Utterly Spectacular!,"I was a fan of the ""V for Vendetta"" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he's always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Closer"". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it's too late.The Wachowski Brothers' former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit ""The Matrix"". Unlike ""The Matrix"", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn't show off, and his trickery isn't self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.With solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another ""Matrix""-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in ""V"" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. ""V for Vendetta"" is a must-see.10/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Remember, remember, V for Vendetta, the writing, character and plot, i know of no reason why this movie should ever be forgot!","First, I have to give credit and praise the team behind this film, for releasing a movie so politicly powerful and sharing a strong message how ""we"", as ""we"" the people living in our country shouldn't be afraid of our governments 4/5 years after 9/11 and during the massive political protests in many countries around the world.It is sad to think that 15 years later in this rough, chaotic 2020, when I saw this movie for the first time, I realized that my countries government isn't far away of being like the government presented as a villain in a fictional, sci-fi, DC made film based on a graphic novel. Hope that in the future things will change for the better, but we should not stand low and keep on fighting.The movies writing and characters have so much emotion, care and love put into them. The plot and the story are powerful, heartwarming yet entertaining. Action is well filmed and exciting. And the acting is just, WoW! Hugo Weaving kills it as V, and Natalie Portman's character Evie's growth through the story from beginning to end was so well done that id had me tearing up!In my opinion, a MUST WATCH!

A Bloody Masterpiece!,"I am speechless. I just came back from the theatre, where I watched 'V for Vendetta'. There are three main elements in the movie and it excels on all three of them.First off the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not patronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at which the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of script from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience that V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled with current events and has a definite strong political sense.Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you from the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible charisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he sounds as good as any of the best actors out there. He should be nominated for an academy award.Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no ""Matrix"" effects used. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'. It's one of the best movies of all time, an eternal classic.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Among the best stuff you'll see from DC Comics.,"DC Comics has a rather poor reputation lately. Despite having some great superheroes, the films based on their characters often have sucked. However, one of the best and most worthwhile films based on their comics is WELL worth seeing...""V for Vendetta"".The story is placed in a dystopian future. According to this future, the United States has been torn apart by civil war and disasters. And, the United Kingdom has gone from a constitutional monarchy to a repressive fascist dictatorship. But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge. To create a climate of fear and chaos, the government has created fake terrorists...and used the deaths of 10s of thousands of Brits as an excuse to control the country with an iron fist.The only hope Britain has is a weird nehilistic superhero, V. V (Hugo Weaving) is determined to bring down the government and give the country back to the people. But how? And what part does Evey (Natalie Portman) play in all this? See the film.This is a very exciting and intelligent film. It definitely kept my interest...much of it because the whole thing (aside from the near indestructable anti-hero) seemed possible! Well worth seeing and exceptionally well made.By the way, if you like this film, try the 1960s Italian film ""Danger: Diabolik"". Both have very, very similar themes and both are wonderful movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An amazing feat of Cinema,"""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. I see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.""I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World Premiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a little weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character ""V"", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie.

Truly Unique,"There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.The acting, the cinematography, the effects, and the general vision of this film all lead me to believe that it will likely receive a cult following. It is only my hope that the message of this film will come to summarize the history of our future ascendancy to true liberty.Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.

This is one of the best films I have ever seen...,"...I am well aware that my summary line invites several retorts, and given the nature of my comment those retorts may very well be resoundingly, unanimously negative. If I say ""This is one of the Best films I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response would be, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy."" Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has been something up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter to leave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity to inspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could never be, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things going in the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film, yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough in this time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endure but seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that do not matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly, the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodical erosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react with complete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from the rest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just like everyone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films like this, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in the world, all we want to do is play our video games, watch reality television, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Things that for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are the distractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of the night what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committed by those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema can dazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one that I will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message finds a wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective, in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film is about...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not to recognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things better than they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but for the viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from this artificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I see there is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can to make it right."" To the makers of this unique and wonderful film, I salute you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ideas Are Bulletproof and One Man Can Make the Difference,"In a near future, a totalitarian state is ruling England. On November, 5th, a man self-calling V (Hugo Weaving) explodes a symbolic monument and starts fighting for freedom using terrorist technique. He also rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from the claws of the abusive secret police and later she becomes her allied. The man in charge of the investigation, Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea), discloses the truth about his leaders while chasing V.""V for Vendetta"" is in my opinion the best action movie of the year. The story, about a totalitarian state that uses fear and terror to win the elections and dominate the population, inclusive forging terrorist attacks, is much updated. There are many excellent lines in this Orwellian story, but I would like to highlight the following ones: ""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""; and ""Ideas are bulletproof"". The awesome Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" fits amazingly perfect to both scenes of explosion. ""V for Vendetta"" is not only a brilliant tale of revenge as the name suggests, but mostly a magnificent message and hymn of freedom. This is a movie that deserves to be watched many times as a lesson of freedom and citizenship.

"Instead of this, try reading Orwell","V for Vendetta was a weak attempt at political commentary and a simplistic illustration of revolution. I couldn't help but laugh at the ending with the fireworks and people. I think I'm going to make a movie that harps on peoples ignorance and emotions. I'm going to fill it with images of death for shock factor, make knives fly in slow motion (instead of bullets like they did in the matrix) because I can't think of anything original, and make my protagonist hero/terrorist speak so ""eloquently"" so that the movie seems smart because no one can understand the alliteration blather coming from behind that mask. The one thing I was impressed by was Hugo Weaving's ability to recite his lines. Natalie Portman was garbage as always. Characters: all 1-dimensional. The action was generic and predictable. When it comes to IMDb ratings, some people jump to say that this is ""the worst movie ever"" and give it one star. That is silly as anyone with a brain can see that there is a tremendous difference between it and ""SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses"" which holds a bottom spot on this site. However, it is not even close to worthy of a top 250 berth. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V for Vacuous,"*** CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS ***Alan Moore's graphic novel V for Vendetta is an elegant, thought-provoking and complex exploration of the meaning of freedom and the politics of protest. The Wachowski Brothers and James McTeigue have somehow reduced this to a film that pretty much says 'Whoa, dude! Terrorists ROCK!!!111!'It's hard to imagine how anyone who is a fan of the book could have produced this film. The novel is clever where the film is dumb, engaging where the film is boring, and subtle where the film simply blows stuff up. Where Moore's V is erudite and sophisticated, the best McTeigue's V can manage is a big speech of words mostly beginning with the letter 'V'.Principally to blame for this must be the screenplay, which is full of unwieldy clunking additions which are supposed to make you think REAL HARD YOU GUYS about how this is LIKE RELLEVUNT to NOW. The screenplay takes a piece which is about Thatcherite Britain and tries to use it to bang home a message about George Bush's USA. So, instead of Moore's extreme conservative regime, we are presented with a 'British' government of the religious right, which seeks to ban homosexuality and Islam in the name of Christianity. Anyone who is actually British will find this confusing and nonsensical, as there is no popular religious right in Britain. And Americanisms like 'lever' (pronounced 'levver' rather than 'leever') and 'elevator' don't help.Still, no one could really have expected the Wachowskis to produce a subtle or clever screenplay. But you might reasonably expect that this would be a super-stylish, high-action thriller. It isn't. The production design is sloppy - we're expected to believe that, thirty or forty years into the future, people are wearing exactly the same clothes and using exactly the same technology as they are now, with the sole exception of a little red bleepy machine which doesn't seem to have a function but might perhaps be a dictaphone. And, as for your high-octane thrills, well... don't get your hopes up. The action moves at around a quarter of the pace of the Matrix, and fight scenes are few and far between. In the climactic fight at the end, wherein V slays a whole troop of men, the film's signature visual effect finally kicks in: and it's... *drumroll*... knives leaving vapour trails. Wooooo. No need to bring a spare pair of pants to the cinema. Bullet time, it ain't.There are many problems with this film: poor editing, appalling performances, the pointless addition of a love story. But the main crime is undoubtedly the sheer stupidity that the Wachowskis have brought to the table. Moore's novel deliberately does not end with firm conclusions, but asks you to consider relative evils: the government is obviously oppressive and fascist, but V is no less totalitarian in his own convictions. When he blows up symbols of democracy and justice like the OId Bailey, murders those who don't agree with him, or tortures Evie to 're-educate her', he becomes more and more like the government he despises.In the film, this duality is forgotten, and V is presented as a straightforward hero. The conclusion, therefore, is that terrorism works, terrorism is good, and the ends always justify the means. The film of V for Vendetta misses the principal point of the novel, and ends up being offensive as well as boring and rubbish. Read the book, please, but don't waste your time watching this. And let's pray they never make Watchmen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very powerful even if it makes Thatcherism look heavenly!,"'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was top-notch and, along with the well-written script and apt soundtrack, gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel-- for better or worse-- for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places, Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey, depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention, as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is, as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich, a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However, above all, it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression, he exudes the pragmatism, charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revenge-driven madness.Entertainment-wise, the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself (it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though) as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Really good... for a dystopian,"I have to admit I'm somewhat baffled as to how this has such incredibly high ratings, but nevertheless I still really enjoyed it. It's just that this isn't anything too special compared to other dystopian future films out there. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the best dystopians I've seen, but that's simply because movies of this genre tend to falter in terms of storytelling anyway. With V for Vendetta (2005), whilst the plot did progress in ways that were not only unpredictable but even emotive, none of it truly wowed me as much as I would've hoped. Having known of just how highly regarded this film was before watching it, I found myself waiting & waiting for something big to occur, something surprising and impactful, as there had been nothing of the sort to warrant such a high rating. And indeed by the end of things, there was nothing of that sort, not for me at least. Hence my slight disappointment overall. Also, aside from the script, I really think this needed a higher budget, as even though this is meant to be set in the future, many scenes (mainly the ones in the alleyways) looked as if this was set about 100 years in the past, so yeah I definitely found the production design a bit bizarre at times.But I am speaking far far too negatively about a picture that I did like to be fair. I'm sure better writers than me could go on and on about how this portrays society and whatnot, but it really does do so well at depicting totalitarianism and autocracy in the modern-day era, and you could even say our real-life government are slowly becoming more and more like the one showcased here. Additionally, both Hugo Weaving (as V) and Natalie Portman (as Evey) are exceptional as the two conspirators aiming to overthrow their tyrannical authority. The former is witty and charming in personality yet determined and passionate when it comes to the ultimate goal, and this attitude rubs off on the latter whose performance gets better and better until the end as a result. And Portman is so incredibly excellent at illustrating Evey's newfound spiritedness that it even rubs off on us, and gets us rallying for a resolution just as much as she now wants one.Altogether, it's honestly brilliant at getting its message across, and although it may not be a masterpiece of filmmaking, it can certainly leave you feeling rather pensive.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Faithful adaptation of the comic book, with some additions just for the movie","I read the entire graphic novel V for Vendetta before tackling the movie. Almost three hours to complete a near 300 pages of one of the highlights of the late 80s focus on the darker side of superhero comic books, especially the anti-hero. A masterwork of both Alan Moore and David Lloyd; credited only to Lloyd stemming from Moore's dissatisfaction for film adaptations of his popular works.The film is extremly loyal to the material with obvious minor changes. Its follows the first half the closest and leaves gaps in the second half being the most noticable (Books 2 and 3 to be exact). Stephen Rea's character the big addition to the film.A slight miscast in Natalie Portman who is quite a bit older than the character in the book, but she nonetheless does a fine job, going as far as shaving her head which did get some attention in the tabloids that year. It doesn't have the look of the time period it portrays. The dystopian future of 1997 in the book looks too modern here. The aforementioned gaps also do change the original finale slightly. Not a big deal.Highlights to me are the flair of the directing by James McTeigue, really nice. And John Hurt himself, never more diabolical, heartless, and just plain evil especially in extremely close up which you get alot of here. His most malicious role yet and a loving tribute to the movie 1984 by having him here.Its definitely worth a look and one of the better comic adaptations out there alongside other films of the time like Road to Perdition and Ghost World.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I guess that showing some concentration camp imagery, an evil Hitler-like character (a grumpy old man version of an Adolf anyway) and rehashing '1984' is enough these days to make something profound.I mean, why else would a movie which has obvious pacing-flaws, a script so full of nonsensical alliteration that it would even make a Vogon gnaw off his own ears, anything but a lavish plot, a pedestrian view on politics and an agonizingly bad performance by one of its leads (Nat Portman (God bless her soul and looks) couldn't act her way out of a high-school drama even if she tried it without a fake foreign accent.) be regarded so highly?Watching this borefest, my eyelids cramped from fighting gravity. I won't get into all the complaints I have with this talky and plodding twaddle, it has all been pointed out by other reviewers in the 'hated-it' section.

As Evey uncovers the truth about V's mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself--and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.This is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the Matrix(James McTeigue) movies really has some talent ,and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation, how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an anti-hero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wrong,he is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.This film focuses on the source material of the book, more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout,never once boring,an apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points, it has a strong script , impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movie,I must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptation,leaving a lot of details behind,whereas the book had a more in depth look at V's life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approach,to which they succeed completely.There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 9/11 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and government,regarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he's insane,but it's just an idea,a notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control us,and inflict fear into our lives.Hidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.V is an idea,a symbol,a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an idea,an icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure ,but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that's what made me respond to this film's ideas.It's full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.A spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Action/thriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis' and Silver.The climax,especially,was uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off ,then this is a blast for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A film that predicted the future!,A film that depicts the mainstream media as another arm of it's tyrannical government which sums up what is happening worldwide in 2020/2021.

An eerily prescient indictment on the trade between safety and freedom.,"It's a little weird watching a dystopian movie like V for Vendetta (2005) in 2020. I watched this film each year around the 5th of November, but life eventually got in the way and made it difficult to continue the tradition. At the time, I enjoyed the ""underdog"" of V (Hugo Weaving) protecting art and freedom of thought from the tyranny of an oppressive government. Having gone back and re-watched it in the current global climate, I'm honestly shocked at how prescient it was in predicting a lot of our future. Hopefully, things don't become worse to the point of completely fulfilling this prophecy.I think part of the reason this film remains timeless-other than the flawless performances of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving-is how it shows the amount of freedom people in society give up in the name of ""safety."" Fear-mongering is a common political tactic to get individuals to vote for a particular party. All we have to do to be ""protected"" is to allow those in power to do what's in ""our best interests."" Except, rarely are the actions of leaders in the best interest of their constituents. After all, absolute power corrupts absolutely.Fortunately, V for Vendetta provides a glimmer of explosive hope. Where tyranny is exposed, the one force that can stand up to it is the Populus's combined force. No political system is perfect, but the will of the people-if unified-can overcome great oppression. People die; ideas live forever. Now, whether or not our current global situation can garner enough unity to shatter this broken system without resorting to V's explosive measures is an exercise left up to the reader.An eerily prescient indictment on the trade between safety and freedom, I give V for Vendetta 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
From Bangladesh- Year 2024,"I watched the movie when it came out. Now after all these years in 2024, watching the same revolution happening in my country Bangladesh.

Thousands have been killed in my country including choldren, mostly students and common people. The students lead the revolution, went through torture and pain, but never gave up.

"""Beneath this mask there is an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.""","In 1982 acclaimed writer Alan Moore published his comic book ""V for Vendetta"". 23 years later this film adaptation, going by the same name, was released. In short V for Vendetta is an Orwellian dystopia that culminates in a now ever more important satire of the dangers a lack of democracy can bring forth.On a personal level this film haunts me a little... On one hand it does so many things so well, but on the other, there are more than a few issues I have to take into consideration.The biggest of the issues unfortunately is the protagonist Evie. Without spoiling anything I can say that she basically boils down to your typical vessel into the film's universe. Her personality frankly isn't strong enough especially when compared to a certain other character this movie contains. Furthermore there are some at times rather goofy action sequences that do pull me out of the film a little. In connection to these scenes, but also just in general, there are some odd editing choices as well as some overblown sound effects.Getting that off my chest though I can finally talk about the substantially bigger amount of things this film does very well. One thing that shines as bright as the sun when it comes to this here picture, is the central character V. Zed character is a sort of terrorist leader played eccentrically by Hugo Weaving. V not only gives the film something of a backbone in the first place, but also makes the viewing experience a hundred times more enjoyable than it would be without his unforgettable inclusion.Speaking of V his mask is one of the most iconic in film history and as such leads us to the movie's remarkable set and costume design. The bleak version of London we see in this film (which undoubtedly is inspired by a certain German movement) sets the perfect scenery for a story such as this.Now the story being told here is also obviously phenomenal which in my opinion is the most important factor to be considered about a film in the first place. Then there is the villain played by John Hurt who acts as striking critique on dictators overall, and so on, so forth.There is truly so much to love about this film and while there are also unfortunately some quite noticable issues that redact a little from the experience, this is still at the end of the day a wonderful and genuinely important satiric sci-fi/action film.Rating: 7+/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Alan Moore was right to remove his name from this film.,"When I first heard that Alan Moore's V FOR VENDETTA was being adapted for the screen, I enjoyed a brief frisson... but this quickly turned to a cynical wait-and-see attitude after I read that Moore himself was asking to have his name removed from the project. Alan Moore is known to be rather rigid in his scruples, but there are those who feel that his rigidity is overblown, and that the man is some kind of bitchy primadonna.Count me in, Alan. This film is a piece of garbage.Sure, it *looks* good. The cinematography, costuming, makeup, sets, and all around technical merit can't be faulted much, although the film does suffer slightly from touches of a misguided Matrix-like darkness. Many of the shots in the film are startlingly like panels from Moore's original graphic novel... but looks are not everything, and sometimes they're not anything at all. Moore's V FOR VENDETTA is a piece of work with a serious, vibrant, important, and challenging message, not a wretched excuse for the usual Hollywood explosion porn that one might find in any Bruce Willis action abortion. Director James McTeigue and screenplay writers Andy and Larry Wachowski should be ashamed of the gutting they've given Moore's work. They have hijacked a truly inspiring piece of truly subversive art and cranked out a hollow, incoherent, castrated, de-fanged and de-clawed mockery of it. Their adaptation is a dark triumph of idiot form over intellectual substance, an arrogant slap in the face laden with product placement to add insult to the injury. This is carefully preripped punk rock fashion being sold in Macy's. It's Pat Boone singing a Little Richard song. This film is Velveeta being advertised as top-shelf Camembert.I just don't know where to start digging into the fetid, cannibalistic co-opting that I see here. The only value this film has is as a touchstone for those of us who have read the graphic novel, and then only if we can overlook the utter debasement that has been perpetrated by McTeigue and the Wachowskis. Perhaps if we turned the sound off while watching.Before seeing the film, I figured that no matter how badly they botched and bungled it, no matter how cynically they sold it out, it would still be a worthwhile thing if only V's televised speech was preserved intact. And of course, they gutted and polluted that too.It could be argued that the politics of the film are nicely pointed, and pointed in the right direction: straight at the whorish corporate hearts of Bush's America and Tony Blair's England. The problem is that that point is (like the rest of the film's plot) muddied and blunted by an incoherence that makes one wonder how much of their zillion-dollar budget went up the noses of Mssrs. McTeigue and Wachowski in the form of entertaining white powdery substances. This is aside from the fact that Moore's V FOR VENDETTA was clearly, overtly, and unapologetically a manifesto of Anarchism as a polar opposite of Nationalism-cum-Fascism, while the McTeigue/Wachowski version is a thin, watered-down gruel that has rejected Anarchism as too radical, too controversial, and tossed it unceremoniously into the lime-pit in favor of an inchoate tissue of vague and fuzzy Democracy Lite... in fact, it turns our hero to the cause of exactly the sort of poorly defined emotional-response pseudo-Democracy that has been rammed down our throats by crypto-Nationalist neocon flag wavers like Bush and Blair for most of the last decade. The only relief here is that they didn't shove any pious Christian dialogue into V's mouth... I guess they felt vindicated in totally blowing off the original political message by keeping the story superficially hostile to the Christian Right (John Hurt as the leader of Britain's Fascist/Nationalist government is still clearly a jerk who doesn't believe in the separation of Church and State, the kind of pig who is busily ruining America by insisting on the legislation of Christian morality in all contradiction of the concepts of religious freedom and ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"").Vendetta against those who would co-opt our nobler impulses and our rebellion in the name of corporate profits! And while we're at it, all hail Alan Moore... not so much for creating V FOR VENDETTA in the first place, but more for refusing to allow his ideals to be compromised by mere money, and for having the stones to disassociate himself utterly with this bowdlerized, bastardized, perverted, and ultimately worthless adaptation instead of taking the money and spreading his artistic legs like every whore in Hollywood who drops trou and bends over for big money business transactions. Woe unto those who actually paid to see it, and had no chance to make a similarly informed decision; for them (in an intellectual and political sense) this film is nothing more than a brutal symbolic gang-rape at the hands of counter-revolutionary corporate goons.If you ever needed a justification for using BitTorrent to preview a film before coughing up your hard-earned money, this is it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The greatest film of the 2000s,"Hugo Weaving delivers his finest appearance in a linguistic and philosophical masterpiece.

We have a masked anarchist voiced by Hugo Weaving exacting revenge on John Hurt's High Chancellor whilst trying to save Natalie Portman from the secret police. She later becomes an ally.V for Vendetta deals with issues relating to a repressive state. Totalitarianism, homophobia, Islamophobia and terrorism. The film with its controversial themes has attracted both criticism and praise, although author of the graphic novel Alan Moore is unhappy with the adaptation.The acting from the cast is excellent.

One of Those Rare Films to Really Earn a 10,"In the future, England is controlled by a fascist, 1984-esque government. One man, who calls himself V, has taken on the guise of Guy Fawkes and has made it his personal mission to destroy Parliament and get England to rise up. He befriends Evey (Natalie Portman), who sometimes sees his side and sometimes doesn't.I've given out a handful of 10s. I think out of the nearly 500 reviews I've done, I've given out maybe 7 or 8 of them. I'm not quick to throw a 10 on something because of some whim, you really have to earn it. This film earns it in spades.Natalie Portman is the perfect actress: obviously beautiful, but also a real actress. Some of the other casting considerations (such as Scarlett Johannsen) I just don't have as much confidence in. And Hugo Weaving, although never seen on the screen (at least not his face), made a great V. It makes me sad that Alan Moore decided to preemptively disown this film, because unlike ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"", this is a winner. (And I liked ""From Hell"", even if Moore didn't.) I'm a little partial to this film. I love the musical themes, the alliteration. I love the anti-government, pro-populace message. I do own the graphic novel. But underneath all that, this film offers it all.There's romance (and I mean actual romance, not just people screwing around on a gaming table). There's action, fighting and explosions. There's intense drama (I cried a few times, especially during the prison sequences). I suppose the humor might be lacking, but I hadn't really noticed because everything else is done in just the right amounts.If you like Portman, like good dramas and action films, and are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (there are some things that might be just a small stretch of impossibility) this is a must-see. Already firmly planted on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250, I have no doubt it will stay there for a great many years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"a Story of suppression, dictatorship and rebellion","What is freedom? What is vengeance? Who would resemble a nation's long-suppressed anger and hatred of their government?!'V for Vendetta' tells the story of a fictional England which had been suppressed by its newly formed government after a long dark era of disease and war with the USA. The story is the resemblance of many countries under dictatorship and suppression which we have seen throughout history, and definitely will see again. Dictators ruling by suppressing free media, omitting the opposite voices, curfews, killings, and tortures are not unfamiliar to us nor will be. From the darkest corners of this England rises a light, a vigilante names himself V. Someone for me was very much like assassins in the assassin's creed series in the video game world. The story is great, thrilling, mysterious, and also dark and violent at the same time. The script, however a little different from the comics is unbelievably perfect. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are the shining stars of the cast. Other actors were really good too in their roles.The soundtracks are really good and were composed beautifully in harmony with the scenes.

O is for Oklahoma,"V for Vendetta: 6 out of 10: Ah the law of unintended consequences. You seek to adapt a 1982 graphic novel about Thatcherism and convert it to a too clever by half attack on the Bush administration and the war on Terror and you end up with a love sonnet to Timothy McVeigh. Uh-oh.V is Timothy McVeigh from the fertilizer bombs to the horrible Waco style fire flashbacks it is of all people McVeigh behind that mask. (In reality Guy Fawkes and McVeigh shared a similar philosophy. The only difference being Fawkes is famous for failing.) Now obviously the filmmakers were to busy ripping off 1984 and Phantom of the Opera to notice this. The film itself is actually quite entertaining in a mindless sort of way. The script is full of self-referential pseudo intellectual quotes and all the cute little British people say things like bullocks. (I have never actually heard an Englishman say bullocks anywhere besides an album cover. It's interesting to note that the British press hated this film with a passion unmatched by any in recent history. I guess they aren't as pro bombing of Government buildings as Americans are.)The films bad guys are all evil mustache twitching, child raping psychopaths while the good guys are all innocent liberals. The idea mind you that the people will automatically rise up and support the bomber against the big bad government is a fantasy right up with we will be greeted as liberators and Jodie Foster will love me if I shoot the President. Needless to say nuance doesn't enter into the picture.Which is a shame because the movie had a good chance to really make a statement had it been willing to go off the rails a little bit (pun intended) and put some shading on these characters.

"Not a film, a political propaganda piece","Although it fails as a film in multiple ways (e.g. boredom, repetitions, predictability, ..)

"Visually impressive, but surprisingly shallow","An alternate futuristic vision of England has the country being run by a ruthless totalitarian government who will stop at nothing to remain to in power. People live in fear and are remarkably passive as a result, save for one masked freedom fighter known as V who fights with cunning and cleverness to rally the people of England to end the dictatorship.Visually this film is quite a stunner. No excessive computer effects, but nonetheless the sets and cinematography are first rate and do a great job and creating a dark world. Also there are many visual symbols as well as creative uses of words that start with 'V.' Added on top of solid acting and direction. For such a faceless performance, Hugo Weaving (who's behind a mask the whole time) plays very well at conveying the character V. However that's the movie version of V, the one in the source graphic novel is quite different.The problem is the film's message and it is ridiculously shallow - ""facism is bad."" That is really it. For a such a lengthy and well produced film it is a real shame, though not much a surprise, that the attention was on the visual, but the metaphorical and philosophical are hardly attended to. There is a lot of dialog and room for for what could have been interesting thoughts of characters reflecting on their world, but it ends up being just routine. For instance when Finch is discussing with his partner the possibility of a government conspiracy they do nothing, but state the obvious - is it worth going against such a powerful government, are we afraid to, and so on. Nothing really that hasn't been done before in countless other stories.Added to the fact that the film ends in an amazingly dull and ridiculously cliché big explosion. It makes sense as you watch the film, but that doesn't mean that it is interesting. How much more interesting would it be when the shadowy freedom fighter V would think of a way to topple the government by not using methods that it uses against it's own people? The film just ends up being almost a more mature version of the Star Wars story - eventually the good triumphs over the evil with a big bang. Star Wars had the Death Star and here we have several buildings in London. So it is good, but retreading on old ground with nothing new to present has never scored a film big points. 7/10Rated R for violence",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Yes, I understand that this movie used a graphic novel as a source material; this is why most comic book movies have less entertainment value than Laffy Taffy wrapper jokes.The visuals and performances were top-notch, but the message delivered inside of the story was pure rubbish. It was the ""slippery slope"" rhetorical device typically used so nauseatingly by social conservatives (The whole world's gone to hell since (pick one) long hair on boys/the slam dunk/the birth control pill/rock and roll) - only this time, the slippery slope falls to the far right: If you're against gay marriage, it leads to the internment of gays. Opposition to radical Islam leads to the criminalization of the practice of Islam. Opposition to illegal immigrants leads to the deportation of all immigrants. There was also fodder for conspiracy buffs: the government knows and sees every last thing. And the government is waaaaaaaaay bad. I mean seriously - like, EVIL. There was even a Rush Limbaugh sighting, complete with prescription drug addiction!It's obvious that this movie is anti-conservative, which I don't mind at all. We need honest disagreement (which we do have in this country) as long as we are willing to work together (which we have not had in this country since the 1810's). However, I really hate to see sophomoric distortions like these presented as some sort of provocative satire. It's not.

"Remember remember, V for Vendetta...","This film is so much more than a comic book film related to Guy Fawkes. Its intricacies regarding politics, morality, sense of self and what it wholly represents; liberation.V for Vendetta shares a relationship with anarchy, shown through V's belief in the absence of government. The film depicts a corrupt and totalitarian government in which V aims to destroy.The symbolism behind the mask is one of utmost genius! V strives for anarchy and freedom and therefore a disbelief in hierarchy. The mask is a perfect representation of this as it implies unity. As the identity of V is never revealed, we understand that the identity is not of importance, the sole importance is the message behind the mask - and the message the mask seeks to tell...
We are also invited to observe Evey and V's ever-blossoming relationship, with V's eventual admission of his love for her. It seems strange to fall in love with an onscreen couple where one partner remains masked and unknown, but the way their relationship is built upon yearns for me to have a complete adoration for their deeply personable and honest chemistry.It matters not what is behind the mask, V's identity lies within his actions.Every year I watch this film and every year I love it a little more.Remember remember V for Vendetta...""Evey, please. There is a face beneath this mask but it's not me. I'm no more that face than I am the muscles beneath it or the bones beneath them."" - V""He was Edmond Dantés... and he was my father.

"""A Timeless Anthem of Resistance""","In a world where fear and oppression reign supreme, ""V for Vendetta"" emerges as a powerful catalyst for rebellion and a stirring examination of modern society. Directed by James McTeigue, this cinematic adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel is a brilliant blend of political commentary, artistic vision, and emotional depth, proving itself to be a timeless classic that resonates with audiences even today.At the center of this dystopian narrative is V, portrayed magnificently by Hugo Weaving, whose iconic Guy Fawkes mask has become synonymous with rebellion and resistance. Weaving's performance is a tour de force of charisma and intensity, conveying a profound sense of injustice and longing for freedom that captivates from the very first moment he appears on screen. His eloquent monologues and unwavering determination to dismantle a totalitarian regime evoke both admiration and empathy, making V one of cinema's most compelling anti-heroes.Natalie Portman, in a standout performance as Evey Hammond, provides the emotional touchstone of the story. Her character's journey from fear and submission to empowerment and defiance is beautifully executed, allowing viewers to witness the transformative power of courage and hope. The chemistry between V and Evey is electric, highlighting the impact of resistance in both personal and political spheres.The film's aesthetic is nothing short of stunning; the combination of striking visuals, evocative cinematography, and a haunting score by Dario Marianelli creates an immersive experience that draws viewers into its grim yet captivating world. McTeigue masterfully balances action with thoughtful dialogue, presenting a narrative that compels the audience to question authority and consider the price of freedom.One of the film's most compelling themes is the exploration of identity and the masks we wear-both literally and metaphorically. The famous line, ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people,"" serves as a rallying cry for all who yearn for change amidst oppression. The narrative encourages viewers to reflect on the implications of complacency and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs.""V for Vendetta"" transcends its genre, elevating itself into a lexicon of revolutionary cinema. It is a powerful reminder that the fight against tyranny is both timeless and universal, urging us not to forget the lessons of history or the importance of individual freedom. The film challenges audiences to embrace their inner vigilante, igniting a spark of resistance that resonates strongly in today's sociopolitical climate.In a world that often feels devoid of hope, ""V for Vendetta"" is a resounding proclamation that change is possible. With its unforgettable characters, profound themes, and striking visuals, this film has etched itself into the annals of cinematic history. It is not only a call to action but an enduring testament to the resilience of the human spirit. As the credits roll, one can't help but feel inspired to take up the mantle of resistance, echoing V's unforgettable concluding words: ""Remember, remember the fifth of November.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Prescient, entertaining, thought provoking, classic Wachowski brothers (as they still were at the time of filming;)","The film is prescient given the current state of surveillance, the ever increasing police state, and the manipulation of authority in the UK in 2021.We will say nothing of false flag operations and ""gain of function"" virus manipulation because that would be inappropriate, controversial and speculative, but the parallel and parable is plain as day. The story is by definition dramatic and extreme, yet Orwell, amongst so many other free thinkers and visionaries throughout history would agree with the underlying premise. Fear and manipulation/narrowing of consciousness is of course what any authoritarian power is derived out of.Unfortunately this is not one of Natalie Portman's best roles, considering some of her superlative latter work, her character is stilted, wooden timing throughout.

"Intelligent film with political criticism , thrills  , action and suspense","The movie tells how a strange freedom fighter named V (Hugo Weaving) in a ¨Guy Fawkes¨ mask -who was a historic terrorist who tried to blow up the British Parliament- wants actually emulate him . As ¨V¨ utilizes terrorist action against London landmarks but his objective results to be the fighting against the fascist state ruling over Great Britain and governed by a dictator , chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) . The authoritarian tyranny rules over citizens with oppression and violence and ¨V¨ is urging the London citizens to rise up and overthrow the government . Meantime , he saves a beautiful girl named Avey (Natalie Portman) from the violent deputies . She decides becoming his ally and confront the atrocities of the nasty chancellor and his underlings (Tim Piggoth Smith) . Meanwhile , a detective (Stephen Rea) and his helper (Robert Graves) are investigating the terrorist events .This is a thoughtful and broody story containing a clever political criticism and is based on a graphic novel by Allan Moore . The film gets diverse influences , as the myth of ¨the beauty and the beast¨ ,¨The phantom of Opera¨, the anti-Utopian literature of ¨1984 ¨ by George Orwell and , of course , ¨The Count of Montecristo¨, but we are seeing images from the classic film and ¨V¨ acts like Edmond Dantes . In fact , the screenplay of the film is remotely similar to that of the Alexandre Dumas novel 'The Count of Monte Cristo' as both stories revolve around characters who escape from imprisonment and proceed in seeking revenge on all of those responsible for their incarceration . The original comic series was originally created by Alan Moore . However, following his negative experience with ¨From Hell¨ (2001) and The league of the extraordinary men¨ (2003) , Moore decided to reject all money and credit from Hollywood on any adaptations of his work . Thus , he gave all the money he would've gotten to the artist who drew the character with him, and rejected his own ""created by"" credit from the film . The movie has a stagy and carnival stylish but with a breathtaking production design by Owen Patterson . Colorful cinematography by Adrian Biddle , he died during the filming and is dedicated to him . The motion picture was well directed by James McTeigue . James , previously , was assistant direction of Wachowski brothers (Larry and Andy) , film producers in high budget along with another great producer , Joel Silver .

"""Fear became the ultimate tool of this government""","V for Vendetta is a wonderful dystopian film. The film makes it's own world, and thus it's own identity. V's opening speech is nothing short of a masterpiece. The majority of his words begin with the letter V, and it's such good fun pausing the film ever second, and looking it up in the dictionary. It's such a shame that he didn't speak in this way for the rest of the film. The action sequences are decent, the tension builds up really well, the reveal of V's identity is really well written, and just generally it's a solid film.However, the film wasted too much time with Natalie Portman and V's relationship. Out of all the aspects of the film they could have focused on, this was the least entertaining. It could be argued however, that this focus was due to the idea that their love was interesting, as Natalie Portman didn't need to know V's identity to love him, and instead she was in love with his world view.All in all, V for Vendetta is a very good film.

I was expecting something a lot better,"Having read some glowing reviews beforehand, I was really looking forward to seeing 'V for Vendetta' for the first time.

Maybe the reviews gave me false expectations, but the film just didn't come close to being the 'masterpiece' that many reviewers before me have called it. Aside from an intriguing main character and some great visuals, it left me cold.From the get-go, the film is more interested in showcasing a bunch of knife fights, explosions and firework displays (timed to music, of course) than telling any sort of story. As a result, the film becomes repetitive and tiresome very fast.

It passes itself off as progressive by spending most of its runtime attacking right-wingers, in spite of the fact that it seems to be advocating libertarianism.

A masterpiece,"V for Vendetta (2005), a cinematic revolution that captivated my heart and mind with its bold storytelling and powerful performances. Hugo Weaving's enigmatic portrayal of V, masked and mesmerizing, is nothing short of iconic. The film editing weaves a tapestry of political intrigue and explosive action, creating a narrative that is as intellectually stimulating as it is viscerally satisfying. The strength of V for Vendetta lies in its timely and thought-provoking message, a rallying cry for resistance against oppression and the power of ideas. The music, especially the use of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, adds a symphonic layer to the revolutionary spirit. While some may find the narrative pacing a bit brisk, the relentless energy serves the film's purpose. Cinematography paints a dystopian landscape with a chiaroscuro elegance, capturing the essence of a world on the brink of change. At 8/10, V for Vendetta is a cinematic manifesto that not only entertains but inspires, leaving me in awe of its ability to ignite a fire for justice and freedom.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Remember, Remember, the 5th of November","Directed by James McTeigue, this film is a rollercoaster of political intrigue, masked rebellion, and a vigilante out to bring down a tyrannical government in a future Britain that's not exactly winning any ""Best Place to Live"" awards.Set in a dystopian future, the story follows V, a masked vigilante with a knack for poetic dialogue and some serious acrobatic skills. Think Batman with a vendetta, and you're in the right ballpark. Hugo Weaving, despite hiding behind that iconic mask the whole time, delivers a performance that's both chilling and strangely charismatic.Natalie Portman plays Evey, the unsuspecting citizen swept up in V's chaotic plan to bring down a totalitarian government. Her character goes through some serious transformations from damsel in distress to a rebellious force, and Portman brings that mix of vulnerability and strength that keeps you cheering for her like you would for your friend who finally stands up to a bully.The film's visuals are a mix of gritty and stylized. From the iconic mask to the shadowy alleyways of a dystopian London, it's got this edgy aesthetic that's part comic book, part revolutionary propaganda poster. The action scenes are like a dance of destruction, and the iconic imagery of V standing tall amidst chaos is just as powerful as your favorite meme.V for Vendetta is a darkly thrilling and politically charged ride through a dystopian world. It's got twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat, and just when you think you've got it figured out, BAM! Another layer gets peeled back, like an onion you didn't know you were cutting. It's like a wake-up call wrapped in a superhero cape, and you'll be pondering the power of ideas and the consequences of living in a world that's both chaotic and controlled. It's a not-so-subtle critique of authoritarian regimes, surveillance states, and the power of symbols in inspiring rebellion. The parallels to real-world politics might hit you like a punchline, but it's all part of the ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Socio-political allegory?,"What a frustrating experience this was.A pseudo-historical philosophical hotchpotch slowly unfolding into a film with an alarmingly nihilistic resolution, that completely undermines the film's initial outlook. Some images are pleasing to look at, but the film's philosophy is incredibly pretentious, with some gratuitous references to Shakespeare and Goethe's Faust along the way, that have no bearing to the story at all. The main character is V, for which Hugo Weaving provided the voice, who looks like a 21th century reincarnation of The Count of Monte Christo. He is constantly - when not wreaking havoc on other people - proclaiming various philosophical cliché's, supposedly referring to totalitarianism or tyranny. Very annoying and they might as well have used a computer for his voice since his lips aren't moving.The film is totally deprived of humor or even the slightest wit or irony, as one can expect from the Wachowsky brothers. For me, this overbearing seriousness is killing. Do these guys ever laugh?V (for Vendetta) has rather dubious and elitist views on how to ""liberate"" the commoners from tyranny, let alone in his relations with Evey. He even tortures her in a specially built cell to force his viewpoint upon her. I thought our hero was supposed to fight these practices. He's worse than the system he's fighting against. I'd rather live under the reign of chancellor Hurt than under V's, with all his bombast and self-righteous flowery speeches about the world we live in.Hardly a thoughtful film. Makes you wonder what audience the makers had in mind. As an action flick is disappointing, as drama it's hopeless. The performances don't really matter for the total lack of material to work with here, but even in this department it fails. Nathalie Portman cultivates a strange BBC-broadcasting accent and gives another bad performance. Stephen Rhea does his mumbling police inspector thing again (how often has he played these kind of roles?). He's not bad, but why is a simple police inspector put in charge of stopping a threat that could put the whole world order upside-down? What kind of character is this anyway? Stephen Fry as a TV-presenter is the only one to breath some live into his character.As a political allegory, it's nothing more than postcard philosophy, completely trivial. Perhaps the Wachowsky brothers should stick to making action flicks like THE MATRIX wherein their wretched views of reality and fiction belong.

Bland and empty political commentary with some cool explosions.,"Another movie based on Alan Moore's work, another failure in every way. Written by the geeks who created (and destroyed) the matrix franchise V tries so hard to be two things at the same time: an action movie and a socio-political commentary of sorts. It mostly fails at both, but specially at the second area.The premise of a single man taking over an entire government is not an easy premise to develop in a believable and convincing way. In the case of V we have a character that want's to revolt the masses to turn against the authorities. The problem with this script is that it never makes up it's mind on how it wants to present ""V"", he's a terrorist, but he's looking for revenge, he's a loony but he's sophisticated. At the end he's really just the charismatic Shepperd leading the flock. He's just another authority figure trading places with the other authority figures. He just happens to wear a very cool mask, and a suit full of knifes.The movie also has no idea what to do with all it's political commentary, how to aim it properly, how to give it any weight whatsoever. England is controlled by a cartoonish religious/fascist state, complete with an evil big brother guy in a big TV always throwing orders at his inept employees. Went it comes to dealing with V this forces of the law seem to be unable of doing even the most simple and logic task. How can a man that is searched by the entire state can ship a bunch of masks to thousands of people across the country? Using every-day shipping service?Once more, is not that the premise can't give us a good story, and good characters, is just that the wachachoskis have not even the slightest idea of how to handle the material. Other phony ""evil"" characters appear here and there, and at the end the entire logic of the movie is nothing more than a black and white picture where V is the good guy and the state is bad and that's it, there's your entire plot development right there. There's a very solid supporting cast doing what they can with the material. Sthepen Rea cringes at every line he spokes, Hugo Weaving at least has the mask to cover himself from the embarrassment. John Hurt hams it up, Stephen Fry brings some charm. Natalie Portman on the other hand gives yet another high-school-musical level of performance. This woman has nothing to do in front of a camera.Sure, watching stuff blow up with the 1812 overture is cool to watch, but when there's nothing to back up all those images then there's a big problem with the material.

If anything, it's more relevant than ever, given the anti-totalitarian theme. There are so many lines I could quote, but I'll limit myself to one:""Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creedy. And ideas are bulletproof.""The power of ideas and their relationship to freedom and liberty are central to the film. SO central, in fact, that the face of ""V"" is never shown (except for the odd back-lit glimpse), as that would distract from the message.I could write more, but seriously, you're better off watching the film.

Amazing relevance of this film,"V for Vendetta, directed by the Wachowskis, is a thought-provoking, visually stunning, and deeply unsettling dystopian thriller. Released in 2005, this adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel is a powerful commentary on government control, rebellion, and individual freedom. The film masterfully weaves together elements of science fiction, political thriller, and social commentary, creating a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.At its core, V for Vendetta is a story about resistance and revolution. In a future England, the totalitarian government, led by the tyrannical Chancellor Adam Sutler, exercises total control over its citizens. The narrative follows V, an anarchist revolutionary, played by Hugo Weaving, who seeks to dismantle the oppressive regime. Weaving's performance is nothing short of phenomenal, bringing depth and nuance to the enigmatic V. His voice, presence, and emotional depth make the character both captivating and complex.The film's futuristic London setting is hauntingly beautiful, with a blend of industrial and Gothic architecture that creates a sense of unease. The attention to detail in set design, costumes, and production is unparalleled, transporting viewers to a dystopian world that feels eerily familiar. The cinematography, handled by Stephen Windon, is equally impressive, capturing the gritty realism of a society on the brink of collapse.One of the standout aspects of V for Vendetta is its thought-provoking themes. The film explores complex ideas, including government control and surveillance, rebellion and resistance, identity and individuality, morality and sacrifice, and the power of art and symbolism. These themes are woven throughout the narrative, making the film a rich and rewarding experience for viewers.Natalie Portman shines in her supporting role as Evey Hammond, a young woman who becomes embroiled in V's revolution. Her character's transformation from subservience to empowerment is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. The chemistry between Portman and Weaving is undeniable, adding depth to their complex relationship.The Wachowskis' direction is masterful, balancing action, suspense, and emotion with ease. Their vision for this dystopian world is both terrifying and beautiful, making the film's themes and messages all the more impactful. Dario Marianelli's haunting score perfectly complements the on-screen action, adding to the overall sense of unease.V for Vendetta has had a lasting impact on popular culture, influencing numerous films, TV shows, and books. Its influence can be seen in works such as The Hunger Games, Divergent, and Stranger Things. The film's themes and messages remain eerily relevant today, making it a timely and important watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Heroes come in many forms.,"Hugo Weaving stars as anti-hero protagonist V, a masked man destined to bring down a corrupt government.'V for Vendetta' is a fictionalized story of Guy Fawkes, who was involved in a failed attempt to blow up the House of Lords in 1605. 'V for Vendetta' is set in modern times. The film starts with Evey (Natalie Portman) walking home at night after curfew, when she is approached by a bunch of unsavoury characters. V comes to her rescue and then invites her to ""an orchestra"". He arranged for fireworks and orchestral music to coincide with the demolishment of an old building.Having been spot on CCTV cameras, the police is now after Evey. Now, V helps her - in the most unconventional way - and she helps him in return, but little does she realize his motive is vengeance.I enjoyed the mystery as to V's identity and the fact we never got to see him without his mask, and I enjoyed the investigative element, as well. The film has a good production design and V's home is absolutely stunning.

Ironic since that is why he is taking vengeance in the first place. He is in no way forgiving, like the government that he seeks to destroy. He is an extremist, like the government he seeks to destroy. Wars are always fort between 2 or more extremist.I would have like to have seen more focus on the ideas of racism and religious intolerance as these issues have been at the root of immeasurable violence, suffering and death throughout the ages up until recent times. Even today we have Donald Trump, potential leader of the most powerful nation on the planet declaring that he will ""Ban all Muslims from entering the country"", a scary and relevant real life occurrence of the totalitarian government portrayed in this movie.Also the phrase that he quotes ""By the power of truth, I, while living,have conquered the universe"" that he attributes to Fuast is wrong, a lie if you like.

Don't waste your time -- or your $$$!!,"If you enjoyed Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel from 1988 -- as I did -- do yourself a favor and avoid this pale rendition. Alan Moore has disassociated himself from this film, and with good reason. A few of the character names are the same, and a couple of sequences bear a slight resemblance -- but that's it. The fire, the passion, the heart and soul that so infused the novel is completely absent. The screen story was already written, and the filmmakers ignored it, rewriting whole scenes, cutting out others, eliminating a good 75% of the story's power, meaning and resonance. The characters are shallow, empty husks of their original selves, and the pacing is abominable. Nowhere in this superficial yawnfest is the true understanding of revolution made manifest. Nowhere is the audience truly brought in to and made a part of V's tormented motivations or Evey's harrowing journey. That would require some creative camera lingering, and sets that didn't look like sound stages. If this had been made 15 years ago -- as a mini-series -- perhaps some of the gritty integrity and enduring strength of the human spirit might have been retained.Shame that it ended up in the hands of overpaid incompetents.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
five'll get you ten,"When ""V for Vendetta"" came out, maybe reviews called it the first pro-terrorist movie of the post-9/11 world. And seeing what kind of society the movie portrays, it's hard not to sympathize with the terrorist (or is he a freedom fighter?).The movie portrays an arch-totalitarian England sometime in the future. Because of the wars waged by the United States, the whole world exploded into war, the US got reduced to a third world country, and the fascistic Adam Sutler (John Hurt) seized power in England. Imposing devout Christianity on everyone, he rules with the slogan ""England prevails!"".However, Sutler's days just might be numbered. A masked man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) seeks to overthrow this dictator on November 5, to commemorate Guy Fawkes trying to blow up parliament. V had gotten disfigured some years earlier from an explosion in a chemical plant where he was a test subject, and thus wears this mask.One night, V rescues young Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from Sutler's thugs, and slowly but surely draws her into his world of rebellion. As it is, Evey has a reason to go along with V: her parents were political activists murdered by Sutler's forces. So what will this all come down to? I must say that this movie really draws you in. While uneasy about supporting terrorist activity, one realizes that there's no alternative. Naturally, that brings up the issue of the current state of the world. Is Sutler Bush, we may ask. (No, Sutler actually has a brain.) I think that my favorite line in the movie is ""We report the news, not fabricate it. That's the government's job.""

"Ahead of its time, but set in the wrong country IMHO","The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in ""1984"" playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in ""The Crying Game"" playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood in the 21st century.The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read ""While Europe Slept"" I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.Instead, this film looks more and more like a futuristic vision of the U.S., and not even that futuristic. I can easily see a theocratic fascist regime set up in the United States, citizens hassled endlessly by security forces over minor infractions of countless rules, and Americans just sitting back and taking it. Europeans would be more likely to protest under these circumstances than Americans, in particular if you could convince large numbers of them that it was ""God's will"" or it was for the sake of ""national security"".

"""1984"" gone mainstream","While watching V for Vendetta recently, I couldn't help getting a distinct feeling I'd seen something very similar before. And I had, it was a few months earlier and it was called 1984.1984 isn't as easy to grasp as V for Vendetta. You need to go into the plot to understand what's going on. V for Vendetta makes that a whole lot easier by adding a villain which anyone can get to know and a main character who goes from being conformist to oppositional through the course of the film. In addition there is an ultimate goal instead of the entire film just being a description of life in an completely authoritarian state.This is all very nice, unfortunately V for Vendetta fails to impress.The symbolism of November 5th is at times taken too far. Despite the entire plot being built around Guy Fawkes and the blowing up of the parliament, the reasons behind it are too weak to make an entire film out of it. Having said that, I'm sure films have been built on less. Furthermore, the idea of a villain who's there to save the world, or in this case, Britain, has been severely worn out by now.

If you haven't watched the movie yet, you might not understand what I've written, but you will after you watch it!I even wanted to rate this movie higher, but there is one part in the movie, that I didn't like at all and it just didn't feel right (I can't go further into that, without spoiling, I'm just going to say that, this happens, before one of our main characters ""changes"" her hair style), but being as it is, if you like the sort of films I described above, go watch this one too!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It's Time To Make A Stand,"This is the absolute ""GOD"" of anarchy movies. This movie is intelligent, sleek, new and creative and totally violent, it can appeal to everyone (unless your in love with Hitler or even the government now). It takes place in the mid to late 00's, the only notification on time is a paper that is written awhile ago when the government started taking over which is dated at 2015 (although the original comic took place during 1997-98). This new version of the Nazi's even have there own symbol but unlike the swastika this new symbol isn't a Hindu good luck charm it's more of a cross with an extra horizontal line. V for Vendetta is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd with the same name. The story revolves over the next rain of a fascist government, though Jews are never mentioned, they pick on Muslims and homosexuals mostly. The government is in complete control and makes sure the people keep thinking that they need them.Code name ""V"" is the main character and as you may have guessed he has set out a Vendetta on the people that have ruined his life and the government who is ruining other people's life's. He's a sword wielding terrorist (a terrorist that you root for!) who dresses like Guy Fawks and quotes Shakespeare. He longs for things the government has kept from the public such as art, freedoms, music and literature. He follows Guy Fawks's plan and does all of his destruction on November the fifth. Hugho Weaving plays ""V"" and should win a golden glob or an Oscar, his performance should not be missed. Then there's Evey, played by Natalie ""Mrs.Skywalker"" Portman who's had a life full of tragedies but still follows the powers blindly. Until ""V"" influences her to rise against the oppression. Mr.Finch, played by Stephen Rea, is the police officer who tries to catch ""V"" but while trying to find him discovers some tight lidded secrets. And of course there's the leader, Adam Sutler, played by, John Hurt, and has a hair cut just like, Hitler.A completely astonishing movie which teaches us about the power of one and what we can accomplish. It also teaches us to question our leaders and not to believe the media, because they are all owned by people with ties to the government and only give their point of view. Best movie I think I've ever seen, complete thumbs up, this movie covers every emotion and does it well. This is how a movie should be made and will become a classic that in 30 years people will still remember remember the fifth of November.... and this movie.

So Why One More Comment?,"I don't need to say too much more if you've seen this...and if you haven't, there are literally hundreds of well written and well reasoned reviews here that should motivate your tail into a theaterThe bottom line is that this wonderfully entertaining and dare I say, enlightening, movie will be (after all is said and done) a FAILURE if it just gets forgotten in the dustbin of commercially successful media.I urge anyone who ""gets"" the message to become politically involved...and to do so at the grassroots fundamental levels as well as on the big sexy issues like Global Warming or the vaingloriously viciously vacuous venomous vehicle for vast profits known as the Iraq war.The grassroots level means actually registering and voting in EVERY election...by absentee ballot if you can't get to the polls......it means running for party committee person in your local precinct and ""taking over"" the county party apparatus so as to reflect a truly people oriented freedom oriented truly American (in the original Patrick Henry/Thomas Jefferson sense) set of values at the local levels of government. If we do this, if the millions of people who will see this nifty flick actually are inspired to GET EVOLVED in political action; then the movie (and us;-) will have served it's(our) higher purpose.Please make this work of art more than a merely entertaining diversion, let's use the emotions and the IDEAS in ""V"" to inform and motivate ourselves and others to commit nuts and bolts political activism! Let's do it now...while it's still quasi legal!!! :-)The kinds of violence and death and totalitarianism seen in this flick can ONLY become actual if YOU allow it to happen!!!!!!!!We in America are fortunate to still have enough shreds of DEMOCRACY remaining to prevent the world of V from becoming any more of a reality than it already is.Let us USE our freedoms while we still have them; or we shall surely eventually lose them all.Nick Lento",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This movie is not about a terrorist.,"*** May contain Spoilers *** This movie was a pleasure in a great many ways. One of my indicators for the greatness of a movie is how it does when I think about it after the fact and my fondness for this one only grows with the passage of time.There are many things worth saying about this movie, but much of it has been well said by others. I want to say something in response to those that seem to miss the mark when considering the underlying point to be gleaned from this.First, this movie is not an attack on U.S. policy. To think that it is is to take a garment off the rack and claim that it was specifically cut to fit just one customer. This is about regular people living under an increasingly oppressive and tyrannical regime and one man being the catalyst to try to get them past their fears enough to stand up for what they believe is right.Second, I do not see that this movie is about a terrorist. I see a terrorist as attacking the innocent along with those perceived as guilty. ""V"" did not do that. He attacked icons of the administration and those that were specifically known by him to be guilty of heinous crimes.His efforts were to free people from their fears. This was done on a group level with the city as a whole, and an individual, ""Evey."" He also did not press his ideas on the unwilling. He left ideas to those who could respond to them. In all cases he wanted people to be freed from their fears and he had no desire to simply replace one set of fears for another. He wanted them to be free. Hence, he left them a choice, which is necessary for there to be freedom in the first place. Terrorists do not want to free you from slavery. They want you to change masters. Terrorists do not want you do be without fear. They want you to fear them. ""V"" made his building bombings a spectator sport. They were not done to cause fear in the people, just in the government.This is a wonderful film and I think that some that have seen it should reconsider their idea on its point.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Matrix-lite semiotics in a confused, if mildly entertaining, grab-bag of popular elements","V for Vendetta throws together a remarkable melange of elements, bringing them together in an attempt to be overtly political. We have a dystopian future, an England ruled by a Hitler-lite version of the worst of Blair and Thatcher's governments (multiplied to a horrifying degree); a slightly crazy Guy Fawkes -style figure (V) who is conducting a vendetta against those who kept him in a detention centre; a mild-mannered heroine, Evie, who is almost gang-raped at the hands of corrupt government thugs; and a rather lovable Stephen Fry playing a closet homosexual TV producer.What was originally a comic-strip, updating an Orwellian tale of revolt against an authoritarian government to the eighties, has become a movie that updates the same themes to the present day. There's mention of rendition, an all-male cabinet that hearkens only to its leader, extensive use of 'spin', people detained without trial, secret police putting hoods over people's heads Guantanamo bay style, and most importantly the theme of 'terrors that we all face' as an excuse for government clamp downs and erosion of freedoms. For people pulling their hair out over the antics of Bush and Blair, V for Vendetta must seem like great fun in true liberal tradition. Indeed, there's a very intelligent film there somewhere  but this isn't it.In one scene, Portman (Evey) is about to be abused to the extent she will wish she had never been born. The masked and near-invincible V appears, slays her attackers, and treats her to a barrage of alliteration in which whole paragraphs use words starting with the letter 'V'. Thankful for her deliverance, she is wondering if she has been rescued by a mental case, but V demonstrates some of his pre-arranged demolition jobs set to music. As terrorists go, he's the thoughtful kind, respectful and artistic. Yet any considered analysis of the film gives us little help in deciding whether V is a true hero, saving the nation, or just someone with a heavy personal vendetta that might have the side-effect of getting rid of the bad guys. V's hero, Guy Fawkes, was not a liberator, even though he wanted to blow up parliament (as does V)  he was a Catholic dissident who wanted to destroy the Protestant aristocracy by blowing up the House of Lords and killing the reformer King James I. V wants to overthrow the government not because they are bad, but because they hurt him (and his family) personally, and is quite happy to murder extravagantly and with a certain panache. The two aims do overlap though, and he realises Evie must play a crucial part as the representative of more regular society.The (Matrix) Wachowski Brothers, who wrote the screenplay, indulge their love of literary association by referencing Shakespeare and the Count of Monte Cristo extensively. The use of colour is striking, jumping from violent red and black to smudgy warm interiors with artistic treasures or the white utilitarian rooms of plebeian offices. Natalie Portman's acting is tolerable, but the film's weakness is that it fails to convey any sense of reality, whether as a believable future society, a symbol of modern day ills, or a political thriller. We are left with the Watchowskis' portmanteau of assorted skills thrown together in an inadequate script, and central characters that add up barely as well as the Joker from Batman and Robin, but with the added baggage of trying to ride the crest of left-wing political comment films without having done the necessary homework. Bereft of its pretensions, V for Vendetta is just about acceptable fare for comic-to-film fans, but otherwise fails to rise above the mid water mark for a night's viewing. Like Superman before him, V is a hero who is portrayed as physically and emotionally emasculated, unable to have normal sexual relations, genetically modified with super strength and near invulnerability  a comic-book fan's wet dream. He ensconces himself in a fortress, venturing out as a god-in-a-cape messianic figure. But when the masses rally to support him in their look-alike masks, we can't help but wonder if they will be capable of instituting an intelligent democracy to replace the order that is overthrown. As a superhero, his philosophy has little to recommend it beyond listening to Julie London classics and imitating the Three Musketeers (unless we add a sympathetic ear for gays and lesbians). Bereft of V's remarkable powers, the pub-soaked working classes watching him on a TV screen seem to offer little hope for an enlightened future.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"They get it , and politically miss it","It starts off with a testimony to the importance of free speech; i.e. IDEAS. The movie purports to show the power of that basis for all freedoms: the freedom to speak your ideas, your insights, your criticisms. Since these freedoms have been suppressed by a conservative-style government (anti-immigrant, homophobic, anti-Islamic, etc.) , kept afloat with the help of servile media, the answer lies in ""V"" as freedom-fighter. So far, so good - and it IS good, but where Hollywood (always) turns the blind eye is that IN REALITY, it is on the nation's liberal left campuses for example, that any opinion other than that of say, gay activists, is condemned as homophobic; any opinion contrary to unlimited abortion-on-demand is seen as anti-feminist; to oppose racial quotas is to be seen as ""racist."" The media is continually in the hip pocket of the left, and the IDEA of free-speech that ""V"" is championing are the very ideas liberal left-wingers will literally not allow to be spoken on campuses, in most Hollywood movies as well as the mainstream press. Having lived 4 years in the mideast, let me say it is obvious neither the Wachowski brothers, the director or the screenwriter had actually read the Koran, which they make a point of protecting from the angry xenophobic gov't. Had they done so, they would have seen that everything ""V"" id FOR is OPPOSED in a book that would suit well on any fascist's shelf. Mein Kamp would have been the same choice. Aside from turning real-world politics 180 degrees on its head, it's a fun movie that demonstrates Natalie Portman is the real-deal and hopefully we'll be seeing and hearing a lot more from her.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"What a truly awful mess of a film. If this got made, it gives us all hope...","I have just seen this at a private screening and was hoping for great things. The general consensus was - How on earth did this get made??? 'V' is easily the longest 2 hours 10 minutes I've ever spent in a cinema. The whole thing is very short on action, and ridiculously long on tedium. A colleague I saw it with - an apolitical Australian - dubbed it 'The worst film I have ever seen..' He wasn't alone.Where to start?1/. Well, FOUR script writers. And not one of them with a decent writing credit to their name. Yes, I know there are loads of sad guys with no girlfriends out there, who think The Matrix is a work of mystical genius. It isn't. It is a film that stupid people think is clever. 'V' is the same, but without the good bits. I haven't read the comic novel on which it's based, but I understand the author has disassociated himself from it. AFter five minutes you can see why. From the off we are hit with ranting, heavy-handed, pretentious, meaningless drivel masquerading as commentary or satire, or allegory? God only knows. But given the hysteria of the writing teams' message, you wonder what sort of government such rabid parochialists would form given the chance.. What is obvious, after an interminable first third is: THE SCRIPT IS A MESS. The writers cannot tell a story and leave vast holes in the plot. My guess is they had neither the money, nor the will, to hire a decent script doctor. It would have been expensive.2/. Hugo Weaving in a rubbish mask is irritating after two minutes. After two HOURS, you've lost the will to live. 'Hey Larry (and the other one). PLASTIC MASKS CAN'T ACT. They're static, and in movies, static=boring. But even his fight scenes were badly choreographed and badly directed.3/. The whole film looks like it was made for TV. The first scene has a set like a 1970s Hammer horror. We in Britain were used to this sort of thing 20 years ago. Is London supposed to be desolate and oppressed as it would be under a totalitarian regime? If so, what was the production designer doing?4/. What year is it set in? It's meant to be 20-30 years in the future and yet the police are still using old Dell computers, driving five year old Rovers and using current mobile phones. Details like these added to the veneer of cheapness.5/. Plot. In Wachowskis' England there is one family, one grotty pub, two policeman who live in an office, five politicians and this girl - Ms Portman - whose parents have been killed by an evil totalitarian government because they protested against the war or something. But the government are bioterrorists experimenting on dissidents until one day there's a big explosion (not sure why) and then a nerve agent kills 100,000 people, (or is it 80,000, we get told both figures) which is falsely pinned on Muslim extremists and then John Hurt becomes Hitler on a chat show and we've still got an hour to go..... I MEAN IT IS SO MUCH JUVENILE RUBBISH. How old are these writers?6/. Actors. Natalie Portman. Yes, she does a perfectly decent job with a script so full of holes and containing so many terrible lines you actually feel for her. Her accent was fine and I hope she got paid well for this, because she is at sea with this ludicrous script. Scarlett Johanssen and Bryce Dallas Howard - count yourselves lucky. John Hurt is great in these sorts of roles (Contact) Here he was terrible. One dimensional, shouty nonsense does not a performance make. Not in the least bit convincing, or unlikeable. The other bit part actors were pretty low rent, you don't even see them on TV in the UK. Even Stephen Rea was laughable on occasion.7/. OK, what is the point? Governments are evil? Totalitarianism is a bit unpleasant? Revolution will save us all? Or worse - and I think this is what our angst-ridden writers are getting at - 9/11 was a Bush plot. How original. Simplistic, Hollywood liberalism is eating itself alive right there, up on the screen.....8/. Cheap, cheap, cheap. 'V' for Vendetta cost $50m. Natalie aside, the acting is so second rate you know the budget didn't go there, the production values were sub made for TV standard, there are no Matrix sfx to speak of, so I guess the cash went on blowing up the Houses of Parliament (still not quite sure why) and shutting down St James' on a Monday night. $50m is cheap by Batman Begins standards. But it looks like it cost half that. And BB is a ten times the film this mess is. The good side? It will make money for fat Joel and his band tedious fat cats.9/. Do we really need a movie for spotty, Chomsky groupies? The downside of the web has been the growth of the conspiracy theory racket. This has always been lucrative Wachowski territory and their constituency will flock to this nonsense and proclaim it a work of genius. For these people, movies like this aren't really entertainment, they are a confirmation of their own simplistic, childish beliefs in scenarios created out of low self-esteem, paranoia, social failure, limited intellect and laziness. This one's for them.10/. V for Vendetta commits the greatest crime in movies. It is boring. Bad story telling is boring. Bad preaching is boring, bad acting is boring. This has all three. I was a guest at the screening I saw so I couldn't leave, and had to watch the whole thing. Someone behind me summed it up. With 30 minutes to go, they hissed 'For the love of God.

Quality!,"The mainly excellent casting and performances in this movie make up for it not quite capturing the bleak mood of Alan Moore's superb graphic novel.

Would have preferred to have someone unknown playing Evie, as although Natalie Portman is a good actress, I felt the part needed to be played by someone fresh and anonymous, and perhaps someone actually English to give it added authenticity That said, Portman's performance is fine and doesn't spoil the film in the way that some extremely wooden performances have ruined big films in the last few years (step forward Mr McGregor, guilty on at least two counts  The Island and Star Wars Episode III).

More than just a movie; an iconic statement.,"Just like the main character itself, this movie is an icon, for fighting for freedom and liberty in the widest sense of the word.The movie is multiple layered, filled with symbolism and deeper meanings but with one clear main message in it; People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. It shows that if enough people are behind something, things can be achieved. Even killing and acts of terrorism can be justified. As the character V's says it; A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. A symbol, in and of itself is powerless, but with enough people behind it, blowing up a building can change the world.The movie shows obvious interesting parallels to western leaders and governments but also that of the middle east and beyond. The parallels to the Hitler Nazi period were perhaps a bit too extreme and over-the-top to find it credible but in this case I can forgive the movie for that, since it still makes its point clear and works powerful as a thought provoking movie. For this movie truly is one of the most thought provoking movie of the last couple of decades. The movie forces us to use our minds constantly and makes us see how certain acts of violence can be used for the good cause and how symbolism and one act can inspire people for coming into action and to doing the right thing. Leaders shouldn't just be able to get away with everything they do.Almost every aspect of the word freedom is present in the movie. Some in a symbolic way, others in a more obvious way. Such as freedom of speech and censorship in the media, freedom of religion (some people see this movie is anti-Christian, quite frankly I really don't see why) and freedom of being able to chose your own sexuality and being able to do what ever makes you feel good and happy. The movie also shows interesting parallels with recent issues and issues from the past, from all over the world, such as the earlier mentioned censorship in the media, which still is the case in certain middle eastern and communist countries, the ex scandals in churches but also the use of violence and terrorism against a governments their own citizens, to control and and form the people. It's refueling the conspiracy theories that the American government itself was behind the 9/11 attacks, to put fear into the people so the government was more able to do the things their way and gain from it, by getting the people behind them and exploiting from the people's their fear. But also less recent issues such as performing medical tests on prisoners, in order to create a super-race and more Nazi like references. In other words, more than enough interesting parallels to make you think about the world we're living in today.What ""V for Vendetta"" also does well is mixing action entertainment with thought provoking, almost poetic like elements. In the essence the movie is still an action movie that is fast paced and has a fair amount of violence and fight sequences in it. The action sequences are shot spectacular and form some of the highlights of the movie. But of course ""V for Vendetta"" is far from your average 'superhero' movie, it's a too important and relevant movie for that.The characters are also symbolic. Of course the character of V is the best example of this. Behind the mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea and ideas are bulletproof. I quote V a lot, since everything he says in this movie is true, even when your initial thought might suggest otherwise. Evey is a character who begins as a normal person but slowly starts to becoming just a fearless, determent freedom fighter as V is. Inspector Finch is a normal cop who start to discover and see through the lies that his government, for which he works, spreads and he slowly begins to see the whole picture and V's true intentions. And Chancellor Adam Sutler is symbolic for basically every dictator that ever lived and ruled.The movie is a very good looking one. The cinematography by Adrian Biddle is truly spectacular and this movie was a worthy last picture for him. The special effects are also what makes this movie a really spectacular one.The acting is also of a very high order. Hugo Weaving is great, even though he wears a mask during the entire movie. He acts through his mask and manages to give the character an own personality, complete with working and sensible emotions in certain sequences. Natalie Portman is also great but it sort of makes you wonder why she was cast in this, since she isn't British. Her accent just doesn't sound right but I have to admit that she never looked any better in a movie. She is absolutely beautiful. It was also great to see Stephen Rea in a big production again. John Hurt convincingly plays the villainous dictator. Is there any role that John Hurt can't handle? He is a very versatile actors that has already played a wide range of different characters. Really amazing.But as a movie it is a rather flawed one to be perfectly honest. The story doesn't always flow and the character development and treatment is also lacking at times. It's obvious that James McTeigue still has a lot to learn when it comes to directing. But it however doesn't take away any of the movie its power or messages. The movie succeeds in what it tries to achieve and because of that I consider this movie as an absolute and important relevant masterpiece.See this movie for its action or its messages. Either way you'll be pleased.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

V's poetic humor and polite manor is terrifying and beautiful at the same time. Evey's steady growth as a character and as human being leaves you no doubt to her destiny. The political cause-and-effect scheme is as such that it can relate to anything and everything happening in our time. this movie shows a modern day revolution of a corrupt government that will make you feel like one among many and many among millions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining and intelligent,"V for Vendetta is an adaptation of a graphic novel by Alan Moore. While V can be seen as an action film, it's much more. Although set in Britain, and originally conceived and written by a British artist, this film seems designed to speak to American political sensibilities. V probes the purpose of government and brings up themes which contemporary Americans seem to have forgotten - the basic concepts of the separation of church and state, government by and for the people, the right to overthrow leaders who exercise their own will at the expense of the nation. V reminds us of our duty to resist and rebel against megalomania and totalitarianism. Though grown in England, and tapped into English history, the message applies everywhere and to everybody, but seems especially appropriate for those of us living with the Bush administration and fearful of its legacy.Natalie Portman plays a young woman who is afraid of her own shadow. Out after curfew one night, she is approached by a pair of ruffians and rescued by the verbose, masked V (Weaving). V is a man who has lost his identity as a result of events in his past which are mysteriously connected to the fascistic government (presided over by John Hurt). He draws his identity out of a relatively obscure event in British history, an attempt to blow up parliament, and dons a mask which is a caricature of the leader of this gunpowder revolution.The plot and characterizations are complex, with adequate but not overbearing back-story. The script is occasionally goofy but excellent - retaining many elements of the comic medium without losing any credibility. The acting is simply wonderful. Natalie Portman is phenomenal. Weaving carries a difficult role very nicely, giving powerful humanity to a man who remains shrouded in mystery. Stephen Rea and John Hurt - always great - both lend strong support. The cinematography is very good and fits the story nicely.Since this film involved the Wachowski's many have seen fit to compare it to the Matrix. Although there are some similarities, I think the comparison is unfair to both films. V is a much less subtle and, in a purely practical political way, a more intelligent and less playful film. It is also less cinematographically innovative and less reliant on scope. Where The Matrix unfolded in the playground of ontology, V is firmly situated in the gladiatorial arena of social psychology. Besides, V was directed by James McTeigue, not the Wachowskis.Even if you don't get it from a political point of view, you are very likely to enjoy this film. I recommend it to all free-thinking individuals who have not lost hope for humanity.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose vis-à-vis an introduction, and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V""I consider this film a revolution in the cinemas, only by the fact of its message. Some people will think that this film urges to commit terrorism, or to dissolve governments whenever they please to. But the real thing is that the movie wants to remind us that the power of a country resides on their people. They are the ones who choose their legislating leaders, in fact, the complete government perce. V wants to teach us a lesson that consists of remembering that the ideas never die; and no matter what horrible things you had to deal to maintaining it, never die. That's the problem with governments that once they have the power in their hands, they want that we forget who chose them, just to do things their way, and thus to be able to do richer others, thanks to that business that is the government. The government or State not exist so that they can use it like an average one to make businesses, under contrary, the government exist because their job is to protect and give security to the people of their nation, besides to conserve and maintain the peace and unity. The governments have to give their people freedom in their own country and protect that freedom for that matter, as long as that freedom is subject to right laws (Locke). And also, this protection and security that the government should give to the people is not for some specific people of their nation, but to everyone no matter what color, sexual preference or religious believes. After all, for that reason it is why we pay contributions, so that the government has the resources to do it. Of not doing it, treason is considered converses from the government to its people. The government does not exist so they could create conflicts that don't exist, so they can control the people by using the fear as a tool. That is not ethical at all, is cruel, because is a way of using the people debilities to manipulate them as they were puppets.We need to remember that your liberty or freedom finish when other ones starts, and is by living in justice what we could make a better world and a better government. ""REMEMBER, REMEMBER THE FITH OF November"", its mean the rebellion and what Guy Fawkes represents to the people.To the people that have doubts of if they should see or not the movie, I totally recommended. The movie do not incite you to blow a building or something like that, but instead, touch a lot of themes that could make you think a lot, and at the same time is totally enjoyable because of the ironic humor that the character of V (by Hugo Weaving)has. If you think that Hugo Weaving couldn't pull this off, you are wrong, because he manage to give life a character that has not expression but a mask. V really can make you be interest in what he's saying, doing, etc... The movie over pass my expectations and I promise you that it would do the same thing on you. Att.

Totally Amazing!!! See this movie!!!,"I'll keep it short, this was the best movie I have seen in many years, quite possibly ever. I will probably always ""LIKE"" most of the Star Wars movies better, and possibly a few others, but I really think this film was beyond excellent. It's story, characters, effects, message, etc., etc. as a whole make it probably the ""best"" movie I've ever seen. As I said, I may ""like"" or ""enjoy"" other movies a fraction or two more, but ever since I have seen this film, I now consider this the ""best"" film I've ever seen. And it is definitely in the top 5 films that I ""like"" or ""enjoy"" the most. The day after I saw it I called three of my good friends to tell them how good it was, and that I'd go with them to see it again if they were going to go see it. I will buy the DVD the very first day it comes out. I'm not going to try to analyze or interpret the meaning or message here, as I feel almost anyone can benefit from seeing this movie, no matter their views or opinions, and debating the underlying meanings/messages/implications/innuendos, etc. could take me more hours than I want to spend, in addition to the responses, replies, etc. that I'd want to respond to.

A movie the world needed,"V For Vendetta is a stunning adaptation of Alan Moore's science-fiction graphic novel that is faithful to its ideals, albeit with some updates which make it seem more relevant to today's world. What makes it truly unique is its believability. While the masked freedom fighter V is the stuff of comic books, the background story of the world's fall into ruin and fascism seems frighteningly possible.The most powerful part of the movie occurs when Natalie Portman's Evey reads the autobiography of Valerie, a remarkable woman who was persecuted, tortured and killed because of her lesbian sexual orientation. Valerie refused to give up her integrity or her dignity, in the face of tremendous evil.The graphic novel was written in the time of Thatcher and Reagan. Today, the forces of greed and ignorance are once again ascendant. Conservatives threaten our values and want to turn back the clock on all the progress made by good-hearted, progressive people. The story of V For Vendetta is a powerful reminder of what could happen if we ever let them win, if we ever give them that ""last inch."" It is also a hopeful film, however, as the forces of wisdom win in the end, just as they always have and always will. Perhaps the very fact that this great film could be made and distributed by a major studio provides the greatest hope that its events will not come to pass.

A surprisingly effective social satire within a Hollywood film? It is not perfect but it is very enjoyable for what it does,"Evey Hammond is heading out after curfew when the Government's Finger Men catch her and decide to enact their own form of justice on her. Her only rescue comes in the form of a masked man in a cape. This man then proceeds to show her the destruction of the Old Bailey. The Government spring into action to spin the story, control the people and find the terrorist. The police track Evey from CCTV and head to her work place (the Government controlled television station) to detain her. ""V"" arrives before them and uses the emergency station to broadcast his own message of unrest, elevating his ""terrorist"" stance against the Government in a year long war that will culminate on the 5th November one way or the other.It probably helps to be in the UK to really appreciate what this film does well. I don't mean that in a snobby way but it is a success of the film that it produces a vision of the UK that is both futuristic but yet recognisable as our current condition. It does this most easily by visually mixing the design of homes and people's lives with all the trimmings of a totalitarian state but it also does it by making the links to our current political state of control and Government intrusion in the name of ""terrorism control"" and protection. Although it is only a year old, the film still shows a lot of foresight when viewed with hindsight and in doing so it produces an effectively bleak attack on our current political climate. It is effective mainly because it doesn't ever feel that far fetched thanks to the details but mainly thanks to the overriding themes of fear and control being used by a Government.The surprise and joy of finding this level of social commentary in a what appeared to be a Hollywood action movie helped cover up some of the weaknesses. Some viewers have complained about the lack of action in the film; personally I do not see this as a weakness because this is more to do with how the film was sold rather than how it was made. The weaknesses are minor and include the asks the plot makes in regards the ability of V to do what he does and how far-fetched some of it is etc but, like I said, these are covered by how relevant and interesting I found the story. The cast are mostly good. It took me a good twenty minutes to accept Portman's accent but after that she won me over. She is very much in the shadow of Weaving, who shows what a great voice he has by producing a wonderful character without a glimpse of his face throughout. Rea is a bit dour but he does convince as a worn-down public servant faced with the truth about his masters. Fry wasn't that good but does what he had to do in a small role. Hurt and Pigott-Smith are both very good; Hurt particularly convinced as the sort of person who rises to power and delivered convincing lines in a convincing manner  it is telling he has little screen time but a large impact. McTeigue direction was surprisingly good and he delivered the whole affair with a real downbeat air while I'm sure some pressure must have been on him to deliver a big budget action movie for the summer season. He is well supported by the designers behind the visuals.Those seeking action to compare with the Matrix (or even action) will feel let down and I can understand why  the trailers have talked up this side and talked down the social commentary side (and this is a damning verdict of how public tastes are viewed from Hollywood) but credit to the makers for producing a film that surprised me by how relevant it was. Over the coming years this will either become a thing of its time or more relevant than ever (I hope the former) but right now it is an effective story, told with the unreal air of graphic novel but with enough to link it to the present to keep it relevant. I was genuinely surprised by how good it was and how engaged I was by it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Movie sucks big time,","This movie is for sure inspired by the 1984 George Orwell book and Zorro. But it is neither a political thriller, nor and action movie. It is just a waste of time. It could be a great action movie, but they wasted too much time being a ""documentary"", who cares? People kept talking and talking and talking about bullshit I have seen thousands of times before. They should have concentrated on the action and less on these speeches. This Talkathon would have been a great movie, were it not so preachy. How about the main character? Where did he get all his shakespearean knowledge? They never explain. Stupid movies always try to throw Shakespeare at you, thinking that maybe that will save it. Why would a zoro-like figure keep spouting these endless diatribes? This movie wants to be this and that and it ends up just sucking big time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding On All Accounts,"Combining super-heroism with a dystopian future, V For Vendetta is a truly outstanding film.The script and dialogue come from excellent source material, and this is brilliantly presented on screen. Intelligent, vicious and witty, the scripts are masterful, and the storytelling reveals the next stage of the plot at the perfect times. The plot is so good and it is a relief that such depth is able to be kept within the confines of film.Performances are superb across the board. Weaving conducts himself beautifully and is brilliant whilst being so limited by being behind a mask. Facial expressions are removed from view but his execution of the dialogue bring that emotion to life. Hurt is fantastic and the perfect casting for the 'Big Brother'-esqe tyrant, showing he can do both sides of the 1984 story. Portman is wonderful throughout and portrays such emotion in her characters development, expressing a great range. The supporting cast all play their parts well, particularly the villains.Excellent choreography and visually stunning, there are many memorable images throughout the film. The costuming and settings do the graphic novel justice and support the movement of the story.Timeless, and unfortunately continuously relevant, V For Vendetta is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I will remember the fifth of November!,"Many people had a very negative reaction towards the second and third part of The Matrix trilogy, something I didn't quite understand but it seems that all the Wachowsky brothers needed to do to get back people's attention (in a positive way) was a change of scenery. Even though they didn't direct V for Vendetta their presence in the film making process and in the dialog is very evident. James McTeigue directs this slightly off key blockbuster and he certainly makes it his own. One could have feared that V for Vendetta would be just another Matrix copy but it isn't. Watch the film and you'll know.The acting is generally on a very high level in the film but because of great casting but there are a few, just a few glitches. Natalie Portman who we know can act (at least those of us who have seen Closer and Garden State) is fairly good. When I say fairly good it is not because there is anything wrong with her emotional range as she portrays all the emotions of her character with great skill. No, its her accent. Her accent is not always completely believable. I'm not saying that her accent is downright bad because its not (its not like Kevin Costner's accent in Robin Hood) but there are a few moments where it is obvious that she is an American and not British. Stephen Rea does a good job with his character as well and he portrays both the urgency and the doubt of his character in a very satisfactory manner. Tim Pigott-Smith is decent as well. We don't really see his character that much but we see him enough to dislike him which is just what his purpose is. John Hurt is absolutely wonderful as the dictator, Adam Sutler. Even though we only see his face imposed on a wall screen for most of the film he manages to steal every of these scenes with his amazing facial expressions and confident tone of voice. Absolutely marvelous. Hugo Weaving who most people know as Agent Smith plays the title role and he is brilliant. Having to wear a mask throughout the entire movie he has to rely on his voice and on body language and it is here that he proves how incredibly talented he is because his character is incredibly diverse. Also he is given some of the more heavy dialog and he is very good at dealing with it possibly because of his experience from the Matrix films. He also has great sense of comical timing and is sometimes genuinely funny. Hugo Weaving is fast becoming one of my favorite actors. Two thumbs way up.In terms of style the film is very unique. It isn't like any other action movie spit out by the Hollywood machinery, no. It has its very own style and it sticks to it throughout the entire movie making the overall impression much more polished and believable. The trailer promotes this film as very action packed. Its not. There are only a few excellently choreographed action scenes but that doesn't matter because when you're not thinking about the well written dialog you're looking at some beautifully atmospheric scenes. There are a few slow points in the movie and in these scenes it really helps that there is something to look at because it really helps the movie so that it doesn't come to a complete stop. The soundtrack is a little too vague for my taste, you don't really remember it after the film but at least its not intrusive.V for Vendetta has come early here in 2006 but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it winds up being one of the best films of the year because it really is a clever, moving and very entertaining film with great acting, suspenseful plot and great action.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I tried to find some redeeming qualities for the poor actors, I like Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, who had to spit out the worse duologue I've heard in years. The Brothers Wachowski must have still been taking their psychedelic drugs, you know the ones they were on when they made the second and third Matrix films.

Unfortunately still relevant today,"Some stories lose their relevance relatively quickly. Others transcend time and find eternal relevance, appealing to diverse audiences as the years go by. 2005's 'V for Vendetta' falls into the latter category, as the story of hope springing eternal for a revolution to usurp a tyrannical government is one that will unfortunately be viewed as an allegory until the end of time.In 'V,' we get the perspective of both the oppressed (Natalie Portman's Evey and Hugo Weaving's V himself) and the oppressors (through the eyes of Stephen Rea's conflicted detective Finch). We see the slow buildup to a revolution in a future dystopian Great Britain following a second American civil war, which sadly doesn't feel too far from reality. This central plot is what drives 'V' and sets it apart from so many other stories, and many can view the horrors and atrocities committed by the ruling authoritarian government led by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) as representative of who they consider to be their political enemies.But 'V' succeeds in painting a picture of how to stand up to protect your rights, how staying silent can destroy the fabric of society and the importance of never giving in, never giving up. It does this, mind you, in a way that still manages to be entertaining.'V for Vendetta' may have achieved ""cult"" status, but there is no denying the impact and reach of its message.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V for Vendetta,"The savior and absolute redeemer of the archaic, pompous and stifling, British film industry.Hugo Weaving, brings to life a multidimensional, multifaceted character unlike anything we had ever seen before, which paradoxically, we never get to see.As we are grudgingly introduced to V by a sudden twist of fate, a new dynamic to this already complex story line is instilled with the incorporation of the humble idealist, Evey Hamm (Natalie Portman).Hugo Weaving explodes on screen with a mesmerizing repertoire of allegory and blazing determination from behind the symbolic, Guy Fawkes mask. The sublime chemistry between V and Evey is extraordinary and serves to fuel the spectators with a combustible mixture of ardent desire and vengeful compassion.V for Vendetta overshadows all other anti-hero themed movies and sets a whole new standard or benchmark for the fans of emotionally satisfying, action, romance and drama.It will most likely be a long time before we the spectators are presented with an equally compelling story as V for Vendetta. I would recommend the 2002 version of The Count of Monte Cristo as an alternative to help fill the void, while we patiently wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Can the revolution happen without a leader?,"Just saw it and was DEEPLY impressed. Yes, acting and cinematography were top-notch, but it was the updated socio-political commentary that gave the film its punch. The novel, written in the Thatcher/Reagan 80's, was projecting the politics of conservative corporate greed into the future, and look how far we've already come since then....Most thought-provoking was Finch's comment to his colleague upon uncovering administrative malfeasance -- if your government facilitated and/or perpetrated actions against its own people that were subsequently blamed on domestic/foreign terrorists, ""Would you want to know?"" (Such a question exposes the root of national denial, through which we're all going to hell in a hand-basket....)V's liberation was by fire, and Evey's is by water. His is mythical, impossible to grasp except through enjoying the fantastical world created in graphical novels. Hers is real and intensely moving. It is the kind of freedom from fear that is faced down by untold others throughout history. Even now as I write this, and as you read it, someone somewhere is coming to terms with the ultimate value of some truth beyond one's own life. Evey experiences and surpasses that unspeakable terror which others (i.e. the great majority of us) prefer to project out into the world as ""terrorism"" -- and without facing such a fear we acquiesce to almost anything in order to believe we're ""safe.""Evey's name isn't merely similar to that of V, but is a metaphor of the first woman as life-giver, and thus subject to the natural and inherent ""temptation"" of preserving life. Is there ever a war worth fighting for, dying for, killing for? This film says yes.While the faceless V behind his mask is a virtual No One, he emerges as the voice of Every One -- and the movie's final moments express this beautifully. Only problem is, most folks have to be much worse off before they rise up, with or without leaders and cool costumes. Bread and circuses (i.e. ""Britain"") will indeed prevail a good while. But perhaps some day when a barely literate populace no longer has easy access to graphic novels, and global warming brings the seacoast lapping up the sides of abandoned coastal cities turned slums, the revolution will come....",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V for Vindictive?,"What happens when the politics of a movie overpower what is otherwise a moving, relevant, and even (at times) beautiful message?Everyone tries SO hard here...Portman becomes wonderfully cockney, Weaving emotes mystery and power with every gesture and head tilt, and Hurt channels Hitler and any other tyrannical dictator with a frightening authenticity and ferocity--this film shares with us by far the best performances of their careers. Technically speaking, ""V"" is better made than any other film in the past 3 years, and much, much better than other Wachowski/Silver collaborations (read: the Matrix trilogy). Throw in what is a perfectly twisted plot, and what we SHOULD have is a movie catapulted to every top 10 list for the next 20 years, right?Well...not so much. You see, intolerance of the intolerant is very dangerous, especially when the filmgoing public wants to be entertained, not indoctrinated. Buried beneath the faux message of love and acceptance, behind the flashy special effects, Panavision gloom, and the painful smile of a ghastly Guy Fawkes mask is a hatred more malignant than anything Hollywood or comic books could ever dream up. This film teaches that learning to hate is how we learn to love, that vengeance is the only way to achieve justice, that fear of anything--including God--is akin to torture. Democracy begets war, Christianity begets terrorism, and freedom may only be found through Anarchy in the world according to V.One question: is that a world where you want to live?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Political Satire,"When I go to a movie, it's either to make fun of it or because I really have nothing else to do on Friday nights. Last night, I saw 'V For Vendetta' and I blown away. I didn't go to make fun of it of course, but I was just floored.The political satire was wonderful. Using Muslims and homosexuals as scapegoats for the things wrong with society and lying about searching for weapons so as to torture citizens in unknown prisons are parallels to today's America, even though the movie took place in the future in England. :) I was amused that the USA had been through a Civil War and was now a Leper Colony. That's a WONDERFUL future for the Americans, wouldn't you say? (I'm being sarcastic of course) I didn't care for some of the slow motion knife twirling, but even that was overpowered by V actually slicing someone. The great thing about this film is that it's almost unbelievable and ridiculous to a point, but because V represents all the people (as Natalie Portman's character states in the film) you feel sucked in and you love V as a hero, you want him to represent you.I also like how they did have some humor in the film. When Evey wakes up and goes into the kitchen, V is in a frilly apron making her breakfast. When he introduces himself to her in the street, his diction is made up mostly of words that have the lette v or begin with the letter v. He said it all so quickly and it was just amusing.I suggest this movie for anyone who is in the mood for some Bush-bashing, impressive action sequences, and damn good music.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Overrated by IMDb users,"From memory when this movie came out most reviewers gave it 6-7 out of 10. This is a more accurate reflection of the film's merit than what the average IMDb user has given it. I would put this down to a proportion of users having not seen enough 'good' movies in their time. For those who have seen enough of these movies they would know that nearly everything in this film has already been done many times before. Honestly, how many times is the 1984/big brother theme going to be rehashed? It is a great book and all but someone needs to think of a new dystopian premise. The other one that has been done to death is the plague that either kills people or turns them into monsters. The only variation of this film is that it combines the latter two premises, but really, that is just a testament to the fact that it is a 'dystopia by numbers' film. I guess it's just a trend - a money making operation.To be fair, had I seen this when I was 12 I probably would have thought it was pretty good, but looking at it objectively there are definitely better equivalent films. My advice to those who liked this and haven't seen Bladerunner, A Clockwork Orange and to a lesser extent: Dark City, Gattaca and 12 Monkeys - is to get down to your video store quick smart and hire them out!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Style without substance,"It seems appropriate that the 1812 overture is part of the soundtrack for this movie: Tchaikovsky might dazzle for a short while, but you wouldn't want to listen to it for over two hours.Even those who have not yet seen the movie, probably know that the Wachowski brothers have jumped on the anti-Bush bandwagon. The political message is not too blatant, but knowing about it helps to understand the symbolism.The movie is set in a future dystopian Britain (confusingly called ""England"": perhaps Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have become independent?). There is a second civil war in the USA, and ""England"" has fallen under a dictatorship with Christian theocratic overtones. By the look of the regime logo, the official religion seems to be Eastern Orthodoxy.For some reason, the title character thinks that blowing up the Old Bailey and the Houses of Parliament would help to restore the rule of law and democracy. He styles himself after Guy Fawkes, a Catholic terrorist who tried to blow up Parliament with everybody inside.Actually, the entire script appears to be written in blissful ignorance of the real world. For example, the dictatorship bans the Koran. What are the reactions of the 1.6 million Muslims in Britain? the movie does not acknowledge that they even exist. Another example: the movie opens with a British televangelist saying that America has fallen because it is more Godless than Britain.The internal logic of the movie world is just as shaky. The regime is only nominally Christian, so why does it waste police resources in persecuting apolitical homosexuals? and why does it impose a late-night curfew?It gets worse. One might think that an American civil war would generate enough fear to sustain a few dozen dictatorships, but the British regime fakes a few terrorist attacks for good measure. This conspiracy looks useless twice over when it transpires that people do not believe in the regime propaganda.On the other hand, people immediately believe the first TV broadcast from a masked man who speaks against the government without offering any evidence whatsoever. This is what I call the ""Running Man"" plot device: an anti-government video is shown on prime time TV, and popular opinion is immediately turned around. It is becoming a popular plot device.One might also wonder why V prefers knifes to guns, or how he manages to live in style in the very center of London, but this is nitpicking.There is a pretense that the plot devised by V is very clever. To support this idea, we are shown how very clever he is with falling dominoes. In practice, the entire scheme devised by V can be reduced to the following:BEGIN SPOILERS: The regime Security Chief has been plotting to murder the Dictator and take his place; V asks the Security Chief to carry out the execution in front of him; the Chief obliges (for reasons known only to him); finally, V kills the Security Chief. Incidentally, this is the only significant action scene, and it is poorly choreographed: the Chief's bodyguards stand like mannequins, waiting for their throats to be cut. END SPOILERSThis is not much of a plot, so it had to be padded with a revenge sub-plot, some prison scenes, and some explosions.In summary, this movie has two confused and illogical plots (the movie plot and V's own plot) which show no knowledge of the real world; and no points of interest other than a character with a cool costume. If you want to see what life might be like under a modern theocracy, see The Handmaid's Tale: it has a low-budget look, but what do you expect in a theocracy? If you want a well-told dark story with a masked super-hero, see Batman Begins. And if you want exciting sci-fi action with a decent plot, see Terminator 2: Judgment Day.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

More than just a Vendetta,"When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty. Thomas JeffersonThat quote, modified by V in the movie, hints at my opinion of the film- (call it a simplistic one if you will). I loved this film. The Count of Monte Cristo revenge plot is given an interesting twist by the immersion in fictitious national political scene. The tyranny imposed on the citizens was inspired by both the past AND present, both fact AND fiction. The writers should not *mask* (bad pun) nor NEED to mask their political views. Everyone should be able to freely and openly state opinions and ideas! This is a key point of the film.The Count of Monte Cristo revenge plot is also transformed by a romance. Evey becomes V's conscience by the end of the film, in addition to becoming his love. Both changes were enjoyable to watch. The actor who played V gave an Oscar worthy performance without having access to the main tool of an actor - facial expressions. Astoundingly well done.And for those who criticize because V for Vendetta b/c they believe it to be a poor adaptation of the graphic novel I say this: No movie adaption of a book is made for the people who ""loved the book."" It's made for people who like movies! I love both so I count myself lucky.

Along these same lines, Hugo Weaving, who played V has an incredible voice and it gave a lot of power to a faceless character which fed into the eroticism.I would have liked to have known more about V - that part of the story felt unsatisfying but all in all, this was a very good Swashbuckling Zorro Meets Phantom of the Opera Meets A Few Other Things But With A More Sensual Love Story film.P.S.

This is easily the best movie I have seen so far this year.I had my reasons to doubt the quality of this film adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore at first. Although, I must confess, it is reading about this movie that made me interested in the graphic novel, it was simply written so brilliantly I was afraid it would be spoiled. Indeed, it wasn't an easy adaptation. The original graphic novel has very little action, and a mind-boggling amount of text, not to mention many numerous characters and subplots. There was also the matter of the Wachowski brothers. I did enjoy the first Matrix movie, but I was terribly disappointed with the sequels. To say the truth, this was a movie that was easy to screw up, and I had a feeling it would get screwed up. I was wrong, and I am oh-so-glad I was.The plot was changed for the film adaptation. The year is no longer 1998. The nuclear war was replaced with a deadly virus. But the idea behind the movie remains, even if the chain of events is different. But the film also added something I felt the graphic novel was sorely in need of: more action. I enjoyed the graphic novel immensely, but I felt it would have been more interesting with more action. And the fight scenes in this film are incredible: swift, stylish, and exciting. I did not like the changed made in Lord of the Rings. But in V, I did not mind the changes. The Wachowskis created a story of their own, based on Alan Moore's original, but different. And it works.There was, however, one change that was for the worst. In the graphic novel, V was insane, and there was no doubt about it. He wasn't simply weird, he was also unpredictable, mysterious and eccentric. V's character was brilliant in the graphic novel, and it was slimmed down in this movie. Hugo Weaving was great as V, of course, but by making the character of V more human, more sane, by making him romantically involved with Evey (who was also portrayed perfectly by Natalie Portman), he became less mysterious and less interesting. Not to mention, they made him more of a man with an idea, than an idea in itself. And that is a shame.All in all, this a spectacular piece of cinema. It's highly recommendable for anyone who enjoyed the original graphic novel, for anyone who enjoys comic book movies, and for anyone who enjoys movies in general. But if you want a different, yet more fleshed out plot, with a more interesting protagonist, pick up the V for Vendetta graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Remarkable,"This was an excellent drama akin to the stories of Brave New World or Fahrenheit 451 in its scathing indictment of those who rule through fear and force. I enjoyed the story and the characters immensely. Though you never see Hugo Weaving's face, his dialogue is masterfully delivered, both a charm and an inspiration all at once. Natalie Portman clearly delivers one of her most stunning performances and projects convincing emotion in her demonstration of an internal struggle. The writing for this project was well done and stands out as a remarkable work of drama whose powerful statements will continue to thrill and haunt you for years. Although I know the graphic novel it is based on was written as an indictment of the Thatcher administration, it nevertheless stands as a reminder to all people of all nationalities that freedom is earned and totalitarianism is given away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"If V is for Vendetta, then D must be for DULL!","I went to a screening of ""V for Vendetta"" last night and if you thought the ""Matrix Trilogy"" was bad then ""V"" will have you pulling your hair out like your name was Natalie Portman. Who by the way, wasn't the worst thing in this movie, which is kind of scary considering what an awful actress she has turned out to be. The movie comes across as little more than an ""anarchy sticker"" stuck on the bottom of some suburban punks' skateboard to look cool. Just like the suburban punk, the Wachowskis don't really believe in what they are displaying, they're just doing it to look cool. While ""V"" is completely unfaithful to comic book it was based upon, that is hardly its biggest crime. Come to think of it, compared to majority of this flicks offenses its little more than petty theft. ""V for Vendetta"" is remembered less for being a great comic book and more for being the work of a great comic book writer; Alan Moore. While nowhere near as good a book as his prior comics that were turned into films (""From Hell"" and ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""), ""V"" does follow in suit as a yet another terrible and mishandled film based on Moore's writing. While nobody would consider the Wachowski brothers to be more than glorified video game creators, I was actually curious as to how they would handle adapting a script for a book overflowing with dialogue and light on flashy graphics. Where as the ""Matrix"" films are completely style over substance, the graphic novel ""V for Vendetta"" has countless scenes devoid of action or explosions but full of rich dialogue and character evolution. Unfortunately the brothers Wachowski, along with their partner in crime director James McTeigue screw it up so badly that if this film were ever shown in a football stadium, it could qualify as the longest fumble in NFL history. For a film that's supposed to be coated in rebellion and anarchy McTeigue and the Wachowski's never really give you a reason to believe in the terrorist hero V or his attacks on Parliament. Instead of giving you emotional and character driven reasons to come to conclusions on the cast, McTeigue and company visually shove it down your throat. You know John Hurt is bad because he's on a giant screen with huge black pupils (to show he's evil, cant you see how evil that is?) and that Portman is good because she is attractive and V is good because he causes explosions and painfully goes out of his way to attempt to illicit laughter from the audience. Not a single character in this has an ounce of reality to them let alone passion for anything going on around them. And why didn't they rerecord weaving's voice; half of V's dialogue is completely muffled due to the mask. Bloated, self important and without any meaning is all you have to remember about the 5th of November.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing - Everyone SHOULD see it!,"This movie portrays the same messages that I often proclaim myself whenever I can.

"""1984"" for Dummies","This film tries hard to be deep, but is actually quite shallow. It hits you hard in the face with simple themes, kind of like ""1984"" for dummies, but without the foresight and vision.The performances were fine, but some of the writing was so bad, it made me want to crawl out of my skin. Too many cheesy lines.Visually, it is quite spectacular, so if you like that, and that is all you require in a film, you might like this one.I live in the NYC area and hearing a line like ""sometimes there's no better way to change the world than to blow up a building"", did not sit well with me.

Maniacally Genius and Inspiring.,"Astonishing. Easily the best film I've seen in my years. It combines create cinematography, writing, screenplay, and directing into a conglomerate of breathtaking film. This film makes you want to be involved, stand up, and see it again. Furthermore, it's a film that will stick with you.If you can go into this movie with an open mind and willingness to think and not just be spoon fed a story, you will fall in love with the piece the Wachowski's have brought to you. From start to finish you are engaged in a inspiring tale that uncovers just enough for you to figure out things by yourself. There are many times you can feel your whole body receive goosebumps, and many more times you can look around and see smiles or looks of worry on peoples faces around you in the theater.Do not be scared away by the mask, many people have said it's the reason they don't want to see this movie.

Sure to become a classic,"Too often films that intend a message become mired in details, and performances suffer, becoming mannered. ""V for Vendetta"" deftly avoids these pitfalls and stands out both as a thinking film and as pure entertainment. The plot is driven by thought and action, increasing its appeal to a wide audience. Upon its release I thought ""V for Vendetta"" would be a sleeper, a cult film appealing only to those of a certain oeuvre; the huge positive response it's generated from film goers of all bents is proof of its success. I attended the theatre with my teenage children who each enjoyed it for different reasons. Viewers familiar with the graphic novel may take umbrage to deletions and changes within the story but the spirit of Alan Moore's vision is intact.Few actors can carry a starring role without benefit of facial expressions but Hugo Weaving is delicious...his mellifluous voice carries just the right weight for the hefty speeches his character makes, never over the top.Natalie Portman surprised me: I always considered her a lightweight actress but she gave a well measured performance, earning kudos as her character develops throughout her ordeal.I've always liked John Hurt; he adds interest to any film and is perfectly cast in a mercurial role.There's no doubt the years will be kind; this kind of film holds up well and is destined to become a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This film has become a symbol for all free men,"This film has become a symbol for all free men in the Arabic countries, I think it affected the Arabs more than the West, Egypt likes young people wearing this mask does not know that they were fully insured, once wrote a news website HTTP://Iraqi-website.com/ story guy wearing this mask for fun police had arrested and imprisoned for three years and he's locked up yet. Maybe the revolutions were not created for the weak, but I like this movie because he found me a fantasy I liked to live in it, perhaps state fair and the distribution of wealth but nice fantasy fiction, I watched the movie 5 times and each time I discover I forgot certain detail, hoping to produce again with a new vision might include Arab revolutions and violent religious extremism",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Magnificent!,"I was astounded by this Movie. Really. I say that because, after Reloaded and Revolution (which disappointed me even more than I expected), I used to think the Wachowski Bros had cheated us all with the Matrix first (and only, I might add) chapter, and that the real dimension of their talent was the one we had the luck to ""appreciate"" with Assassins (which, IMHO, is going to be remembered as one of worst movies ever). So, although (or should I say ""since"") I'm a HUGE fan of Alan Moore's comic, I have to admit that I was a little skeptical. What can I say? I don't know whether I was wrong about the authors or not (who cares, anyway?), but this is a surprisingly TERRIFIC movie and I can't wait for the day the DVD shall be released in Italy! Good acting (Natalie Portman is one of the best young actresses in the biz, only Scarlett Johansson could be reasonably compared to her) and, most of all, a Great Screenplay (but maybe we should thank Alan Moore for this) make this one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, no doubt about it. Not mentioning some typically brilliant genius idea, such as John Hurt playing the right-winger chancellor (a homage to Michael Radford's ""1984"", I guess). I realized that what I was seeing was a work of art right from the beginning, but the more time passed by, the higher the pleasure. I think that one of most frequent misconception about this movie could concern the genre it belongs to. Well, in my opinion, this is not an action movie. Or better yet, this isn't JUST an action movie, and this is its strong card. X-men is an action movie. Superman returns is an action movie. V for vendetta is much more. It's not just the story of a guy with a mask who gets bored of all those Nazi bullshit and goes berserk, kicking asses and blowing up buildings. It is a wonderful representation of emotions, feelings, situations and characters in a well-balanced mix of action, dialogues and poetry and, most important thing, the plot is not so far from being a realistic picture of the world we're currently living in (at least, some part of it). This movie is a perfect mix between Orwell, Edmond Rostand's Cyrano (well, just a little bit angry) and the Matrix, played by really good actors and based on one of greatest graphic novels ever. So, whether you've read the comic or not, this masterpiece is a must-see, because there is really no reason why the 5th of November should ever be forgot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Truly Revolutionary Work of Art,"To sum up the brothers' masterwork in one word is a quite impossible task, but I have come to the conclusion that V For Vendetta is 'perfect'. Nathalie Portman as the hapless chick is one weak link because she is not a good actress and her English accent is as bad as the Bridget Jones Diaries but the rest if just brilliant. Making this film all the more compelling is the classical music perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the cult love bestowed upon it, especially the social movements it has aided. It deserves all these awards and more. V For Vendetta is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. The good guys and the bad guys are so complex, so scary and so relevant that it will remain an immortal film forever. Homosexuals, Muslims, freedom fighters, media folk, cops, politicians and regular folks who believe life is just drinking beer and being stupid will benefit from watching this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Alan Moore had a good reason to disown it,"V for Vedetta, a terrible excuse for making a film. How could Alan Moore allow Hollywood to make a big budget Bush-era investiment and not have any control over it. Alan Moore, the writer and creator of V FOR Vendetta was not about America's governmental system or Republican-bashing-it was about Anarchy and Fascism! For God's sake, it was about England! I have no problem with Bush-bashing but this film makes it so hard to believe, what may seem to be a beautiful, intriguing sci-fi film about the Holocaust is actually a movie that's meant to get to the box office and not to the true core of emotion and thought that it was meant to be. V FOR VENDETTA is about the man in the mask, but the true men that should be wearing masks, my friends, is the makers of this film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"Remember, Remember the 5th of November the gunpowder treason and plot.

This movie was based on the comic books. I haven't read them but I don't think that you would need to read them to love this movie. This movie was about freedom and the way that some countries might end up. People control government. Not the other way around. This movie was heavy at times but really made me think.

One of the few that have stood out and done that so well!,"Like many i was skeptical about v. i had read the comic, and enjoyed the wachovski brothers work, i was carefully optimistic.I saw it the day it came out there were very few people at my theater i was shocked. when the credits started to roll i stood up and applauded , i NEVER do that. i was even shocked at myself. after being pulled through each and every movie i've seen over the past few years i found a gem, a diamond in the rough. This movie was incredible. i believed in the characters, i laughed with them i felt sorry for them, i felt their rises and falls. the story was incredible, it was churned out from the page to the screen so beautifully. and it had a message. i don't mean that sappy message you get at the end of a Disney movie. it spoke to me, i made the connections, i followed the dotted lines, and i was impressed, it showed the evils of the world and it showed that freedom is a price you must sacrifice, avenge, and possibly die for. if somethings not right you do something about it, an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth, all that good stuff. all in all v for vendetta was a movie i will not soon forget if ever i was appalled when i walked out of that theater some guy said ""that sucked"" then i realized that not everyone understood what i understood, a lot of people just saw a guy in a mask. i felt sorry for them i hope if you have not seen this film, you will. i gave this a 10 out of 10 with all my heart.

Mixed,"I have mixed feelings about this film. There are aspects that I really enjoy and others that I despise.Hugo Weaving's performance is my favorite part of the film. The fact that he had to do it all behind a mask makes it doubly impressive. He has a great, expressive voice, and he makes full use of it here. He is able to be engagingly delightful one minute, then become terrifyingly intimidating the next. Natalie Portman is a good actress and a beautiful woman, but she's too petite for a movie like this. I feel like a stronger actress would have been better (both physically and emotionally).The story is not very original, which ties into my biggest complaint with the movie. Instead of being a new take on an old idea, V For Vendetta's story feels more like a political statement than entertainment. I understand and even admire the writers for taking such a strong stance on their politics, but I feel like the story is riding on top of the political statement.When it comes down to it, I like this movie. The acting and the execution is impressive. However, the imbalance between the story and the politics leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Real Nature of Terror is not Pulp,"This movie is after all not so bad, but it lacks everything that stirs inside me after an 'interesting' movie. Well, you should say 'it not the movie stupid', 'it is you', but however...Along visual pleasure, a movie should scratch something on your memory or emotions, so that you can connect with the fictional world. Sadly, the only thing that leaves me with something is Portman who is a perfect vulnerable actress close to the flirtatious Scarlet Johanson in Match Point.As for the Utopian nightmare, London as a Leninist brave-new-world-1984 meets Matrix-goes-to-the-opera is anyway my kind of 'bullocks'. Yet this nightmare is a corny fantasy as long as the authoritarian/totalitarian context is totally misconceived.

"Pretentious, and not even for a good purpose","Well, the critics have spoken, the box office has spoken, the fans have spoken, and now I will speak:This movie is junk.Anyone who thinks this is high-flown political allegory should take a remedial class in civics, and another in history, and yet a third in rhetoric. Anyone who thinks it's art needs to take a shower.V for Vendetta has none of the flash of the Matrix, but all of the pretentious pseudo-intellectual ""philosophizin'."" It oversimplifies both politics and human nature to the point that none of the characters are remotely believable, nor is their situation. Despite this, it manages to fail even at the level of popcorn fare, yielding not even a satisfactory final scene. Simply put, it's not even technically successful.Statements which should be the clear bulwark for the opposing forces are mumbled unintelligibly through several layers of cardboard (Mr. Weaving' voice is often-times inaudible. Don't believe me? Go look at the message boards: half of the threads are requests for clarifications on the inaudible dialog). Confrontations like the final fight scene, which should be titanic, are instead grungy and poorly lit (seriously, someone buy the cameraman a mining helmet or something).And then there are the characters wandering through this pasteboard wasteland. The main bad guy is never seen, and never provides his rationale, rendering him beyond flimsy and certainly no threat. The main hero is similarly opaque, since the filmmakers decided obscurity would somehow seem like wisdom to the sweating masses of fanboys who elevated this dreck. The most emotionally affecting voice comes through a long flashback sequence from a character long-dead. That should tell you something about the characters.And finally, the politics: shoddy, ill-researched, and venal. All the characters we're supposed to think of as 'noble' seem motivated by the most pettily personal of reasons, with the arguable exception of the main police officer investigating V's actions. That the system would rise, then collapse so spontaneously is not only unrealistic, but irresponsible since young and foolish filmgoers are apt to mistake anarchy for freedom. My worst possible curse upon them would be that they get precisely what they ask for.Thank all Gods that may be that their safety, the arts, and the world, are in better hands than these.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A view that lacks technical appraisals, because the sensations reach beyond dogmatism, ""What is this? How can there be something so perfect in such an imperfect world?"". The shock remains until today, because the story went on to take the edges of me, of what I am, the ideas that this film conveys, freedom, truth, revenge, things of life itself.

Like it was her portraying herself instead of the character. The movie makes me want to read the book, and see for myself.

V for Vocal Political Point,"I must admit, I expected something completely different from this film. Instead of a ""Matrix-esque"" type of action film, I found myself in a political statement film. Based on a hugely popular comic book, this movie shapes the viewers into thinking about today's political society. It presents ""Ideas"" as they stated throughout the film as the beginning of regaining control of your government. Many obvious shots at the Bush administration, Bill O'Reilly, and the Fox Network as all propaganda factors for today's government. Obvious characters formed after George Bush and Dick Cheney. They also visit terrorism in all forms, and actually state "" sometimes you have to destroy a building"". Hmmmm. 9-11 reference ? Or just trying to stir the pot on what brings HATRED. Because our masked hero admits to being a MONSTER and he had so much hate. Are we supposed to have some sympathy for those who attack us ? Or just look deeper ? Why do they hate us so much. A lot to handle from one action film, but worth the price of admission.You will be disappointed if you expect all action. Some great explosions and a great grand finale showdown between the man who represents Dick Cheney, and the masked hero. Natalie Portman is superb in this by the way.An above average movie, and one that will speak volumes about the political societies today..........I'm sure each country can relate some of the factors in this film to their own government's, past and present. And the movie at the end will remind you that all this just represents an ""idea"". An idea can change history and many people will die to protect or live up to an idea. The masked hero known as ""V"" actually just represents all of us. An idealistic people who will and can demand change when we need too. Do we need too demand this change now in real life ? And don't other cultures and countries have this same right too ? The viewer is left to ponder .........",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Cute rip-off Orwell's 1984, but seriously, come on now. In the top 250 movies ever made? Excuse me as I laugh.","I can't point to a single film by the Wachowski brothers that wasn't cheesy, over-hyped, unoriginal, and just downright pathetic. I guess the first Matrix film was alright, but that's the closest they have ever gotten to deserving even half the acclaim they get from mindless ""fine cinema""-whores. Or, in other words, ""People who do not have the ability to disagree with the critics, because they have no brain to make their own judgments."" If they critics call it original and daring, they call it original and daring, even though they've seen a hundred other movies just like it. That is the only reasonable explanation I can see for the mass love for this film.Here are my ABCs of V for Vendetta: A for Annoying. The directing and camera-work are so bland and typical I felt like I was watching a children's TV show. The two main leads are okay acting, but every single secondary character, EVERY single one, are so bad at acting I occasionally had to pause the movie so I could stop and laugh. And I'm not someone who usually cares about bad actingthis was just terrible. What also annoyed me was the level of pure cheese the movie carries and sustains. Gunshots don't bleed, typical stabbings are off-screen, and even some fistfights are off screen. It just added to the children's TV show feel the directing and acting started. How did this movie get and R-rating? I've seen PG-13 movies (like Cloverfeild and The Dark Knight) that have more violence/blood than V for Vendetta. The MPAA puts this on the same level as Saw III and Hostel: Part II? Dear God, our rating system is so screwed up it's not even funny. V for Vendetta did not deserve and R-rating by any means, and I think they honestly slipped the MPAA a little cash to rate it such.B for Boring. Just so anyone out there who hasn't seen this yet knows: this is not an action movie. If anything, V for Vendetta is a political drama. There are maybe two main action sequences that last about five minutes each, and the rest of the runtime is old men rambling about terrorists. The plot is no more complex than you're standard, cliché James Bond plot: terrorist appears, and old men with guns talk about him for the majority of the movie, then in the last ten minutes when the ""climax"" starts they finally stop talking about the terrorist and try to do something. In V for Vendetta, when I say the majority, probably 95%, of the movie is nothing but repeated dialogue, I mean it literally. If you were to fast-forward through all the all talking scenes, you'd still understand the plot because it's so generic. You'd also have a fifteen-minute long movie.C for Cliché. As I said, the plot is a rip-off of the books that ripped-off 1984. Giant speakers, evil dictator, TVs used to make mass announcements, people have no freedom . . . blah, cliché, blah, blah. V leaves a rose after he kills, just like every cliché ""sentimental"" killer in movie history. The reason he wears a mask and why he seeks vengeance is also the biggest cliché in movie killer history. Also, the ""government lies"" jokes were so cliché and annoying I was about to turn it off. As if we haven't heard a thousand times that the government is evil! The movie doesn't even give the audience credit for having basic intelligence of political issues. I cannot name a single aspect of this movie that was original, or even close. The entire movie is the biggest cliché ever.Overall, V for vendetta is a waste of time. It is just a boring drama with a cliché ""moral"" that we've heard all our lives. Sure, V himself is cool for a few minutes, but when you realize the knives he carries are just a sales gimmick because there is less action than you could see walking down the street, just know I told you so.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Magnificent, Insightful and Very Entertaining - Fantastic Performances and an Intelligent Story","V for Vendetta is a thrilling and capturing film that explores issues of freedom, government control, and personal responsibility. Set in a dystopian future Britain, the film follows the story of a masked vigilante known as V, played by Hugo Weaving, who seeks to overthrow a totalitarian government and inspire the people to rise up against their oppressors.The film visually is absolutely stunning, with a dark and brooding aesthetic that perfectly captures the film's dystopian setting. The action sequences are well choreographed, and the use of slow-motion and stylized camera angles really adds to the sense of drama and tension. The score is also impressive, with a mix of classical and electronic music that complements all of the film's themes and tone.The standout performance of the film comes from Hugo Weaving, who portrays the mysterious and charismatic V fantastically. Despite being hidden behind a mask for the entirety of the film, Weaving is able to convey a wide range of emotions and create a compelling and sympathetic character without needing to show his face. Natalie Portman is also excellent as Evey, a young woman who becomes caught up in V's revolutionary plans and undergoes her own personal transformation.One of the film's strengths is its use of historical allusions and references. The film is set in a dystopian Britain that draws heavily on the historical context of Nazi Germany and the rise of fascism in Europe. The film's exploration of these themes and historical allusions adds depth and richness to the story, and helps to make it more resonant and impactful.Overall, V for Vendetta is a well-crafted and thought-provoking film that is as entertaining as it is insightful. The film's excellent performances, stunning visuals, and intelligent storytelling make it a must-see for fans of dystopian fiction, political thrillers, and action movies. While the film's themes may be challenging for some viewers, they are handled with skill and nuance, making this an important and worthwhile film that deserves to be seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Ahh, the genius of Alan Moore!","I saw this movie in 05 and loved it's message. I knew nothing of Alan Moore or Guy Fawkes...In 05 The internet exploded with DSL making its way into the homes of selected areas...2005 was the year it made it into Philadelphia and I began my journey of discovery of who we are, who the government is, our uncensored history.

A Tragic Waste,"Based on the 1980s graphic novel by Alan Moore, ""V for Vendetta"" had tremendous potential: A fabulous source book, top-notch actors, and brilliant directors. And then they blew it. The graphic novel, which was more libertarian than liberal, was very even minded, not truly siding with either point of view. It contrasted two extremes: anarchism and fascism, and let the reader decide which was preferable. Most importantly, it was most definitely about England, not America. This was their first mistake. They changed the plot to appeal to modern audience, but what they ended up doing was injecting US politics into a British story. Not nearly as even minded either, the film completely sides with the title character, who has gone from a libertarian anarchist to a liberal revolutionary. Worse still the plot line's back story is now a thinly veiled analogy of the 9/11 attacks though the eyes of conspiracy theorists. A tragic waste, considering the film's good points. The acting was phenomenal, especially Hugo Weavings, had to do the entire film masked, depriving him of the benefit of facial expression. The special effects were impressive too, reminiscent of the Wachowski Brothers work in ""The Matrix"". Unfortunately all this is lost in the poor storyline, which reduces this potentially operatic masterpiece to a sloppy political satire.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
1984 and Phantom of the Opera with PC Shlock,"Where do I begin? ""V for Vendetta"" is a fun movie, with an annoying aftertaste that gets more pronounced as you leave the theater and begin the walk home.I never read the book. I don't believe that a movie must stick to the dogma of the book that was its inspiration. It's a movie, with liabilities and assets that don't necessarily work in both mediums.It should be noted that as a right-of-center libertarian type who believes that the United States is the last hope for maintaining liberty in the world, I view things from a particular perspective.I like the concept of fighting for freedom in a repressive society. I'm not against the concept of using violence to overthrow tyranny. I don't mind borrowing themes from different movies and books. And I think that Natalie Portman is maturing into a decent actress. I don't even mind the occasional cliché, even if it pokes fun at my wonderful United States.But you know... you can't base a movie on clichés and political correctness. And that is exactly what the core theme of this movie is all about.I don't believe what I'm about to say involves spoilers and apologize if it inadvertently does, but in this flick, the villains are Christian males of European extraction, hereafter referred to as ""Pale Faces."" The film takes place in England. The United States is a warmongering trouble maker who has screwed up the world and the British Torries are a bunch of authoritarian tyrants who have turned Great Britan into a police state.In England everyone is a ""Pale Face,"" because they have expelled or killed everyone else. Naturally, the expelled Arab Moslems, West Indians and Africans were total innocents. They were in no way responsible for the violence, drug dealing and terrorism that apparently made the ""Pale Face"" majority kick out the Labor Party and vote for Torry fascists. And the British Labor Party (renoun for passing anti-free speech legislation and firearms confiscation laws) has passed from the scene.But wait folks, because it doesn't end here. Homosexual ""Pale Faces"" have been forced back into the closet and the Koran has been banned because it is a tremendously beautiful and profound work of art. Naturally, nothing is mentioned of the Bible where the Book of Psalms is generally considered to be one of the best done prose ever written. That goes well with the rapist pedophile Christian clergy that support the tyranny and are even in it's government.After all, we know that Moslem clerics are universally peaceful, never condone violence, believe in free speech, religious freedom, strenuously object to honor rapes and slowly sawing infidel's heads off like turkey legs.The only thing omitted to make this skewed scenario complete would be to have a few Jewish Doctors harvesting the organs of illegal aliens for sale in Tel Aviv. But I guess that would be too much, even for the Worchowski brothers to capitalize on. And by the way, I'm a practitioner of the Jewish faith and a military officer, so get over it.What a world! What a world! This is definitely not Kansas anymore.Up from the ashes comes a ""Pale Face"" hero in a mask. But wait a minute. He's not really a ""Pale Face,"" because diabolical genetic engineering has morphed him into a scarred and mangled ""any man"" (or ""any person"" if you wish).Natalie Portman gets her head shaved, truth and justice reigns and it can be assumed that ethnic drug dealers, terrorists and illegal aliens are invited back into England to restore civilization under a Socialist Labor government.Somebody give me a break.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Never Mind The B*ll*cks,"It's difficult to see who exactly James McTeigue's 'V For Vendetta' is aimed at. Even given that Alan Moore's complex tale has been stripped to the bone (perhaps inevitably, as otherwise we'd be looking a looong film), it's far too wordy for most action-movie audiences  and, by the same reckoning, too violent for more thoughtful patrons. There are allusions to 'America's War' in the near-past, and of how religious fundamentalism and intolerance have come to shape the dystopia represented, but these connections are astonishingly heavy handed and unsubtle. This, plus the Wachowski Brothers fondness for cod-philosophising reduces Moore's incisive wit into something more blunt and unsubtle. That said, there are a few genuinely interesting comments made about the nature of terrorism which I'm surprised survived into the final script. No wonder the Daily Mail hated it.The biggest problem is the main character, the man known as V. In the comic book world (where masks are the norm) V's blank, unchanging gaze adds to his mystery. Here, though, his only expression is vocal, a great limitation of the talents of Hugo Weaving.A Prologue  intended, quite clearly, for American consumption  explains a little of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot to destroy Parliament. To some extent I can see why this is done, as very few Yanks will have heard of Fawkes, and may wonder why our hero, V, dresses in the style of this historical character. This introduction sets the plotter up as an idealist, a crusader against injustice, which taps into part of what our hero is supposed to represent  the Freedom Fighter. It's a simplistic interpretation which does rather defeat the essential message of Moore's character and book. Fawkes wanted a new order, yes, but he fought on behalf of an authority no more democratic or tolerant than the one he sought to destroy. He also wanted vengeance on those  the Protestant King James, especially  whom he felt has persecuted his Catholic brethren. The bulk of the population considered him a terrorist  which is why his defeat is celebrated each November 5th. Moore's character is complex  recognising that Idealism, Terrorism and Vengeance are all part of the same destructive impulse. In the graphic novel V quotes, on occasion, from the Rolling Stones' 'Sympathy For The Devil', which is the best indicator of what the character represents  his own personal vendetta aside, he's an Anarchist, a catalyst for sudden and bloody change.V's 'origins' are hinted at, but by depriving us of the detail of the original source material he becomes more human, more the 'wronged man'  and, again, I can see why this was done, as audiences are expected to empathise with their hero  but it does make what he is (as opposed to who he is) less frightening. And V should be frightening. Another attempt to humanise V  the hint of romantic feeling between him and Natalie Portman's Evey  completely misfires.There are a few equally misjudged comic moments, the worst of which  a grimace-inducing 'Benny Hill' skit (more trademarked 'British' humour for the Yanks), but there are a few changes that actually work. Stephen Fry's Dietrich is virtually unrecognisable as the character from Moore's book, Dascombe, upon which it is based  but does, as a gay man masking a liberal outlook within a totalitarian regime, serve as a potent all-too-human counterpoint to our mask-wearing 'hero'. Portman's Evey is also a million miles removed from her source-character, but her screen persona is less successful than Fry's  a shame, as she could have probably made interesting work of that more ordinary, desperate Evey. For all the many changes I'm glad to say that the touching Valerie sub-plot survives intact.Tim Piggot-Smith enjoys a fine return thuggish form, and John Hurt overacts his wrinkly little head off as the Chancellor. Steven Rea is excellent as the dogged, sad detective Finch  probably the most loyal transfer of character from page to screen.Visually it has it's moments, and it is very stylish  as one would expect from the Wachowski Bros and Joel Silver - but very few of them are truly cinematic  save, perhaps, for the final Tchaikovsky accompanied scenes of Parliament, which was genuinely impressive.I was prepared to hate this film with a fiery passion, but didn't. It wasn't  to use what the scriptwriters seem to think is the only British expletive  'b*ll*cks', but it has no real excuse for not being considerably better, given that so many of the plot changes were so unnecessary. It's the best adaptation, thus far, of any Alan Moore subject  though given how bad 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' and 'From Hell' were, that's not saying much. That said, it is seriously flawed, and most of those flaws arise out of a basic misunderstanding of the nature of the central character.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

There were several elements to this movie that I enjoyed. One of the biggest elements throughout this movie is the theme of fighting for freedom, against your government. In the movie, we see how the government seems very controlling, which is the reason why Vendetta is doing what he is doing as he attempts to take down the government. I do not want to spoil the movie, but I will say the director of the movie has done a great job in the way he portrays the comic, and how the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Everyone must see this provocative but important movie.,"V for Vendetta explores one man's courage to stand up to a government that continues to isolate its constituency. Not unlike the Frodo character in Lord of the Rings, V is one insignificant human that inspires a nation and changes the course of its history. Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) plays the enshrouded V, who, within the course of a year turns the tide of a fascist and oppressive dictatorship. On a more symbolic level, the movie reminds viewers how seemingly insignificant violations of liberty can lead toward the consolidation of power.On a historical note, one need only know a tad bit of British history to really appreciate the metaphor behind the lead character V.The Facts: Guy Fawkes (April 14, 1570January 31, 1606) was an English soldier and a member of a group of Roman Catholic conspirators who attempted to carry out the so-called Gunpowder Plot in 1605. The plot was an attempt to assassinate King James I of England (James VI of Scotland) and the members of both houses of the Parliament of England. To do this, Westminster Palace was to be blown up during the formal opening session of the 1605 Parliament, in which the king would address a joint assembly of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Guy Fawkes was in large part responsible for the later stages of the plan's execution. His activities were detected, however, before the plan's completion. Following a severe interrogation involving the use of torture, Fawkes and his co-conspirators were executed for treason and attempted murder. Guy Fawkes is remembered with Guy Fawkes Night on November 5",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
You don't have to cover your face to wear a mask...,"""V For Vendetta"" is a 2005 comic book drama directed by James McTeigue starring Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. As it is sort of a holiday for cinephiles and most of us tend to rewatch it on that particular date, I tried to give it a first time watch myself this year, but unfortunately I had to postpone it due to a punk concert I've visited instead, but now - a few days later - coincidentally on a date that bears a tremendous political importance in Germany, I finally got to see it. So I think this will make it up to it. First of all, this film shows us a dystopian society that has a lot in common with several classic novels. Unfortunately though, there's not enough to it that makes it distinct, it's not as well elaborated as I hoped it would be. There's no explanation of why it happened and doesn't offer any chance to learn about the circumstances. But that's only a minor flaw. What I think was excellently done is the dialogue and the meaning behind every single line. It's so tremendously intelligent and thought provoking and the choice of words is only superb. It effects the viewer to intensively think about the own society one lives in. Furthermore, it's alarming to see how the corrupt government misuses the media for their own, misleading interests and how it is close to it's real-life counterpart at times. It's actually sad to say that the reality doesn't always differ from what is depicted in here. Next to this, the sensational cast really shows that it has top-class actors and actresses in its ranks, especially Portman and Weaving (is it even him, though? Serious question) and it's stylishly filmed and captured the essence of the graphic novel very well. It doesn't recoil to tackle highly inconvenient topics, such as propaganda, mistreatment of human beings and media and the abuse of power. Also, it offers a lot of highly quotable exclamations, but there's still one big issue that prevents it from being a masterpiece: The narrative structure. The film is way to long in general and it has too many scenes that should have been either cut or shortened, but as they are still in the final cut, they perturb the storytelling tremendously. The absolutely well worded scenes and following actions would have had way more impact and would have striked the chord way more unpleasantly if it didn't have so many lengths in it. The buildup of tension was immensely disrupted my multiple scenes that simply lasted to long and, as harsh as it sound, made the tension vanish on several occasions. Each time it seemed to reach the perfect level again, it failed to do so. After seeing this happen a few time it was frustrating. The final act though redeemed the overall unbalanced second act and showed the brilliance it had in the first act. Additionally, it didn't reach the emotional depth I was hoping to see, but that's just mentioned casually. All in all, this dystopian drama knows what it stands for and offers the right approaches, appropriate performances and twists and extremely intelligent lines, besides the disastrous storytelling it's an enjoyable and important flick that makes us reflect our own view to our own society. It's no masterpiece and it's such a pity that it had so much potential to be one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Vindication in Vigilance,"""V for Vendetta,"" directed by James McTeigue and based on Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel, is a riveting and thought-provoking dystopian thriller that resonates with contemporary relevance. Set in a totalitarian future Britain, the film follows the enigmatic vigilante known only as V, portrayed with magnetic charisma by Hugo Weaving, as he seeks to overthrow the oppressive regime through acts of revolutionary violence.At its core, ""V for Vendetta"" is a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of individual liberty. McTeigue skillfully crafts a world that feels both eerily familiar and chillingly plausible, drawing parallels to real-world political movements and societal trends. The film's themes of government surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of civil liberties strike a chord with audiences, prompting reflection on the nature of democracy and the responsibilities of citizenship.Visually, ""V for Vendetta"" is stunning, with its iconic imagery and striking cinematography lending a sense of grandeur and urgency to the narrative. From the rain-soaked streets of London to the shadowy corridors of power, McTeigue creates a dystopian landscape that is as bleak as it is beautiful.But it's the film's characters that truly elevate it to greatness. Weaving's performance as V is nothing short of mesmerizing, his gravelly voice and masked visage imbuing the character with a sense of mystery and gravitas. Natalie Portman delivers a powerful portrayal of Evey Hammond, a young woman whose journey from apathy to activism mirrors the film's larger themes of personal transformation and political awakening.""V for Vendetta"" is more than just a political thriller; it's a rallying cry for resistance and resilience in the face of tyranny. Through its gripping story, rich symbolism, and unforgettable characters, the film inspires audiences to question authority, challenge injustice, and never lose sight of the power of individual agency.In conclusion, ""V for Vendetta"" is a masterpiece of modern cinema, a film that transcends its genre trappings to deliver a powerful and timely message about the enduring struggle for freedom and justice. With its blend of action, drama, and social commentary, it stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling to inspire change and provoke thought.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

From the start to the end you are given a clear view of a world you can see forming around us today.I have no doubt that I will be carrying this movie with me for sometime to come. It is at once disturbed and elegant. It brings into clear focus how people can let their fear make them victims of those who claim to protect them.Hugo Weaving shines through mask, cape and gloves, giving a performance few actors could give to a character created originally for a comic. He gives it a solidity and sense of vitality that left me breathless.Natalie Portman, shines equally as bright in her role. Other people will give you a better description of her transformation in the movie. But I believe she is well on her way to being a award winning actress for many years to come.I do expect the Academy awards to give this movie serious thought for awards. It was done with just the right amount of special effects. To help you enjoy the high energy moments all the more so.I give 2 hands way way up for this move.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Initially a jab at Margret Thatcher, Applies to the US all too well...","This is not your average mindless action flick. This movie deals with several hot button issues, such as racial and religious discrimination (specially post 9-11) terrorism versus freedom fighters, and the trade off of personal freedom for safety. Naturally, there are slight exaggerations , but once you think about it, its not really that big of a stretch, seeing where we are heading and the latest political news. The action scenes were entertaining, with some nice cinematography. I had never heard of the comic books, yet the story managed to draw me in. While at times I thought the film nearly approached one too many twists, it never actually went overboard, and was very entertaining throughout.

"An amazing film, very appropriate","I was reluctant to see the film, too many release delays, and being burned on too many recent bad comic films: Punisher, Aeon Flux, UltraViolet... but I went to see this film based on overwhelmingly good comments. I must say it is perfect. The film is the best comic book film ever, perfect casting, flawless writing, superbly acted, perfectly lit and filmed, the soundtrack was genius and the direction was art. Most of all the timing of the film could not be better. It is 2015 and England is under the rule of a totalitarian dictatorship very 1984 / Brazil, it seems the eventual evolution of what the US government is becoming, our rights being freely given away in the name of security. Fear is the greatest currency of all. The film is about revolution and the power of ideals. WIth all that is going on in the US now, I am thrilled that this movie could be made, and that it was made as Oscar worthy as this one is.

A few notes on how I enjoyed this film.,"There aren't a lot of movies that I care to watch. Too boring, too gory, or just plain stupid. This is not one of them.V for Vendetta, is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I got the DVD and watched it three times. I could watch this movie forever.Best love story, best action, best plot, and the acting was outstanding.You hated Hugo Weaving in the Matrix, but you will love him in this.

Excellent in every way,"If you are having doubts about this movie, I highly suggest overcoming them. I had expected it to be an action movie cashing in on the political anarchy theme in the shallowest of way. After seeing that it had led the box office all weekend, I gave it a shot. I was definitely happy with my decision. The movie contains a deep and complex story of a futuristic Britain, lending to political satire of current leadership as well as fully developed characters. The plot never had a dull moment and no holes to count. Also, the action was exciting in the style of the first matrix. Rarely does an action movie invoke so many different emotions. The witty comedy, well written screenplay, deep sympathy for the characters, and flashy action comes together in a way no other movie has in quite some time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"An Unexpected Surprise, No Doubt Will Win NO Honors With Hollywood","I chose to see this movie based only on the trailer that I saw when I went to 'The Hills Have Eyes' and knew nothing at all about it. I must say though that it will probably rank as one of the best, if not the best, movie of 2006 (for me, that is.) I'll admit to being somewhat of a conspiracy theorist, and also admit to being rather mistrustful of our (US - G W H Bush) government. This movie though, should serve as a warning to all that may chose to give up 'liberties' to gain some vague 'security.' The totalitarian regime depicted in this movie isn't really all that far off from some that are currently in power in several so-called 'free' countries and we really must maintain vigilance that our leaders do not gain the powers that the leaders in this movie have gained.I won't give anything away here, but I strongly urge ANYONE who is concerned with civil liberties and free will to see this movie and to recommend it to all their friends.Writing this review a full five days after viewing, I still must give this film a complete (and totally out of character for me) ten out of ten, not for any acting, directing, or editing, but simply because I feel that it conveys a very valuable message that ALL people who value their hard-earned freedoms should take heed. Our founding fathers would probably love this movie, much as I did.Enjoy!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It will make you believe...,"This is probably the most powerful movie I have ever seen and definitely one of the best movies I have seen in the past year (this is counting 2005). From the previews I thought it would be awesome and being a comic book geek I've been eagerly awaiting it for almost a year. Now normally when something gets hyped up like that there is no way it can live up to your expectations, but this simply went above and beyond them.The movie's theme is not original, in fact it's basically the sequel of 1984 (both movies cast John Hurt as well, though in completely different roles), but that's not important. I love movies that are all about governments going too far and the people finally standing up to them. It inspires me to believe that we can really make a difference in our world, but I've never seen a movie with this theme that has moved me so much. Yes, it's moved me so much that I have begun to use clichés in order to explain my feelings towards it.""I laughed, I cried, it moved me Bob.""There were a few things that rubbed me the wrong way, like Natalie Portman's accent. Now, I have nothing against Natalie Portman, I love her in fact. I think she is a great actor and I think she did an incredible job in this movie, but her accent just sounded really fake. I suppose we can't win 'em all... I also wasn't entirely sure if I liked some of the director's (James McTeigue) choices in the fight scenes. In the last action scene with V vs. Creedy and his goons they made it look like a comic book which in turn made it look a little too Matrixy for my taste, but I still think it was a cool scene.I recommend that you go and watch this movie in the theatres, because it is most certainly worth the money and if you are reading this too late to do that, go and buy the DVD.

A Memorable Movie.,"V For Vendetta was one of the best modern day movies I have seen. Very mysterious movie, but a thriller as well. The movie starts off with a young lady walking alone at night, however there is a curfew and she was captured by 3 members of the government in a dark alley. Then like most typical action movies someone always saves the beautiful woman from the bad guys. Well, the main character, V, appears and saves the woman. The woman falls for V and V also falls for the woman himself. There is much more, However, I do not want to ruin the rest of the movie for you. This is a must see movie, if you haven't seen it already, then i suggest you rent it or even buy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A bang from start to finish,"I went to see this film with average expectations. The trailers were there, the posters were there but was it really going to be all that good. Well I can safely say it was, I was glued to my seat. When I wasn't listening intently to every syllable coming from the mouth of the hero V, I was delighted with exciting fight sequences and a few explosions which left me feeling nothing less than liberated. When someone informed me that Hugo Weaving would have the mask on throughout the entire film I was concerned that the character would never be able to connect with an audience at all never mind portray strong emotions, key to such a character and I believed I would quickly loose interest. However Weaving managed to keep me extremely intrigued by V. Something I could never have imagined possible without having seen it done. Weaving has a charisma perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else playing V so well. The other actors also kept me interested in every character that came across the screen, especially John Hurt who I thoroughly enjoyed hating. Natalie Portman was a joy to watch. Although her British accent wasn't so fantastic her presence on screen more than makes up for it. The non-conventional theme of fascist governments and terrorist hero's may not be for everybody but I certainly found this film one of the most entertaining things I've seen in a long time.

V for vendetta review,I think that the movie was really good. It makes you think what if? and I like that not a lot of movies do that today. V is also futuristic but no in the way the Matrix was. I am so enthralled with the movie that I have chosen it as my last topic speech in my college Communocations class. I think that it is high time to address some harsh topics of the past and present so that people understand why present day is what it is. V is the man! I thik that more people should go and see this movie. If you haven't read the graphic novel on V please do. It is very good and it will tell you more of V's story.

Amazing,"There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said already. The acting is unbelievable, the characters and their dialogue are brilliantly written, the plot is deep and thought-provoking without being confusing, and the special effects are jaw-dropping without being oppressive. The best effects in the entire move are actually the ones that required no computer animation or modern technology; fans of classic movies will notice such devices as low-key music, camera angles, and background noise fading into silence all being used masterfully. I saw this movie on a Friday night, opening weekend, in a cinema packed with over 300 other people. Not one person moved or talked for the last 30 minutes of the film; we all sat in stupefied silence, utterly spellbound by this powerful movie.Ironically, one of the major theme of this movie is that intelligence is perhaps the strongest weapon in the world. This is ironic because all of the people frantically blaming this movie for religious or political reasons are the ones that misinterpreted it. My advice to anyone that has not seen it is to go do so right now, but leave personal prejudices outside the cinema and enjoy an experience that is as poignant as it is absolutely mind-blowing.Oh, this is off-topic, but I thought someone might want to know that the IMDb spellchecker will try and ""correct"" several words even if they are spelled correctly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Fun fact: John Hurt who played the Big Brother esque Adam Suttler also played Winston Smith- the hero of 1984.This was a great film. It has particular relevance in today's society and it has some great performance particularly by Hugo Weaving as V.

Prognosticates the future of freedom...,"I went into the theatre to watch this movie expecting an action flick of the likes of the matrix. However, V for Vendetta more than surprised me with its direct comment on the politics of dictatorship, censorship and intellectual slavery.The movie is a comment on the growing shackles that governments the world over are imposing on their citizens. I personally believe that we are less free than we were about 10-15 years ago. The events that have shaped the past decade have allowed governments to justify intense curbs on freedom the world over in reality.Although the movie might not appeal to your average person who doesn't pay much attention to what is going on in the world, it does present a dramatic (though a little overstated) history of the near future in which the government takes over private liberty in the name of security. It also makes a subtle comment on how propaganda is used as a weapon, though the movie doesn't fully recognize its potential.Vendetta goes on to show that the power of a thought, sparked off by a single person is enough to return freedom to a nation.Overall, I think the movie presents a message to the people who see it, a message that we are being fettered each day with greater curbs. A message that we need to awake to the way the world is being shaped at this very moment and respond before it is too late.Quite inspiring.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V is the greatest,"I think V for Vendetta is a truly great film. It is one of the best films to be released in the last 2-3 years. The plot is different, makes people think and provides good plot, characters and action. Altho bits from the comic, I feel, could have been introduced into the film. Like Dominics transformation to the new role of V leading the people of London. Perhaps they felt they should not corrupt the film with a sequel, I know that Alan Moore the original writer was unimpressed with the film project and left, so perhaps it was in kindness to him. I think it is ignorant to pick up the small things in the film that are perhaps wrong. I see people writing about how people in the UK never say elevator, course they do, just because you don't say it. Hugo Weaving as the lead role does seem to suit him, his voice is superb, but still it would be interesting to see how James Purefoys voice would have sounded behind the mask. Natalie Portmans acting was also very good, I can see where people are coming from on her accent but she still did a good job, portraying emotions. Just my thoughts!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the best big budget blockbusters to come out of Hollywood in years.","""V for Vendetta"" takes place in the future when Britain is in a fascist state. The people of Britain are no longer free to stand up for themselves and are being controlled by their government. The story begins when a girl named Evy (Natalie Portman) is attacked in an alley way and a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving) appears and saves her life. V's goal is to help Britain reclaim its independence and V will stop at nothing in order to help his fellow citizens' rise up and take back the rights that were taken away from them. But Evy is a key part to this story as it's up to her to discover the truth about V and herself in order to bring freedom back to a society that is overruled with cruelty, fear, lies and corruption. A great movie ensuesWow! Why can't all big budget mainstream films be as good as ""V for Vendetta""? I literally think this movie is one the best mainstream films to come out in the last 5 years. The movie not only contains some great special effects and action sequences but also a well written thought-provoking script and some great performances. Finally, Hollywood has made a film that is a perfect mix of both an independent film (great writing and acting) and a mainstream film (great action sequences and special effects).""V for Vendetta"" is a film that surely didn't disappoint me at all. The thing most movies like this lack is good acting and a half way decent plot. Not this movie, this movie is golden with a great plot and great acting. I think the main problem with Hollywood movies is that they lack one element or the other. When watching this film, you are hooked to it from the opening credits all the way till the end. The special effects are solid and aren't overused like in ""The Matrix sequels"" or ""King Kong"". There is enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film. The movie keeps its audience both excited to see what happens next but it also keeps them thinking which is rare for a big budget movie.At times, ""V for Vendetta"" seems to hit a little too close to home. Certain events the film addresses such as the fear element and government cover-ups don't seem like fiction at all anymore. I think this movie allows us to be entertained but also question what is going on in our world as well. It's a movie that provides everything that a normal Hollywood movie will contain special effects, action, a fictional hero but it also contains some realistic and thought-provoking ideas that many films of this nature don't normally produce.This movie was directed by James McTeigue, a man who worked as assistant director on ""The Matrix Trilogy"". For being a first time director, this guy has the skills to pay the bills. Maybe the Wachowski Brothers helped him out but regardless he did an amazing job capturing all the excitement moments and the emotions of the characters. There are several amazing scenes in this film that just blew my mind including the final scene.The Wachowski Brothers wrote the script for this amazing movie and I guess this movie can serve as their apology for the 2nd and 3rd Matrix which I deem as really bad films considering the first one was a Hollywood masterpiece and a one of a kind film.As far as the acting goes, I am falling in love with Natalie Portman all over again. Her acting in this movie is superb. Her character is likable, realistic and believable. She has really come a long way since her career in film began. Her roles in ""Closer"", ""Garden State"" and now ""V for Vendetta"" prove that she has the ability to be one of the new leading ladies in Hollywood. Although Hugo Weaving's face is not seen during the film, I still feel the man did an excellent job as V. Even though he wears a mask during the entire film, you can still feel the emotions his character is feeling. It was a job well done. Stephen Rea also did an incredible job as Finch, the detective who was trying to solve the case of Code name V during the entire movie. He gave a fine performance. And finally all the rest of the supporting cast was great too. Everyone in this film did a great job.So In Conclusion, if you're tired of seeing a big budget action movie that is all special effects and no substance, go see ""V for Vendetta"". If you like movies that have good stories go see ""V for Vendetta"". If you like movies in general you will probably like ""V for Vendetta."" It's a rare movie that so many audiences alike can enjoy and unlike most big budget films you can actually leave your brain on during it. It's an amazing feat by Hollywood and I can't wait to see it again. It's truly the first great movie of 2006. Let's just hope they don't ruin it with a sequel.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""V for Vendetta"" is 9/10. A big budget blockbuster that really delivers!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The dialogue is smart. I have seen so many action movies where the dialogue is dull and this is not one of them. The action is sensible and clean. No gratuitous violence, which is refreshing. I do not even know if I would call it an action movie. It is a movie about human nature, about government, about oppression, and about freedom. It shows the viewer what is important.

An Uncompromising Vision Of The Future,"A vehemently crafted, voraciously told & vigorously acted cinematic vessel with a valuable & vivified voice that's as vital as it is vengeful, V for Vendetta presents an uncompromising vision of a vile future our increasingly venomous world already appears to be veering towards, and is one of the finest examples of its kind.Vicariously scripted by the Wachowskis & valiantly directed by James McTeigue in what's his directorial debut, this vividly visualised voyage of a vigilante who veneers his visage with veil, vanquishes virulent vermin of society & incites a revolution with vehicles of violence, is balanced in ways that most films of its genre never aspire to.Volatile yet vigilant from its opening scene, the film benefits immensely from Hugo Weaving's viciously charismatic performance despite only utilising his vox, and the veteran actor's voice alone vouchsafes life & soul into his vindictive character while his vacant veiled attire compels us to view him as the embodiment of an idea rather than an individual.Natalie Portman's input is just as valuable while John Hurt chips in with a volcanic work in his villainous role. The execution of technical aspects is sound throughout. Cinematography envelops the images with a bleak tone & dismal aura to illustrate life under totalitarian rule while taut editing, variegated score & brisk velocity make the viewing experience more intense & visceral.On an overall scale, V for Vendetta viciously combines elements of cautionary tale, politically charged drama & action extravaganza into a visually stunning & thought-provoking cinema that provides a voice to the voiceless, and is a valid & vociferous reminder that every society has the vim n vigour to dismantle any venal regime that violates its volition. Much more relevant today than it was at its time of release, this dystopian political thriller is by all means an essential viewing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great movie,"""V for Vendetta"" is a captivating cinematic experience that seamlessly weaves political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and intense action. The film, set in a dystopian future, explores themes of authoritarianism and resistance, drawing parallels to our own societal struggles. Hugo Weaving's enigmatic performance as V, shrouded in a Guy Fawkes mask, is truly mesmerizing.Natalie Portman's portrayal of Evey complements the narrative, showcasing her character's evolution from vulnerability to resilience. The film's visual aesthetics are striking, with the iconic Guy Fawkes mask becoming an enduring symbol of rebellion. The narrative's intricate layers keep viewers engaged, prompting reflection on the balance between order and freedom.However, the film occasionally falters in pacing, with certain scenes feeling drawn out. Despite this, the overall impact of the story and its relevance to contemporary issues elevate ""V for Vendetta"" to a thought-provoking cinematic experience. With its compelling characters, thoughtfully crafted plot, and powerful symbolism, the film earns a solid 7 out of 10, making it a must-watch for those who appreciate politically charged narratives with a touch of theatrical flair.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

After watching a behind the scenes clip a few nights ago, I had to see it and I am extremely happy that I did. The movie goes along the lines of Brave New World, 1984 and Animal Farm, and takes an interesting look at the world of ""what if""... What if your country came under complete control of one man? What if every citizen gave into his control out of fear? What if one man's tortured past was the only way that he could see the totalitarian rule as a bad thing? And what if this one man was the only person that could change the world for the better? Beautifully filmed and magnificent dialogue moves this movie along. An underground cavern filled with priceless works of art that chronicles the world's history. And a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask who outwardly shows no emotion, but with excellent lighting we see every emotion that he truly has.

excellent & thought-provoking,"An interesting forecast of events which reflect very clearly the dangers of 1939-45 which might have been presaged in 1933 with a little more attention. Makes you wary of the danger of incremental power accretions while providing an entertaining and emotive experience. Natalie Portman was finally given a role in which she could flex some acting muscles after the disasters that were her lines in Star Wars and Hugo Weaving excels at imparting emotion without having to reveal his face - acting with only his voice, he demonstrated a real appreciation of his craft and testified to the potency of words alone. There were certainly some scenes inappropriate for children and yet there were also scenes that need to be seen, images of things that might have happened, could be happening and are likely to happen so long as the public remains acquiescent. Although the movie preys on current fears and worst-case scenarios, it is well to remember that it is a commentary on the potency of fear as a weapon of power, and not confined to the specifics of contemporary environments. The movie made good use of evocative symbolism, music and dialog as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
poignant and subtle in its attack on the US,"Was V justified in his actions? The movie portrayed him as a just vigilante.

The similarities are staggering, however, we do not accept the actions of Iraqis because they are not ""film-friendly"" and are not fully understood by Western culture. V wasn't perfect in all of his actions, neither are others...try to re-watch this movie and detect the similarities...the sidebar news reports regarding the ""new U.S.A."" further the premise that they are headed for a similar fate as London, in the form of foreshadowing.Loads of fun, though.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I liked it... when I was a kid,"This movie highlights the seed of cultural decay in 2024.""Being gay is normal"" in 2005 has turned into ""LGBT everywhere, including in schools and video games, gender fluidity is real, people are obsessed with pronouns, you are a bigot if you don't date a trans person"" in 2024.""Poor guy was arrested for having a Quran"" in 2005 has turned into ""the Islamization of Europe and criticism only towards Christians"" in 2024 (I'm agnostic, btw).""We should welcome all immigrants"" in 2005 has turned into ""the crisis of refugees invading Europe and demanding free stuff"" in 2024.""The fight against fascism"" in 2005 has turned into ""Antifa committing gratuitous violence"" in 2024.""Political protest"" in 2005 has turned into ""disrespect for a country's history and the complete demonization of the past"" in 2024.So what's the appeal of this movie?Obviously, a tyranical regime is bad. Unfortunately, the movie mixes some valid arguments with progressive propaganda and blaming conservative views. ""Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young, up-and-coming politician. He's a deeply religious man and a member of the Conservative Party"".There is a specific appeal to the idea of a ""revolution"". It's the same drive that make people go skydiving: adrenaline. I wouldn't say revolutions are ""fun"", but they do present a certain charm, especially for young people. They give purpose, a reason to fight. The will and need to fight for something is embedded in the human condition. It has accompanied humankind throughout its history.Another positive point for this movie: The action is nice and the main character is pretty cool. He knows how to fight, he is intelligent and has a moral compass, which is always appreciated.However, he does something very questionable at some point. But it's not like the movie tries to start a discussion around his actions, asking the viewer if he really is a ""hero"" or justified in his actions. He is clearly portrayed in a heroic manner.

Republicans won't like this movie,"Make no mistake, this is a politically motivated movie. If you are one of the dwindling number of people who still support George Bush, don't waste your money and time. You would probably think that V for Vendetta is rubbish. On the other hand, if you liked ""Syriana"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck"", it's a safe bet that you'll like this one. This movie shows that democratic institutions are no protection against totalitarianism if the people of a country are willing to trade their civil liberties for security. It shows where America could be headed if the president is allowed to continue to consolidate his power and ignore the laws of the land, all in the name of security.So much for the message, is the movie any good? Surprisingly, yes. I was not expecting much based on the previews and the mixed reviews. I just couldn't imagine enjoying a movie with ""V"" in the title and a main character who wears a mask the whole time. But my son likes Natalie Portman, so my wife and I took him to see it.I'm glad we did. The movie grabbed me from the start and got better as it went along. This is one of Natalie Portman's best performances and she has never looked more beautiful. Hugo Weaving makes a good intellectual hero despite the fact that he has to act without ever showing his face. That outlandish mask didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. The directing is good. McTeigue has a particularly effective street scene at the end of the movie. I liked the unpredictability of the plot. It has some totally unexpected twists. Sure, the movie is overly dramatic, but given that the stakes are so high, that didn't bother me.If you are worried about the future of America or if you are apolitical and want to see a thinking person's action flick, I can highly recommend V for Vendetta.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

One of the most underrated comic book movies of all-time!,"V for Vendetta is the movie that I thought was a great comic book because at first, a lot of people attended this film to be the biggest joke ever released in theaters, but after the film was released, I saw the film for the first time on DVD and then I watched a few times of FX and they still show it on TV today.The film follows an anarchist freedom fighter named V, who attempts to ignite a revolution against the brutal fascist regime that has subjgated the dystopian United Kingdom and exterminated it's opponents in concentration camps.A girl named Evey, a working class girl caught in V's mission and the detective Finch leads a desperate quest to stop V.The film has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; libertarians and anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. The film was originally scheduled for release by Warner Bros. Pictures on Friday November 4, 2005 (which was a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night), but it was delayed and was released on Marrch 17, 2006 to positive critical reception and box office success.I liked the story and screenplay by The Wachowski Brothers, who directed and wrote The Matrix Trilogy, Speed Racer, Jupiter Ascending and Cloud Atlas and the dialogue is just wonderful on screen.The cinematography is good and I have to give credit to the late Adrian Biddle for doing such a fantastic great job. The music by Dario Marianelli is just spectacular and amazing. The action sequences are just spectacular and my favorite scene at the end and it was amazing.The acting is amazing. Hugo Weaving plays V and he does good and I liked him in the Matrix films as Agent Smith and he is good as the vigilante and he is spectacular with Natalie Portman in his scenes. Natalie Portman plays Evey and she is good as she was as Padme in the STAR WARS prequel trilogy and her performance along with Weaving is really amazing.The supporting cast includes Stephen Rea as Finch and he is amazing, Rupert Graves as Dominic Stone and John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler and they all done a good job in their roles that they are in.Overall, while I was scared that V FOR VENDETTA would be stupid as hell, it turned out to be one of the best comic book films ever made.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Amazing Characters, Brilliant Action and a Tremendous Story","Remember remember the fifth of November When I first watched V for Vendetta I didn't know much about it. However I have always had a fascination with darker comic book movies such as The Crow and some of the Batman's. I am going start by saying that the character of V played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving is one of those characters that will be remembered and is an instance classic. This in truth is 1 of my favourite Natalie Portman performances, she is just so full of determination and curiosity and it's infectious. The scene where V and Evey first meat is truly tremendous. V saves Evey from some men trying to rough her up, she does hold her ground, V shows off some kick ass moves and a very versatile vocabulary (see what I did there). One of favourite things about V is he is an antihero yet he still views himself as a sort of freedom fighter who is standing up for the opposing government. The reason why I love this movie so much is the true determination to do what is right and the casualties that had to happen. V was a broken body but a free soul that wanted to make a difference and he did so. Was everything planned, I don't know but all I know is this movie is a must watch and truly is amazing",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A comic book that acts like a novel.,"V for Vendetta is a continuation of the modern super-hero movies. In which the protagonists are not superman like characters who are invincible. Beside one slightly unrealistic scene towards the end V is completely human. Much like the heroes of Spider-Man and the recent Batman Begins.Looking at the movie after it was finished and considering everything that has happened I came to the realization that V for Vendetta really had everything. It was thrilling, taut action, snappy dialogue, and a distinct lack of plot holes. The pacing is brutal, which helps maintain the level of suspense. It would seem if you only read this part of the review that I would give V for Vendetta a 10 out of 10. But alas V for Vendetta is not perfect.To be honest at times V for Vendetta is incredibly pretentious. The romance between Natalie Portman and V is contrived and is unnecessary. The middle portion of the movie (a.k.a. the torture part) lags and when you think about what's happened in that sequence after the scene is over you will see how insane the entire situation was.Overall V for Vendetta is a solid movie. It has some flaws but stays solid through the final explosive scene.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Truly a postmodern masterpiece,"After seeing this film Thursday night, I have had a few days to really think about it. Overall, it is easily one of the best films I have ever seen. The character of V is one of the best portrayed characters I have seen in a while in a film. Through his very loose body language and Shakespearean language, he is acted out perfectly by Hugo Weaving. V was a bit frightening at times as well. Though he was masked the entire film, it was still easy to see his emotions and really feel what he was feeling. You know you have a great character when this happens. The character of Evey was portrayed perfectly by Natalie Portman. I was a bit skeptical of her being in this at first, but she quickly made me over come that and stunned me on screen with one of her best performances.

"Decent, but not as good as heralded","V for Vendetta is an interesting movie in the sense that it features both superhero blockbuster action, as well as a political message. The political message is not subtle: it warns of the dangers of power abuse resulting from people's political indifference. Sadly, the hero's path to political action is one of violence and rebellion. The parallels between current American policies in the name of ""freedom"" and ""righteousness"" and the totalitarian British state are remarkable. The scenes greatly remind me of Michael Radford's 1984, especially the prison and torture scenes. The use of humour attempts to make the movie lighter and it does, but I find it to be unnecessary and resulting to occasionally stupid and out of place dialogue. The superhero part of the movie is not much better even though the director puts a valiant effort to develop the hero's character. Alas, V is no Batman but he definitely has a more romantic and intellectual air to it. An overall good effort which could be much better if the production was more serious. Natalie Portman performs remarkably but her script could be better; when dressed as a school girl (admittedly a provocatively pleasant sight) everyone in the cinema erupted in laughter which showed how flawed the movie was. My rating, a critical 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Adolescent and boring,"This film plays well to those of us who have already made their minds up concerning current events(that certain governments are evil). So what? Government gets away with all kinds of bad things, no matter who runs the show.Aside from this, this movie reminded me a lot of ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" in its negligent desire to reach a more mature audience. I am tired of ""R"" rated films for adolescent mentalities. Young minds are easy to propagandize, especially with easily digestible, non-thinking, fiery slop. Since the story comes from a comic book, maybe it is just for the the intellectually lazy.There are better films that portray similar ideas. ""Brazil"" and ""1984"" are such endeavors. They are far more frightening in their depiction of evil police states.But ideas can be whispered and still change the world.

A Very Hollywood Revolution,"V for Vendetta begins with quite a spectacle: a mysterious masked man with a penchant for alliteration saves a young woman (Evey, played by Natalie Portman) from being raped by a gang of secret policemen. He whisks her to the rooftops of London to put on a show he has prepared. Suddenly, the street fills with the sound of the 1812 Overture and the Old Bailey explodes, with fireworks shooting up into the air.Written by the Wachowski brothers and directed by their protégé and former assistant director James McTiegue, V for Vendetta is based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd (although Moore has distanced himself from the film). In a near-future London, a fascist government led by Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has arisen from the ashes of a War on Terror that has seen the USA collapse into civil war and disorder and Britain devastated by a mysterious biological warfare attack. Sutler's regime has a little bit of everything: the 'Big Brother' style surveillance that one can gradually see popping up in London today through CCTV cameras, a Fox News-style media outlet (complete with a British version of Bill O'Reilly), a strong dislike of gays and Muslims, and for good measure, the traditional icons of old-school Euro-fascism (big red and black flags, etc).Pitted against the Government is V (Hugo Weaving), a vigilante in a Guy Fawkes mask who promises that in one year, his revolution will reach its climax as he completes Fawkes' original goal in 1605 by blowing up Parliament. The government immediately begins searching for V and his new accomplice Evey with an investigation headed up by a weary Scotland Yard chief inspector (Stephan Rea). As the police work to track down V, who is causing havoc all over the place, the inspector pieces together the puzzle: V is hunting down the staff of a concentration camp that seems to have disappeared from all government and military archives. As the clock ticks closer to Guy Fawkes day on the 5th of November, V's plans are set in motion as the police struggle to keep up.There's a lot to like about V for Vendetta. Despite resorting to some obvious choices (the Chancellor appears only on a giant screen projected into a black, cavernous room and the regime's red and black crucifix-style symbol hangs everywhere), the movie looks stunning. And the performances from Weaving (masked the entire film), Portman and the supporting cast are all excellent.Ultimately, V for Vendetta's problem is that it takes the easy road. It boldly claims to ask the question whether one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, but then robs the audience of a legitimate choice. V is not a terrorist. He doesn't terrorize anyone. Instead, he seems to deliberately avoid directly harming civilians at all. V attacks and kills the guilty: concentration camp governors, corrupt and deviant enforcers, brutal secret police officers. He seeks only for some kind of return of Britain's liberal democratic traditions. The government, on the other hand, seems to lack any support from the people (who swap over to V's side as soon as they see him), murders its citizens by the thousands and clamps down on all that is good in the world. Is there ever any doubt as to whether we should root for V? Or whether his methods are justified? V for Vendetta clearly wants to be more than an action movie. It wants to be an allegory about the War on Terror and the erosion of civil liberties that comes with it. It wants to be a shout of political frustration about the way the West is headed. It wants to be a macabre celebration of people power. But the whole thing seems too sanitized, too easy, too Hollywood. For a movie that tries so very hard to be controversial, it winds up being some of the best mainstream entertainment so far this year.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I see that it was produced by the Wachowski's which really doesn't surprise me. Although this movie is not as groundbreaking, spectacular, or mind breaking as The Matrix it's still has an incredible mind opening message. I think this movie shows us. There really is no villain except the ones we create within our own minds. And limitations and boundaries we place on ourselves out of fear.

Does fascism justify terrorism?,"In the near future, after the United States collapses and England is plagued by a biological terror attack, a Christian fundamentalist (John Hurt) is elected chancellor, and immediately enforces Nazi-esquire restrictions and curfews. He creates a propaganda ministry which controls all media, and a secret police called the fingermen.Evey (Natalie Portman) is an aspiring actress who works as an assistant at the state-run TV station. One night, she is accosted by three fingermen. Out of the shadows comes a mysterious man (Hugo Weaving) wearing a cape and a Guy Fawkes mask, and referring to himself only as V. He is trained in hand-to-hand fighting and speaks poetically and articulately.The following morning, he attacks the TV station where Evey works. He forces them to play a DVD, in which he explains his admiration for Guy Fawkes, his grievances with the government, and his intention to do what Fawkes failed to accomplish 400 years ago: blow up Parliament. Feeling obligated to help the vigilante who saved her, she helps him escape when the police surround him.As Evey and V become friends, we learn that her entire family fell victim to the government, as did V. He is not just fighting for the freedom of England, but for his own personal vendetta against those who made him the monster he knows he is.Stephen Rea is well cast in support as Inspector Finch, assigned to find V and bring him to justice. Hugo Weaving creates a sympathetic vigilante, despite the fact that we never see his face. Natalie Portman is perfect as Evey, the character she famously shaved her head to play.Many of the themes have been examined before, most obviously in George Orwell's masterpiece ""1984,"" but also in the second ""Star Wars"" trilogy, in which politician uses a crisis to force himself into the position of a supreme leader. What is new is the dilemma of who is a freedom fighter and who is a terrorist.""V for Vendetta"" is intelligent and disturbing.

heights of George Owells 1984 predictions now come to pass,"V for Vendetta (2005) - A Chilling Prophecy That Becomes Reality (10/10)Few films stand the test of time, but V for Vendetta has transcended mere entertainment to become an urgent warning-one that rings louder in 2025 than ever before. When this film was released in 2005, many dismissed its dystopian vision as fiction. But now, under the grip of an ever-expanding left-wing surveillance state, where censorship is law, freedom is a relic, and the global elite tighten their control under the guise of safety, the film's message has never been more relevant.Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel and deeply inspired by Orwell's 1984, V for Vendetta paints a picture of a society ruled by fear, where the government controls speech, thought, and even the truth itself. Sound familiar? As the global cabal pushes its agenda-erasing independent thought, demonizing dissent, and manufacturing crises to justify their overreach-the parallels between fiction and reality have become terrifyingly clear.Hugo Weaving's performance as V is nothing short of legendary, embodying the spirit of resistance with poetic brilliance. Natalie Portman delivers one of her most compelling roles, as her character, Evey, transforms from a fearful bystander into a symbol of defiance. Every line of dialogue, every masked act of rebellion, pulses with raw, unfiltered truth.But the true power of V for Vendetta lies beyond its cinematography, performances, or action sequences. It is a call to wake up. To remember that governments will always seek more control, and that power is never given back willingly. To remind us that when oppression reaches its peak, the people must rise.In a world where truth is labeled misinformation, where history is rewritten in real-time, and where obedience is enforced through social and financial manipulation, V for Vendetta is no longer just a film-it's a mirror. It's a prophecy fulfilled. And above all, it's a reminder that the people have one weapon the ruling class fears most: the idea that they can say no.10/10-because this film is not just relevant.

Another 1984-like England, another dictatorship (that could be right or left). It's the kind of story that works in an 80s comic book, and very well, but gets annoyingly repetitive in a modern movie. There are very good aspects, of course. The visual atmosphere is excellent, V is a very charismatic revolutionary (I won't call that a hero), even though we can't see his expressions and I admit I liked Evey better in the movie than in the graphic novel.

You could have it so much better (with Alan Moore),"'V for Vendetta' is a well intended film for today's audience. As many other science fiction movies, like Matrix or Blade Runner, it presents a could be-world in which freedom is an underrated right, and a character who is willing to put things upside-down. So, as every dystopia attempts, it makes you think. It is interesting in that the film is absolutely not a follow up to Neo's special effect nightmares. In fact there's only one sequence that will satisfy the people of that likes. But regrettably neither the film is well directed nor did the Wachowskis write a screenplay that raises questions in depth. The filming language is extremely poor in some sequences, like those of the burning birth of V at Larkhill, or the ones about the lesbian couple. A somewhat shallow film, though the strength of the comic books remains in the character of V.

"V for Vendetta, D for Disappointing","Morally aggravating and cinematically direction-less and pretty dull, V for Vendetta strikes me as yet another over rated Hollywood picture which may seem to have something going for it but ultimately does notSet in a totalitarian future in England, (a vision pioneered by legend author George Orwell), the story follows a strange masked individual who dresses like Guy Faukes and is planning a conspiracy to over throw the government. The only person with whom he shares his secrets is a pretty young lady who he rescues from thugs one night and he brings her to his lair. both their lives are suddenly taking a strange turn as mutual feelings for each other start to emerge.Pop culture tends to like stories which attack power, authority or religion, but this one is a bit absurd. It praises one of England's biggest traitors. Guy Faukes was caught trying to blow up the parliament buildings in 1605. This is not however what bothers me most about the film. the real problem is the writing. With the exception of a few moderately neat scenes, most of the film boring, with not much plot progression, and the script includes a lot of silly and pretentious lines which sound clever but arn't. A good example comes after our hero survives a round of gunfire, he says to one of his attackers 'Behind this mask there is an idea, and an idea is bulletproof'.Whatever else V for Vendetta has to offer isn't worth your time.

ideas are bulletproof,"Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, 'V for Vendetta' is a political thriller set in a fascist-ruled England in the 2020s. A film that delves into the political side of oppression and anarchy, whilst running a somewhat emotive and heartfelt story of a character in betrayal, 'V for Vendetta' is a visually stunning and extremely smart flick with some fantastic performances from Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman (whose English accent is rather impressive). The film is nowadays considered a cult classic, and rightfully so, even to the extent that the film has been utilised by governments as an allegory of oppression.I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com.

V for huh?,"For something the famed Wachowski brothers have made, this film disappointed on many levels. Being the first Wachowski screenplay since the excellent Matrix trilogy, the story jumped around more than Skippy on steroids, and I felt Hugo Weaving's character was wasted behind the mask. More background info on V would've vastly improved this film. The entire torture scene seemed pointless (not to mention long), and the detective's side story concerning the St.Mary's virus was uncomfortably slotted in, and seemed to make no sense until much later in the film. The people's characters seemed to be transported out of Eastenders, and were just frankly annoying to look at whenever they briefly appeared on the screen. I did, however, appreciate Natalie Portman's acting ability (despite her character being plonked in for no reason... why should someone wanting to blow up the Old Bailey randomly save some1 on the street first? He does'not seem to do it ever again...) and the cinematic special effects were decent (but no way as good as the Matrix). It did get me talking about recent politics, as probably was the point, but Mike Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" did that much better too, and that was a couple of years ago.This film got the idea right, but the execution was completely wrong.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"V is for ""V""ery political and still ""V""ery stylish","This movie seems to tear me in two. On one side, it was well done and well implemented from my perspective, though I have never read the comic therefore digressing on it's true implementation is beyond my scope. On the other hand, this movie is almost too much to stomach, unless one is a true conspiracy theorist. My entire post-screening group interview was filled with people discussing how closely linked the government in ""Vendetta"" was to America's own. This could in no way be the case, though the crazies are always around.While I would say that the audience reaction does not damage the film, I will also say I saw blatant motive for feeling the movie was a political message to support these theories. While I found the abundance of this message weighed the film down, it also carried with it a very film-noir/Victorian-esquire feeling. There are goodperformances and some good action (though it was well done). All in all, very stylish, but it tried a bit hard and hurt itself at the same time. 6/10 overall, but worth a watch for fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

pretentious rubbish,"It has been explained much more explicitly by other reviewers, but in short: poor acting, dull script, lame implausible action scenes and in short a complete waste of time for all 6 of us who saw it.

Possibly there was meant to be a parody to modern US politics but this was simplistic at best.Normally i would sit back and laugh at rubbish like this, if it were not for the irritation of the lack of research carried out by the makers. Being British, the stereotyping, generic settings and set pieces combined with the theory that saying ""b*****ks"" every 5 minutes makes you English/British -the two of which were freely interchanged, something the Scottish might object to. Accents were awful and even pronounciation was painfully American - most obvious in the word ""lever"" - a minor point, but by this point it was enough for me to wish that some effort could have been made. Clearly the amount of time i dwelled on this showed how bored i was of the same point being made over and over again.In summary a good idea that was poorly executed on most levels leaving 2+hours of tired regurgitated poltical rubbish that didn't even tie in with the central story that well - Guy Fawkes was not a freedom fighter or zorro-esquire hero of the people.

My Favorite Movie of All-Time!,"This is MY ""greatest movie of all time"" and has been for quite some time now. I often hope something may come along and knock it off the shelf, but it has not happened. (Children of Men came close) I've come to understand what's most important to me in storytelling, Encompassing the entire human experience.Most will not agree, but I found the film better than the comic book, and the comic was top notch! I know Alan Moore hated it, I think he even tried to get it banned or something, but to me Hugo's performance is beyond incredible. The general fear of a main character behind a mask with no facial expression's is totally beyond comparison here. Hugo, if you're reading this, you have reached Ian McKellen status in my eyes.It's really difficult to imagine this comic being put onto the big screen and more so, being acceptable, yet I found it truly compelling, inspiring and the overall essence captured.

Mind Blowing,"When I entered the theater I was hoping to see a movie that I would add to my favorites list. A movie that would have many different emotions. I was hoping to see a great film. The movie went above my expectations.In the first 10 or so minutes, I worried that there would be nothing but violence... but the next scene threw that out the door. With a bombardment of ""v"" words who couldn't smile? This film didn't only have humor and violence... it had so much more. More that you just cannot explain. For example: right when you have a serious point in the film, someone will ask a question... the answer will be so simple that you almost laugh.Almost nothing turned out the way I expected, and I'm normally pretty good at figuring out endings. When it was over I just stared at the screen, as did my friend and my mom. It was over... yet not.On the way home you just keep thinking. It feels as if everything you once thought was taken out of your head, then replaced, but with a new thought too. Will this really happen? that's one thing you wonder.

This movie reminded me a lot of the book ""1984"", the movie ""Wag the Dog"", and the movie ""Loose Change"" about 9/11. It showed how the chancellor tried to cover up what was really happening by feeding lies to the public, which the publice did not buy.

The rise to overthrowing power has begun...,"After a disappointing attempt in making The Matrix into a totally forgettable trilogy, the Wachowski brothers write a new film tackling the issues of terrorism and corruption between the bureaucratic governments in this futuristic look of Britain. I am a big fan of the original Matrix and how they tackle the contextualized version of religious undertone of Neo as ""the one"" was great, so I would have only high expectations for this film. As for new cumber James McTeigue, who served as an assistant director on the Matrix films, I was impressed with the outcome of his new born film.In a state of government that is controlled by a tyrant and is in a state of civil war, there's nowhere safe for anyone that is a possible suspect of terrorism. With corrupt leaders and crooked officers, there is only one thing that is suspected of this and that is the right to rebel against the government. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman, Episode 3: Attack of the Clones) becomes cornered in a dark alley by several government officers who have only one thing on their mind. Luckily she is saved from the power hungry officers by a man in black that wears the a Guy-Fawkes mask and whose weapon of choice is the dozen of daggers that he carries around. She's intrigued by the man in black, who has no second thought of using violence as a mean of expression for his rebellious ideas, who latter has been labeled as the terrorist of the new generation and given the name ""V"". With her curiosity, Evey is kidnapped by V and learns of his lifestyles that he carries on. Meanwhile, Inspector Eric Finch, (Stephen Rea, Breakfast on Pluto) is questioning the authority of the nations dictator Creedy, whose face is blown up on a large movie screen as he dictates his committee, displaying his ego and attempt to be intimidating to his council. All I can picture is that this guy is probably 5'1'', drives cars that are large and fast, and makes sure to be yelling and/or frowning at the same time. As the film continues, you begin to learn the reasoning for V's acts of terrorism involving explosions of national monuments and the mentality that violence is the only way to rebel.The pace of the film isn't what you would expect from the previews but that doesn't change anything. Coming from a comic strip of the early 80's, the film shows the stylistic traits of a graphic novel that seems to be the new wave of interpretation as seen through most recent films such as The History of Violence and Sin City. There are several high class references in V's humble layer, underneath the rocky ledge near the coast of some river, being that there are rare paintings on the wall, operatic music playing in the background and other nick-nacks that show the intellect that V truly is, giving him the approval rating for his actions. Even though he seemed to be justifying the rights of all mankind in this totalitarian government, it seems like I've heard or seen this story before at least a half a dozen times, I don't seem to mind. The ending is what ties everyone together and the effect that V had on society is what is special about the film and shows the overpowering force of the people against a tyrant. To sum it up John Locke would approve with the idea, disapprove of the actions, while Machiavelli would be frustrated beyond belief. A great look at the rise and fall of power in a time were the nation is trying to understand what there future might evolve into.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Courageous, fascinating movie signals a cultural shift","Dramatically, it's a little flawed, but I'd blame that on its considerable thematic weight. It's a courageous, fascinating movie that questions and attacks US and ""Coalition of The Willing"" fear-mongering in the pre- and post-9/11 era. In an effort to not-so-subtly mask its primary target, its setting is post-Thatcher Britain where Big Brother, John Hurt, fans the flames of fear and spews bald-faced lies on giant TV screens to a zombified populace totally reliant on mainstream media for its ""truth"" and moral compass.""V"" (Hugo Weaving), which stands for both Victim and Vendetta, initiates a series of incendiary subversive acts he hopes will destabilize the government and cause it to fear its people rather than the other way around. Natalie Portman, in an important but not always crucial role, plays Esmeralda to V's Phantom and undergoes an interesting transformation that locks itself into V's dramatic journey.The pacing is sluggish in places and the exposition is thick, but ""V For Vendetta"" is a work of ideas and outrage, and it wears its heart sincerely on its sleeve. It addresses issues not only as topical as terrorism and government deception, but it also shakes up subjects as diverse as sexual intolerance, secret prisons, the media's snug relationship with the ruling party, and the purpose of violent rebellion.That a multi-national such as Time-Warner made and released this movie is, in itself, a sign that we may be emerging from a dark, cloudy period in which basic human rights have been ignored by folks claiming to be championing them with missionary-style zeal.The action set pieces, which are not numerous, are not staged on a grand scale, but they are exceptionally well directed, smartly edited, and threaded with the blackest of humor. Performances are all excellent, with Stephen Rea and Weaving stand-outs.The film is funny at times because it's truth is so raw, but the audience I saw it with in a large LA cinema was, for the most part, not laughing. I predict that this film's value may not be immediate, but it is assured.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Hmmmmmmm.,"I just saw this film at the local cinema (was hoping to see it in IMAX, but for some reason the UK doesn't seem to be showing it in IMAX), and my final thoughts on the film are ""Hmmmmmmmmm."" With the Spider-Man films, I was a comic fan beforehand, and I loved the films all the same. I was quite familiar with X-Men, Hulk, so on, and I enjoyed those films too. The harder thing with V, which I finally read in October, is that it's a mini-series. One story. Thus, comic fans will notice the changes more. I've noticed the films been getting rave reviews in the States, and mixed ones in the UK. That's why I believe the film will perform better across the Atlantic. Profuro is a Hannity-alike, which will have American liberals jumping with glee, but will have most English people scratching their heads. It's just not quite what we're used to. The comments Alan Moore made here about ""eggy-in-a-basket"" still hold true, and I was tempted to walk out numerous times during the first half hour. There were some brilliant moments, even some surprisingly decent ones (the alliterative opening speech isn't that bad, thanks to Weaving's fine performance), but after the brilliant beginning explosion there's a great slump. Shouts of ""Bollocks!"" and numerous shots of people with bad teeth in pubs seem artificial and forced. Natalie Portman's accent does improve as the film goes on, and by the time we enter the Shadow Gallery (a beautiful set), things peak up again. The torture scene: brilliant. The flashbacks to Larkhill were haunting. Its just the odd flaws that stop this from being downright brilliant. To a US audience, these flaws will not be so apparent. I'm not US-bashing. I am Iranian, I've been brought up in England, and I love the States as well. I have family in Virginia, and when I come to visit I'm taken aback by people's kindness and generosity, as a lot of people here have a somewhat warped view. Tangent aside, it's just that these flaws may make the film hard-going for a British audience. I love Weaving's performance, but the early TV station speech was one too many, and too soon. V has won over the populace within the first 20 mins of the film. This leaves less of an arc for the rest, but still, the film prevails. The final explosion, even the infamous V army, is proof of what Hollywood does best. A Mesmerising Climax. If you're desperate for a star rating, I'd give it 4 out of 5. Star knocked off for the artificial Britishness. Two stars for the middle slump. But an extra star each for the wonderful domino montage, and the... I was going to say explosive, but... one extra star for the ending it is. A flawed film, but one worth seeing. I just fear that Saturday the 18th will be like any other day, and that copycat criminals will give the film, and V's cause, a bad name (the shoplifter in the film may be a sign of things to come). Partly I saw the film today for fear of a Clockwork-Orange style backlash in the UK. The hairs on the back of the necks of everyone in the cinema were on end when they saw that Tube train packed with explosives. Even I, who had already read the book and countless previews of the film, was taken aback. An Uncompromising, but flawed, Vision of the Future, indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
From Strangelove to Vendetta: The journey from Lincoln/Douglas to Sharpton/Kucinic.,"If you haven't advanced beyond the second grade, and therefore require that your vilification of the Bush administration be bereft of the slightest modicum of subtlety, then ""Vendetta"" is your cup of tea. Its message hits you over the head like a billy club, and no surprise, the message is pure Hollywood propaganda.John Hurt (the protagonist from Orwell's movie version of ""1984"", no coincidence) is the head of a police state that ruthlessly exploits public safety fears to implement totalitarian measures. We learn Hurt's character started out as a ""religious conservative"" who rose to power in the wake of public safety concerns over supposed terrorist attacks (no, I am not making this up).Big brother is evidenced in force as government trucks roam through the city randomly eavesdropping on citizens' conversations (gee, no intended Bush administration parallel there).Citizens are constantly assured that heightened security / diminished civil liberties are for their own protection, as they are surrounded by peril at every turn around the globe. But have no fear, ""England Prevails"" is the mantra people are taught to repeat. Gee, Bush has never said anything like that either.The ""regime"" has eerie parallels to what else, Nazi Germany. We know from the beginning that people whom the state deems ""undesirable"" have been imprisoned, and the movie's own Joseph Mengela has performed unspeakable experiments on the prisoners - all for the supposed greater good of the state, of course. Homosexuals (who else?) are prime targets of the state. Soldiers/stormtroopers goose-step down a main street as their leader/Fuhrer pounds on a rostrum in the background. There is even a Swastika substitute.Enemies of the state are imprisoned, re-educated, or in the case of a subversive element found with a Koran, shot dead (Nope, not making that up either).So in case you didn't get it (as I will concede it is never written in boldface across the screen), the Bush Administration is exploiting your fears (and perhaps even manufacturing events to put you in fear), and is taking your beloved country down a road towards becoming a ruthless, police state where dissent equals death.This movie isn't a poor man's Dr. Strangelove. This move is a 1st grade imbecil's Dr. Strangelove. This Cinematic polemic is the equivalent of a political cartoon with all the subtlety of a picture of Adolph Hitler superimposed on George Bush. The far left can, and HAS, done a HECK of a lot better than this. It is a woeful sign of the times that more than 40 years after the release of a great movie like Dr. Strangelove THIS is what ranks as compelling political cinema. Cinematic social commentary has made a sad reverse evolution - from Lincoln/Douglas 160 years ago to Sharpton/Kucinic today.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the most important movies you will ever see,"This movie adaptation of the graphic novel is an astounding feast for the eyes, thought food for your head and a emotive testament to the power of people in the face of adversity. The original 'comic' was set in a fictional version of neo-Nazi Thatcher era Britain, but taking out actual historical figures (apart from Guy Fawkes) gives the piece a much bigger net to cast. With enough fantastic fight scenes, and things blowing up to keep the action fans happy, V brings a multi-layered complexity, poetry and wit that one does not usually associate with this kind of movie. Even though it is fiercely British (the dismissive and passing references to the civil war in ""the former United States"" is a powerful backdrop) one of the things that gives this movie such a resounding impact is the parallels that can be drawn to current world events. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. It looks at how governments control the media, mutate and mold the publics perceptions and use questionable methods to their own ends. The tag line of 'People should not be afraid of their Governments, Governments should be afraid of their people', is such a powerful and brave thing to say in this day and age when countries all over the world initiate sedition and treason laws. It's theatrical release was held back in the UK due to the London bombings and it's easy to understand why, but I'll spare you the spoilers. Their are some incredible performances, Natalie Portman as Evie gives perhaps the best performance of her career. John Hurt's malevolent High Chancellor is a seething cauldron of hatred. Stephen Fry as Gordon is magnificent and gives a glimpse of what I hope will be more dramatic roles for him. And then there is V, played by Hugo Weaving, who although you never see his face gives a remarkable portrayal full of humour, madness, righteous vengeance and tenderness. That mask will forever evoke strong feeling in me. V FOR VENDETTA is an absolute must see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Provocative,"There are many ways to expose corruption of the sort that defiles the memory of the Founding Fathers of this great nation we call the United States. One of the best ways is through art imitating real life and that is what has been accomplished with V for Vendetta.

"Many things to amaze and stun, but it's the character(s) that count","In this rather colorful and clean (albeit darkly lit) futuristic British world, a fascist government has taken control. And since we don't like fascists, we need a very colorfully masked character to save us all from being mindless sheep. He also is wonderfully poetic, too, making him more than just a zealous terrorist: he's an artist.Hugo Weaving is, frankly, amazing. Not only does he have to overcome his (basically) typecast nature (who really saw him as Elrond in The Lord of the Rings? No, everyone saw him as Mr. Smith posing as a zealous elf), but he has to do so without a face. His voice acting is one thing, but its the pantomime that matches the voice acting that gives this character its compelling nature. He's graceful, and poetic, and artistic, and swashbuckling... and straight out of silent film, despite his ""verbose"" dialog. That is why when he does stuff like pretending to be strangled by an empty suit of armor or speak an entire paragraph with words starting only with V, it actually works. No seriously, it's brilliant.Natalie Portman supports well, but none more so real than when she's really put into a testy situation. She moves from fear to chaos to acceptance to love in a moments notice, exactly the way the audience wants to move with her. Despite V's rather straightforward narration of events, it's at Evey's speed that we try to alternatively catch up and slow down to understand what's going on.And finally, Stephen Rea. Wow, what a perfect choice for that role. Now the movie mentions that he's Irish (and we all know what that means to England and it's ideals of status quo), but it barely even needs to. Not only is Rea's nationality perfect for the part, but the way he's proved himself through such films as The Crying Game really endear us to the guy who is suddenly shocked out of the status quo... and is now in the position to make a major decision about whether to reject or accept this sudden change. If anyone should be given credit for this film's success, it's the casting director.Now the story is a ""pretty good one"", though it's really engaging mostly through its in-depth explorations of its characters. I haven't read the graphic novel. I've read enough vitrolic rants about this movie to understand that it gets nowhere near the depth of these characters as presented in the original work. But unlike such adaptations as our infamous Harry potter series and the like, this movie does have a certain care and understanding for the characters, doing the best it can to really give them lives and histories... and sidestories. In fact, it felt like this movie could go on forever, and that even if it did, I wouldn't have minded.I think there's two major places the story fails to make this film from good to really great. The first is that some of the dialog just simply doesn't hold up to some of the other dialog... V's lines are great (though I understand they are much better in the original work), but stuff like the policemen's constant repetition about coincidences doesn't hold up well.Secondly, at first it's really unclear why exactly the government we're watching is evil (except with the usual Big Talking Head that always makes us think of Big Brother), then even when it's cleared up, it's hard to understand why the subjects are so ready and willing to jump on the V bandwagon and practice ""Anarchy in the UK!"" (By the way, was that line necessary either? I think this movie had enough trouble from the beginning without having to sound like a stupid punk who doesn't realize the 70s ended more than a quarter of a century ago).However, that's not to say that this film isn't full of some really strong points. I think what did it for me was the comedy show featuring the Grand Chancellor being humiliated. Both as a loving homage to British humor past and present, and as a thumbs up to satire and the power of daring media, it's a grand addition to the preceedings. The comedian's subsequent arrest places it into a morbid theme: you can't just talk about it or joke about it. You have to act to change it. Hint to the left, in case they're wondering why their ""Impeach Bush"" stickers aren't doing anything.And about the politics, since it's such a big issue. This movie is very stunted in that it uses discourses we use today, and the Wachowskis are obviously very intent in putting a bit of Bush-bashing into it. It wasn't very necessary, but it worked out in places like the little quip about the Avian flu and whatnot. Personally, I could have used a much broader and somewhat universally-themed approach, especially since this film seems to be almost begging in parts for the Right to get angry at it so that it could get some free publicity.That said, despite all these things here, all these things here which weren't quite good enough to have me absolutely raving about it, I can't help but really love it for those characters. I think what appeals most about V is that not only is his mask just a wonderfully distinct image, but he has absolute control over a world where power seems to be utterly lacking. I especially love that last fight scene he does at the end with the vapor-trails around the knives. I've heard a lot of scoffing about how that's just pointless bullet-time, but it isn't bullet time. It's V's utter, almost mystical, control over the elements and the energy around him right as he's about to kick some serious booty. I think that's a great way of turning the Wachowski's self-created image into something entirely new.--PolarisDiB",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ridiculous,"I'm not one to come onto IMDb to stir things up and I know a lot of people get very angry on these boards when someone comes on and slates a favourite movie of theirs but my opinion's as valid as anyone else's and I thought this was a ridiculous film.Argue all you will but I saw nothing original in this and nothing particularly entertaining. For the most part, I thought the actors were poor quality and the story so formulaic in delivery that I can't believe how high this is rated.I found this to be deeply flawed and desperately uninspiring. I had no idea the Wachowski brothers were involved until I saw the end credits roll, which added further to my disappointment. It could've all been so much better.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
stronger than flesh...ideas,"Well. I saw this movie last night. I was waiting to see it and I was not disappointed.The main point of this film is to make people think about what starts a reaction of the citizens of a nation. I believe that it did a good job at it. While people are arguing that it is the ""power fighting the power,"" I think that it doesn't matter that it is the power that is saying this, just as long as it is said. After all, we have the freedom to at the moment, why not use it, at least up until the freedom is taken from us.The main reason I liked this movie was the fact that it was interesting. It held my attention, and I wasn't squirming for three hours trying to get comfortable.There are many many action movies that are made to simply entertain and basically to occupy (and waste) the audience's time. This story has plot and characters and a back story, and a future. And, most importantly, it opened the floor for discussion among friends, co-workers, and even strangers.Although V was an anarchist, it doesn't advocate anarchism, to me. It advocated the need for the citizens of a country to be aware of it's leaders and what they are doing behind the doors of their offices with their cronies.Another thing I enjoyed were three very beautiful songs. ""Bird Gerhl"" by Antony and the Johnsons, ""I Found a Reason"" by Cat Power, and ""Cry Me a River"" by Julie London. They are all very slow, pretty songs. It is a very interesting part of the score, as when i think of other movies with similar themes and their soundtracks. In my opinion it is a very strong departure from the fast paced theme of the movie (365 days in three hours!) and is a very interesting backdrop to the relationship of V and Evey.Overall: good show!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Mezmerizing and Unforgettable,"V for Vendetta is a movie that will cause much stir among the critical voices as well as the movie goers for years to come. However, aside from being controversial in almost every way, it is also a film that many would say is necessary for people to see. For those who like action, violence, and special effects, hooray because this is your type of movie. V for Vendetta is an extravagant display of eye candy made for the viewer's pleasure. Yet, what about those who care for a great story? Well I'd say that V for Vendetta is as creative and superbly imaginative as cinema can get these days. The concept of an alternate totalitarian world, as depicted in the movie, is captivating because of the modern time frame it is attributed to. It is a world that shows how far human choice and capability can easily take society down the wrong path, yet at the same time the two can give people the strength to revolt against the unrighteous.As political and mentally questionable as the film is, it is still a good time to spend at the movies. Yes, the dialogue can be cheesy at times, but for the most part try to look for the underlying meanings of the topics the movie tries to project. As for the acting, Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are great in portraying their characters. Overall, V for Vendetta is a great cinematic experience which will definitely not be forgotten too quickly and one that may be mimicked in terms of subject matter by films to come. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V is Victorious!,"I have recently been a bit disappointed with comic-to-film adaptations recently. Frankly, the last one I saw that was good was ""Sin City"". When I heard that they were making a film of ""V for Vendetta"", to say I was worried was putting it mildly. Especially when I heard that the Wachowski Brothers were helping out with it. Today proved me wrong and has restored my faith in comic-to-film movies. Being a major fan of the original comic, I found this movie faithful to the source and utterly brilliant. The cinematography was beautiful and the characters were all around wonderful. I especially enjoyed Hugo Weaving as the enigmatic V. He had the voice and the character that I imagined for the role and I was pleased with his performance. Natalie Portman's portrayal of Evey Hammond was nothing short of wonderful and the supporting cast, including Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, and the always brilliant John Hurt, were truly spectacular. For fans of big action and great characters, I highly recommend this film. Even for those who have not read the original comic, it will prove to be a visual treat and will keep you hanging on the edge of your seat right up until the ending credits.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"do you have a social soul, see this movie and find out...","This is one those films that makes you walk out of the theater wanting to change the world. The sad reality is that for most of us, moments of clear conscience and absolute senses of right and wrong are far between the overwhelming activities of daily life. It is a thankful breath of fresh air and more than that a righteous social wakeup call to make films like V for Vendetta that remind everyone of us that some, I emphasize some, of these hideous truths are in fact a reality in this country and other countries.To witness the imprisonment, the bleak reality of a detainee's hopeless existence and imminent death after their use to their captors has all but dried up, it tears a hole in any person who believes freedom and justice are truly the most important things in this country. While this film takes place in Britain, its themes and warnings are universal. I walked out of the theater hoping everyone who saw this film was reminded of vital ideas like ""The people should not fear their government, the government should fear its people"", and the value of the 'Question' and of defiance and ultimately of such basic values as tolerance, truth and justice. While V for Vendetta may only serve to echo these themes as they have been presented in dozens of other classic films like 1984 and the Manchurian Candidate, it stands apart in the absolute belief that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.If a person could live their entire life with the hope and strength of will to spread justice and tolerance that this movie instills in us for the short time we are in the theater, there would be no need for such reminders as V for Vendetta, and the world would be bereft of tyranny and oppression.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
excellent watch!,"V for Vendetta has ALL the elements of an excellent movie that should NOT be subjected to certain reviewers personal tastes.

You'll either love this movie, or, you'll find it ridiculous.V for Vendetta is nothing like the trailer. I haven't read the book before so my critique is less biased even so.The story line is very satirical and will make you think. There's an apparent political message that's strong and clear. The dialog and script are simply excellent and powerful. Camera work and lighting is just perfect. The movie itself is dark, serious and very poetic. Overall it's a work of art.

to see it once,"The feelings about it , seeing time by time, are less clear. It is a good film but the references are so obvious, the clash against aspects of near reality so present, than it is very hard to be real enthusiatic. Sure, it can be a warning, portrait of dictatorship, definition of high need of freedom, a form of parody, use of Gunpower plot, Brave New World or 1984 for a sort of manifesto. So, it is good as answer of frustrations, conspiracy theories or people under tyranies. But can it be more ? Sure , Natalie Portman gives a good role, John Hurt reminds 1984 for the change of places, but, after a time, the film, source of enthusiasmus after the first discover of it, seems too... simplistic.

overrated,"'a work of monumental genius' 'an amazing feat of cinema' 'truly unique' 'a bloody masterpiece!'...just some of the things said about this film.IMDb rates this 125th best movie of all time. i don't think so. its heart is in the right place, but let's get a couple things straight to start with.now i'm a Natalie Portman fan, but as it says on the rubric 'evey, a working class girl...' i'm afraid Nat's accent is worse than Rene Zegweller in Bridget Jones' diary. even radio 4 would reject her for being too posh. sack the casting director for starters.and whilst it is fairly obvious we are sleepwalking towards fascism, to hold Guy Fawkes up as a shining beacon of freedom is incorrect to say the least.this is a film adapted from a comic and unfortunately that's exactly how it ends up. comic book like. superman at that. not in it's look but in it's heart.yeah there's some nice touches, but that makes it even worse for not being completely bad which would be OK if it wasn't trying to be serious, but it was.about three quarters of the way through i thought 'aha! Ian Hurt HAS TO BE v, now that makes some kind of sense!' but no it descended into ridiculousness and in the end i felt it became:'how one man can stand up to a fascist regime and end up justifying it whilst still remaining totally cool.'but hey i guess it IS called v for vendetta not r for revolution. maybe it should be called y for why or b for bol**cks.it's sad that in 2007 that this is what passes for revolutionary cinema (i will forgive you if you're under 15)oh and a tip for future fascist dictatorships: avoid red and black in your backdrops. it's really unappeallingseen alongside 'brazil', 'nineteen eighty-four' and 'richard III (1995)', v for vendetta can be forgiven for attempting to update these classics. it cannot be forgiven for falling way short.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely STUNNING!,"V for Vendetta is a masterpiece. I just came home from seeing it, and I am totally blown away. The plot, effects, acting, and overall execution of the movie was amazing.

V is a character that will become an icon in the world. If you are looking for a movie that will completely blow you away, and have you leaving the theater thinking "" What should happen to us?"" One word: STUNNING!!! When you go to the movies, and you look at the movies playing, you wonder which one will affect you the most in mind, body, and soul. V for Vendetta is one of those movies. It shows contriversy, and the troubles that war leads us to. What V says "" The people should not be afraid of the governments,the governments should be afraid of their people."" is very true, and this movie gets that message across easily. I have a feeling that this movie will be nominated for many, many,many, MANY awards, and believe me, it deserves it.

Absolutely prophetic and frightening,"Even though this was originally developed (as a comic) in the 80's and made in the mid 2000s and people think of it as being synonymous with Bush. Unfortunately, and frightingly it reflects so much of the rise of Trump, social media and the Covid Pandemic. But we didn't realise at the time. Needless to say it takes on a different type of sinister and cynicism then it even originally did if you saw this around the time of release.It's done so well though, with great acting by brilliant actors. And even though dystopian films are not my favorite I really liked it when I saw it about a dozen years ago. So much so I used one of the speeches in an acting workshop. Seeing it again I agree with myself but again as mentioned in the introduction it feels even darker and more concerning.

Yet another portion of political propaganda,"The Wachowski brothers confirm their standing, commenced in 'Matrix' with 'Mr. Reagan', who 'used to be an actor' and 'would prefer not to remember anything' (remark made when Ronald Reagan was mortally ill from Altzheimer).Now they have adapted a cartoon (made by people protesting this way against 'ultra-right' Thatcher government in 1980s) and cast leading left-wingers (e.g. Stephen Fry) in order to protest against Tony Blair - once a favourite of the left, who now 'betrayed' them.One wonders why dictatorships shown in a contemporary movie always have to be the same: lesbians are of course persecuted, government uses the sign of cross (Lorraine, slightly similar to that used by right-wing French Gaullists) and is supported by bishops. Of course not a word of 'englightened atheism' and dumbing political correctness, so omnipotently present - not to say running rampant - in the world we REALLY live in...The rest is just a consequence: unarmed hero with knives, somehow still standing after a hail of bullets; he manages to live at least for a year in a huge apartment filled with all possible kinds of art and memorabilia - not to mention training martial arts (otherwise he couldn't be possibly fit enough for all the things he does) and doing communication tricks - while he is chased by all the 'totalitarian' (i.e. supposedly very well-informed) police; childish plot to blow up the Parliament (and why??? under any dictatorship it would clearly have not had any role) and rather humorous idea with thousands of masked men (who by the way spread crime and disorder - true revolutionaries, indeed).On the film's website screenwriters claim they wanted to show what happens 'when governments do not reflect the will of the people'. No matter that Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair have been elected many times by great majorities. But in fact their governments have not (or not enough) reflected views of the people like this movie's authors - tiny, unelected clique of 'artists'. And this is the real reason why this movie's been made - to deliver yet another portion of political crap.If you're a far-left activist you're gonna enjoy it. Otherwise, it's just a loss of time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An utterly astonishing film...,"It seems that quite a few people don't like this film. Most dissenting voices appear to be not overly concerned with the quality of storytelling, visuals, dialogue, acting etc, for all excel, but rather with the broader concept - the rights or wrongs of sedition, the questions raised by the totalitarian state of the film, the eternal left/wing continuum...Well they're entitled to their opinions of course, but it appears that this film has caught a mood, and that something very slowly is happening out there. I've rarely seen public opinion so galvanised by a politically-motivated film, and I've personally never been so affected by a film in my life.To leave a movie theatre open-mouthed in astonishment, one's brain whirring at a million miles per hour, is an all-to-rare occurrence in life. Yet it happened after watching V For Vendetta. But why? The fight scenes, though cool and crisp, are relatively brief, and I'm not really one to get off on fight scenes much anyway. If that's all I want, I'll watch Bad Boys II. The explosion scenes, equally, are executed with amazing aplomb, but the film would barely register a loss if the climactic explosion didn't occur. The primary message of V is that ideas are paramount, ideas count above all else and ideas will lead us to freedom. And it is the idea of the film that cuts so deeply.I have never been so affected by a film, to the extent of contemplating leaving my lucrative but pointless job after watching it... I would welcome every single individual in the UK watching this with an open mind. If it's not your thing, fine. If you find the action not mindless enough for your taste, again fine - most of Hollywood's other product will cater for you.But if you feel, as I feel, that something's not quite right with how our countries are ruled, then see this film, and get a glimpse of what might lie in store.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Incredible,"This movie was truly incredible. Before seeing the film I figured it was just another one of those boring action films where the main character is virtually invincible, but this was different. The main character ""V"" was very intriguing. The one man rebellion was very impressive with his mix of intelligence and shadowy figure. I strongly recommend seeing this film. There was never a dull moment. When I say never a dull moment I don't mean explosions and bullets every second but a very well developed plot. The title seems to reflect the film quite well, it was a great choice by whoever named it. Overall the film is a must see because of it's very good plot and very good special effects.

More than a shoot -'em-up,"V for Vendetta had the makings of a typical Hollywood movie filled with explosions, blood and violence. But the Wachowski brothers created a film with multiple levels of meaning that the trailers failed to even begin decoding. It is set more than 20 years in the future in England where a masked man attempts to change the world. There are elements of Hitler's rise to power through the induction of fear, the mystery of Phantom of the Opera, but most importantly an inquisitive protagonist similar to the one found in Orwell's 1984. The theme is evident: People should not be afraid of their government; the government should be afraid of the people. Through ingenious acts of deception and illusion, the main character, V, shapes Evie, a girl he rescues in an alleyway. As a common woman, she represents all of society. She has the ability to incite change but is unsure how to go about it. V's acts come across as horrendous to some, but for those attentively listening to his rationale, seems so logical. A higher-thinking member of the audience will be able to draw parallels to present life and come the horrific realization we better take care of the future before we fall victim to the same totalitarian rule.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Only Hollywood could have dismissed the Wachowski brothers,"Well, I put off going to this film after reading a couple of reviews. It sounded a little lame, and the last time I saw Natalie Portman she was less than rewarding. This time, however, she captured my attention and held it like you would expect a beautiful young woman to do, though with her own twist, namely that her persona manages to speak of her humanity more strongly than her physicality. It seems Natalie has deepened her skills since The Professional. Still, the movie relies on her performance to the extent that it would have failed if she had faltered. She doesn't.No, I walked away from the movie tonight totally amazed that this 2 hour plus movie had managed to keep me riveted to my seat like some old Bingo player needing only one mroe square to win the night's big jackpot. And my wife, no fan of either action movies or political thrillers, was miraculously just as mesmerized.This movie is a towering achievement, and there's no doubt in my mind that it will be the standard in its genre for a long time to come. And if you thought Hugo Weaving a slightly odd choice for Agent Smith in his last big role, watch him win you over in this film. He does it with insight and intuition despite extreme limitations (a Guy Fawkes mask). And John Hurt is every bit as righteous and outraged as some of our real politicians, making him all too easily recognizable.I love this film! V may introduce himself with about 1,000 more words than necessary, but quickly, this film makes its points like some master litigator building an ironclad case. Oh I looked at my watch alright, but not to see how much more I had to endure, but how much of this cinematic miracle was left before I'd be unceremoniously thrown out into the cold, cold night. To say this screenplay is brilliant is a colossal understatement. It's almost impossible to believe any writing team could have dreamed it up, much less one where one of the team is seeking a sex-change operation in a real-life. And considering that the Wachowski brothers were responsible for The Matrix as well, I thank my lucky stars that I didn't grow up to be in competition with these guys! Quite unlike the Matrix sequels, this movie is very much the worthy of successor of The Matrix.A couple of after thoughts: If you've heard about the Holocaust allusions, don't worry. You're not pummeled into submission with yet another account of that tragedy. And two, I fervently hope this operation they're talking about doesn't diminish their ability to create mind boggling cinema.

"A thanks to The Wachowski Brothers, James McTeigue, Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving.","*Warning: there are a few minor spoilers, but nothing that should ruin the movie for you.* I am a huge Alan Moore fan. He is arguably the greatest comic book/graphic novel writer ever. (Neil Gaiman still has time to pull ahead). This is in my opinion, of course. Anyway, I have read most of his works, and 'V for Vendetta' is my second favorite...Just behind 'Watchmen.' After seeing the terrible adaptations of 'From Hell' and 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', I did not want them to adapt anymore of his genius comics. I heard 'V for Vendetta' was being made and I shunned it. I ignored it. Even when the first trailer came out. I thought it looked bad...Because, well, the trailer was bad. But, I started seeing reviews all over the place saying it was spectacular and inspiring...It got me interested. I found out about the Wachowski Brothers love for the comic and Alan Moore...Gave me some hope. I was still extremely skeptical though. I kept reading good reviews over the next couple months, eventually gave in, and became really excited to see it. I got some passes to an advanced screening and attended on Monday night. I was nervous to say the least...I thought I had too high expectations.I had a couple advanced screening passes. So, after waiting for an hour and half outside, we were let in. Then, we waited for about half an hour inside. The waiting was unbearable. Then, it finally started.A little over 2 hours later, I was completely memorized. The movie was fantastic. I was so relieved. It's obviously the best Alan Moore adaptation. It may be the best comic book movie out yet...I have a really strong love for 'Hulk' and the 'X-Men' movies though. And it was a great transition from comic to the big screen...Probably the best they could have done. Even the changes were good. Not okay, they were good. There was only one thing they completely took out that kind of bummed me, but I know why they did it. The Wachowski's wrote an amazing screenplay. So good in fact, that I am able to forgive them for the third 'Matrix.' (I hated that movie). Everyone was spectacular. Hugo Weaving was DEAD ON...Especially when it came to the way he talked, and the fluent sentences he was able to pull off. Natalie Portman shines here...And it is probably her best role to date...If you have read Alan Moore's genius work, you will know what I saw when I tell you to wait until the ""imprisonment"" scene. She is amazing. Stephen Rea was perfect as Finch. And John Hurt pulled off a great pseudo-Hitler figure. I was also skeptical, seeing as they chose a new director to take charge....He only had experience working on the 'Matrix' movies. But, James McTeigue has proved himself worthy. The score/music was also terrific...The cinematography...Everything. The Wachoski brothers, who invented the ""bullet time"" craze used in a lot of films and video games now, decided to take it a step further...It's being called ""knife time""...And as stupid as it sounds, it really was not bad at all. Sure, it will get ragged on, and isn't nearly as cool as ""bullet time"" the first time you saw it in 'The Matrix', but it really was not a terrible addition.So, all in all, 'V for Vendetta' was spectacular. Moore would be proud if he was to ever see it, but that is doubtful. I applaud all involved...They deserve a long standing ovation. Congrats.Seeing this made me realize that even though most adaptations are terrible, every once in a while, one comes along and totally blows me away. Some adaptations are be very well done. It is rare, but when it happens, it's good. I wish all adaptations were as good as this one, but at the same time, I don't mind seeing a bunch of crappy adaptations as long as it means one this great will be done eventually. This brings hope to me for the 'Watchmen' film that cant decide if it wants to be made or not...I would love to hear that people involved in this film took over for that film...But alas, I doubt that will happen. I trust David Hayter...Especially since Alan Moore himself said it's the best screenplay possible. I just don't trust Paul Greengrass...I guess we'll see.""Those who are responsible will be held accountable."" -V",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
In awe of such masterly artistically political propaganda,"When The Matrix came out i was very suspicious, and having just seen V for Vendetta, now I'm sure. The Wachowski brothers may not actually be real life revolutionaries but they sure do understand them. Completely and utterly. Not since i read Jack London's ""The Iron Heel"" have i been in awe of such masterly artistic communication. Virtually everything you see on the screen is designed to heighten the impact of the plot and dialogue - the costumes, bleak weather and mood, everything - it's so interesting to watch. I remember raving about how they didn't waste a single second in any scene of the first Matrix and they've basically done it again with this film. The director could maybe have saved a further 2 to 3 minutes but that's it.But it's the plot, dialogue, theme and ideas behind the movie that make it so thrilling to watch. As a revolutionary sympathiser that is. For those who think Che Guevara was a cold blooded murderer, and Fidel Castro a dictator, you're probably a bit shaken if you actually sat through the entire movie but you definitely wouldn't say it was much good. You'd probably want people to quickly move onto their next movie fix, like those guys at the end of The Truman Show who wanna know what else is on after Truman signs off for the last time.For those who think the Cuban revolution is one of the most inspiring & heroic stories of all time, much better than what fiction can come up with because it is real and still undefeated (yay!), then i guarantee there's a good chance that if you go to see V for Vendetta, you're probably going to whoop and sing out ""Yay!"" like I did when something happens to a big building that represents the current political system.Where the flaw of the first Matrix film was the implication that a saviour would deliver us from the system, Vendetta makes no such mistake. I thought the dominoes was a nice touch in case there were some unclear about the masses part of the answer to the social problems caused by the current system.This movie will reverberate for many years to come because it manages more than any other in recent times to express the real issue of the day. And that is a tiny rich minority have vast power which is wielded through State machinery. Of the total amount of Terrorism that happens in the world, probably 99% is State Terrorism and the rest individual. The Bush gang think they can get away with the charade in Iraq, but then films like Vendetta are released into the wild and the similarities are just too many and obvious for people to not at least think about it for a bit. But the film also looks into the near future and what doing nothing will lead to. But not in any sappy, liberal way - the message is its gonna take lots of guts and courage and it will probably scare the living sh*t out of you.One more thing: V for Vendetta introduces a completely new side of politics to all those without much political consciousness. If you go to see the movie, you might just come out a changed person. You might not have gone through the hell that Evey Hammond did (a very effective plot twist, my awe is squared) to experience a sufficient enough radicalisation to become a hard-core Marxist-quoting revolutionary overnight, but again, it introduces a side of politics sometimes completely alien. In any country where the people have no real interest in voting in 'democratic' elections (like Australia where I live for example), I hope they go ""oh, so that's what politics really is ..."". If that is their reaction, the Wachowski brothers would most likely see their film as a success.Sirs, you have more than made up for selling out with Matrix 2 and 3. I am in awe ... 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Why V is so good,"V for Vendetta was an original movie that has substance. The comic book that inspired this film has many deep seeded issues that I feel we all can relate too. There was so much rich dialog that made you think, and the action had you on the edge of your seat or at least mine definitely. Hugo Weaving did a great role choice to be V he also made the character believable. I loved V for Vendetta in the theaters and can not wait to own it at home. It was a well thought out film that has an edge and was very serious about what the world can become. I knew that this movie was going to be good once I found out a little bit of background about it but I had no idea it was going to be as good as it was. More movies should take the approach of V for Vendetta because it had great screen shots, once again dialog, and a unique story line. V for Vendetta is a movie you will want to watch over and over and over again.

Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that?,"I was fortunate enough to watch this on the opening night. Having returned from the cinema, just a few hours after it ended, and with the movie still fresh in my mind, I write this review. My main interest in the film was and remains that the graphic novel upon which it is based was written by Alan Moore, arguably one of the best comic writers and without a shadow of doubt one of my favorites. Allow me to address the fellow fans for a moment; a lot of the story is intact(if the conflict is shifted, with measurable loss of effect, to the current political climate, rather than Moore's original, anarchy versus government), though some is changed around to being more visual(even though it does have images, the original comic book is still that... a book. Words can convey more depth than moving visuals with few exceptions, and the transition from one medium to another, it is pointless to deny, requires some changes). However, several images are recreated to the very last detail(something I haven't seen the likes of which since Sin City, which used the comic as storyboards, something I suspect may have also been the case here, at least to a certain extent. I recognized so much. Some subplots and such are cut for length and pacing, but they did fair in keeping all that they could without it being difficult to keep track of for new viewers(I watched it with three people who had never seen a single frame of the comic, and each of them 'got it', and enjoyed it, just as I... one asked where he could get the comic itself). And I'm very happy to tell you that the famous torture sequence hasn't been removed; if my memory of the comic serves me right... is hasn't even been trimmed. The first trailer told me this, and ever since I saw it, I've been eagerly anticipating its premiere, and I don't regret hyping myself up for watching it in the least. Albeit, that trailer(and the following one, even more-so) also claimed that the film was action-packed... something one of my fellow viewers accepted as true, and expected. He didn't leave disappointed, though, merely surprised. Know, dear potential viewer and reader of this review, that this is not an 'action' film/flick... don't go to see this expecting constant fight scenes. If you watched The Matrix and all you saw were the fight scenes... don't watch this. There's considerably less action. What there is, however, is rather remarkable... it's clear that these are the people behind aforementioned film, and it's clear that they read and dig the comic, and comics in general. The visuals are breathtaking. I don't remember when I was last gripped by a film like I was by this one. The direction is quite good, although there are points where you can tell that the man in the chair has not sat there before, as well as the fact that he had strong guidance from the Wachowski brothers. The plot is excellent. The pacing is near perfect. The acting was flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The film is very involving and intense, it pulls you in and doesn't let go until the credits roll. It's very stylish and cool. The film relies greatly on dialog(which also means that most of the humor is verbal, British... marvelous choice, if I do say so myself), much like the novel... although some things are obviously more visual than the source material. The Voice of London gets a face and V's fights get easier on the eyes(and obviously, the explosions are very much there). What I really enjoyed, while watching this movie, was that it was hardly toned down... it was almost all there. The perverseness, the 'different' human beings, and, most importantly, the message. The moral. The question that is asked, that we must consider: Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that? I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who is willing to open their minds to the themes within(though the book contains more), and especially fans of Alan Moore, the Wachowskies and/or comic books. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Spot-On Movie for our Time,"Though the packaging of both the theatrical release and the DVD suggest that V FOR VENDETTA is yet another action hero comic book foray, nothing could be further from fact. James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.Swooping out of the time in England in 1605 for some background as to the mission of our hero, V (Hugo Weaving) appears as a masked grinning man who uses terrorist tactics to take down a British government as corrupt as any one might imagine. The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry. One remnant of the government's destructive forces is a beautiful girl Evey (Natalie Portman) who rapidly becomes V's apprentice/accomplice in the fight against the corrupt powers. The police (Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) work to capture V and Evey, thinking they are terrorists out to destroy the government. But the heads of state (John Hurt et al) fanatically attempt to brainwash the populace through the television madness of a talk show host. Gradually the horrors of the current regime are revealed and it is a case of the good guys versus the bad guys with Portman and Weaving towering in importance by the end of the film. The quality of acting form this fine cast (including such actors as Stephen Fry among many others) is first class, making the potential silliness of the story dissolve into horror.Well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking. It is an entertaining, fine movie - but it is more importantly a red flag warning we should all be heeding! Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Remember, Remember...","""Remember remember the fifth of November The Gunpowder, Treason and plot. I see no reason why The Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot...""All I have to say is WOW! What a great great movie. This truly is an important movie. A shadowy freedom fighter known only as ""V"" uses terrorist tactics to fight against his totalitarian society. Upon rescuing a girl from the secret police, he also finds his best chance at having an ally. That's all I'm going to go into for plot details.I've never read any of the graphic novels this is based on, so this is a review after a virgin viewing. I love this movie, plain and simple. Hugo Weaving is V and he plays the part amazingly well. Even though V's face is never shown, it doesn't need to be. Weaving uses mannerisms and has such a great voice, that sometimes you forget that it's even a mask. Natalie Portman is wonderful as well as Evey. Both of them have such a great chemistry together and it's always great when they're on screen. The rest of the cast is wonderful as well (John Hurt is amazing as well even though he's not in it all that much).This is not an action movie like the trailers portray it to be (nor is it directed by the Wachowski Brothers as some are lead to believe). It doesn't need to be though. The story, characters and events are so good, that the few action moments in the film (which are spectacular by the way) are so good, you don't need action. It's such an interesting plot too, which I won't get into because you should see it yourself. The action scenes in this are great though, especially at the very end, I got goose bumps. The end sure goes out with a bang too, it's a great great ending to a great great movie.I seriously recommend this movie. It's a very smart movie that puts story over action and characters over flashiness. This truly is an important movie that makes you think, it wants you to think and it does so wonderfully. I recommend this movie completely. It's a great first movie by James McTeigue, it's controlled very well and is a tight movie.""Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. There is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fresh and Superb,"Movies like this one do not come along all the time, but when they do they wake us up to what film mastery actually is. This film holds us speechless by the masterful acting, breathless from the action, and thinking due to the plot. It is a story that hits very close to home for those of us from the United States. While our government is nowhere near as bad as the one presented in the film, it may be steadily approaching. ""V"" is the perfect hero; a freedom fighter labeled terrorist by the government. The ideas he leaves embedded in our minds as we leave the theater alone makes this movie worth your money. The dialouge from ""V"" is amazing. Portman does an excellent job as Evey. The action, even if it is not frequent, is pulse-pounding and stellar. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie if you have not.

Of course....,"Vendetta's a completely farcial take on Orwell's 1984 with one of the worst 'acting performances' by Natalie Portman to date. Superficiality of characters, plot and politics and not even slightly in an entertaining way.Special mention must go to the cringeworthy script with a fetish for sophomore-level alliteration starting with the letter 'v'. I think Shakespeare said it best when he appeared to me in a dream last night and stated: ""AAAAaaaaaaargggghhhh"".In short, the perfect film for a fine bundle of general acclaim and fit to shelve next to other recent entries in the IMDb top250 such as Million Dollar Baby and Children of Men which most dreadfully shows the abysmal decline in good taste and cinematic appreciation which is sweeping the Earth like a virus gone berserk.So, if you thought these movies I mentioned were great, have a blast with V for Vendetta.

Inspirational Magical Majestical,"This was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen! I have been an avid film-watcher for 20 years now and rarely have I ever been so inspired and filled with life after watching a film. Everything about this movie worked for me, which is incredible given what they accomplished in a little over two hours.Most of my favorite films have several important themes mixed with an interesting plot and genuinely funny, dramatic and poignant moments. It's so refreshing to see a film not afraid to take chances and deal with issues that are so relevant to the world today. This film should be a screaming alarm to everyone who has become complacent in ANY government that cares nothing of the majority of their citizens.Sadly, however, many may need more than what happened to V to finally realize what atrocities can occur when you do not stand up for love and justice. In any case, V for Vendetta is and will always be an unequivocal classic in my eyes, one I will show to my kids someday.Oh, and the music V uses hasn't seen this great a day since Bill Murray blew up the golf course in Caddyshack.

Visionary,"Some of us read the book by Alan Moore many years ago. Some of us regard it as at least as good as his oft-lauded opus, Watchmen. Some of us were very wary indeed when we heard there was to be a film version... and even more so when it transpired that Moore himself had refused to have anything to do with it... to be credited, even.Some of us went to see it anyway and are so very glad we did. What an amazing film. In an unusual climate of heavy political movie-making comes this: a fantasy thriller with all the adventure, action and, well, silliness you could want, but nevertheless a political message you cannot ignore to boot. If anything, Moore's strident left-wing opinions are given even more weight than his own original work carries  now that the reader must find them a quarter of a century out of date. Surely, he must be proud of this film and the ingenious way it has updated his ideas to reflect the current political situation?You can pick holes, of course. I got used to Portman's imperfect accent a lot more quickly than I did the Wachowski brothers' occasionally overcooked outsider's take on scripting English characters, though. And V's introduction  all 'v'-word alliteration  is badly misconceived and had me worrying for a minute or two. But things soon settle down and though it's been a few years, I can say that almost all the major examples of Moore's brilliance that I could recall and was hoping would have been translated from the page are here on screen - meaning moments of considerable shock and horror, beauty, emotion and profundity. The double-barred-cross softening of the fascist-church imagery is a tiny niggle in the face of scenes such as: the padeophile Bishop; Evey facing her fear; the whole Valerie / The Salt Flats story; the bedside chat - victim and villain reversed; and the daring (in light of all-too-recent horrendous real-world events) inclusion of the London tube bomb, exactly as in the original.Better still, the additional/extrapolated material  lots of stuff about the Koran and Muslims being persecuted, the 'formerly United States', bird flu etc.  and the whole subplot involving Stephen Fry's character (ultimately harrowing in the extreme) are actually improvements on Moore's anti- Thatcher polemic. This story could scarcely be more relevant in the now. Sue Perkins, reviewing the film on ITV, was annoyed that the future fascist British government is depicted as having come out of the Conservative Party - fearing the film- makers had missed a trick, but in fact, herself, completely missing the subtler point that our current Labour administration (which she is not alone in deploring certain actions of), in moving the 'centre' further to the right, is indeed undermining the left-wing alternative for our democracy and making it more likely that a far-right movement such as is depicted in the film could feasibly emerge (the gods forbid). Where else would it come out of? The distopia shown in the film is precisely what the worst subset of Tory supporters  specifically Daily Mail readers  want for our country!Another critic who got it wrong was Jonathan Ross (on the BBC's Film programme). He absolutely hated V for Vendetta and urged his viewers to give it a miss. Thank goodness I didn't listen  fortunately, he'd mentioned that he found Moore's comic 'overrated', so I was able to add another 'wary' to my expectations  but on the other side of the balance. That balance is now tipping  the film magazines are awarding 3 and 4 stars out of 5, and the mixed audience I sat with on a Sunday afternoon were certainly gripped from start to finish.

More Then Lives Up to it's Predessessor,"V for Vendetta is pure gold. The style, the action, all perfect for this type of film. But by far, a stand out performance by Hugo Weaving as the mysterious masked man known only as ""V"".In a future world, London has become a totalitarian system of government, having complete control over all of it's civilians. In a shadow of what the former Soviet Union was, this is a harsh world, where fear rules the minds of the inhabitants of this once free country. Horrible atrocities are committed daily (just which ones, you'll need to see the movie for), and there is only one man who stands against it. An idea.The trailers would lead you to believe the film is action-packed, with little story, when in fact, it's just the opposite. While there are action segments (and they are PHENOMANOL) there is more then enough story to make you genuinely care for the characters portrayed on-screen. There are moments of great sympathy for the oppressed people, and there are also moments that make you want to stand up and cheer, because Weaving's performance is incredibly portrayed.V for Vendetta is a spectacular outing by the Wachowski Brothers, and more than worthy of the nine stars I have given it. It leaves everyone with a solid message, a message of how an idea that can change the world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An attempt shouldn't even have been made,"Shock horror a review that doesn't give this 10 out of 10. So why? Well, first things first; any type of mask blocks out any emotional expressions, obviously. So it is hard for any actor, even the magnificent Hugo Weaving, to pull of a character well when he can't display his emotion. Multiply the difficulty of his job of expressing emotion by one hundred when the mask is constantly grinning...cheesely.This is the main reason why 'V for Vendetta' is a poor film. It should never have been attempted on celluloid in the first place. It works on a comic book simply because there aren't long-winded dialogue scenes where the camera cuts back from Evey (Portman) to the smiling anti-hero who is meant sad, angry, in love, etc. etc. And these dialogue scenes make up the large majority of the film, accompanied by less painful but equally laborious scenes of the London bobbies trying to work out who V is (which they do not do well at). You see this would have been one of the few films that would have been better had it been 90% action and 10% chit-chat because in the action scenes the mask does work and he looks almost 'cool' (if he has the hat on to detract from his stupid hair style, without it he looks like a rampaging hormonal goth).However there is some good in 'V', the little action that is there does just about work, the story wasn't translated to an American setting which was brave of the studios and the torture scene of Evey is well done, though it is then thrown out the window for reasons I will not disclose to prevent spoilers.The thing is that by the end of 'V' your tired of the boring speeches, tired of the long-winded story and fed up it trying to be a 'clever movie' by adding the odd quote in from MacBeth and other works of literature.It probably looked good on paper (apart from the constant repetition of the word 'b*llocks' that apparently Brits use as frequently as they do where bowler hats and have handle-bar moustaches) it just doesn't work on film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Avoid If Possible.,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this film. I liked the graphic novel and was interested to see what kind of film would result from it.Considering that the script for this movie was already written in comic book form by Alan Moore all those years ago I would have expected the Wachowski's to retain a lot of his work in their script as the story contains some very well-written parts. However, even parts of Alan Moore's original plot have been poorly re-written by the Wachowskis; for which there seems to be no good reason. The Wachowski's writing is very, very poor in place of it. I cite V's first speech as a striking example.Secondly, Natalie Portman's poor accent skills. I read in an interview that she spent a month with a dialogue coach in order to get it right. Who've it was, she should be asking for her money back. Eventually, after swinging through Australian and South African she manages to settle into an impersonation of Keira Knightly. It really grated on my nerves.I would say that this is one film to avoid if possible, unless you want to spend next bonfire night burning effigies of the Wachowski brothers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good but could have been better,"Having watched the trailers I was looking forward to this simply because it looked so different to anything I had seen recently.Ignoring the bad press reviews I determined to see the film and was not disappointed.The dystopian story, as most people will know, is set predominantly in London during the near-future.England (Scotland and Wales are not referred to.) is a police state. Of the rest of the world we know little, only that the US has collapsed into Civil War.The plot centres around a mysterious but enigmatic freedom fighter named only ""V"" (Weaving) and his relationship with Evey Hammond (Portman). V takes Evey under his wing and proceeds to open her eyes to the true state of the world but at the same time she is subjected to his mind games.The world-weary Inspector Finch (played excellently by Stephen Rea) dominates the sub-plot as he investigates the dark past of the party members that V is theatrically bumping off. In his attempts to find V, Finch is ultimately fumbling his way to a far greater truth, this is, of course, V's intention.V's actions are civilian friendly but morally ambiguous; he mercilessly kills security men and former workers at a detention centre without remorse. His significance lies in the influence he has on the public, especially Evey and Finch. Both have changed by the end of the film and become ready to embrace a new future. Similarly Londoners, who once were blind or chose to ignore the problems of society gradually become aware of the ""state they are in"".Weaving is outstanding in his larger-than-life role. Weaving manages to convey incredible emotion for a man constrained to acting a mask. Portman put in a good performance and I was pleased to see she has regained her abilities since seemingly suffering from an acting lobotomy in the Star Wars films. Though her accent is convincing it is clearly false and though it never slips the range of her voice is clipped by the need to maintain it. I also think it is too posh for one that supposedly spent five years in a ""re-education centre"", unless that meant she was sent to a private boarding school.Rea's understated performance contrasts well with the flamboyant V and is perfect for the role. Also worth mentioning is Tim Piggot-Smith as the unpleasant Mr Creedy. John Hurt hams it up as the disgusting Chancellor and Stephen Fry basically plays himself, again.Fans of the Matrix will spot the Wachkowski's slick stylish influence on the film as well as the indulgent script. People expecting the Matrix will, however, be disappointed. Apart from a well choreographed fight scene at the end this is a film about words and ideas rather than martial arts and CGI. They would perhaps prefer Batman Begins. Which, similar in many ways to V, has weaker dialogue but is more action focused. Having read the graphic novel upon which this is based I was pleased to see many of the ideas given expression on the big screen. Some elements of the novel have even been improved. Sadly much of the central theme of the novel has been abandoned and simplified for mass consumption. The main plot has been ""updated"" and I would say over-complicated to make it more relevant to the current situation.Finally the film contains the usual problems associated with predictions of the future. For example why are they still using Dell computers if the US has collapsed? Technology (cars, phones TVs) has not moved on in 20 years. Evey claims she has not eaten butter since she was a child but everyone in the film lives in spacious London houses and have access to luxuries such as Champagne and Tobacco. These are minor irritations though.In conclusion it was a thought-provoking enjoyable film but may suffer from being too focused on the present. It could have posed deeper questions about the themes which the novel is based around; Anarchy and Order, Fear and Love. Vengeance and Forgiveness.Contact me if you want to discuss it more, or would like a link to the comic/website.ingrey@hotmail.co.uk",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Awesome film... BUT,"Before I say anything about the film I want to make it clear that I thoroughly enjoyed this film.It wasn't some mindless action film as few people I know feared. instead it is an emotional and thought provoking film that raised interesting politic topics. however I was rather disheartened in which the way the original graphic novel was ""adapted"" for the big screen... wasn't so much adapted as almost re-written in places! some important parts were changed drastically and even omitted in some cases! but I can understand this as certain aspects of the film that had been different from the comic (drug use and prostitution) are very risky to be shown to the mass public.But all in all this will become a cult classic and comes highly recommended from me! comic adaptations are the way forward, step aside X-Four and Fantastic Men (on purpose that! :P )... make room for Dwight and V!Oh before I forget V's fight sequence at the end?... sublime!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Wearing a very cool mask and twirling ultra sleek ginsu knives, V takes revenge on those who experimented on him and others with a very nasty virus. Along the way, he stumbles on a real cutie in Evey (Natalie Portman) who just happens to be the offspring of some infamous revolutionaries. The relationship between V and Evey is the heart of the film and very interesting to follow. They are being chased by a detective played by Stephen Rea who seems to be smarter than the Orwellian dictator played by a way-overacting John Hurt. His characters name is Adam Sutler, which is (not coincidently) similar to Adolph Hitler.The story is kind of unique in that it works in so many aspects of history while staying centered on our fictional characters. Something tells me the fun game to play once this is released on DVD will be counting the ""V"" references throughout. Early on, Weaving has a soliloquy that must utilize 93% of the V words in Webster's. It is quite a challenge to follow the first time through. In addition to the spoken V words, the number of ""V""isuals is astonishing.Don't be disappointed that we never get to see Portman (with her Sinead O'Connor look) actually fight. This is not really a huge action picture, although there are some stunning moments. This is much more of a political statement that can be twisted to fit any country at any time. The Wachowski brothers once again break new ground and it is definitely worth watching a time or two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Comic,"I skimmed through some of the comments left by those who've seen the movie, and I find no one mentioning the book.Between those who love it and those who hate it, I can't help but wonder how many have actually read the book. I personally had read the comic only days before seeing the film, so it was very fresh in my mind in the theater.The comic was one of the best books I've ever read. My personal top 5, probably. I find it a little hard to judge the movie without comparing it to the (superb) comic, so I might not be the best reviewer of the film. I thought it was a good translation of the overall PLOT, but the SPIRIT of the book only managed a half-translation (and sadly, the lost half was the better half).I'll save a play-by-play comparison until I know if anyone will know what I'm talking about. And I don't want to spoil the book for anyone.Those who loved the film, give the book a go. I think you'll find many layers of depth added to the story. Those who hated the film, I implore you to not judge the book by its example. We were denied so much character exploration and political philosophy. And V was so much more enjoyable.""He looks at me like I'm an insect. Like I'm a thing on a slide. Oh God.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Simple-minded political message is overcome by events,"As a comic book movie, I would have been inclined to give ""V"" an average rating but for its repellent politics. A key scene is when a gay TV host (played by Stephen Fry) comes out to heroine Evey (Natalie Portman). This scene is used to fill in the political background of the story. Apparently, all the evil that ensued in the U.K. came about through the War on Terror: ""America's War."" It is not implausible that a long-running war could lead to curtailment of civil liberties  this actually happened in the U.K. during the long battle against IRA terrorism and those freedoms have never been regained. If the movie stopped there, it would be tolerable but it doesn't.As we know, ""V"" was set to come out November 2005 but the subway suicide bombings conducted by Islamic terrorists was deemed to be too much like the final scene of the movie in which the Parliament building is blown up. Now that I've seen the movie, I think there was another reason. The gay TV host has a centuries-old Koran in his secret room and talks about how lovely the writing is. Never mind that, as a gay man, in theocratic Iran (currently the number one state supporter of terrorism) he would be executed. The fact is, this scene must still be jarring for British viewers, even months after the suicide bombings and the more recent Danish cartoon demonstrations. It is so politically tin-eared and clueless as to be breathtaking.The Wachowski's should have used the delay in releasing the movie to cut that scene, which has so clearly been overcome by events. That they didn't is yet another indication of the insularity of the Hollywood crowd.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent (with some reservations),"Well, just returned from seeing the movie... again.As a movie, all on its own, I liked it. Obviously, having just watched it a 2nd time is as many days:) If you're looking for a direct translation, you're out of luck. Evy is played differently, other characters are amalgamated, sub-plots eliminated, events transpire out of order, etc -- standard comic-to-movie fare. However, even though much of V's dialog is changed, Hugo Weaving brings V to life in brilliant fashion (although the ""movie V"" is less vicious than the ""book V"").All the core moments of the book are there, and some scenes are taken verbatim (or close to it) right from the printed page. The general feel has been updated, and subject matter as well to make the story more contemporary.And therein lies my only major complaint. I have no issue with a film maker creating a *new* film, and injecting it with a current, topical nature (as George Lucas did) but I'm disappointed that the Wachowski Bros felt they had to so alter Alan Moore's work. I can totally understand Moore's reaction to the script, and the simplifying for general movie audiences.If you haven't read the book in years (I re-read it today for the first time I'm MANY years), or not at all, you may want to see the movie first - otherwise, you may be disappointed. Try to take the movie as an entity unto itself.-JeffVI VERI VENIVERSUM VIVUS VICI",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent movie,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this movie. The previews being shown on TV make it look like an action movie. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of action that takes place but there is a lot more to it. This movie makes you think as well. It was nice to see Natalie Portman in a role that was so far removed from Padme (""Star Wars""). She does an excellent job. Hugo Weaving (Elrond from the Lord of the Rings trilogy) is also brilliant, he has to rely on his acting skill and not his expressions since you never see his face beyond the mask. This movie is an excellent thriller and I would highly recommend it, if you do have a problem with graphic violence however you might like to stay away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good,"This film is not quite what I expected but was still one of the best I've seen. Yet it does have certain holes. For example, for all this environment of suppression and oppression blah blah blah, we see very few or no actual examples of those really happening during the movie. Sutler does not really come across as someone you'd hate, fear and despise, rather, he looks sad and pathetic. The second thing is that too much attention is given to explicitly portraying and exaggerating current political topics namely, the Koran being banned and the priest being..you know. They look too intentional in terms of finger pointing. This movie does not have too much action so don't go expecting the same. Lets hope that you are'nt already too familiar with Shakespearean dialogue too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Marvelous!,"I would like to say a few words about the movie i saw a couple of hours ago. V for Vendetta. At first i would like to emphasize the fact that i am a huge fan of Natalie Portman. I think that she will live to become one of the best actresses of her, and thank god mine, time. So don't get me wrong if i am a bit over-thrilled about this movie and not objective at all. I was too with Leon The Professional and she was only 14 years old. Back to my story then, i don't want to tire you with my obsessions.I think the movie is about ideas. About the liberty we people have to express our opinions freely nowadays. It's about hope for good things to come in all dire circumstances. When all hope had faded..I found many parallelisms in the movie with our world today. There were scenes when the Chancellor made speeches, that looked awful familiar with Hitler. Same colors, same passion combined with insanity, same intensity in the man's face, same rush for power. The destruction of the parliament, besides it's historic reference to England was in some way similar to the destruction of 9th of September. The fear that is brooding in the minds of the people of this world today, is the same fear that is being harvested in the minds of the people in the movie. I believe that everybody could and found that parallelism in the theater today. It was quite clear at that point that the director wanted to say something more than the comic was trying to accomplish. ""Hope is a good thing, probably the best of things""(Tim Robins - Shawshank Redemption). A line in the movie moved me, i think it moved a lot of people. ""People should not be afraid of the power of their government, the government should be afraid of the power of their people."" We see in the face of the redeemer (Hugo Weaving) a man, who is trying to wake his fellow citizens from the hibernation of their minds. To change things as they once were. He does it not only for his personal revenge, but to shake the others around him. To make a difference. Hugo says in the movie: ""I am wearing the mask for so long, i no longer remember who's beneath it."" A government that is feeding fear to it's people with misinformation, a perfect brooding machine whose crops will benefit only little. It's all about control. People with power will become more powerful, only to produce more fear over the weak-minded. I cried when William Wallace yelled Freedom in Braveheart. One person CAN change things. But it is not the person who changes things, it's the idea that he carries within. I wish i could say more about V, but i have already tired you. Maybe i'm just wrong and this was a movie about kniVes and it should have more fight scenes and more Natalie Portman.But that's just me. What difference can one man make?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Perfection,"This Shakespearean-esquire instant classic gives you a world that appears to be the collaborated work of Edgar Allen Poe, Tim Burton, and Alfred Hitchcock, although it is not.It feels darkly uplifting, while offering you the light. I found this work to be the perfect reflection of a contemporary society (although contemporary time is NOT the setting for this production) on the brink of self destruction via their own attempts to better their existence through the forced sacrifice of others.The main plot demonstrates the vicarious venue of a velvety-voiced villain whose verve and victorious visions vie to vent the vastly varlotous valet of vipers.This work is not merely entertaining, it is thought-provoking and deeply disturbing in a way which almost calls for anarchy from the masses against a totalitarian regime which is run inside the freedoms of Democracy.More drama than anything else, this work delivers great performances, beautiful execution, and a lovely flowing, blood-soaked plot.It rates a 9.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

V for vendetta better than predicted,"In an industry where DC Comics and Marvel pump out comic book based movies almost bi-monthly, I was hesitant to try V out. However, after experiencing this powerful movie, I am extremely glad I chose the way I did. While V did have many ""comic book"" aspects to it, do not confuse it with The Hulk, Spiderman, or even Batman. This movie had a distinct character of its very own. V had some incredibly well made scenes, and extremely well developed plot, and some of the best character involvement I have experienced in a movie. You get drawn in by the dark, idealistic ways of the symbolic terrorist, by the girl who has lost it all, and by the people set on doing whats right in their hearts and minds.If you have reservations, much like I did at first, of passing this movie off as another comic-based mishap, I urge you to reconsider.

Look,"I'm from San Francisco. When I went to see V for Vendetta, I had heard both positive and negative comments about this movie. Most of the comments I had heard, however, were positive. So I went to see this movie expecting it to be good. My brother and I were both sorely disappointed.People think that this film is brilliant. The truth is, even the author of the original graphic novel, Alan Moore, was not willing to cooperate with the conversion of his work into a screenplay by the Wachowski brothers. The screenwriters I find far gone from professional, this movie rushed and executed terribly by James McTeigue, and an all-around terrible movie. Though I always agree with anti-war and anti-totalitarian politics, this I find an ignorant liberal stab at its own party and nothing more than a pretentious action flick.Maybe I saw the wrong movie, who knows, but the glowing sign said ""V for Vendetta"". It's strange, really, whenever I tell anyone I didn't like it, they say that I didn't understand it, that I don't understand revolutions. I find it kind of funny that they think that's how revolutions work.

"Remember, remember the fifth of November","Remember, remember, the fifth of November, The gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.Take the stories ""1984"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"" and combine with Phantom of the Opera, and you have V for Vendetta; A Fantastic new movie from the creators of The Matrix starring Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving. Based on a 1982 comic book story by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, V for Vendetta tells the story of the world about 15 years or so from now, and how it quickly became a world of despair and tyranny, created by a compliant public, in hopes that the government can save them from everything they fear.Most of the population accepts what they feel is a necessary loss of freedom in the hard times the world is facing. Those that don't are usually branded terrorist or enemies of the state and ""black bagged"" in the middle of the night by government agents, never to be heard from again. One man, known only as ""V"" (Weaving), refuses to live in such a world. Believing that ""people should not fear their governments, governments should fear their people"", V single handedly purses a vendetta for liberty against those individuals in power responsible for the new world order. In a very ""John Galt"" like address to the nation, V starts to shake the citizens from their complacency, helping them to realize they only have themselves to blame for the situation they are in, but it is also only their willingness that allows it to continue. Circumstances tie V to Evey Hammond (Portman), a young woman who knows what is going on in the world is wrong, but is too scared to do anything about it. The story follows her individual journey from fear to realizing freedom of the mind is more important than even life itself. This movie may be build as an action film, but I see it as a love story. Not in the traditional sense of between two people, but in a Randian way between people and ideas.This movie is one of the most powerful movies about liberty I have ever seen. I have seen this movie twice now and both times I have had to keep myself from standing up and cheering at the end. I am very heartened by the positive response I have heard from everyone I have talked to that has seen this movie. V for Vendetta is rated ""R"", but I would still recommend it to anyone old enough to understand the ideas presented in this film. The second time I saw it I brought my 15 year old son, and I would have brought my 13 year old daughter, if I thought she would have understood it. To all my family and friends that don't quite understand why I am involved in the libertarian movement, this movie is for them. These are the reasons I devote so much time and energy to that cause. Seeing these ideas so strongly displayed in a major motion picture, gives me renewed hope that people still place a value on liberty of more than mere lip service. To anyone that supports our government's suppression of freedom in the name of a ""War on Terror"", this movie is also for them.

this wonderful film may now be illegal,"Why are films of comics and graphic novels among the most thought-provoking made today? I saw this with my family at the very last screening in Nottingham and wasn't sure what to expect, as some of the reviews were pretty damning. The ideas sounded interesting, however, and the French website looked terrific, so I thought we'd give it a go.It was totally gripping, both in terms of plot and action (I hadn't read the graphic novel so didn't know where it was going) and in terms of the high-level intellectual engagement it demanded. It is probably more relevant now than when it was originally due for release. There were moments when it evoked recent events and debates. It got us all thinking about democracy and the relationship between government and people - and about our responsibility to resist injustice and how this should be done. (I'm a pacifist, by the way. I'm also a woman in my fifties so not the obvious viewer for this film.) However, this film may now be illegal in Britain.

V for re-View,"The latest film from the Wachowski Brothers, this adaptation of Alan Moore's dark, brilliant graphic novel is the movie that this country needs to see. For the uninitiated, V for Vendetta is the story of a scarred, masked vigilante fighting against the forces of fascist Britain in the year 2015. Inspired by the actions of 17th century proto-terrorist Guy Fawkes (who tried to blow up Parliament in an act still known as the Gunpowder Plot, V moves that story forward into a nightmare world, where politicians control the airwaves, music and art are banned and the subways are shut down so that the populace may be better controlled. Sound familiar, dear reader?Hugo Weaving gives the performance of his career--part of the fun of this is it's like The Matrix but you get to root for Agent Smith. Concealed for the entire film behind a grinning Guy Fawkes mask--itself eerily reminiscent of the current spate of Burger King commercials, V encounters Evey (pronounce it) and enlists her aid in his explosive crusade. Weaving is physically elegant, and uses his voice through the mask to amazing effect--the performance recalls Andy Serkis' work as Gollum and King Kong.As Evey, Natalie Portman is here the professional actress who first dazzled us in Leon. Surrounded by a solid cast, including Stephen Fry, John Hurt, and Stephen Rea, the movie resonates with echos of great art works that have gone before it, from Beethoven's opera ""Fidelio"" to the Ring Cycle and the Matrix trilogy. Director James McTeague keeps the action moving along, but the viewer must also pay attention to the dialogue and narration--this is a dense movie and your concentration is required.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Interesting but not amazing,"V for Vendetta is not faultless by any means. I thought it got a little ""soggy"" in the middle during the prison interlude, a series of scenes which would have benefited from some livening up and editing, and the movie was both too wordy and too worthy in places, but overall, I thought it a good investment of two hours of my time and almost ten bucks of my money. Hugo Weaving's performance as V was astonishing, hidden as he was behind a mask the whole time, yet still able to covey pathos and purpose. While credit must be given to some intelligent writing, most of it was down to Weaving's sheer physical ability as an actor. His voice was both seductive and sinister and his presence never less than compelling. And Natalie Portman just gets better with everything I see her in. Stephen Fry also stood out as a gay TV host in a future Britain where homosexuality is once again a serious no-no.I came to this film as a Brit who grew up celebrating Guy Fawkes Night (or Bonfire Night as it's more often called in colloquial English), and the playground rhyme Remember, Remember the Fifth of November is for me immediately evocative of chilly, foggy November nights from my childhood, shivering crowds gathered around a bonfire and letting off fireworks, hands clutching steaming mugs of hot chocolate to ward off the cold. Few of us gave any thought at all to the historical origins of this strange celebration; we simply seized the opportunity to indulge in public displays of pyromania, united in our rather subversive love of a good fire. Would Brits turn up in their thousands to watch the Houses of Parliament burn down? It's an interesting question. I rather think they might. (And I'm not going to get into the politics of 17th century Britain and the Protestant v Catholic debate or the recent appalling terrorist attacks.) The connection between Guy Fawkes and V in this movie, may be a little lost on other nations, but it makes the obvious point that terrorism has been around a very long time (with a variety of names), and that the old adage ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"" is as true now as it has ever been.A future Britain has become a fascist state where information is tightly controlled and the population is kept in line by fear of the chaos and anarchy existing elsewhere. Or maybe chaos doesn't exist everywhere else? Who knows when a few people control the media and the populace prefer to spend their time watching brain-dead TV dross? Does this ring a bell? (Presumably the Internet and communication satellites have been closed down in V's Britain.) Undesirables of every type are rounded up and shipped off to secret facilities where they are the guinea pigs for various biological warfare experiments. A lone survivor of the worst of these facilities, a character known only as V, sets about single handedly bringing down the government and setting the population free by exposing them to the truth. And by blowing up a lot of London and killing not a few people.The movie is interesting as a contrast to the Wachowski brothers previous Matrix trilogy. Fewer acrobatic displays, more old-fashioned explosions. And the plot is easier to follow but perhaps not as original. I have never seen the comic book from which it is derived, so I can't comment on the interpretation. But one thing I do like about the Wachowski's movies is that although they are full of stunning special effects, they are ultimately character driven, and we can get a sense of empathizing with the people at the centre of the plot. That's something too often missing from science fiction  or perhaps future fiction, as V for Vendetta might more correctly be called. I enjoyed it, and I think I could happily watch it again. My teenage son, perhaps closer to the target audience, thought it wonderful.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Remember Remember the 5th of November,"A hero sporting a mask eerily reminiscent of the king from the Burger King commercials (actually a Guy Fawkes mask here) who quotes Shakespeare. Natalie Portman with a shaved head. Hilarious allusions to Fox News and the Bushes. A comic book (pardon me, graphic novel) adaptation with an actual idea in mind and a strong political statement. What's not to like? ""V for Vendetta"" is a better than average genre flick that is as enjoyable for its silliness (when we first meet ""V"" he is a bit too loquacious and seems to exist only to ramble off tongue twisters) as it is for its high-mindedness. The political message may not be so bold or new (totalitarianism is bad, and we the people should rally against it through IDEAS) but it's timely and well played here.Natalie Portman does a decent British accent in what is basically a natural progression of her breakthrough role in ""The Professional"" where she once again ""falls"" for a vigilante with a heart of gold in the name of vengeance. Roles in forgettable quirky comedy/dramas and her interesting turn in ""Closer"" aside, this is really her first chance to act since she was a child, and it's a joy to watch her here. It really is amazing how wasted and ill-used she was in the recent ""Star Wars"" prequels. This is the perfect type of role for her and she carries the film through its sillier parts to make it the stuff of high drama.""V"" doesn't have the visual chutzpah of ""Sin City"" or the AHA! factor of the original ""Martix"" or the deep psychological complexity of ""Batman Begins,"" but it's full of great acting, big ideas, and a dense and satisfying plot played out to a proper conclusion. Brush aside some of the British stereotypes (everyone says ""bollucks"" and the people are bit too pleased by a Jack Benny style comedy sequence meant to poke fun at their Chancellor and his war on terror), some clunky pacing in the beginning, and a missed golden opportunity for a release date (remember the 5th of November? unfortunately the studio didn't) and let yourself be entertained.

Amazing,"This is probably one of the only films I have seen that deserve a full 10/10. It is absolutely jaw-dropping and an amazing piece which is a perfect example of pure cinema. I have not read any of the comics so I went to the film with no knowledge of it and no preconceptions of what it should be like. And I am glad I didn't. Hugh Weaving was well cast and he gave the character of V great charisma, wit and made him strangely attractive ( although that could just be me). Natalie Portman's character Evey was good and provided the typical love interest but the way the film ends, with V dying just after they realise how they feel about each other was well shot and portrayed the emotions felt by both characters. However, I don not think that she is a particularly good actress as some of her scenes are quite wooden, although this could also just be the fact that her lines weren't as interesting or as well written as V's. In general, however, the film is astonishing.

England Prevails,"'V for Vendetta' is set a near future London which, in appearance, is not so different from today - except this is a brutal totalitarian dictatorship where the secret police break down doors in the middle of the night, put black bags over their suspects' heads and then drag them off - never to be seen again.This society is ruled over by the grim ageing face of High Chancellor Strutter (John Hurt), who is only ever seen on giant TV screens. The nemesis of this regime is an anonymous terrorist called V (Hugo Weaving), who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and begins the film by blowing up the Old Bailey, then declares he will do the same to Parliament on November 5th. Unwittingly involved with him are the TV PA Evy (Natalie Portman) - who V saves from being raped by two police thugs - and pursuing him is the downbeat but decent police inspector Finch (Stephen Rea).The movie has its origins as an Alan Moore graphic novel, but it also recalls those other dystopian classics like 1984, BRAZIL and FATHERLAND, especially the latter with Finch uncovering a dark secret hidden by the state - the germ warfare attack which lead to Strutter's rise was engineered by Strutter's party and that V was the only survivor of the same biological experiments.As well as being scary and creepy, satirical elements feature prominently. I like Roger Allam's manic right-wing TV pundit who ends his nightly rants with the blessing ""England prevails"". Also Stephen Fry as a gay chat show host who satirises Strutter in a Benny Hill-type sketch and subsequently disappears after a visit by the secret police.Amidst the bleakness, there is hope. V turns Strutter's own Police Chief (a nasty Tim Piggot Smith) against the Chancellor, followed by a mass public uprising on November 5th with the citizens of London descending on Parliament wearing Guy Fawkes masks. V dies, but Evy places his body in a tube train loaded with explosives and sends it hurtling towards Parliament.If 1984 was a projection of 1940s fears, then V FOR VENDETTA is a projection onto an imagined future of early 21st century fears about the erosion of civil liberties. Curiously - like CHILDREN OF MEN - in this future England has survived but the United States has ceased to exist (it's now the world's biggest leper colony).",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A good movie, but with dangerous ideas.","This film focuses on the mysterious figure V, a masked without name or identity that stands against the English government. Everything takes place in a dystopian future, where parliamentary democracy gave way to a totalitarian one-party government, based on a strongly nationalist, repressive and ultra-conservative ideology. Inspired by a catholic conspiracy of the seventeenth century (the Gunpowder Plot), V declares himself a defender of democracy, starts a terror campaign against the government and incites the people to revolt against dictatorship. But, what no one knows is that V is driven by a desire of vengeance linked to his mysterious past. By his side is Evey Hammond, a young woman who is saved by V and eventually become close to him.The film is an adaptation of a comic book written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd in the eighties. It was directed by James McTeigue, who also directed the ""Matrix"" trilogy and that seems to have a particular taste for Orwellian dystopias. The cast is headed by Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portmann in the roles of V and Evey, having been at a great level and toasted the audience with excellent performances. Very interesting are also some dialogs and talks, in particular the way that V introduces himself before Evey in the beginning of the film, where almost every word he says begin with the letter V. The character was able to transcend their individuality and become a symbol of struggle, with a gentle touch of anarchism. Such a strong symbol that, even today, we see masks similar to those used in this film in many protests around the world.The only negative note: this film does, although perhaps without that intention, a ""defense"" that the ends justify the means, and no matter the destruction of public buildings, works of art and historical monuments when we are looking, through this gesture, to defend an idea or cause that we thought to be important. However, this is terrorism, and the people who does it are that fanatics that we used to condemn in other movies and in real life, which makes this idea too dangerous to be ""supported"" by films like this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
I was impressed..,"Great movie.. I liked it a lot. I really wasn't expecting much since the Matrix series was little more than a brainless special effects reel.But this film, this one is good. Not only is Vendetta entertaining but it's also socially important. Like ""A Handmaid's Tale"", it's something everyone (at the very least, within the United States) should see and take consideration of.All the actors were great, the script was surprisingly good, and I have the feeling Natalie Portman's shaved head will start a trend or two.""A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having."" - V",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Beautiful Film-Quite enjoyable -I highly recommend it.,"I was torn in exactly what rating to give this movie. I chose a 7 only because 10 would be perfection & I wouldn't go so far as to say this movie was perfect. I thought the acting was a 9.5 by the two leads (Portman,Weaving). Just listening to the lines delivered by ""V"" was almost musical it was so beautifully done. Natalie Portman is a delight in anything she is in. She simply raises the bar for the other actresses in her age group. In this film she displays a maturity beyond her years which she has conveyed before (see-""Beautiful Girls""). My only problem with this movie; & it is a minor one, is that it seemed a tad long. Perhaps an editing issue with me. That is what had me wavering between a 7-8. The supporting cast was fine if not outstanding. They were all very adequate in their roles. I really enjoyed the cinematography of this film-just lovely to watch.

Terrible,"This film is easily one of the worst I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Loud and overbearing, lacking in any subtly or nuance, heavy-handed message, repetitious and drawn-out. At so many points in the movie, I thought to myself, ""Ok, I get it already, please move along."" It got to a point where if it cut back to John Hurt barking at his subordinates from his giant video monitor one more time, I'd be heading for the exits.In almost all cases, I can understand why critics and/or the public enjoy a film that I dislike, but this case baffles me. I can only imagine that with such a large number of people currently in disagreement with the decisions/actions of the US government and others, a story of rebellion satiates their state of unrest.However, I fail to see the entertainment value of watching a guy who reminds me of one of the puppets from Mr. Roger's Land of Make-Believe go from The Phantom of the Opera to Betty Crocker to The Matrix's Neo, all the while prattling on using alliteration and wordplay meant to be clever and thought-provoking, but it's just tedious nonsense.It's a fiasco, folks. If you can't see that, you just want a global leadership shift so badly that it's clouded your vision of what makes a good film.As awful as one of the RoboCop sequels. To see others compare it with A Clockwork Orange makes me cry.Grade: F",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Best Movie I've Seen This Year,"It is a compelling drama and a fantasy at the same time. It's one of those rare movies that leave you thinking about the world around you and how the events in the film could actually happen - or may be happening now.Of all the movies I've seen in the last 12 months, this is the only one that left me pondering today's events in view of the movie events. That's a powerful movie. But it is also entertaining and funny at times. The acting, the cinematography, the lighting, all support the plot and feel of the movie.Hugo Weaving does a tremendous job evoking emotion through a masked character (that never removes his mask).

The Revenge of an Idea,"It is not often the facade of a character can emerge from disaster to become a hero. However, there are precedents, like Phantom of the Opera, Darkman and The Hulk. They however, lack subtly. beauty, poetry or as the highbrows call it, Panache. Seeking to find an intellectual or sophisticated hero, I give you "" V ."" It is not the usual movie. Indeed, it is quite a bit more. In fact I would go so far as to proclaim it is the best film of this genera, I have seen in years. There are many special qualities of a classic film and this one has them all. There is violence, suspense, drama, revenge, romance, comedy, intrigue, excitement and of course, mystery of character. Most of all, this film has Chancellor Adam Sutlet (John Hurt) who embodies the unbridled and ruthless power of a brutal government. Arrayed against him is V, superbly and adroitly played by extremely talented Hugo Weaving. The story is that of a dark hero who is condemned to unspeakable torture and imprisonment returns from certain dead to strike terror into the heart of an established totalitarian system which created him. Using the facade of a dead anarchist, Wearing plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with the police and the dictator, using both special effects and a dazzling dexterity with knives.

Fantastic movie!,"In this day and age of tired remakes and formula films, this plot stood out as original & unpredictable. Being not familiar with the comic book source, everything was totally new to me. I truly was pleasantly surprised at some of the turns the plot made and took great enjoyment in not being able to second guess what would happen next. Further, Portman's acting ability really shines in this role. Her portrayal of Evey added a human dimension to the movie that kept this movie from being just a superficial film rendition of the comic book.

Most subversive mainstream film ever?,"We, the ""developed"" nations, are a controlled by fear. The media continuously bombards us with stories of terrorism, disease and disasters. The bigger the fear is, the more we allow our governments to control us, to dissolve our civil liberties.In various nations people can be held with no trial or charge simply for looking a certain way, having faith in non-Christian gods, or being brown and having a beard. Claw for a hand optional. These people are tortured and humiliated.Terrorism is a real threat, there is no denying it. There is only avoidance of the cause. Very little asking why, but a lot of finger pointing and knee-jerk reactions. These reactions are caused by fear but simply fuel terrorism, like a self-fulfilling prophecy it scares more and more people every day while the reactions fuel the anger of the terrorists. If we, the people, force our governments to examine and eliminate the causes of terrorism we will eliminate our own fear. This is unlikely to happen as the governments will no longer have the power to control us. The power of nightmares is strong, the politics of idealism long gone, we are firmly in the grip of the politics of fear.This may lead to the situation presented in 'V for Vendetta'. A Naziesque totalitarian government keeps a tight grip on the citizens of Britain. Evey part of the media is controlled and every event is spun for the benefit of keeping the public in fear and the government in power. Until one man decides to fight back.So is V the most subversive mainstream film to ever hit cinemas? Possibly. Is it a cheesy b-movie with bad acting and forced dialogue? Definitely ... and that's why I think it's brilliant. It's top level allows the subtext to get plastered on thick, and it's all the better for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

And there could not be a more relevant context for this message than today's strife-torn world. V represents the spirit of freedom that exists to varying extents within all of us. It is up to us to recognize the V in us. While he uses a mask to reveal his true nature, we use our own faces to hide ours! Our faces are but masks...about time we changed that! And Hugo Weaving's V really comes alive and stands larger than life! And to think Weaving accomplishes all that without ever using an actor's greatest tool, his face!

N for Nice Try,"On the surface, it doesn't seem like ""V for Vendetta"" has any more to offer than a few dozen other comic strips turned feature films. We have the tortured, brooding superhero with otherworldly powers; the beautiful damsel-in-distress who he rescues and dotes over; the over-the-top villain lusting for world domination.What distinguishes this film to some extent are the interesting twists given to these familiar roles. The superhero V (Hugo Weaving) is an anarchist-terrorist. He seems more interested in personal vengeance than in righting any wrongs. His damsel Evie (Natalie Portman) is meek and subversive. In a vicious plot twist she is transformed into a woman of substance and character.John Hurt, in a reversal of his role as Winston Smith in ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", chews ample scenery as the lead villain, Chancellor Adam Sutler. The idea of a corrupt politician is hardly new. But the totalitarian regime he presides over in the very near future is unsettling and uncomfortably plausible. All that is needed is the lemming-like allegiance of the populace that some would say is the crux of American society.Throw in adult themes such as rape and homosexuality and you have some pretty heady stuff for a comic book. Although based on a series by Alan Moore, he refused any connection to the film, claiming it wasn't true to his vision. This leaves all the credit to the producers, Larry and Andy Wachowski of ""The Matrix"" trilogy fame. Comic aficionados themselves, they again show their ability to borrow characters and plots to create their own vision.The problem with this genre is that besides action and comic buffs there isn't much for the rest of the movie-going audience to appreciate. The characters are so off the chart that it's difficult to relate to them on a level other than disbelief. Weaving does a fine job of conveying emotion from behind a Guy Fawkes mask the entire movie. But nothing in this film has the emotional impact as when Peter Weller as ""Robocop"" returns to his vacant home. Everyone could feel how Robo felt at that moment, and the connection was immediate. ""V"" is fine as entertainment, but like most comic movies it falls short, and by much more than one little inch it begs for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Showing V for Vendetta in Volatile Philippines,"Now is a particularly interesting time to show V for Vendetta in Manila Philippines.Bear with me. Let me give a thumbnail sketch of recent political history in the Philippines, which is as straightforward as cooked spaghetti.Our present President, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, is slowly growing paranoid because she wasn't properly elected. When the previous president, Joseph Estrada, was allegedly caught ""plundering"" the Philippine Treasury, people took to the streets and protested until he got kicked out and Arroyo became president. Then in 2004, Arroyo held real elections this time, to prove she could get elected and not just do a ""Gerald Ford"". She cheated, was elected, and a year later a tape recording of her practically conniving with an election official became public.Somehow because of public ennui, some savvy political spinning and sheer stubbornness, she managed to survive the crisis (barely) and held on to power.Last February 25, we were celebrating the anniversary of the February Revolution, marking the time, way back in 1986, when we peacefully kicked out Ferdinand Marcos after he'd been dictator for 20 years. During this year's February Revolution celebration, Arroyo learned of a new coup attempted, and created presidential decree 1017, saying she can close media who are saying something she doesn't like, and she can break up any mass protests. She also arrested known communists and several political opponents under the excuse that they were plotting a coup against her.Then that same weekend, the Philippine Marines barricaded themselves in their barracks and complained that their commander was unfairly linked to the coup attempt and was replaced. That was also resolved peacefully, but you get the point. The atmosphere right now is ugly. Everyone is frustrated and tense and people are in a ""dare me"" mood, their patience frayed, their tempers are on a hair trigger.I think she's ignoring this V for Vendetta at her peril. I can imagine her dismissing this ""It's only a film!""I was watching Vendetta and I was wondering about similarities. The ending was prettier than our original February Revolution, with all those matching masks, but yes, we did walk past barricades, yes the police held their fire. There were no picturesque fireworks to mark the victory, but one frail dictator in a helicopter was good enough for us. Whatever it takes.I saw the torture scenes and I remember the stories of people (some I even knew personally) who'd experienced similar things. When I was a kid, we also had curfews for a long time. We also heard of the stories of how the privileged, the people in power, had Mercedes Benzes, imported tinned goods, Gucci, Dior, all the stuff that were not only expensive, but unavailable to the politically not connected.I was watching Vendetta and I was wondering about possibilities, if we could all be outraged again, if we could remember what it was like before she came along, if we could believe that we deserve better leaders because we are not scum of the earth and I remember a saying that people deserve the leaders they elect. We don't deserve her, and we need to show it to everyone.She's one. She's scared. She's outnumbered. We're many, but dispersed and unfocused. We need to rally together around someone, some symbol.To be realistic, I don't think this movie will do it. Only the middle class watch movies. Seventy percent of the population, the poor, will watch other movies in Tagalog, or listen to the radio. Movies are bourgeois entertainment.Maybe some incident, something that will make everyone mad, like the accidental shooting of a little girl. Something will ignite the situation. Maybe in the next six months, something drastic will happen again. SHE knows it. That moled midget. It's only a matter of time.V for Vendetta, written in the 80's, read in the 90's, filmed in the new millennium, reminding me of possibilities. Hmmm....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I was laughing and riveted to the screen the whole time. I absolutely loved the line about how V preferred the percussion instruments because I knew exactly what he was referring to. I want to see this movie over and over again until I wear out the movie theater! I know the critics believed that because Hugo Weaving wore a mask the entire time, there was no emotion and expression to his performance. His performance was masterful. It takes a lot of talent to be able to convey that type of emotion only through movement and actions and through your voice, without having people see your face.

No, they merge with you in timely harmony; seep in like wine over time into the walls of an oak barrel. Best movie in 25yrs, quietly, subtly, almost surprisingly...the way it should be. Were the fireworks over the top? Maybe, but it was so good overall (even the Chief Inspector, a role player in the truest sense, was incredible and believable). Just see it, and understand. Humanity is all we really have in this physical universe, and any movie that connects us and reaches through the screen to enter our soul deserves a place in the top 250 and plenty of other movies there have no business, we all know it.

Sure, there are many dialogs, but most of them will lead you to think deeply again of how this movie correlates to the real world. Sure, there are action scenes, but they are not the main attraction. Rather, it was how V interacts with the other characters, and how they life changes with the interaction.

An Amazing journey,"Simply put, V for Vendetta is an amazing and challenging film. One wonders what Tony Blair would think of it - whether it is a glimpse of the future, made possible by Bush's war. The movie is set in the year 2020, where England is completely controlled in a dictatorship based on fear and submission by it's leader Adam Sutler(John Hurt in a Hitler-type role). The general population is kept under control by Sutler's Fingermen, pretty much criminals with a badge. Through the movie's intro, we discover that the rest of the world has succumbed to disease and chaos, and England has disassociated itself from Europe as the only ""free country"" left in the world. America is singled out as a ""diseased leper colony"" that has dissolved into civil war due to an international war they started years earlier (no guesses for which war that was). Into this world, we are introduced to Evey Hammond (played wonderfully by Natalie Portman - forget her performances in the dreadful Star Wars prequels, as here she excels). One night after a government imposed curfew, she is caught and almost raped by the Fingerman. To her rescue comes V, a masked vigilante who rescues her and transports her to safety. Evey is taken to V's secret compound, where we discover V's whereabouts and the reason for his Guy Fawkes mask, as well as his crusade for revolution. To go on would be to ruin the story for the curious, however, I must say that this movie was a breath of fresh air in a world of political (right wing) correctness. The performances in the movie are outstanding, particularly Hugo Weaving, who plays the neo-terrorist V. For a character who appears the entire movie in a mask, Weaving's voice and mannerisms provide all the personality and character you would expect from a fully faced actor. In fact in some of the scenes you forgot there is a mask at all.Simply put.

Great Graphic Novel.

However, it was far more captivating in the beginning and middle, than towards the end when it seemed the movie was trying to pack too much in. It was full of loaded ideas, but they were spread thin instead of being explored in depth. I think this movie had the potential to be very powerful, but any poignancy (and to a large extent the viewer's ability to sympathize with V) was lost in the grandiosity and self-importance this film projected.

Planing to make himself and intentions known to the British people on midnight November 5, V, Hugo Weaving, first rescues young British national TV employee Evey, Natalie Portman, from two government security men who are about to have her arrested for being outside on the street after curfew.V takes Evey with him onto a London rooftop as the Old Baily Building in London is blown to pieces by explosives that he planted there to the music of Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture. That results in the British dictator Chancellor Adam Sutler,John Hurt, having a fit ordering his entire army of security, as well as the British military, to find who ever did it and then bring him to justice; Which is a kangaroo trial conducted by the state without a jury.The next day V breaks into the government controlled TV studio in London and after dispatching a squad of security men goes on the air telling the Britsh people that he'll be at war with Sutler's regime with the final reckoning coming next November 5 ""Guy Fawkes Day"". It's then when he'll destroy the British Parliament Building that Fawkes attempted, but failed, to do back in 1605.The movie ""V for Vendetta"" mirrors what's happening now in the world with terrorism as the weapon of choice by the likes of Osama Bin-Ladin & Co. and has V using these same hit-and-run tactics against the British Government that he feels has betrayed and enslaved the British people. Enormously successful in his battle against the Sutler regime V nevertheless is a one man army with no one, but Evey, joining him in his fight. Which makes him a bit more then just a human being but someone with superhuman powers who can take on dozens of opponents and defeat them without as much as breaking into a sweat.We get to know V's background in a number of flashbacks that indicate that he was the subject of a government experiment that went wrong that left him scared for life. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and Zorro-like hat V strikes us as someone out of the 18th not 21th century. We also get some idea of how a totalitarian regime like Adam Sutler's took over the government with flashbacks about a deadly biological attack on Britian that resulted in over 100,000 deaths. Were also given the impression that it was the Sutler Regime itself that engineered that attack, making it look like it was the work of Islamic terrorists, in order to get the British people through their representatives in the Parliament to give up their rights and make Sutler a total dictator who answers to no one and to no laws.As November 5 gets closer by the day It's not V but Chancellor Sutler and his underlings who start to panic as the mysterious masked maestro knocks off key members of his regime including the ""Voice of London"" Lewis Profhero,Roger Allen,who we later find out was the commandant of a brutal government concentration camp where V was later almost killed in a chemical explosion. Using the London tube, or subway, V has a plan to use a train-load of explosives that will go under the Parliament Building at precisely midnight November 5 and blow the place straight to hell but Sutler won't be there. He's deposed by his handlers lead by the secretive behind the scenes Cheedy, Tim Pigoff-Smith, who together with his henchmen ends up confronting V in a battle that the result will be the future course of Britsh, as well as American and world, history.Thought-provoking film with a really surprise ending, that takes up the movies last fifteen or so minutes, that has you thinking about that famous saying about Freedom & Equality; ""Freedom is not Free and all men are not Equal"". That so perfectly describes the movies sheep-like and ignorant British people in the quotes beginning statement and the courageous and principled masked avenger and freedom fighter V for Vendetta in the quotes end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Shockingly Good,"I hadn't intended to see this film but it was on at the IMAX and I had a free evening so I figured I'd take a look see. After all a comic book film would have effects and those would look amazing on a giant screen, thus compensating for all the shortcomings that comic book films so often have.WOW!!!! It was a film chock-full of ideas, many of which are still fermenting in my head. It was about the indomitable human spirit. It was about the integrity of each individual. It was about a vendetta. It was about love of self, love of society (a much-abused concept), love of an individual, love of ideas, love of art, love of books, love of words, love of your fellow man. By the end I was almost hyperventilating at the power of the images and the ideas and the possibilities.What didn't I like? Well, I wouldn't have cast Natalie Portman. She was too California skinny and her accent was appalling. I'd have got an actress with a healthier English build and the ability to hold an English accent. Having said that, she didn't let the film down or make it unwatchable. The cast, directors and production team were so good that they were able to carry her easily.Please see this film. It may shock you but it will also make you think.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Loud, Brash and Disappointing","I can't say I've ever heard of the graphic novel by Alan Moore, but I hear he wasn't too pleased with this cinematic vision of his work. I cant say I was too overly impressed with it either; I saw it mainly because Natalie Portman thought the project was good enough to shave her head for, and even though the last two films by the Wachowski Brothers weren't very good, the first Matrix film made it obvious that they have a flair for action sequences. The plot is based on numerous ideas, all of which focus on government. V for Vendetta is supposedly a commentary on Thatcher's Britain, and this is mixed in with ideas stemming from Guy Fawke's plot to blow up the houses of parliament, and a revolution against the Government. The ideas are mostly very good; but there's too many of them, and many of the themes get lost in a convoluted plot that mainly sees a masked marauder calling himself 'V' picking off various members of government, while finding time to plant bombs and share a tentative near romance with the angelic Evey, played by the very talented Natalie Portman.The film constantly nods towards more intelligent work, such as plays by William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang Goethe's 'Faust', and this serves to remind the audience of the shortcomings in this work. It has to be said that the technical work on the film is very good; the dark and brooding atmosphere works very well when coupled with the doomed vision of London. It would seem that The Wachowski's couldn't be bothered to direct their own screenplay, so that honour falls to James McTeigue, otherwise known as the first assistant director on The Matrix Trilogy. His direction is largely pretty good - he has an eye for aesthetics, and constantly makes use of the dark locations and many of the characters' dark clothing. The masked central character makes for a memorable anti-hero; but his spectre does look a bit silly, and seeing him constantly deliver convoluted dialogue in the style of 'The Oracle' soon wears thin. Natalie Portman looks stunning as always; even when she loses her luscious locks. The action is loud, brash and entertaining; and this provides the film with its biggest strong point, but it tries to be too clever and often ends up looking silly, as the plot is never deep or engaging enough for all the elements to really shine through. A shame; with the right handling, this could have been great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"'' V..'' is a great movie, also beautiful to watch","Ever since I saw the trailer for V for Vendetta I just knew I had to see it. Now that I have, I simply can't wait for it to come out on DVD. I will buy it straight away! And that is something I don't say that easily..This film is equal in originality and beauty. The story of the mysterious hero ''V'' who tries to make the people see just who their government really is and that they should take their lives in their own hands again and his new-found accomplice Evey is highly interesting to watch. Also, you feel for all the characters right from the start. Due to the deliciously evil John Hurt, who plays the vicious high chancellor Sutler, it is without problems you will find yourself siding with the rebels in no time.The manner in which the story is told is very intense, making sure you are right there in the middle with the characters. It's like a puzzle; pieces start falling in the right places piece by piece; filling you in on the plot when the time's right. This film also is utmost pleasant to watch because of the way it was shot. The colours (uniforms, flags, symbols and so on) and the objects hidden inside the hide-out of our hero ''V'' are amazing and the entire feeling of the story is simply breath-taking.As much as acting is concerned; the wonderfully cast Hugo Weaving delivers a stunning and very impressive role as ''V'' and also Natalie Portman, who I have always liked on screen, shows her true talent as the young, innocent Evey who learns that sometimes you have to fight for what you believe in, no matter what. I also immensely enjoyed the sadly, brief- performance of Stephen Fry, who played Evey's boss Gordon Dietrich.The action sequences with ''V'' are also very much worth mentioning. It is nice to see how his personal style, motivation and play on words were used to create this effect, and, very important, without looking overly dramatic.I can honestly say even the way ''V'' and Evey felt about each other at the end of the film, left me with a bit of a chill and somewhat teary eyes. Although it was very clear they could never be together it was nice to see ''V'' had learned about the importance of hope and love in his quest for vengeance.Therefore, I can only highly recommend this film to anyone out there. By an instant it has become one of my all-time favourites and I am sure you will enjoy this film as much as I do.Tata, Miss V ^^",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Worst piece of drivel I've seen in years.,"I liked Bound, hated the Matrix (and yes I ""got it"", thank you). The trailer already made V for Vendetta look like utter garbage but I still gave it a try with an open mind and oh my God... I wasn't prepared for this !American actors trying to imitate the British accent by throwing around words like ""bollocks"", ""bugger off"" & ""bloke"", sitcom acting from Natalie Portman (seriously, does she actually get paid ? Even when she says she's starving you can't believe her), the most uninspired fighting scenes, shallow pseudo-philosophical statements, simplistic politics and morals, and the unavoidable Wachowski question: ""Do you get the subtle message behind the movie ?""I think the real problem is that people seem to think that the Wachowski brothers are the kings of allegory and that this actually is a good movie ! What do these people watch or read the rest of the time ? This is truly scary. No wonder the author of the book refused to have his name mentioned in the credits.Now, I 've never been able to give a 1 to a film but I think this one really deserves it. It was already painful and embarrassing to watch from the very first minutes. You're definitely better off watching the B-movies that inspired it: Fantomas, Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, the Abominable Dr. Phibes or an episode of Zorro... At least, they don't take themselves as seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V for Vendetta is V for Very Good,"V for Vendetta V for Vendetta takes place in the near future (2020) in London, England. After disengaging itself from a ""war America started,"" terror attacks  including an horrific biological attack that killed thousands  have resulted in a totalitarian government there. Using tools ranging from strictly enforced curfews to surveillance cameras, and from ""disappearing"" political activists to government-controlled news outlets, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) is firmly in control. That control is exercised, of course, for the security and good of England's citizens.A man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) disagrees. His stance against the Chancellor's government is two-fold: he hates what the government has done to him personally, and he loves freedom. In a series of violent attacks he personally orchestrates, he sets out to prove his point to the largely oblivious population.Through no real fault of her own, a young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) meets the mysterious masked V in a dark alley where V saves her virtue from a trio of government-appointed citizen informers (aptly called ""fingermen""). Employed by a government television station, Evey doesn't occupy a place of authority but is positioned quite well enough to know that the news anchors often must relay stories that they personally know to be untrue.Evey's knowledge is only further cemented when the newscasters try to pretend that some explosions the night before were the result of a planned demolition. It's also more than enough to make her fear that a visit from the state police could be targeting her. In reality, however, it's not her the police are after. It's V himself.V is at the television station this November 5 to claim responsibility for a bombing as well as to challenge the people of London to join him on the following November 5  Guy Fawkes' Day  to destroy Parliament itself. V only narrowly escapes the police who are there to arrest him, and again by accident, Evey gets involved.Meanwhile, the ongoing machinations of the Chancellor and his minions serve to show just how far a tyrant will go to hold on to power. But when the anguish of Evey's friend, Deitrich (Stephen Fry) and a woman she'll never meet (Valerie, played by Natasha Wightman) offer a heart-rending counterpoint from the other side, Evey isn't the only one whose loyalties and motivations are conflicted!Natalie Portman proved she can really act in her superlative turn in 2004's Closer. She stays at that level here. Hugo Weaving's face is never seen, but his voice alone is terrifying, poignant, and powerful by turns. The supporting cast is also very good, particularly Stephen Fry who offers up a wonderful rendering of a publicly resigned man who slowly lets his own disillusionment grow into some brave action of his own.Though much touted as being a movie from the same men who brought us the brilliant Matrix series, in reality the Wachowski brothers are responsible for the screenplay alone (they're also credited as producers). Director James McTeigue is instead behind the cameras here, and he ably brings a complicated story to life.The sets are spectacular and the effects even more so. But I maintain that it's the story itself that makes V for Vendetta as impressive as it is. I really enjoyed my movie-going experience simply from the standpoint of suspense and entertainment; but what really got to me was the view of the near future and its horrifying plausibility. Though I had a hard time divorcing the two points for myself, I can tell you that my friend's 17 year-old son and a buddy saw V for Vendetta this weekend as well, and neither has shut up about it since. They don't care anything about politics, and yet they both loved it. So did I.POLITICAL NOTES: There is literally no moment of this film that doesn't have a political impact.In the movie, political activists are watched and sometimes punished; in America today, we know that, at a minimum, many are surveilled. On screen, we see ""for your safety"" extolled by government officials; today, more than a few laws, including the freedom-stealing PATRIOT Act, are based on those very notions. In the film, ""fingermen"" are everywhere to report on their fellows; today, we've been encouraged to do the same, up to and including the infamous TIPS program.There are many more parallels to name, and most of them are at least as awful as the few listed above. V for Vendetta takes place in the near future, and impossible to watch the movie, as enjoyable as it is, without wondering just how ""near"" that future really is. Perhaps an early warning can help us avoid the nasty fate  as well as the very violent ultimate release from that fate  depicted in the movie. And while V for Vendetta is certainly not a movie to be taken literally, there's some very real and legitimate early warning here that I personally believe should be heeded.FAMILY SUITABILITY: V for Vendetta is rated R for ""strong violence, (and) some language."" This is not a movie suitable for young children either in its overall topic or its rendering. From its opening scenes of the execution of Guy Fawkes in 1605 to the penultimate (beautifully choreographed, I might add) fight, the blood and guts are fairly graphic. In addition, everything from Shakespeare to classic movies are quoted or somehow otherwise involved, and the politics is sometimes complicated in and of itself. This is not a film for the faint of heart or those unable to understand such vocabulary or ideals. But for the rest, whether they consider V a terrorist or a freedom fighter in the end, there's so much of thought-provoking value here that I'm inclined to consider V for Vendetta required viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
pathetic,"Many people like the ""thriller"" feel of this movie but I thought the ideologies that this movie contained were pathetic and needless to say inconspicuous to our situation in this world today.First of all, anti-conservative? pro-homosexuality? anti-Christianity? And this supposedly ""corrupt"" government is replaced by a cult that wears a Guy Fawkes mask or ""Freedom Fighters"" - how unique yet absurd and ridiculous.This movie will only make people stupider; what are we supposed to get out of this.What a waste of time and effort - since it does show a remarkable effort put into this movie",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
People power,"Awesome......and maybe more.Set in futuristic Britain, it is about a fight between one man and a tyrannical government.The acting is a class on its own, with memorable performances both from Portman and Weaving. In fact, even though he has been picturised behind a mask, you can almost see the expressions writ on his face behind the mask.A well made movie with well thought about and well delivered dialogues. Weavings character is not only powerful in words but powerful in action and deliverance.A must see for those who love action and drama, with oodles of talent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Dialoges,"The movie captured my imagination.Excellent movie! Worth every minute of your time. The dialogs grab your attention, especially from the character V. Hugo Weaving has given an Oscar-worthy performance, even with a mask on. Natalie Portman is stunning as ever, and has given an equally excellent performance. The movie without being too big on action scenes, delivers the idea of action very well. I especially loved the first set of dialogs between V and Eve, when every word V speaks begins with the letter 'V'. Hugo Weaving creates this mysterious, strong, and yet, sensitive personality in an unparalleled way. Excellent casting, cinematography and amazing sets. Amazing! Overall, an excellent watch. I know this movie is going in to my movie collection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A hero/anti-hero is out to avenge himself and society against a criminal government.,"I see in V influences of Zorro (the bladed weapons and the costume), Phantom of the Opera (the disfigured face and the mask), Captain America and his nemesis the Red Skull (both products of genetic engineering gone awry), Robin Hood (who robs the villains), The Silent Knight (who, however, unlike V, wasn't loquacious), the comic version of Spiderman (more because of the verbosity than the agility), Alan Ladd's The Black Knight (his chaste devotion to a lady love), Cyrano d'Bergerac (use of the rapier and the look of that Guy Fawkes mask), the beast in the TV series Beauty and the Beast (the elegant prose), and a host of other characters whether masked, disfigured or not.The storyline is of course similar to those of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. The wonderful difference is that unlike in 1984 where the hero physically survives but loses his freedom of mind, in V for Vendetta, (spoiler ahead), V vicariously survives his death through the many people who take up his challenge to set themselves free by virtually assuming his identity. In Fahrenheit 451, the heroes are really the books which survive through people with the main character taking the identity of a particular book by memorizing it. In V's case, he becomes an idea that survives in the hearts and minds of people. For further comparisons, watch Brazil, another Fahrenheit take-off, which in spite of its inspiring visual effects is quite a ""downer.""The above having been said, there is no quibbling over the fact that it is a riveting movie. The speeches, repartee and even the obiter dicta which continuously spew from the main character are certainly worth listening to and remembering. I was struck by that quote in Latin on his antique mirror (Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici)which comes from Christopher Marlowe's play The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus based on a German folk tale. Production value is great.The topic is both current and everlasting : how people in general respond to cleverly manipulative, brutal and tyrannical governments -- initially with timid obeisance until inspired by a few or even one brave person.This writer should know as he participated in the glorious People Power Revolution of the Philippines, a country under the grip of a rightist and criminal dictatorship for 14 years. Until, one person told us that we couldn't ""allow ourselves to be paralyzed by fear"" and that ""courage is contagious"" made us march in the millions with nothing but flowers and rosaries to topple the Dictatorship.What intrigues me was V's use of the Guy Fawkes mask and why he derives his inspiration for his revolt from the Gunpowder Plot. Was he a Catholic? Are his creators (Alan Moore and David Lloyd)? The Gunpowder Plotters were disenfranchised Catholics who couldn't bear the repression of their right to worship in the Old Faith. Their churches were confiscated by the monarch and given over to the Church of England while parliament passed laws stripping English Catholics of much of their rights, excluding them from much of public employment and restricting their ownership of property.The film of course takes deep digs at the proponents of ""The War on Terror"" who use the problem of terrorism to promote their rightist agenda and for their and their friends' power and economic aggrandizement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Nice storyline, poor acting","The movie has a nice and sort of a catchy storyline. However, the poor acting - or directing, or both - makes you almost cringe at times. Especially that of Portman. The movie is kind of corny most of the time. However, the plot builds up nicely towards the end and you kind of do want to see how it ends. Some things are left in the air in the end that should be revealed to the watcher. This movie manages to surprise and entertain you to some extent. However, if only the screenplay would be more realistic, you would really emphathise it a lot more & feel like it was actually happening, just like you should feel when watching a good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Enjoyable But Also Flawed,"I would have to say that V For Vendetta (VFV) was an enjoyable film it was also one that was not an easy task to take on. For starters, the comic book is extremely political and deep and despite the fact that it has been around for quite a while, is still very potent. Its message almost represents current times with the Patriot Act, wiretapping, Guantanamo Bay and public terrorism trials right in our faces. But the fact remains is that it was a piece of work built around political overtones as well as a very deep question which the movie fails to provide enough material for us to investigate.You would like to watch the movie and wonder: Is V a terrorist or is he a patriot? Is there actually a justification for his murderous rampages and body count? Even if you think he has the political agenda to and he is a patriot, does he as a person have the right to murder all of the people involved in his creation? Especially those who were repentant of their crimes towards him openly? While this is not a fast paced movie, it is too swiftly paced and superficial to give us enough material to answer these questions if not only to debate them. The comic was written in the hopes of bringing about that debate as to whether he was mad or just a patriot and what qualifies as a terrorist. In the efforts of making the film more easily digestible for the average fan and more action-based, it sacrificed good quality for extra popularity.To these ends I can only say that the film was enjoyable and entertaining but it really lacked in bringing up that all important debate. What made the comic memorable was that question. A simple inclusion of some well thought conversation and investigations into the mind of V would easily have made this a solid 8.5 vs. 9 debate because it's such a solid adaptation. What I'm most happy about is that it avoided fully selling out by involving some stupid back-story or including far too much Matrix-Reloaded like action sequences. The action sequences were tastefully done and despite some clearly Waschowski brothers' effects at the end, were very good.I'm just to troubled about what the story never answers. There wasn't enough justification for Natalie Portman's decisions and character transformations, what V's agenda was based upon deep down, and also why the government agents make the final decisions that they make. Overally though this film hints at a great 1984 like setup, with many homages, but lacks in the depth that 1984 had by adding in some flashy action sequences instead of some good debate material.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Standards have got so low it's not even funny.,"I can't fathom it. Acting is bad, dialogue is really bad, directing is in your face bad, atmosphere is non-existent, plot/story very, very contrived, clunky and childish.People getting excited about this movie can only have been swept away by their feelings for the Matrix brothers or have been blinded to all the films failures because they have just discovered their first taste of political comment. Either that or they all wish one day they will marry Natalie Portman and that some how by giving this film a good rating she'll find out and come around to their house and thank them.One day people here will rate Barney the Dinosaur the movie highly, because it has an inkling of social commentary, a nice looking actress and well known creative duo behind it. All those who love this film will then lament the fact people could like Barney the Dinosaur the movie, saying how low standards have dropped.

Too Close For Comfort,"Though this movie is set in 2032 which is only 12 years from now, It's strange how few viewers have spotted the chilling truth in this film and the way it points at how things are today in the UK, especially with the lockdown. We are a hair's breadth away from the kind of scenario portrayed: Mysterious experimental virus's being unleashed on unsuspecting civilians; paralyzing fear fueled by fake news media; people being pressured and shamed into wearing masks and keeping apart from each other; vaccinations now being tested on people who have no idea what is in it with the threat of becoming mandatory; freedom of speech slowly being stifled through the guise of 'political correctness'; the government slowly nut surely taking more and more control of people and their lives. Slowly, slowly catch your monkey...and although other countries are in revolt, the UK remains as a nation of 'do as you're told' citizens. When I first watched this in 2005 I thought it was a chilling prophecy of what soon might come to pass. Now it's fast becoming a reality.

One Of The Best So Far,"After 2005's discontinued success with big,clunky action movies, I was afraid for V for Vendetta, The Wachowski Brothers bundle of love. Yet, I was fortunate to watch the movie yesterday, and this is a first, but it is the first SMART action/adventure movie and for that reason, this movie in itself is a revolution in a revolution.The movie brilliantly opens with Natalie Portman's exuberant and calming voice of the tragic poem that is of Guy Fawkes, a man who tried to blow up Parliament and was eventually executed. Throughout the movie, the first lines of ""Remember, Remember, the fifth of November,"" rambled in my head. The movie creates a world in where America has gone communist and apparently, is in the open fire of a civil war. Britain has become a totalitarian state with a vicious chancellor by the name of Sutler (Played notoriously by John Hurt). The world has been protected from wars and viruses and such for some time, as the government makes sure the people are put in their houses at a curfew and do not do anything drastic. Enter Evey Hammond, who meets V, a terrorist with the mask of Guy Fawkes on throughout the movie.V's performance is one of the most tragic, comedic and substantial roles I've seen in the past decade, and he's under a mask. The mask is one of the most prolific symbols in the film, as even though Hugo Weaving is speaking, the mask moves with his words. It's smiling at a comedic moment, it's grimacing while he is thinking and it is hiding the facade of emotions that is V when he is emotional. Weaving's mask work is one of the best and should be noted as a high point for me in the film.The movie creates a world that we've thought to have been dead. Any movie that is able to create a controversy WITHIN the film always receives top honors, and the movie does just that. The criticism it has received for it's political references are so irrelevant to this film that it's near funny as hell. The Wachowski's have decided to mock reviewers in their attempts to find some parallel with politics of today, as every movie in 2005 tried to do just that. V For Vendetta is the most symbolic movie I've seen in the new millennium, bringing up topics we are too afraid to watch. Evey and V's romance though, is something the Wachowski's to have wanted to be fronted in the movie.There are no flaws with the movie, except maybe the ambition meter was pushed a little too far. But then again, ""it is the only thing celluloid has to offer"", as V says.Grade: A-",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"This film is one of the best films I've ever seen, it had great cgi, storyline, everything. I had been waiting 5 months for the film, and it was worth the wait. It was hard to keep up with some of the long, political words, and speeches, but it all came out good in the end. I liked the way the dominoes were laid out on the floor, and he flicked them making them roll out into a sign saying V. i thought that part was extremely well done. I had read reviews saying Natalie Portman was bad, but i thought she was good, even if her accent wavered at times. Hugo Weaving done a good job at making V how he was, at times though he talked very fast, making it hard to keep up. I also liked the way the film was repetitive, they said some of the lines over again, and the way they played he same music before the buildings blew. At the end when Parliment blew up, it was amazing. I would recommend this film to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Thinking Man's Horror Movie,"V for Vendetta is a combination of many things that ultimately adds up to a surprisingly enjoyable film. It is based on a comic book character but you can wipe that little fact from your memory since this is unlike any other comic book movie you have ever seen. There is no super hero aspect here that is saturated with over-the-top nonstop action and violence. While the main character V does have some very slick combat skills using only knives and swords, that is not the main focus of the storyline. Depending on your perspective V can even be seen as a anti-hero or terrorist instead of a hero.This is a film that is meant to provoke thought from the viewers throughout every plot twist in the movie. There is a lot of intentional symbolic references that mirror past and present events in the world we know. This is probably a result of The Wachowski Brothers directing the film. They should have made this movie after the original Matrix instead of cashing in on lackluster Matrix sequels. I digress... V for Vendetta is set in England in the near future. The entire country is being ruled by a fascist dictator who will let nothing stand in his way of absolute control. This includes control over all media which are sometimes forced to broadcast false stories by putting a 'spin' on them. This is done to misinform the citizens for political reasons and paint the picture of V as a terrorist who must be stopped.The film covers the next 12 months of V's life in which he meets Evey (played by Natlie Portman) who is a journalist for Britains largest news network. The two spend time learning of each others past history and how they became who they are today. V simultaneously spends his time pulling the citizens away from the lies the government is feeding them and instead show them the truth. He wants to hand the power to make their own decisions back into their hands. He preaches things like ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" and ""Remember, remember the 5th of November.""

"Fantastic, Brilliant, Amazing, and Downright Awesome","V For Vendetta is the story of a man who rebels against a dictatorship government in the future. The movie has close ties to reality, and provides a very strong message. All I can say about this movie is WOW! Now I went into the theater expecting a good movie but I was expecting something this good. Hugo Weaving (V) really comes across as a bad-ass rebel in this movie. Natalie Portman (Evey) is great once again, this time portraying an innocent, scared girl who eventually comes face to face with her fears. John Hurt (Sutler) really makes you believe that he actually is a dictator in real life, he is that good. The acting overall in V4V is sensational.The acting isn't the only good thing in this movie, the action is phenomenal. It will keep your interest for the entire 133 minute duration of the film.The story is excellent. It is hard to come across one as good as V4V nowadays. About a very dark, grim look into the future where government rules absolutely everything and everyone is at its mercy. But there is one who fights, our beloved V. Thus creating the ever, enticing story.So, all in all, I STRONGLY recommend you see V For Vendetta. It is the best movie I've seen in a long while, and the best movie I've seen so far in 2006.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Impressive cinematography, powerful story.","A real sleeper film, I wasn't even aware it had been released until my local video store received it. To my delight, it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, enough to give it a 10. And in my opinion, out of 2006, the only released (on DVD and in theaters) actually worth seeing. Absolutely stunning cinematography, beautiful audio, convincing acting, and a very powerful story. It was like watching a dramatic theatre show, not a movie. A very serious plot confronts social issues in the near future that stem from problems in the world today. This film combines a very unique and original view with the brilliantly-created character 'V', a political visionary and rebel. Though it conveys a political message, it's not overly-preachy at all, and the true dramatic theatre quality is unbelievably entertaining. Very few movies deserve a 10/10, this is one of them. Do yourself a favor and pick up the DVD, you won't regret it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Nothing like what you would expect but likable nevertheless!,"Lets face it a lone man fighting against a totalitarian society in the future is a most unoriginal concept and I really expected to no originality from the movie the only way i thought the brothers would make this film work would be to cram it with some mind boggling special effects and action ala Matrix.I went into this movies expecting another action and special effects extravaganza in the lines of the matrix and i must say that the trailers were most misleading in this context and led me to believe that was indeed an action film.Well this was any thing but an action film.It has 2 or 3 mediocre action scenes and fans of the brothers and people who like only action movies will be severely disappointed.To make up for the lack of action the creators have in fact resorted to tactics that are original but are like gimmicks that performers use to enthrall the audience. some of which are--the hero of the film whose face is never seen throughout the film (Hugo Weaving doing what he does best Dub)is a ""V"" obsessed, limerick quoting British who is obsessed with historical events.-- The supporting cast is absolutely brilliant and has some of the best actors from the British film industry all of which have performed brilliantly and easily overshadowed the two main leads. Special mention for Ben miles who i loved in coupling and who held his own here.---Natalie Portman is a bald actress who is made this way by her not so obvious tormentors.............who does anything but you expect a bald actress in a thriller to do to.The few special effects in this movie are as expected top class but the background music of this movie is absolutely forgettable.The movie a couple of great scenes both of which come in the end - we have one in which the detective predicts how the revolution will unfold that demonstrates an acute knowledge of human psyche. - and the other of the actual revolution. If you like such arty cinema you will love this film.Well the above points make this movie watchable even though this movie is not what you expect. Although i must add i feel this involves some things that are more Art House and quite like gimmicks.Also this movie loses at least a couple of points for originality.If you go into this movie with a open mind you will enjoy this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Fairly intelligent and equally enjoyable filmmaking.,"Perhaps the only example of a 'Bonfire Night' film I can think of, this graphic-novel adaptation casts Hugo Weaving as the vigorously verbose avant-garde anarchist known only as 'V' and places him within a bleak dystopian Britain ripe for an uprising, making a meal out of the whole 'ideas are more powerful than the men behind them' theory while also providing plenty of verbal and visual splendour in the form of a tight script and some even tighter stylish set-pieces. While 'V For Vendetta (2005)' certainly has its faults, especially in its rather slow second act - not to mention the fact that Natalie Portman's English accent is almost criminal, this is an entertaining and, at times, thought-provoking piece that manages to maintain a decent distance from its somewhat touchy subject matter and to exist purely as a piece of fairly intelligent but equally enjoyable filmmaking. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Veni, Vidi, Vomici","Top 250 for this piece of crap?? At least the Matrix had some (CGI) ""action"" to distract us from the mind-numbing mumbo-jumbo crap that they were pouring over our poor brains (I'm talking about matrix 2 and 3, the first one being not so bad even though Keeanu Reeves was doing some kung-fu).. But this ""V"" thing is just like a 12 years old thinking he has an original view about our society.. 1984, anyone? Farheineit 451? Brave New World? As though they had tried to mimic these meaningful stories and actually tried to ""modernise"" them (because of course, people don't know about these wonderful satires anymore.. they forgot to read while watching too much telly).. Noble intentions, but catastrophic results! This London-terror-scenario, based on an American war-gone-bad and the world-falling-into-total-totalitarism, is almost as credible as Nathalie Portman when she's crying (the poor thing.. she's reading from toilet paper and has had her hair shaved..). The world they are trying to convene is half-baked, half-thought and not worth the original comic book ; they skipped so much details that it feels just like any other Hollywood movie : it's made of cardboards and we don't give a crap about anything else than the 12 buck we just coughed up..Don't believe the hype. Trust your instincts : Wachowski brothers + Portman + metaphorical story about the world today minged with terrorism and totalitarism = watch Fox news instead and get the real deal! (it's even more scarier).. The producers think you are as dumb as the viewers in this movie : you are just sitting there while watching stuff happening in front of you.. The hell if you're gonna wake up.. At the very least, you should just stand up and turn the damn movie off!If this is supposed to empower the citizens and really make the governments scared, I think I'm going back to sleep and dream about another so-called ""revolution""..

"It's good, but it's not great.","I love sci-fi films. And I also love films that depict a utopian fantasy society, or dystopian rundown waterhole. I lump these into two different categories. Utopian society films are usually films where everything seems to be great, but when in actuality there is something very wrong. The public enjoys great health and luxury, but behind the facade the public is being oppressed. Examples like Equilibrium, Rollerball and Brazil come to mind.Dystopian films usually depict a society where everything is just outright wrong, but freedom still exists. The world is, pretty much, a crap hole in either a very literal sense or for the people who live there. The world makes no attempt to cover up the fact that it is a crap hole, and the people don't really seem to mind either. Here we have Blade Runner and Gattaca.The V for Vendetta film falls into the former category, but I wonder if you wouldn't put the comic book in the later category? In the film everything is to black and white. The good guys is too much of a good guy, the bad guy is an over-the-top bad guy and clichés are numerous.If you just watch the film without prior knowledge about the comic book, you won't really care. But if you've read the comic book and know what it could have been, you'll realize that there could have been so much more to this film and a lot of it's faults are exposed. Stylistically this film is very good, but plot wise it's... not so good.We've seen all of this before. A revolutionary fighting to bring down the corrupt oppressive society, where a dictator rules supreme. The twist is that this revolutionary is using modern day terrorist tactics, involving murder and bombings to further his cause. But since the film depicts him as very much of a good guy, his motives are never really questioned by the audience, like they SHOULD be. He's a good guy fighting for justice and revenge, what's not to like? Well, the problem is that we've seen this before. To many times, perhaps. The mere fact that he's using drastic measures isn't enough to make us dislike him.And the bad guy? Well, compared to him, our good guy revolutionary looks like Jesus himself. This makes the film a bit dull, because we can all pretty much pinpoint exactly how the plot is going to develop from scene 1 and in the end we're right.Now, the film is very well made. It's very stylistic and builds up quite nicely. If you like these kind of films, you'll like this one. The acting is great, the visuals fantastic and the atmosphere likewise. But the plot is lacking, and there's nothing really unique about this film.So I suggest you watch this film if you're interested in this theme. But don't fool yourself, there are a lot of films out there on the same subject that are better. Including all of those I mentioned in the first two paragraphs.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

V for Vigorously Brilliant!,"First reaction: WOW!... Second reaction: Why in hell haven't I seen that before?!!... Third reaction: Why did it have to end? I want see it one more time... Fourth reaction: This will unquestionably head to my all- time favorite movies list.It has been a really long time since I gave a movie the ten stars without second thoughts. And with all those crappy and disappointing movies around, I thought I'd never do it again. Rare are those movies that leave such an impression on me and result in this lingering feeling of enthusiasm. I know, to some people, I might be overrating, but this is exactly my idea of how a perfect movie should be.I have to admit I was let down knowing that the Wachowskis are the moving force behind this project (I've never been a fan of The Matrix and never will be!) but hell with my prejudices! They have succeeded in turning V from just an impressive comic character to an international, timeless symbol of revolution. The setting of the movie is a futuristic Britain, but the practices of the oppressive government (that strongly reminds me of Orwell's Big Brother) pretty much resembles the practices of all oppressive governments in history. This leaves you wondering: Are the people in power really that stupid? When will they ever learn that peoples cannot be controlled?James McTeigue did a great job in keeping the movie as symbolic as possible to universalize the experience. The film is not engaged in details; the focus is always on the consequences of the events, not the events themselves. That is why scenes related to the past are repeatedly juxtaposed with scenes from the present so that they would acquire new meanings every time they are shown on the screen (an example is V coming out from the fire in Larkhill). The editing relies heavily on juxtaposition also to stress the unmistakable tone of duality in the movie; fear is juxtaposed with belief, past with present, fire with water, oppression with freedom... etc, there are certainly no gray areas. In addition, the cinematography retains this 'unreal' symbolic effect by using colors that leaves the impression of watching an animated comic book. McTeigue's shots and camera movements are definitely breathtaking - the guy knows what he is doing, without doubt! I also like the fact that the Wachowskis and McTeigue insisted on the anonymity of V, despite the Hollywoodian nagging urge for final revelation.Hugo Weaving.. Hugo Weaving! How can I possibly love him more?! In V for Vendetta, he has proved that a good actor does not even need a face to perform a role. How did he make me 'see' every facial expression and read his eyes from behind the mask?! I have no idea! It is not just his expressive body language I'm talking about, there was more to it; he character of V radiated a certain aura of grandeur mixed with rebellion and playfulness you can never miss. Hugo Weaving... RESPECT.

This movie ROCKED!!!!!!,"What would have happened if Frank Capra came to maturity as a member of Generation X, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington would have been called V for Vendetta.I will admit, before seeing this movie I didn't know anything about the story beyond the trailers (I hadn't read the comic books or anything). So take my words from that perspective.That being said I thought this was a GREAT movie, one of the best I have seen in a long while. The story was unique, and the acting excellent. There wasn't much call for special effects but what little there were was interesting (A take off on the Matrix bullets, but then both V and the Matrix were directed by the same people).I was quite astounded by Hugo Weaving's performance. Having experienced him in the Lord of the Rings and in the Matrix, watching him act you do not realize the power of his voice alone. Weaving has gone up in my estimations as an actor.Natalie Portman, whom I only know from Star Wars fame does a fantastic job and proves that she is not just a one role wonder. Her character goes through a huge evolution and her acting chops are right there with her.I wish I could go on more but I know there is a limit to this comment section and so I will end simply with this.

Great Ideas via Hollywood Inc.,"Is this film Hollywood? Yes. The shot structure is rather characteristic of plot-driven Hollywood style and all the traditional elements are there. But, I'm willing to forgive the subtle romantic subplot, the classic one-liners, and the lack of confidence in the viewer for a sufficient grasp of complexity and praise it for its daring. This film is a play on the parody of our times, and is, by all means, worth seeing. Do they drive the ""message"" in too deep, yes. Several of the senseless melodramatic elements (especially towards the end) could have been omitted, leaving something that would make a much greater impact. (Watching this film you can clearly see how the Hollywood formula was slapped on it with little regard to maintaining the integrity and intensity of the script.) Anyhow, I applaud the Wachowski brothers for approaching a construct of American issues with a nazistic/communistic sensibility that could have only been gained through generational experience of both Eastern Europe and the US.

V. Good!,"Based on the Alan Moore/David Lloyd strip of the same name (which first appeared in top British 80s comic, Warrior), V for Vendetta is a thoroughly entertaining adaptation which will most likely appeal to fans of the source material, but may leave others expecting summer blockbuster style action a little bemused.V (Hugo Weaving, who remains masked throughout the entire film), is a freedom fighter in the near future determined to bring down the bully boy fascist government that is controlling England with fear and hate. Dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume, he plots against the state (led by John Hurt's nasty Chancellor Adam Sutler) and the people responsible for both his mistreatment and the death of thousands.Although the film is not 100% faithful to the minutiae of the comic strip, the movie's writers (The Wachowski Brothers) have wisely not strayed too far from Moore's basic vision, delivering a script that retains the core ideas (the importance of freedom and individuality) yet still has time for a little wham-bam action.Whilst the movie is not a complete success (it's a tad too long and drags in a few places), this big-budget adaptation of the relatively unknown (to the general public, at least) V for Vendetta is a brave move and everyone involved should be applauded. Although I fear that the appeal of the movie will basically be limited to fan-boys, I do hope that others seek this one outthey might be surprised by how good it actually is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Although I spotted a few surprising omissions from the original story, the recent translation of another Moore story, Watchmen, has taught me that many times a direct panel-for-panel recreation isn't the right way to go, either.

Highly watchable but lacking in firm ground,"V for Vendetta is another comic book adaptation from Alan Moore whose previous works - The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Hellboy - were brought to the silver screen and, I have to say, sucked pretty hard. However, there was more hope for this movie because the screenplay was written by the Wachowski brothers and the director James McTeigue was the first assistant director on all three Matrix flicks indicating that there would be a happier working structure between what's on the page and what appears on celluloid. Nevertheless, controversy surrounded the movie due to the use of scenes of the bombings on the London Underground train network and Alan Moore publicly disassociating himself from the movie and cutting his remaining ties with DC Comics.The film is set in a futuristic England that has become a fascist state akin to something straight from 1984 where the government controls all form of life and the public are told what the government want the people to believe. However, a lone figure makes an entrance onto the stage to refute the current state of being, opposing the government and fighting for the freedom from autocracy. Caught up in his plot to overthrow the current state, Evey, played by Natalie Portman, is seduced by V, played by a masked Hugo Weaving and becomes a target herself.Over the course of the film, Evey discovers herself in an implausible manner that I cannot divulge lest giving plot detail away, and becomes V's unofficial aide and ultimately plays a vital role in his crusade.Whilst I found the movie to be highly watchable, it was also lacking in firm ground, and was as fictitiously futuristic as it was unbelievably unconvincing in terms of suspension of disbelief. The acting all round was over the top but entertaining and despite its lacking, it is a decent action thriller worthy of renting for a Friday or Saturday evening.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Violent, disturbing, and unusually patient, ""Vendetta"" reaches its film-making ambitions and makes its message heard.","Someone once said that great ideas do not succeed without loyalty between individuals. (I'm paraphrasing.) There are many great ideas floating through the film incarnation of ""V for Vendetta"", and the protagonist, V, is a compelling individual who draws the audience into his strange existence and inspires, at the very least, fascination. V (played marvelously by the masked and enigmatic Hugo Weaving) is agile and strong, educated and articulate as well as poetic, romantic and cultured. Not only can he fence, discuss music, talk about classic films, but he's a wiz in the kitchen. He is a definitive Renaissance Man who just happens to be wholeheartedly insane.This story takes place in the totalitarian England of a not-too-distant possible future. It's a place where a disaster has allowed people to be consumed by fear of the outside world. Chancellor Adam Satler (John Hurt) is the unquestionable authority of this new era and channels Hitler as he booms orders over a Soviet-style regime with cutting-edge technologies. People scrabble about to keep up as much of a normal 21st century life as they can. Evie (Natalie Portman) is on her way to a dinner when three policemen stop and threaten her for no other crime than being out past curfew. V comes to her rescue and invites her in sincerely gentlemanly fashion to join him for a special event. The newly acquainted pair watches as V's explosives blow the historic Bailey Building to pieces as viewing London is treated to a recording of The 1812 Overture. Naturally, Evie is appalled, and although V keeps his word to return her home safely and goes on his way, another chance meeting irrevocably entwines their respective paths as investigated by the cynical Chief Inspector Finch (Steven Rea).Hurt and Weaving as The Chancellor and V portray the flip sides of the same coin. They are men of force. One gathers power by instilling fear. The other instills hope by inflicting revenge on those he sees as the guilty. Steven Rea's Inspector Finch already knows how badly this world is run. He is cynical of the government, his place in it and what chance he might have to change it. The journey his character is on also illustrates many things about this world and where he is going in it, and it is a subtle and gradual performance. As Evie, Natalie Portman brings the audience into the nightmarish world and the increasingly nightmarish situations in which she finds herself. She makes every scene work, not just as a plot device, but more importantly for the character. There is even a scene in which Evie experiences an awakening not dissimilar to Neo in ""The Matrix"". She is viewing the world with entirely new eyes. However, instead of playing off of scenery full of scary machine monsters as Keanu Reeves did, Portman creates the moment standing alone in front of the camera; swamped and drowning in emotion.Controversy has been the buzzword surrounding ""VfV"" during the run up to the film's release. It has been said that this movie is taking aim squarely at the Bush administration here in the US. It's not. It's also not talking about Tony Blair's current administration nor is it reflecting upon the unpopular Thatcher administration, which was in office at the time Alan Moore and David Lloyd created the graphic novel on which this is based. Nor are the filmmakers endorsing terrorism as the best way of altering a government any more than a dentist would recommend eating more candy for healthier teeth. What I believe director James McTiegue is trying to illustrate in his work with the Wachowskis' adapted script is the very need for revolution in thought when fear becomes the predominant theme in a society.The Chancellor is seen mostly as a huge projected talking head barking orders and making frantic threatening demands. The government and military follow suit, but only out of the fear of retribution. While V is certainly not a passive figure, he radiates calm in even in a fight; no motion is wasted. V sees himself made more a reactionary than an instigator, and this refined masculinity is proved genuine as we view how he behaves in his own home with Evie. V disrupts with violence, but he appeals with conversation and ownership of his actions. He is attempting to inspire people from their fear and lethargy.Although there are frightening images, such as V's birth by fire and Evey's torture, McTiegue's camera, too, is sparing with its motion and reserved with the space it permits the story's characters. There are close-ups during intimate and poignant moments. The action sequences are startling in their ferocity and executed with all the expertise expected from the assistant director of ""The Matrix"" series. In many scenes, the camera frames up an entire room and sits still. Even moves following someone down a hall or across a floor are done out of necessity and without excess flourish or unusual angles. The characters and situations are allowed to do the talking. Control and patience are the dazzling features here.Unfortunately, some people will always take inspiring fiction (written or filmed) as fact or mandate, but this is a comic book world with comic book rules and brutal action  though action does not occur as often as one might expect. This is a comic with ideas in its head. If it just so happens that people find similarities between the film and current governments in the world, maybe that says something about the real life situation to which they are comparing it. If one finds a government is not living up to expectation, maybe it's time to start running for office or working for causes. This is a film with a big point to make, and takes risks making it. It's rare that a studio film is as driven as its main character.10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V for Vendetta sends an important message,"The reason this movie is great, is because it does a great jobs showing what can happen when people decide to give up their rights and freedom for a promise by a person or political party, that they will protect them. But it will be necessary for you to give up this right to do this, or that. You'll have to have a curfew, or be convinced that you should turn your neighbors in if they seem a little suspicious. But it's all necessary to get that ""bad guy"", or ""terrorist"", or ""enemy."" That's why this was a great movie, because it showed that things aren't always as they seem, or as our leaders say they are, and that we should do some critical thinking for ourselves and not just follow like sheep.""A society that will trade a little liberty for a little order will lose both, and deserve neither""-Thomas Jefferson-",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Truly Excellent,"I, Like may others that have written reviews, went into this movie prepared to hate it. I came out feeling that this is the best movie I have seen in years. Even though V is technically a terrorist, you can not help but feel his passion. He wants to free the people from their corrupt government and does so with a bang! Literally. Don't get me wrong, I am not one to support terrorism or destruction for any reason. I am just pointing out how beautifully done this movie is. It also, appeals to many people. There is action, pyrotechnics, love, and crazy twists. I hope that everyone is able to see and appreciate this incredible movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V for Wonderful !!!,"As good as it gets. The movie was refreshing, the ideas were liberating, the entertainment value... priceless.Definitely see it... for the directing, the acting, the special effects and certainly the story.Its a movies about Vendetta... revenge, vengeance. I hope that no one goes in expecting a story about Gandhi. Its about V, a freedom fighter, who fights the oppression of a dictator-like chancellor by terrorizing him and his politicians. He meets EV along the way who unwillingly becomes a major part of his crusade.The story certainly bears some similarities with reality. As they say in the film 'an artist uses lies to tell the truth'. So also do the artists who are responsible for this masterpiece of fiction. Its hard to ignore the the resemblance it bears to the way of the world today and how we are trading in our freedom for the promise of safety and security.But politics aside, I highly recommend this film just purely for the fresh and entertaining film that it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Only movie worth seeing twice!,"I went to see this with my boyfriend and his best friend. His friend had seen it once already and said it was THE ONLY MOVIE he ever saw twice. I loved it and my boyfriend continuously stated that it was ""total ownage!!!!"" I mus agree. If it weren't the last day or so in theaters, I'd probably see it again. Well, when it comes out on video, then, needless to say, each of us are buying a copy of it. Our friend even commented that it was too perfect to ruin by watching any deleted scenes that might come on the disk.The characters are amazing. The plot is amazing! Everything about this movie is amazing. It makes you really think about what is going on in today's world. Especially important is the fact that people are being prosecuted for what they believe in. For having a Qu'ran (please excuse the possible butchered spelling), you would be killed. That's almost like post-9-11 America. Also, the riots in the streets? That's going to happen if gas prices continue to rise. Yellow Coded Curfew? Sounds a bit to me like the terror alert level! There's a lot of important and RELEVANT things this movie has to say.Anyone who doesn't like this movie is probably an idiot. It makes you think. It's NOT about humor, sex, romance. It's about standing up for what you believe in and being willing to die for it. It's about defending the people of your country against such a world as portrayed. It's about being heard!

True to the intent,"Finally - an Alan Moore story that hasn't been butchered by Hollywood. Unlike The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, this film has been made by people who like and understand the themes within the novel, and it's good to see what is arguably the best graphic novel (disregarding Neil's Sandman series ) brought to the general public who - by all accounts - seem to be very receptive to the themes (for some strange reason).It's not obviously as good as the novel which includes more and varied themes that are not even touched on in the movie. The end is let down by the Wachowski treatment which wants to make some sort of superhero matrix-like fight sequence as a highlight of a big-bang action ending. Totally unnecessary, as is a bit of Hollywood schmaltz at the finale. However, overall, the writing is tight and sharp and it's still so much a film for our times, as it was one for the Thatcherite period. Obviously fascist tendencies are an integral part of government - that desire for total control over the population, which is increasingly seen as little more than a tax base and a means of supporting privilege among the few who deserve it (since they were the ones smart enough to rise to a position of power).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"OK, if you ignore the fact that the oppression presented is leftist oppression in real life..","First time seeing this in 2018. The secret is out, now, that even those 20th century oppressors imitated here were in fact leftists (despite post-WW II revisionism), as were the other mass killers known to be from the left. People living in fantasyland can still make gripping movies, even if they don't know squat about history. 
-- Collectivists are not about individual political freedom, and demonstrably against free speech. If you just ignore the vulgar conventional-wisdom that assumes leftists care about anything more than controlling other people, the rest of the movie is pretty good. The main characters are incompatible with the political premise presented (they're classical liberals), but these days, one has to go into a movie expecting to have to set aside the delusions of the entertainment class.

A well thought out spectacular with an interesting message,"This is a spectacular movie with a well thought out well told political narrative, marvellous central performances from Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving and great music selections (does anyone with a brain not love Tchaikovsky?)What really struck me hard about this though is that the heavy right wing libertarian internet crowd who think Obama is instituting a police state will eat this up. All it proves however, is that the world we live in is nothing like anything resembling what is portrayed in ""V for Vendetta"". This is completely undermining their values and love for the film in the first place.

Political and dramatic yet very unique,"This movie is what I would refer to as a sneak and peak into the future. Why? Take a look at the world today. Our privileges are being slowly but surely cut off. This means that in a not so distant future we will discover that this movie is telling us the truth. I find this movie entertaining and very interesting because I ask my self the very question that has haunted my mind since the first time I saw it. Is V really a terrorist or a freedom fighter? Is this what the future will bring us? Some people would probably find this movie as a typical hero movie where the good guy is fighting the bad guys. I say that these people fail to se where V for Vendetta kicks in. This movie is not what you see in an everyday motion picture where the hero is just a hero. Even though V is wearing a Fawkes mask he is not just a hero. Let's discuss that for a minute. Why is he wearing a Fawkes mask? The Fawkes mask is a symbolical thread and V chooses to wear this mask to remind the people what he is fighting for. The same things Guy Fawkes fought for. Freedom and a better future. Maybe I'm wrong but it occurs to me that V has simply forgotten who he is. He knows what he is fighting for but he has maybe chosen to forget who he was. As you very well know V had his face burned off in the explosion where he was kept as a prisoner. That's a symbol too because his face tells us who he is. V is certainly not an ordinary man anymore but more like a rebel just like Guy Fawkes. V knows what happened the 5. Of November 1606 and he is fighting for the same things. He doesn't just want to blow up the Parliament but he is trying to remind the people of what they have become and what they have forgotten. Remember, remember the 5. Of November The gunpowder treason and plot I know of no reason why gunpowder treason Should ever be forgot When we hear this little song from V we know what is about to happen.

They got it all wrong!,"First of all, if you know and love the original comic book don't go and watch the movie! Those ""matrix"" dudes did not know what it was all about. They got it all wrong! The setting is wrong. Their is no feeling of total control, despair and starvation created. That sort of feeling you probably have living in a totalitarian state like north Korea today. The classic gun powder treason story is plain unnecessary. The leader is a total different character and his ending is ridiculous.Warning SpoilerThe story about the self produced virus is laughable. Evey is also portrayed in a false matter.The only good parts in the movie are the ones that stick close to the book like Natalie Portmanns part in the fake prison. V is not killing people randomly in the comic. And they should have used the original speech for his TV announcement. With those pictures of Adolf and Mussolini. And for god's sake ""V For Vendetta"" is not supposed to be a love story!! For those who do not know the comic book, do not watch it either. The action sequences are shitty and have no real motivation. Go and buy the comic. It's probably in the top 5 list of every comic book fanatic.

An anthem...,"So many films that start as novels fail in their transition to the big screenso, it is always a pleasure to see one that succeeds. ""V for Vendetta"" is even more surprising because it started life not as a typical novel, but as a ""graphic novel,"" an extended comic book of sorts. While that might imply a trite or childish story, the protagonist, V, is no super empowered, comic-book hero, but a real man, with real limitations, and real passionspassions that would make Thomas Paine proud. While the original story had overtones of a socialist response to Thatcher's England, the film version is as libertarian, and as American, in passion, as one could imagine. Given the current dismal politic of America, it is perhaps astonishing, and encouraging, that the film appeared at all. Still, stranger things have happened: At the height of Mussolini's fascism, Ayn Rand's pro-individualist novel, ""We, The Living,"" was produced and distributed in Italy. In the same surprising fashion, ""V for Vendetta"" has managed to appear in America, much to my personal delight. I have just finished watching the film for the third time, and I cannot imagine a more entertaining celluloid manifesto on the importance of individualism and human liberty.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V-V-V-Very Amazing (Times V),"This was the best movie I have seen in a long time. It was entertaining, compelling, violent, humanistic, and I loved it.It's a little 1984, a little Phantom of the Opera, and a lot wonderful.Natalie Portman is charming, as always; Hugo Weaving lays out the most fabulous use of alliteration that I have ever heard in a movie and remains spirited and expressive, despite being cloaked by a unmoving mask; supporting cast members are equally intriguing. The movie never ceases to keep your attention. Even the violence in the film wasn't of your average shoot-em-up type, but a more stylized sort. The stories of the characters become those which you can empathize with; the fights the characters fight become your own; and the struggles and repressions which are laid down to smother a society are as a pillow on the face as a sleeping child to you - they repulse and infuriate.After leaving this movie, I was moved ... especially to go put a slash through every ""W"" sticker I saw.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"To call this ""fiction"" would be an injustice.","V for Vendetta - World War III has come and gone, and the mistakes of the past have come 'round full circle. The people of Great Britain, in fear of the plague and chaos that resulted in the ""States"", have handed their rights away to the church, and a Hitler-esquire ruler (John Hurt) for protection. But not all hope is lost, for an anarchist has come to save us from ourselves. His name is V (Hugo Weaving) and he has not forgotten ""freedom"" and it is not just a word to him.This is an excellent movie. It hits hard the problems of today. As we find ourselves being robbed of our civil liberties by a pack of sniveling fear-mongers. As we find ourselves in a world where our religion has quickly become the only thing that matters, and crimes committed by those that claim to be heads of religion are allowed to get away with horrid crimes. As we find that the line between ""hero"" and ""villain"" is quite easy to cross, if it exists at all.Hugo Weaving deserves an Oscar nomination at least. He won't get it, but someones got to admit that it's pretty damn hard to act and show emotion and charisma inside a mask. He is a formidable presence as the charming and devilish anarchist V. Natalie Portman isn't quite as good, but she's still very convincing as the vulnerable, but not too vulnerable Evey.As one of my earlier comments might have indicated, I was grimly satisfied at the inclusion of a pedophile priest. SOMEONE had to include it in a movie sometime.The effects are spectacular and the dialog is too. I enjoyed the brutal hard hitting fight sequences quite a bit.It will be snubbed all around, but V for Vendetta is an amazing movie with numerous references to our own situation with George W.

I felt I needed to say this.,"I don't often write comments but this moment deserves to be noted by all who will.As a film, there is much to recommend it and yet it is flawed. I would say that there is too much glamor, too much Hollywood show-offiness(if I may be allowed to make up my own words). That said, I get that that's probably the best way to reach the masses who crave the trendiest of forms. To be irrelevant, I actually am not that impressed by Miss. Portmans performance, truly, her poor accent is a distraction. I think the cinematography is good, the acting, overall, good. the pacing is good in short this is a good movie.It actually disappoints me to read the too long paragraphs describing line for line this movie not to mention the whining about how it's not exactly like the comic(big surprise). I don't think we should miss the the point here, as many of our leaders hope, by getting all caught up in trivialities. I would like to ask that we all send a silent thank you to all the parties involved in bringing this film to the people. I believe I spent most of this film with mouth open in shock. I almost felt that they(the makers) and we(the viewers) were going to face some sort of repercussions. I guess I have our new constitution aka the ""Patriot Act"" to thank for that.Some things transcend their form and it no longer matters about the elements that made it, all that matters are the lingering effects. I felt it as I am sure many of you did. Subtlety no longer seems to affect the hardened shells of the grotesquely apathetic, only a sledge hammer will do.

It could have been a so much more...,"Here is a film for modern day, a film that openly discusses the state of government, more so in America than England in my opinion. But the flaws, those ugly flaws that drag it down, ever so slightly but just enough to rip it from the grip of perfection. Lets start with the director who never makes any real commitment to particular style for the film; he seems torn between getting the idea across and making it appealing to a mainstream audience. The script also suffers the same flaws, adding a sense of humour and personality to the main character yet expecting him to be seen as an Idea not a man. It tries to be dark, to be all about the idea, but it also wants to hit the mainstream audience, and yes it does this, and yes it gets the message across, however, it also looses some of its power in doing so. This film is not bold, exciting, and inventive. The ideas are there but it still persists in following the old, going with what has worked before and will work again, the main goal is to make money, and it's this business focus that stops it from being a giant, that stops it from being something truly special. It's through experimentation the Matrix redefined cinema, V for Vendetta is afraid to do so, it's afraid of failure in the mainstream and so it is just another Matrix influenced action film, and a good idea. However it isn't bad, it just doesn't meet its potential. In fact it's rather good; it just feels like it could have been so much more, if only it could resolve its conflicts and truly define itself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This was an extremely believable plot that really did provoke much thought. The dialogue throughout was superb, and the casting was excellent. I'm not a huge fan of films that use American actors to play Brits or vice versa, but I really can't think of a British Actress who could have played Evey. and Hugo Weaving was spot on with all the accents in the film. Northern England by an American cannot be easy!! What I also enjoyed about the film was the way that everything was laid out like a TV serial of a crime. I felt like I was watching a special drama. Not many films can do that. The danger with a film put in the genre of action is that the writers and producers go overboard with the special effects because that's what the public expects.

"Killing In The Name of who? - ""V for Vendetta""","For those familiar with former political rap-metal collective Rage Against the Machine, then you know that the song ""Killing In The Name"" off of their self-titled 1992 debut is an anthem for those upset with our current state of affairs. More so, ""V for Vendetta"" is a visual manifestation of Rage's innermost fears and rants, and, more accurately, the fears of those in power in our current administration. I'm listening to that song right now as I write this review and it's giving me the creative juices to express myself freely as my fingers reach for the keyboard.""V for Vendetta"" is more spiritually akin to the liberal fears of the American conservative Right than it is the DC/Vertigo graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. Moore created ""V for Vendetta"" as a manifestation of his political paranoia over a sure-fire conservative victory in the 1982 General Elections of the United Kingdom. This big-budget adaptation, or, revision, is tailor-made for liberal Hollywood for their fears, doesn't take the courage to out-right condemn the powers-that-be, and instead just mirrors the climate without any kind of addressing whatsoever (reasons to which Moore has sought to disassociate himself from the picture).Most remember that code-name ""V"" (Hugo Weaving) is a free-whelming anarchist instead of a violent freedom fighter. Weaving is acting his way out from behind a mask of Guy Fawkes - yes! - the same co-conspirator convicted and later executed in the foiled 1605 Gunpowder Plot to blow up both houses of Parliament in an attempt to assassinate King James I of England. Weaving's face is never actually seen, so he has to use his voice and mannerisms to define his character. He's exceptionally skilled with a pair knives, is expertly trained in the martial arts, likes reciting literature and poetry particularly ""Faust,"" and using the letter ""V"" in rhyme form and iambic pentameter. He also has a plan to blow up Parliament, just what his hero was unable to do.It's 2020 London; in Moore's novel it was 1997 (back in '82, 1997 WAS the future). Years have passed since a viral epidemic killed nearly 100,000 people. The United States is in a state of civil unrest and other political upheaval (geez, the filmmakers, despite their apparent lack of backbone in the political arena, really know how to stress a point of America and Britain's doomed authoritarian futures). And it looks like more war is on the horizon.The film gets underway when V saves the life of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from thugs. She's a civilian, a pale, sullen home-body who represents the ignorant Everywoman and is naturally unaware of her government's devious plans to subvert public opinion about a guy in a plastic mask who has it out for those in charge. The powers-that-be is a man who's straight out of a liberal's worst nightmare: a gay-hating, woman-bashing, right-wing Christian Hitler/Mussolini/Bush prototype named Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), Big Brother personified, and is never actually seen in person throughout the film but when he is seen, it is always from behind a video monitor.V has a plan to blow up Parliament on November 5, to mark the anniversary of Guy Fawkes Day, and sweet-thing Evey is going to bear witness over the next 12 months to the fireworks and celebrations. A cop named Finch, played by Stephen Rea, is on V's trail and as he digs deeper, finds himself questioning his own allegiance to his government. V is determined to live up to his vow to bring down that house. Is V a terrorist? Is he a hero? Has he found a kindred spirit in the newly enlightened Evey? Or, more terrifyingly, has he become the thing he has sworn to defeat?""V for Vendetta"" was directed by James McTeigue, a protégé of the Wachowski Brothers, Andy and Larry, who wrote the script and were the directors behind the insanely popular ""The Matrix"" (1999) and its sequels. Those films too had similar plots of revolution and political retribution and heroes who were seemingly superhuman. But while they defied gravity, our V here defies clear-cut classification as some anti-hero archetype.The Wachowskis shy away the best they can from their works to give protégé McTeigue enough room to shine on his own. His film does have a rich visual style akin to what we saw in the ""Matrix,"" though it lacks the technical skill and wonder of those films. I was able to sit through ""V for Vendetta"" with a pretty open mind about its politics, (lack of) faithfulness to the source material, but something still didn't stick right with me. I don't know, maybe it's just because ""V for Vendetta"" didn't stand up to my expectations as something groundbreaking or in-your-face about our current administration and its diabolical affairs. But that's just me.What I do like about ""V for Vendetta"" is how it's still able to not represent any kind of clear-cut ideology or philosophy. It's not liberal-leaning nor is it really anti-conservative, despite my political musings. It stands on no moral high ground at all. It just shows us a guy in a Guy Fawkes mask trying to stop some really corrupt government types; V is one that DOES practice what he preaches. The film's ending will surely leave a sour taste in the mouths of many but one thing's for sure: never has the destruction of a famous landmark been a reason for celebrations, nor for sympathy.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Slick, Gripping, Compelling","Before watching this film, I had obviously recognized the mask and had heard about it. I must admit, this was one of the films I had been meaning to view. It had been on my watchlist for a while and was available on Netflix. So I seized the chance.The movie is a classic slick, dystopian film where society has been stripped of individuality (as far as complete freedom). I saw comparisons to Equilibrium (2002) in that the system is rigged, life is unfair and frankly the citizens of London are being watched 24/7. The plot of ""V"" taking down an entire country is of course something the viewer would want to see, and I enjoyed how the film essentially took place over the course of a year.Hugo Weaving, although not seeing his face, delivered on the role of ""V."" His character and personality are greatly seen and I do believe he was the right man for the job. Now, I do make these remarks after seeing him as Agent Smith in the Matrix Trilogy, so I do now how he acts and portrays different characters. Nonetheless, as far as the role of ""V"" goes, he delivered. (How much can you actually act with your face behind a mask?)The development of Evey, portrayed by Natalie Portman is without a doubt obvious. Her development from scared individual to fearless rebel is completely and utterly seen. Natalie Portman is a very talented actress, and I do believe this was absolutely one of her best pieces of work. At such a young age, her ability to pull of such a role is remarkable. Seeing her in the Star Wars prequels a few years before, I do believe she truly tapped into her potential in this film.I will have to go back a rewatch this when I can, so I may pick up on things missed the first viewing. (Not to mention, I viewed this late at night so I will admit to being a little sleepy.)V.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V for Vonderful,"V FOR VENDETTA Written by Andy Wachowski & Larry Wachowski Directed by James McTeigue""I wish I wasn't afraid all the time but  I am."" A young lady speaks these words to a man in a mask who has imprisoned her in his home. This time in captivity is the most free she has ever felt. London waits outside these walls, as does her job, her friends and what she calls home. The insides of these walls are lined with art; the room is filled with history, music, colour, life. The mask the man is wearing is a Guy Fawkes mask, in honour of the man who once plotted to blow up the parliament building in London as part of a Catholic plot to overthrow the British government. The man behind the mask, known simply as V, plans to finish what Fawkes started centuries before and blow up parliament in the name of the British people so that they can reclaim the freedoms of life they gave up to their government out of fear years before. While the government and media, naturally controlled by the government, proclaim V a terrorist, V sees himself more as an artist. For V, the artist is one who uses lies to tell the truth while politicians use lies to cover the truth up. The men behind this brave film clearly feel the same as they make a terrorist into a sympathetic protagonist and draw undeniable lines between the ruling British government of V's world and the current political relationship of the United States government and it's people. As writers, the Wachowski brothers choose to highlight fear as the motivating factor in people's lives but go so far as to implicate the government as the major perpetuator of that fear. This is not a fresh accusation but the Wachowski's go boldly further to accuse the government, fictional or otherwise, of not only maintaining a stronghold on it's people through fear but originating that fear to begin with, subsequently forcing the people to abandon the original motivating factor in their lives, love.The frightened young lady being held captive by V is Evey (Natalie Portman). Director James McTeigue, longtime protégé of the Wachowski's, instantly links Evey and V together in the opening sequence of the film by juxtaposing the two characters getting ready for their evening. They are both fixing themselves in the mirror, putting on boots. They both watch the same television news program and both shut it off at the same obnoxious point in the commentator's monologue. They are both putting on their armour to protect themselves in the night, her from harm, him from human connection, and they both have similar views and ideals. The major difference, she's going out to visit a colleague and he's going out to blow up a building. As Evey, Portman is composed and confident. Throughout the course of the film, her character learns to open eyes that have been closed in fear since she was a small child when she witnessed her parents' abduction by a government task force. With her eyes wide open, she can finally stare fear down and see there is a grander design that she is but a small yet vital part of. Hugo Weaving plays the role of V although it may be more appropriate to say the role of V is voiced by Weaving, as we never see him without his mask. Weaving's delivery is both eloquent and polite making for a poetic and charming terrorist. Together, V and Evey are a delightful couple. McTeigue puts them in very simple and close situations, like sharing a breakfast V prepares for her or cozying up on the couch to watch V's favorite film, ""The Count of Monte Christo"", which Evey enjoys but finds sad as the hero chooses duty over love.Evey's quest is in all of us and we all must overcome our fear, as must she. Placing the viewer on par with a terrorist and his apprentice is what makes V FOR VENDETTA so poignant and effective. At a critical moment in Evey's journey, which can also be ours, she must give herself over to faith and allow herself to be the person she wants to be. Her future self must choose to leave her present self behind her for the present self is too heavily controlled by her past to do what needs to be done to effectuate change. Explosions will ensue and life will be forever changed. It is the change that we cannot fear for we have sacrificed so much of ourselves to that fear. V FOR VENDETTA is dark and bleak. The citizens need a deep extremism, shown here in a stylized pairing of bombs and fireworks set to Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"", to wake them from their complacency. This is where my fears come into play. I fear that we are far too comfortable, far too afraid, and far too apathetic to respond to the call to overthrow those who impede our growth as individuals and as a species. I fear we believe change will come but that it will just happen without any work on our part at all.V FOR VENDETTA is playful and cheeky. It is exciting and insightful. It can be very wordy but I like wordy. Ultimately, its very root is fearless and that bravery will energize and invigorate the viewer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Misguided interpretation of political history,"First of all this movie confirms my belief that if you make a film flashy and fast paced with quick editing then you can get away with murder. It seems this is the preferred method these days with comic adaptations, keep it fast so people don't notice the plot holes and unbelievability.I guess this movie makes attempts to have a message, but I was constantly reminded of it's comic book, sorry ""graphic novel"", origins because of the existence of the ever present male pubescent fantasy super hero who can beat all the bad guys and is impervious to pain, physics etc without any real explanation as to why. V for Vendetta seems to fail on both sides, there is not nearly enough action for it to be a true comic book movie, and the political commentary is so ridiculous that it can't be taken seriously either.And for those who credit it as updating the old 1984 story of big brother to the present day war on terror really don't know their political history and i think we listening to too much Air America radio when this movie was being made. 1984 was written in 1949, and was a commentary on the Soviet State, NOT a capitalist democratic state. The ones who are truly pulling the strings TODAY are the corporations, not the government. Politics is essentially a game between these two forces as how best to carve up the world's resources. The people don't really enter into it except as consumers and tax generators. Some parties are more pro corporatist than the others, but let us never forget who is really in charge. George Bush didn't wake up one day in late 2008 and decide the banks needed 750 billion dollars, it is the banks that commanded that from him. Also, everyone who makes all these Nazi Germany comparisons don't really understand what Hitler and the Nazi party represented. The Nazis were both pro government and extremely conservative, these things don't really exist today, except perhaps in China. Most conservative people are extremely anti government, especially in the United States because of all the evil the government does with taxes, like build roads and schools and stuff. Bastards! Present day neo conservatism preaches that the only role of the government is to wage wars and have a police force, each of which performs essentially the same job, protect wealth and access to resources.Anyway, back to the movie, even though it is shot beautifully it is really fairly empty in its heart, I never sympathized with any of the characters and every time it seemed to saying something interesting, something unbelievable would happen and all of a sudden we are back in comic book land. Everything happened so quickly that I couldn't grasp what was going on half the time, or if I did I was rolling my eyes. I also liked Natalie Portman, she at least redeemed herself from her horrible performances in the Star Wars movies (which I blame mostly on George Lucas) but I think Kira Knightly would have been better cast, at least she is British.So in the end, not a bad attempt, but he rehashes the same old dead ideas about big government and anarchy and ends very similarly to Fight Club, which is not a good thing. It's message is pretty childish, when in doubt, blow everything up and it'll make everything right. Isn't that why were are in this mess in the first place?",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

V for fantastic.,"V for Vendetta, is in short brilliant ! Much like a lot of other comic book fans, I find myself disappointed in to the extreme when some hack film maker takes a look at the brilliance of Alan Moore, and then throws any old rubbish at the screen.This take isn't the graphic novel, book it keeps faith superbly with the character of V.Hugo Weaving is astounding in the role.Natalie Portman also puts in a very performance as Evey.Can't rate this highly enough.

Phantastic movie,"I read the comic before and had high hopes for the movie after reading all the reviews. I was not disappointed.

"Good plot, Good acting, problematic movie...","Having read the comics I was expecting a good plot - not a perfect adaptation of the comics - a good plot, and it is here and works fine.The other strength of this movie is of course Natalie Portman, who always does a convincing job. The problem is she does it in an unconvincing movie!!and here we arrive at the major problem of this movie: The pacing. This is a very popular problem in modern film. The pacing is horrible - the scenes come and go very fast, asking you to believe a lot without giving you real content to hold on to. The result: 1. V for Vendetta has no exposition, you hardly ever learn anything about any of the characters, making their development uninteresting. Why? because their characters have no start point to compare to. (excepting the inspector, who is an example of a well-written character)2. With no exposition and no time taken to introduce Portman's character, it is not easy to care for her or identify with her. Same goes for V himself. The touchy-feely side of this movie doesn't work at all.3. The third and last problem is that since the pacing is so fast, the writers did not really have the time to build any mystery around V and his plans. Beside one good twist, you can pretty much guess where each scene is going, and is constantly being fed ""facts"" with a spoon. V's cunning can be compared to the Joker on The Dark Knight. They are both agents of Chaos. Yet while the Joker is the master of violent surprise, everything on V for Vendetta feels like a dreamy Deja Vu.In a sense, the entire movie can be viewed as Evey's Dream, and that may be intentional, but this constant unreal feeling made me more sleepy than interested. This movie is nice but will not make you stand up and protest again the ones enslaving you. It is more likely to send you off to sleep!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Interesting at times though overrated,"Rated R for strong violence and some language.I saw V For Vendetta a few months ago on the movie network.It was a pretty good movie.The acting was good and the storyline was good as well.The film was pretty strange and I don't think it should be rated so highly in IMDb's Top 250 films list.It is based on the graphic novel of the same name.The film takes place in the future and is about a terrorist named V, he saves a girl from being raped one day and in turn she becomes his assistant though initially not wanting anything to do with V.The entire film makes a jab at politics.V For Vendetta is a fairly interesting film and I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Failed to stay true to the Graphic Novel,"I am sure there will be a ton of people who will disagree with me on this, but I don't care I would still like to express my opinion. Well, here goes:1) Dark City was fantastic and that made me think this director could pull it off since he was the assistant director on that film.2) I enjoyed watching the first Matrix film. It was refreshing, I liked the action, and even though they bit off a lot of comics and the Dark City movie, it was an all around good effort.3) Graphic Novels do not translate well onto film (sin city and 300 looks like the best efforts so far)4) I read V for Vendetta numerous times and long before the film came out. A lot of people dismiss graphic novels for being childish and nerdy books that only teenagers read. This is a common misconception. Graphic Novels, especially Alan Moore's work, are very intelligent works of art.5) Before I saw this movie I knew it was going to be ruined. Why? Because it's impossible to fit so many subplots in a movie. This isn't the part thats wrong, but it seemed like they made this movie because of whats going on in the world right now (Terrorism and War).*Possible Spoilers*6) The characters still seemed shallow compared to the characters in the Graphic Novel. I know its impossible to put all the subplots in this movie, but they cut out the most important ones. The whole train scene was cut out, the part where Finch goes to Larkhill and drops acid was cut out, and there was no such part when V met with Finch and Dascombe to tell them what the government was doing. They made one of the most beautiful scenes a wretched ""controversial"" part. When V comes to the doctor's house and when he tells her he ""killed"" her 5 minutes before while she was sleeping, she asks to see his face one more time before she dies and he does and she says, ""Beautiful"" right before she passes.7) I'm not just nit-picking every little thing, I am a film major at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan (not intended to sound snobby), so film, or Cinematography in this case, is my passion so I studied the elements of cinema and I consider myself very knowledgeable in this medium. I was still able to look at this film as a whole (not just story wise but entertainment wise also) and I still didn't think it was a very good film. V's lines seemed to fly past and not stick with me and even the most memorable lines didn't give me goosebumps like in the Graphic Novel.8) It's just tough to transform graphic novels into good films, even the works of Alan Moore. Filmmakers things that just because its so great means it will be great on film. Time and Space are so much different in graphic novels than they are in films. You take your time with graphic novels and in this film everything is sort of just thrown at you.9) There is very little action in the graphic novel. If you read it again very carefully you will notice that there aren't many fighting scenes etc. Which makes me think that they were thinking about how they can make more money in ticket sales while writing the script rather than writing a more heart-felt story.10) Natalie Portman is a great actress, but her beauty got in the way of her character. Someone less stunning, in my opinion should have played this role. The whole time I was staring at Natalie, but not really paying attention to what she was saying...I mean shes F*****g, man.Anyway, that's all I have to say. Whoever read this whole thing, Thanks for being patient, I hope some of you will agree with what I had to say. Take care.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Film Review,"This film tells the story of an extremely intelligent man, the man is simply known as V and is fantastically played by Hugo Weaving. Living in a Tyrannical London England in the 1990s-2000's era. The setting I feel could've been changed to almost any 1st world country that may fear overruling governments. London doesn't feel like the perfect place, yet I see nothing integrally wrong with it. With daytime and nighttime scenes, the film looks fine, the main positive for me is I didn't struggle to see the scenes in the dark which can almost ruin any movie experience. With this film I did have a hard time hearing the quieter conversations, which is almost all scenes involving V. In my experience, the acting throughout the film was good, with no complaints, although I want to praise the quality of acting by John Hurt (The Chancellor/main antagonist). Some may say he oversold the power-hunger of his character, but I felt it was perfectly deranged and slightly out of control. V is for Vendetta has two protagonists, which I think affects the storytelling heavily. V is a broken man who has rebuilt himself. Whereas the other main character Evey Hammond is trying to be your average citizen but her past, her parent's pasts specifically, draws more from her. The weight of two protagonists makes for twice the story to be told and much of this film is divided up to tell each's side (excluding scenes shared between the two) which can be confusing and a little difficult follow. I feel as though the producers did an excellent job of keeping the stories separate while still telling them together. From their chance meeting after curfew in an alley to their second where they both seemed to be in the right place at the right time. Like mac and cheese these two tells complement one another and lead to one solid plot, in which I found no holes/flaws. Like the plot the characters seemed to be ""solid"" in the sense that their reasoning appeared logical, and their reactions came off natural to the character. My overall impression of the film is: the film is worth the watch but isn't exactly a masterpiece. I would rate V is for Vendetta eight out of ten points.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very dystopian view,"We're living in these times now.There is so much oppression since last year.V for Vendetta, while based on Alan Moore's graphic novels, has a distinct similarity to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Free thought is taken away, cultures seen radical are abolished, homosexuality unaccepted, televisions everywhere watching and monitoring your conversations; Big Brother is watching. While not have read the graphic novels, V for Vendetta seems to lack that depth of the political agenda it's tackling. The political side plays second fiddle to much, when it should have been in the fore front all the time. There are some startling references to history; Nazi Germany, Gay Fawkes, while looking at our modern state; war on terrorism.The problem with V for Vendetta is that it's a mix affair. The beginning is chaotic and unfocused. Much like when Neo meets the Architec in Matrix Reloaded, the Wachowski Brothers are throwing the thesaurus at you, with V spitting as many V words in one sentence. Vendetta takes its time to focus, though when it does really gets the gears moving in sync.

"A Great ""Controversial"" Comic Book Movie!","V for Vendetta was directed by James McTeigue and written by The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix trilogy). Starring Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea, and John Hurt.Based on Alan Moore's amazing, eye-opening and futuristic graphic novel, this movie takes place in a future British tyranny, a shadowy freedom fighter, known only by the alias of ""V"", plots to overthrow it with the help of a young woman.This movie is very controversial, back when it came out in 2006 people said that this movie is encouraging terrorism, it came out 5 years after the 9/11 tragedy, and that wasn't a good time for a movie like this! People started judging this movie, and it didn't get the appreciation or the ratings it deserves!Alan Moore himself didn't want his name to be written on anything in the production, not even on the screenplay, he didn't even see the movie, he skipped all the premieres, and he said that he feels ""vindicated"". This movie is one of the biggest controversies of all-time!What upsets me is that people seem to forget that this is just a comic book movie and that it's even very faithful to the 1989 graphic novel, but people weren't so aggressive on the graphic novel because it came out in time that the internet wasn't such a big deal, but when the movie came out, which wasn't that very much different of the graphic novel, they were so aggressively criticizing it, just like what happened with the 2019 Todd Phillips' Joker, which is very sad because people don't look at the movie as a whole and get what it's trying to tell us or show us, they just look at one minor thing and they just sit down and trash it!This movie is NOT encouraging terrorism, it's encouraging our demands for freedom, and to take what authority is taking from its people, in the form of a ""terrorist"", though I don't like to call him that!Now let's talk about the movie itself.First of all, what's so hard to neglect, the performances! Everyone in this movie did an amazing job, especially Hugo Weaving who was wearing a mask for the whole runtime, and still we could see and feel every emotion and every reaction and his face, he delivered an amazing character without even seeing his face! And that was great, I liked that for the whole movie we didn't get to see his face at all and that even when he took off his mask in one scene his face was so shadowy that we couldn't see it, that shows that, as he said, the mask is now his face and not the one beneath.Natalie Portman is also great in this movie, everyone is great in this movie, there isn't one bad performance or even a character that was badly built, everyone was great!The plot is very intriguing, it's very easy to start this movie not that interested, and within a couple of minutes you just get very hooked, and that's where McTeigue shines, he built this atmosphere, and this futuristic world in a way that can keep you very intrigued in no time! The plot is so smart, and the movie can help it but to get even better with each scene, the movie is always going up intensely and smartly, it never loses its mystique nor its heart!What McTeigue has done amazingly was the editing, though it didn't always work, and we'll get to that later, for the most part, the editing is what makes this movie very good to look at, because visually, and I don't mean special effects, this movie is just beautiful! That shows in a lot of scenes, for instance, the scene where Evey was on the rooftop, and she was walking under the rain, feeling like she's being reborn, and the shots where V was coming out of the fire, feeling like he's being reborn as well, were merged in a way that makes this scene beyond perfect!The screenplay is also very well-written, every line was well-crafted, smart dialogue that makes this movie amazing and intriguing.You know a great movie when you look at the main characters at the beginning of the movie, and then you check them out again at the end of it and you see how different they are, and how good they were developed, this movie has one of the best characters development in comic book movies! You take a look at Evey's character and you see her at the beginning, a very simple and nice girl, who's not that brave but still trying to protect herself, you see her at the end, and I don't wanna get into spoilers, and you just can't believe that this is her, she took her time to be ""reborn"" and that made the audience care about her very much. The same happened with a lot of characters, and a lot of characters you look at them thinking that they're not that important, or you think of them that they're those a-holes, but when you get to know their secrets or their backstories you just can't help it but to love them as well!Some people will go to watch this movie expecting a ton of action sequences like The Matrix, even the trailer showed us that this movie is gonna have a lot of action sequences, but no, this movie doesn't have a lot of that, and a lot of people will get disappointed, but for me, I don't care, the movie has a couple of that, and that was enough for me, it's the drama and the thriller that intrigued me and made me entertained, so here's the thing, don't go to this movie expecting The Matrix, it has a couple of action sequences, but that's about it, this movie is a crime, drama, and thriller.This movie is not by any means perfect, it has a couple of flaws, and what bothered me was some of the editings, I know I said is that this is where McTeigue shines, but some of it just didn't work, for example, there's a scene with V and Evey watching the TV, and the news of the death of a certain character is being broadcasted, she asks him if he's behind this, and he confirms it, she asks him if he's gonna do it again, and he says ""yes"" and the scene ends, for me, it felt unfinished, I thought that there will be more, some kind of a conversation about why he thinks to kill is the answer, but there wasn't, and that happened often in this movie.What I also didn't like was the exposition scenes, it happened more often, it wasn't badly made or anything, but it was frequently used, and it didn't work for me because the movie seemed smarter than this to me.In the end, V for Vendetta is a great comic book movie, if you liked the graphic novel, I don't see why would you hate this movie, just forget what everyone's saying about this movie, and go see it for yourself. I'm gonna give V for Vendetta an A-!Thank you, guys, for reading my review, more are coming on your way!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Dystopian Drama At Its Finest,"V For Vendetta(2006)A Women accidentally meets a mysterious terrorist V who is fighting an oppressive government.Thought provoking finest drama set in dystopian future. The movie needs to be applauded for its interesting premise, shocking twists and the things it tries to convey. Comimg to acting presence, Natalie Portman excels as Evey a women caught in between the whole ruckus whereas Hugo Weaving proves his mettle with just his sound. The BGM, frames and usage of songs are yet another things to be praised. Last but not the least, the mind blowing climax helps elevating the movie to higher extents than expected.The only con of the movie is its slow paced dramatic approach but drama lovers won't even feel this problem.In the end, once in a life time DC Comic book based experience that is surely worth a watch.Rating:87%",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
proselytizing polemic,"V is likely satisfying for fans of graphic-novel or anti-hero action movies. Hugo Weaving maintains character through his physical camouflage and manages the center of gravity for the movie. If the movie had concentrated on the thematic depiction of how seeds of revolution were planted (someplace/somewhere) in the midst of a dying autocracy, it might have been a great movie. The movie fails in developing an allegory of how disastrous circumstances will develop in familiar England and America. I spent cycles sifting through the American politicians that must have been on McTeigue's hit list. It was easy to loose track of the story within the movie (was this Fahrenheit/911 redux?). The movie makes no effort to explain the ""coast-to-coast"" civil war in America and how the conflict bled into Europe. A discriminating viewer is expected to take much for granted, if the viewer is to buy into the film's story. The villainous British bureaucrats fanatical religiosity runs counter to any demographic trends in the UK. The screenplay's connection between current political situations and those in the movie just produces confusion. The viewer is distracted comparing real trends to developments in the screenplay, many of which run counter. The screenplay requires so much taken for granted based on the director's fantasy vision of the future. Regardless whether you liked his message; Michael Moore succeeded in making a focused production in Fahrenheit/911. McTeigue had a choice; develop a genuine anti-Utopian, anti-heroic saga, or make a political statement and he tried both. In order to develop both tracks within the movie, the running length should have been doubled.

A must see for all freedom loving human beings everywhere,"This film was well received by everyone I know.Sadly, it was not so well received by political, financial and religious groups who wish to control us - and not have their lies and failings put on the big screen for all of the world to see.After a few minutes of research online, I came across a statement by Jonathan Ross - that bashed the film on his BBC Television Programme for being a ""woeful, depressing failure"".Nothing could be further from the truth. The film is fantastic, and it's message is timeless. However if he were commenting on his own life, the statement would be true.Jonathan Ross was paid £5,000,000 a year by the BBC (nationalised) at the time of the comment - so his anti-V quote comes as no surprise to me.He would probably be frowned upon if he didn't take his money and do whatever the British Government demanded of him.No doubt the government contacted the BBC and demanded that Ross describe the film as a failure, or ""pro-terrorist"" - to try and stop more people learning it's message and standing up to the corruption to come in the future.The film isn't even remotely pro-terrorist. It simply outlines the main problem we have in the world today - Government corruption, running rampant with our freedoms.The message of the film is timeless, and the most important message of our time.Today in the western world propaganda and surveillance are running rampant.We describe an uncountable number of humans in the Middle-East as ""terrorists"" - while Western Armies murder hundreds of innocent civilians every day on average in a war that has no reason to exist other than profit for a small group of people at the top of the pyramid.I can only hope this film is seen by all freedom loving human beings everywhere - so our future can be rid of the disgusting corruption running throughout our entire civilisation.To finish I will say it was a pleasure to see John Hurt in another political role. Since I saw 1984 I have nothing but respect for the man and what he believes in.It was a pleasure to see him helping out yet again - bringing the most important message of our time to the world in yet another brilliant film.""People should not fear their government.The government should fear it's people."" - V10/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Vermurkste Verfilmung Von Visionärer Vorlage""","(=""Screwed up theatrical adaption from a visionary tale"")The Wachovskies continued here what the already did with their Matrix trilogy: while the first part was an interesting and highly entertaining variation of Descarte's methodic doubt (do I really exist, or is all that I see, hear and smell just the coincidental one-second-glimpse imagination of a one-cell bacteria which I truly am?""; watch Carpenter's Dark Star"" for more details), they dismantled it themselves with two sheer-below-mediocre sequels with virtuous but pointless action, plot-hole-chains, horrible performances, grotesque attempts in coolness and hazardous dialogs.When I read Vendetta"" first in about '91 or so, I was once more reminded that we're yet not safe from the menace which my country unleashed over the world in the 30s and 40s last century and that it can occur anytime anywhere again. The vision of the novel was as credible, authentic and fearsome as many news-broadcasts today. Which is what the author tried to accomplish as he mentioned in his foreword in the trade-paper-release I owned then. If I recall correct he mourned about cheeky (cheery?) and cheesy, soaps, comedies and music-shows"" and about ... people who turn off the news..."" there. He dedicated the novel to ... people who don't turn off the news...""The Vendetta""-movie-adaption is for people who turn off the news.A valuable blueprint of a possible dystopia which played in the same league as 1984"", Fahrenheit 451"" or Brazil"" has been turned into a useless action-flick, lacking any political ambition or any attempt to subversively play with the viewers perceptions and political convictions. You leave the theater without anything to cut your teeth into or a matter to discuss controversially. And that despite the fact that the story today has enough actual events to function as an allegory for, as it had when it was written (war-propaganda, media-control, cutting of civil-rights, unbalanced and misanthropic economy etc). Hell, even Mad Max II"" was probably more political than this flick.All the characters were real in the novel and became comic-characters in the film. Especially V"" is now a one-dimensional clown who rushes through the dialogs like a rabid rocket and through all the fighting-scenes like the energy-cell-rabbit: It has no blood, no animae..."" (Grosse Point Blank""). All those brilliantly placed quotes from literature-history that V used on any given occasion and during any terrorist action in the book turn into a what-did-he-mumble jelly here. Too fast for everybody who didn't read the novel, hell even too fast for those who did and -worst of all- too fast to celebrate the punchlines behind them. Who swaps drama for dynamic, deserves to lose both.The story is an only fast forward. The fear of a fictional but credible fascistic regime that drowned out of every page of the novel got replaced by constant sensory-nervous-system-attacks and by the annoyment and anger about todays regular one-cut-per-second-editing-for-the-Mtv-generation; If it's too slow, people can't follow."" God, I miss Alfred Hitchcock...I paid much attention on the Konzentrationslager-background of V but it didn't struck me at all as it did while reading it. Au contraire: Look what a cool fighter V has become there. Gee, Concentration-Camps can't be that bad..."" Folks, this is dangerous!It's plain obvious that it was the wrong decision to let some non-UK-filmmakers do the project; some British would have better done this. No anti-americanism here, not at all, but the priorities would have probably been set elsewhere then and for sure on the more essential aspects than just on the visual and martial-arts.

Revolutionary...,"""Remember remember, the 5th of November."" Interesting words to ponder. In 2005 I bet this was a real treat. Almost 20 years later it still holds up. V is a very interesting character with a lot going on. His mystery and voice from the impeccable Hugo Weaving expand this film into epic territory. Natalie Portman is a wonderful sidekick to V's madness and the story unfolds in thrilling fashion.""Freedom"" itself has become pretty cliché these days but V does his best pulling off an epic battle against an authoritarian government. The London backdrop is an interesting choice and makes more sense than setting it in the United States.

Absolutely spectacular...No words,There is no negativity towards this movie. All positives off course. The message in the movie is amazing and it kinda reflects our society today. No person should be afraid of the government and should not dare suppress our voice and what we belief in terms of freedom. The male protagonist was a reflection of what we want to achieve and should stand for what we belief in.The language use in this movie is very sophisticated and the dialogue was thought provoking. The masked anarchist (Hugo Weaving) obviously saves the young female (Natalie Portmen) as any typical hero character does but he gravitates towards insanity. This pulls us aways from the masked anarchist but somehow manages to win our hearts eventually.Its quite a spectacular movie and it a must watch somewhere in your life time.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The idea of the vanguard has serious limitations.,"I thought this movie was excellent as a movie, but at the same time it would be a serious mistake if anyone thought anything like this would work in real life. V was counting on ""the masses"" rising up to vindicate the struggle against the dictatorship, but it doesn't work that way. Resistance may be clandestine, but revolutions can never be, and the idea that a few brilliant brave men and women are going to lead the rest is by its very nature elitist. That is a good recipe for corruption further on down the line, and there is nothing to prevent the transference of one dictatorship to another, no matter how high-minded in its origins. The clues are that V and his comrades are active and interesting (there's no denying that), but the people in their houses and pubs are mere decoration. Why weren't they involved? The trench-coat mafia parade at the end doesn't count. Didn't they have an actor's union card? The movie business in real life is elitist, and this is necessarily reflected in the plot (stars and supporting players). Additionally, it would have been stronger if Evye had been tortured by real government agents, and had become fearless thereby. However, the idea of control of a virus used as control of the population is interesting, and has echoes in the LSD and syphilis experiments, and as some have implied, in the (manmade??)HIV virus.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Wannabe Orwellian-ish Wachowski party,"V for Vendetta isn't socially meaningful as it aspires to be. It's adolescent in its ""message"" delivery, pseudo-philosophical and heavy-handed.

P for Pathetic,"Comical, overblown, poorly written and a delicate subject given the 'Hollywood treatment'; all of these can be used to describe 'V for Vendetta'. The film kicks off far too early with the evilness surrounding the state thrown at our faces in a very sudden fashion. We aren't given any build up to Portman's character, nor to that of 'V' and as a result, it takes a lot longer for us to 'get to know' them as the film goes on. This twinned with the fact that when we should have been properly introduced, we're given a brief and rather ugly introduction to Guy Fawkes and the history surrounding him, obviously one for the Americans as anyone who has been to a November the 5th BBQ or fireworks party really doesn't need this sort of beginning, in fact the film would've benefited from more of a build up involving the corruption in the state and the past trauma's surrounding the main characters. As a result, we see this later on in the film  at the wrong time, emphasising the evidence that the film was written badly.The initial incident of V and Evey meeting each other happens far too early on and the relationship between them dies a quick death between them meeting for the first and second times. The gap is just far too long. This is very disorientating as from then on, they are inseparable. Another example of the poor writing is where a 'mock' television programme episode is created by one of the characters. Clearly a suicidal act within the film world and a huge question mark is raised as to how much the writers really 'knew' their characters. 'Would he have really done that?' From this act of the mock TV programme being shown, the film twists down another road as this stupid, suicidal act propels the film forward and spawns a few extra events. I'm not giving too much away but there's a death, a kidnapping and a mini-twist within the narrative, all creating the ILLUSION of good film making and although it's directed well, the fact is that it should never have happened in the first place(!) The writers clearly ran out of ideas and realised the dead end they were heading down before coming up with this narrative revelation.Another flaw in the writing is the dialogue. This is a very American film and was clearly written by the Americans, FOR the Americans. The script is clearly lacking in research as the British stereo-types flow out of here like water out of a power shower: thick and fast. Another thing is that English people don't say 'bollocks' in every other sentence when faced with an awkward/life threatening situation, they swear like every other person in the world and if you're writing for a 12-17 year old audience whilst at the same time keeping in the violence shown towards the end and of course, the element of terrorism which is obviously present then shame on you for not getting your priorities right. Yet again, an example of terrible writing and not any where near to what I expected from the Wachowski Brothers. The laughable monologue at the beginning of the film which used as many words as possible that begin with the letter 'V' was ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It was an obvious hint to what was to come.I think the people who REALLY like this film are suffering, in some way, from some sort of brain washing. I think they've realised the Wachowski Brothers are involved, they've realised it's a comic book outing, which most people enjoy given success of films like Underworld, X-Men and Spider Man in recent years, they've realised that it's got a big cast and they've realised it's dealing with current affairs in the form of terrorism. Everything seems so perfect, when really it's very far from it.What has happened here is the makers have cleverly set it away from America and in the pretty distant future, thus thinking that they have a bit of a license to overcook certain things and audiences have lapped up the fantasy. Little annoying things such as the fact V's face has the same expression on it over and over due to the mask he wears. This makes it very difficult to relate to the main character as we never even see him and I found it very difficult to motivate myself to even care for him. The poor casting of Stephen Fry, who emphasised the stereo typing with the accent and attitude of his character and the annoying invincibility that V seemed to have throughout the film. Things like this drag the film further down.This wasn't spectacular in the cinema and will look even worse when it comes to the small screen.One last thing is that 'Remember, remember the 5th of November' has got to be one of THE most annoying taglines in film history.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Revolution in Every Frame,"'V for Vendetta' is a film that exudes the essence of revolution in an extraordinary way.

The phrase 'ideas are bulletproof' perfectly encapsulates the central message of the film, reminding us of the strength and resilience of ideologies in the face of oppression.

Amazing Achievement for McTiegue and crew.,"What a debut showing for director James McTiegue. V for Vendetta is a gem among the deluge of crappy movies we've been hit with this year. Its easily the best action movie of the year. McTiegue takes his experience working on the Matrix, combines it with the eclectic genius of the Wachowski brothers and craft one of the of the deepest and most profound films I've seen in a good while.The plot follows a revolutionary known only as V and a young woman named Evey in a futuristic, totalitarian Great Britain. The government imposes strict restrictions and on their citizens, including a curfew. Evey and V meet when Evey is out after curfew and is stopped by undercover police. They intend to punish her by raping her, but V, who wears black and a mask in the likeness of Guy Fawkes as a symbol of his intentions, stops them. V is not quite a superhero, but is indeed something special. He is cunning, well educated and devious. Evey, on the other hand is young and impressionable. Circumstances land Evey in the care of V, and the bulk of the plot revolves around V's effort to reform both Evey and the country which he calls home.V For Vendetta tackles some of the most controversial issues head on. It doesn't shy away from any topic. It attacks not only government issues, but terrorism, homosexuality and a host of others as well. One of the unique things is that it is really up to the viewer to decide what to think about V. Is he a terrorist or a freedom fighter? Are his methods noble and justified or not. Who is the real terrorist? The Chancellor or V? You get an impression on what the film wants you to think, but there is a certain amount of ambiguity involved.Overall, V for Vendetta exceeded my already high expectations. It took a quality graphic novel and adapted it perfectly for the screen. A real masterpiece for fans of the genre has been given to us. V is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Steady entertainment -- keeps moving -- brilliant film,"Such deep characters, so beautifully written, so much symbolism, we have typical beauty and the beast heroes set in a film so relevant to our times that it's almost painful to watch. Some beautiful turns of phrase – so much so that it's worth watching over and over again – that the hero is masked lets us both not identify with him on a personal level and yet totally identify with him on a much larger symbolic level and at one point his turn of phrase implies I am more than a face - at another, he states that beneath the mask is more than face there are ideas (which is why he can't die - symbolically) – the masks again, later in the film disguise individuals acting in concert for one idea – a really great use of a dramatic symbol -- watch for the falling dominoes and remember ""they will fall one domino at a time"" --- this is almost always true of chaotic fundamentalist groups, politicians and nations.Watch for the references to a recent presidential administration (that impliedly led to the situation at hand in the film) – watch for the symbolism in Creedy's closing statement to V you have nothing  we have guns – even without the intense play on symbolism the storyline Is beautiful Wonderfully filmed at angles that best portray the feelings the writers want to evoke – a lot of ground level filming lots of intense close ups – watch for amazing slow mo of the knives near the end (beware not for small kids) but the filming, the cinematography is wonderful.Beautifully acted – so much power behind a voice and mask that you don't even need facial expressions from Weaving and a fabulous portrayal of Evey by Natalie Portman – Stephen Frye shines as always – what a lovable character he comes off with (ditto for his psychiatrist role in NCIS) just a super good guy always characterizing an amazing sense of humor- This is now an ""old"" film but so worth watching if we can take something from it – there is power in numbers - we CAN change the world and what we are currently doing has us on a path for certain destruction – this was Parliament but could so have been the Whitehouse, Congress, a representation of oppressive political power in the world.I love this film and if it has a cult following, I am a cult member!",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Chapter 11: Valhalla,"""V for Vendetta"" is more than just a masked terrorist running amok in a futuristic Britain; it is more than just the quick wits of an anti-hero challenging the government; and it is far more than just the follow-up film from the Wachowski brothers. This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster. While most will argue that it is a poor excuse for the graphic novel (and slightly I agree) because it doesn't follow the story frame by frame, the themes are still pulled through. Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold. The ""happy"" ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel. The main difference between the two is the lack of grittiness, one could call it realism, found within the story and missing in the film. ""V for Vendetta"" the film is beautiful, watched in full HD, the sound, visuals, and colors are exactly the opposite from the graphic novel, and while comparing the two is not the extent of this review, it is an element that needs to be considered. Alan Moore took his name off this film, reading the graphic novel will explain why.With that said, what worked and was miscalculated in the film? To begin, the Wachowskis coupled with the direction of director James McTeigue captured the visual of ""V"" perfectly. The mask was chilling, and the darkened question of his origins remained open-ended. Their depiction of this masked vigilante was brilliant. The way the shadows fell, the camera angles on his face instilled both fear and excitement for this character. ""V"", with this film, became iconic. Alas, the visual alone couldn't counter what preceded ""V"". The use of Hugo Weaving's voice was, like Natalie Portman's accent, weak. ""V"" was a bold character, but when he spoke, he seemed weaker and in less control. Weaving's voice-work didn't capture the intensity that surrounds this character – and then there was Portman. While she brought some innocence to the character of Eve (a name symbolic as well as poignant), the fading British accent continued the idea that she was merely Natalie Portman playing a character, not just Eve incarnate. Stephen Rae was superb in his role, as always, as the tamed cop hunting for a belief he struggles with, and John Hurt was completely over the top, applauding his role as evil as outstanding. These secondary characters, proving their might stronger than the primary ones, added much needed relief to this film, but it didn't make it perfect.""V for Vendetta"" is a great film to sit down and enjoy two hours of crisp visuals, amazing music (look for a beautiful cover by ""Cat Power""), and intense ideals. It is a thinking film. It camouflages itself as a big-budget action/adventure film, but all the while it is asking to you see the modern news and question our governments. It will keep your mind occupied for hours. McTeigue did a great job of bringing modern relevance (still tragic today) into this film to create a timeless sensation, but it still doesn't counter the disappointing acting. As mentioned before, what makes ""V for Vendetta"" the graphic novel work is our characters, and as they lacked in the film – it moved it in a different direction. Without the graphic novel, this film still works as entertainment, and slight thought – but it isn't a complete masterpiece. I enjoyed this film when it was first released on the big screen, but watching it today – the small nuances with the characters just don't hold up well over time. Its message is in tact, but lacks the body.Grade: *** out of *****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"One of the most pedantic, unengaging, and insufferable films I can remember","As one who is deeply concerned about the lack of critical, independent thinking amongst proponents and adherents of right wing ideology, and the disturbing willingness of its followers to fall prey to demagoguery, I am particularly disturbed and shocked to see this film rated with the likes of The Graduate and Platoon.

"When Things Explode, They Go 'Kapow'!","This is without a doubt a modern day masterpiece! And, I really love how it just rips the whole fear fueled by the media/fascist government/terrorism by our own government wide open. It is a great film that deals with the freedoms of speech, thought, and religion being stripped away from us in a fascist community, allowing a government to rule over the people instead of the people ruling the government, as it was intended when the government for the people, by the people was created.This is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia""). The political statements about ""terrorism"" and how it can be induced by the very same government that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today. Our freedoms are being stripped one by one. This film is about a fascist government that installs fear in its people by acts of terrorism, blaming such acts on 'enemy' foreigners, when the acts were committed by the very same government that's supposed to be protecting the people from such terrorist acts; like our own country!I highly recommend this film, especially to anyone who knows the REAL reality of our fascist state. It will bring out the 'commie' in most people who oppose our fascist politicians and the ongoing senseless war. This is without a doubt a masterpiece, entertaining and bravely 'open' about our current state of political stance in our 'free' world. And, especially pharmaceutical companies keeping people drugged (think Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxycotin, something that's ripping across America like wildfire; and, it's legal!) so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home. No matter what someone's political party is, be it Democrat, Republican, or Independent, this is a film that's VERY important for EVERYONE to see!People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independent thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song ""The Mob Rules"", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Michael Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound"".We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is considered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We started quickly declining into a fascist state when our former president was in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"" before it's too late. And, it's definitely time to stop all of the hate crimes!This is an important and entertaining movie that you'll want to view over and over. It's political and romantic, and very intelligent. Oh, and, the British humor thrown in midway through via a television show is pure genius! Very well written, brilliantly directed, and intensely acted by a topnotch cast! It is definitely one you will want to own so you can view it over and over, like a favorite album. Thank you. :>)",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A good attempt by a major film to be good. Not quite.,"An obvious satire of modern times. It made parallels to the modern US government and the fight against terrorists, WMDs, and, some might even say, Islam itself. It portrays a futuristic (but not too far in the future) Britain, which has apparently conquered the (former) US, and rules the people with an Orwellian iron fist. The leadership believes it rules by the divine right (familiar anyone?) and hates homosexuals. Apparently it's up to a masked man (named simply ""V"") to set it right through acts of terror.I found it quite difficult to accept V's character development, since all he was an expressionless mask. However I think that was well done, considering the protagonist of the story. I also thought Natalie Portman did a good job... until she transformed into a fearless ideologue who intrepidly roamed the streets of London, even though she was one of the most wanted women in the ""empire"". In fact, the movie started losing steam after that part. The plot became more convoluted, and it didn't help that they all spoke with thick (possibly fake) British accents.There was also some unneeded gore. In the beginning of the movie, V managed to beat up three armed men without spilling a drop of blood. However, by the end of the film, he felt the need to stab people in the heads, and sever major arteries, as fake blood squirted by the bucket-full. The film also brought up the importance of having ideals and beliefs, and sticking to them (V said that he was an idea, and ideas can't be killed). It was a good effort at adding more meaning to the film. Another thing that was repeated many times in the film was that there were no coincidences. To this point, I still don't know what they were trying to say with that, other than remarking on the existence of fate (which seems a bit incompatible with a film that advocates taking the law into one's own hands when a government becomes oppressive).The movie made some very interesting parallels between this oppressive government, and the modern era, saying what might happen. However it didn't give much of any solution to the dilemma. As far as I can tell, the film suggests that we have Congress blown up, while the entire population of DC looks on in awe and a bit of glee (it was London, and Parliament in the film, which I found a bit disconcerting to see the ancient British Parliament building, along with Big Ben, go up in fireworks, literally). All in all, it brought up some good parallels, and satire. It was a worthy effort at a good, meaningful film, especially while trying to maintain blockbuster status, but in the end it just didn't come through. And remember, if it doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time. -Michael",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V for Very Good,"Having just read the comic book I really can't see what writer Alan Moore had to complain about ... the film pretty much updates the plot line from the late-eighties Post-Apocalyptic paranoia to today's fear of a terrorist biological weapon attack. The roots of the story, a Britain in the grip of a right-wing totalitarian state and the unquenchable idea of personal freedom however, remain the same.Hugo Weaving as the eponymous V is quite mesmerising and does a great job of delivering some of the often quite flowery language. Natalie Portman is equally watchable as Evey Hammond who is inadvertently on the run from the forces of the totalitarian state authorities. Obviously she's nice to look at too, but she does strike a good balance between hardy heroine and vulnerable victim.John Hurt is also well-cast as Sutler - the figurehead of the state - but you can't help thinking that it's a bit too close to Big Brother (the film not the ongoing reality TV nightmare!) and since Hurt acted opposite Burton in the 1984 epic I found it a bit difficult to disassociate the two. There are also some good supporting cameos from Stephen Fry and Rupert Graves.All in all though it's film that makes you think, whether it will date if and when terrorist threats become a thing of the past I don't know, but in today's political climate of fear, intolerance and prejudice it is all to easy to imagine that even the generally liberal British are only one major attack away from sanctioning some draconian governmental policies. Let's face it ID cards are coming in soon to the UK and that is seen by many as the start of some real Big Brother attention.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Where do you start with this movie?,"I loved them using the voice of Hugo Weaving for V. It was so odd and surreal to hear ""Agent Smith"". Hugo did a good job NOT sounding like Agent Smith for most of the movie and it helped V to become it's own character so when Hugo did sound like Smith (normally when speaking in philosophical explanations of the ""why"" of it all) I realized it was on purpose. Smith became whoever he wanted to become in the Matrix and he evolved in the Trilogy to be able to take over the persona of people OUTSIDE the Matrix and into Zion. And it is almost as if Agent Smith has now evolved to exist outside of the Matrix Trilogy. Almost like he is now a consciousness that can pop up in any film. It was an eerie feeling.But back to V for Vendetta. The tag lines in the movie were great and I'll remember them and the tag lines are teaching tools themselves.There were more than a few things in that movie that felt 9/11-ish to me. Some of the view points of the producers I'm not sure what their points were. Well let's just say I HOPE what came across was not what they meant. I got a feeling this movie will inspire more than a few people with some warped ideas. I will hold my breath on November 5, 2006.The movie did what I think it set out to do and that was to get people thinking about their relationship with their government. And I think that was the major point of the movie. I hope there is a V2 in the works.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
P for Pathetic,"Watching ""V for Vendetta,"" the story ""The birds, the beats, and the bat"" from Aesop's fables comes to mind. That story is of a war between the birds and the beast, in which a bat attempts to ally himself with both sides, only in the end, to be friendless when peace is achieved. The moral of the story was that if you try to appease everyone, you will satisfy no one. This is the main flaw of ""V for Vendetta."" The movie often changes pace, attempting to be a action film, a serious drama, a comedy, and an ""intelligent"" commentary on the dependence on government (""science fiction,"" in the sense of remarking on societal flaws). It achieves no success in any genre. The film is too mellow and the action is too spread out to be a gripping action movie. The dialogue is too cheesy and the characters not developed properly for this movie to achieve the level of a serious and meaningful drama. Additionally, the story is executed in a manner that is too cliché and in-your-face to be an intelligent science fiction flick. The movie is funny at points, but it rarely strives to be witty enough to make you laugh for long.In penning the screenplay to ""V for Vendetta,"" the Wachowski Brothers have hit a new low. They have once again proved that, like me, they have no writing skills. If you've seen their previous work - such as ""The Specialist"" or even parts two and three of the grossly overrated ""Matrix trilogy"" - then you understand what I am referring to. They take a good idea and kill it. I don't know how they do it, but they do. Despite it's promising commercial, I assure you that ""V for Vendetta"" has none of the soul or flair of the graphic novel (which I highly recommend).Another thing that bugs me about this film is that it feels the need to make Matrix references, as if they were 1) still funny and 2) hilarious because the joke is being made by the writers of ""The Matrix."" Bullet time has been replaced by knife time and if you pay close enough attention to specific shots in the action sequences of this movie, you may recall them from ""The Matrix.""This movie is far from an entertaining popcorn flick, with a plot that drags at numerous instances and dialogue that makes ""Matrix Revolutions"" looks like Shakespeare. If you want to see something entertaining, I implore that you to heed my warning and avoid this flick at all costs. Go to Blockbuster instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Good movie with decent acting,"At first I hesitated to go see this movie. I was wrong... V for Vendetta is a good political action movie that takes over 2 hours and doesn't get boring at all.In the not too distant future the whole powersystem in the world has fallen apart, but in this movie they stick with the story of England. After the world terrorism as we know today had increased to abnormal proportions the government of England had decided to take more control over the people. England has become a totalitarian state in which the government rules the people's life (camera's everywhere, subway shut-down). One individual wearing a mask has a plan to fight the power. The story begins quite fast as the 'terrorist' saves a young female from a couple of corrupt police-agents and then takes her to a roof-top to let her see what his big plan is. After blowing up the courthouse he's tapped in to the government controlled television-network and appeals to all people in England to fight the power exactly one year after his television message, November the 5th.Naturally the dictator of England is in panic and wants the terrorist brought to trial by any means. Slowly the people begin to question the government and more and more people become sympethatic to the terorist' cause although the government tries to put him in a bad daylight with TV-propaganda. So far for the storyline, you'll have to see the rest of it yourself.I found this movie to be a very realistic scenario although the name of the movie sounds a little bit cartoony. It's about a modern fascist state and how it became that way. It has great similarities with the upcoming of Hitler in 1933. People live in fear and are willing to sacrifice freedom for safety. Governemnt propaganda is everywhere just like in 1940's Germany although the reason for becoming a fascist state has been put in a modern jacket. Even the clothing of state police looks simular to SS-uniforms and they also performed gruesome medical experiments on political deserters (wich play a keyroll in the story later on)just like the German doctor Joseph Mängele.So to sum it all up: A very realistic and ingenious story with decent actors. The conversations can be a bit philosophical especially in the beginning but when the plot thickens the movie seems to last merely an hour, because it is so interesting to watch. Special effects are okay. The ending could've been better though. I got the feeling that the director ran out of time or something but the movie lasts a good 130 minutes.One to watch definitely",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
V for Vendetta,"Based on Alan Moore's excellent graphic novel, V for Vendetta is set in a post-nuclear world, where Britain is run by a fascist government which sets limitations upon the freedom of it's peoples in true Nineteen Eighty Four style. A man named V (Hugo Weaving), uses terrorist tactics to try to show the people of Britain how they have fallen into passive acceptance of this regime, starting by destroying the Old Bailey, then publicly announcing that in exactly one year he will destroy the Houses of Parliament. Along the way he meets Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman who he believes can help him achieve his goals.V for Vendetta has turned up at an interesting time. Indeed, with the news mostly concerned with terrorists and dubious politics, it seems apt that a supposed blockbuster film should come along and try to get us to think about exactly what the hell is going on with our world. People have associated the film with Iraq, North Korea, and Nazi Germany, despite the fact that it was written during Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister. Alan Moore himself has disassociated himself with the film because he believes it has been twisted from its original intentions, but it seems right to do this  if people are going to get a message across, it needs to be relevant to the day and age that the message is concerned with.The real focus is V  is he a terrorist or a freedom fighter? It depends on the perspective taken. From Adam Sutler's (John Hurt) government's view, he is a terrorist, but he soon opens peoples' eyes to become their freedom fighter. But the methods he uses are dubious  destroying famous landmarks, packing an underground train with explosives (particularly relevant for Britain now) and strapping explosives to himself. This is clearly a film that wants us to think.And it does. In fact, audiences have been deceived by trailers that show V for Vendetta to be an action film. In reality, there are less than ten minutes of action throughout its two hour run time, but this doesn't matter as the rest of the film has been carefully structured to keep the audience interested without the need for slo-mo violence. The key to its appeal is the characters, and here the actors all stand out. Natalie Portman is the right kind of actress to portray Evey (although her English accent suffers, sometimes horrifically, but it is a reasonable attempt), and shows her vulnerabilities very well. Stephen Rea's detective is a world-weary man, frustrated by V's ability to avoid capture, again carried off with aplomb. The star is of course Hugo Weaving as V who, being masked all the way through the film (he never reveals his face, emphasizing his existence as an idea rather than a person), has to rely on physical and vocal actions to portray emotion, which he does extremely capably. His voice is perfect for V  understanding and passionate, yet with a slight hint of craziness.There are some faults  Britain loses the grimy feel that was given to us in the graphic novel, instead looking plain and perhaps too much like today's London. Secondly, sometimes the film feels too heavy handed in its message, coming across as clumsily preachy. Also, V's introduction is, from the script's point of view, extremely heavy handed and could potentially put viewers off the film. Stick with it though, and underneath the blockbuster you'll find a film that is both daring us to challenge our way of thinking, and also managing to entertain.Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Romanic View of an Individual verses Government,"James McTeigue directed V for Vendetta, a film about an individual who is brave enough to stand up against the oppressive new global government. Surveillance cameras are everywhere therefore, having a good time is forbidden unless permitted. V for Vendetta is produced in a time where the 21st generation is questioning 9-11. Was it someone trying to get personal revenge on the Western Government or someone trying to get revenge for deceiving society, yet let them believe that they are living in comfort? Was it over opium? I mean pharmaceuticals... V for Vendetta is produced during the Bush Administration Era: 2000-2008. Bush's reign produced the Iraqi War to help rid the world of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Osama Bin Ladin laid claim as the leader of Al Queda to the destruction of The World Trade Center. Only if there were fire works when the jets smashed into the Two Towers.V is a graphic novel brought to screen. It's entertaining as it reminds us of past dictatorships based on an ideology. The Government of America wants to convince the world of Globalization and prosperity for the individual. It is a destructive and evil nature to seek, for it makes the individual spiteful of their plights.Natalie Portman is an attractive female caught up in the world of V, the individual for freedom. The film romanticizes terrorism, as if it is a cause to philosophize about. Who are these terrorists anyway? It's so vague isn't it? Maybe the truth is hard for a comfortable nation. It was for Germany as they ignored a holocaust.Too bad the intellect of the individual is not examined. V for Vendetta is a bourgeoisie chat fest over a few drinks and a joint. The film tries to convince that it knows a deeper secret, yet it fails to convince. 9/11 was a serious attempt at telling us that we need to see the whole and step outside the box. V for Vendetta is helping us see beyond the walls, it wants us to suffer for the consequences of capitalism, a world void of feeling.

"Vivacious, violent, verbose","I certainly wasn't expecting that! V for Vendetta was one of those films which I've kinda wanted to see but there was something that always stopped me. I'm glad nothing did this time.The film begins with a double shot of the films two protagonists (or antagonists?!) share a double shot as they get ready to go out on their respective nights. Evey (Natalie Portman) is a young PA at the national news centre, BTN, and is accosted by some ill-intentioned 'Fingermen' after she is out after curfew. V (Hugo Weaving) saves her life, and therein begins a complicated, romantic and immediate relationship between the two. What ensues in the film is intrigue, emotion and vengeance as the two navigate an oppressive government while learning their backstories along the way.What impressed me the most is the script. Leaning on a Shakspearean satire style, Lily and Lana Wachowski creates a drama at its most literal meaning. They were effectively able to combine fascist ideals with the frustrations of an oppressed society, with every faction of this represented very well.The acting was perfect. The supporting cast played their role, but the two leads were in impeccable. Portman, although it showed she was quite early in her career, played the strong-willed-yet-vulnerable little girl superbly, but this film was run by one person: Hugo Weaving. This guy managed to make an emotionless mask convey all the emotions in his position, which has since become an icon in movie folklore. V has the past of hell, but with his voice alone he was able to portray control, deep sadness, menace and suave. The rest of the cast a whose who of British acumen: Rupert Graves, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Piggott-Smith, Roger Allam, Ben Mills and more.Great film and a better insight into government control and censorship.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"An ""Interesting"" Take on a Brilliant Novel","Though an interesting movie, and surely entertaining, V for Vendetta takes execrable liberties with the story by Alan Moore (so much so that Mr. Moore preferred his name not be attached to the film). Gone is the prevailing theme of anarchy as an alternative to fascism. Gone, too, are many of the lesser truths of the movie; but then again, as they said, ""artists use lies to tell the truth."" I can forgive the usage of television instead of radio for the use of propaganda, I cannot however neglect the drastic changes that go far beyond nuance.In Moore's graphic novel, no mention of Guy Fawkes is ever made. This is but one of the many things that in the movie is spelled out for the audience, but that the novel leaves as unsaid, though understood. Also, the novel does not take place in the future. (Though it should be noted that when written, the novel's time would have been the future, so this is understandable.) In the novel's beginning, Evey Hammond is trying to solicit herself upon the Fingermen, who then threaten to rape and kill her. V blows up the House of Parliament and then The Old Bailey, quite a drastic difference from the film. The graphic novel makes no mention of America, or ""America's war,"" both of which grandly offended me in this movie. That places a completely unnecessary element into the film, one that changes the viewer's concept of fascist Britain. And as for the St. Mary's Virus... I don't even know where that came from. Maybe the Wachowskis just wanted to throw another 'v' word into the mix. And as for how Finch was able to enter V's mind so ably at Larkhill, in the graphic novel, he was on LSD. No such mind-altering drugs are mentioned in the film. Which also reminds me that the theme of Britain's genocide seemed drastically down-played to me in the movie in comparison to the novel, though that may just be me. A huge discrepancy betwixt the graphic novel and the film is the manner in which V dies. I will not spoil that fact, but I shall just say that the bullet-storm V endures at the hands of Creedy is quite inaccurate. Lastly, the army of Vs, so flagrantly displayed in the the trailers, is an interesting idea  I will go so far as to say that I thought it was kind of bad ass  but entirely new to me. And as for V's final words to Evey in the movie... I nearly violently vomited.That said, I knew the movie was going to be a drastically different take than the graphic novel. As such, I was not entirely shocked by these massive changes. To put it as best I can, the differences between the book and the movie are much like the differences between Christianity and Islam. Yes, there are very noteworthy departures, but both have at their core a similar message, and at the end of the day, both accomplish the same goals.All in all, I would recommend this movie, though remind those that read the graphic novel to be prepared for a completely different view.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Bulletproof ideas,"No matter how you see it, be it by putting the DVD into the player, buying a ticket to watch it on the big screen or by streaming it.

V is an English-major's protagonist, spouting alliterations and quoting Shakespeare. Dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask and voiced with honeyed tones by Weaving, he's instantly likable and frightening, a madcap spirit who heralds the clarion call of change.Yes, there are obvious jabs at current events.

"Thought-provoking, uplifting, and inspiring.  I have never seen anything else that compares.","Cinema is an art form that is all too often cheapened by unimaginative, lazy and dull film-making. V for Vendetta has none of these flaws. This is not to say that it is a flawless film; rather, I cannot imagine anything that would improve the overall experience. Technically, the movie is more than sound, it is excellent. Performances are uniformly powerful and nuanced, camera-work suits the design elements and from the script to the editing, the film looks and feels coherent. This is, however, something of a high-brow action film and as such there is an inherent contradiction, an attempt to entertain with philosophy. The Matrix shied away from the deeper questioning of V for Vendetta in favour of awesome technical wizardry, and was a much bigger popular success as a result. While V is undeniably pretentious and self-indulgent, it is well made enough to lift itself above such criticism. For anyone who sympathises with the ideologies championed by the eponymous character, this is a film that will leave you internally cheering. Or literally cheering, if you are less restrained than I.The story itself is at once familiar and confronting – a totalitarian government pushes its citizenry too far, and a hero steps forth to try and overthrow the tyrants. But the genius of the storytelling is in the understatement. Vague references to events at 'St Mary's' and 'Threewaters' have little meaning to the audience until the later stages of the film, and the Wachowski Brothers have no qualms about revealing their plot slowly, using Stephen Rea's detective as a vehicle for their unveiling to their viewers (yes I am using alliterated V words. A tribute, I tell you). So much information is implied, rather than directly presented, that after numerous viewings there are still subtleties to the plot that are newly discovered. Piece by piece, the audience starts to understand the nature of the government that V rails against, and in doing so, they are positioned to question their own.Given the film's release date, this is not only a controversial but also brave project. Highly critical of government responses to terrorism, this is a film as sensitive to the fear and paranoia of the post-9/11 world as it is in the anger and discontent about government responses to that tragedy. V's terrorism is never fully endorsed, and he alludes to the fact that he is attempting to create a world in which he may have no place, but his attacks on landmarks seem bloodless and the people he kills all either deserve it, as in his revenge on those who tormented him, or are faceless uniforms that steadily march into quite exciting if cartoonish action set pieces.The graphic novel source is clear in both the imagery and atmosphere of V for Vendetta. Not only the painted Guy Fawkes mask, but the pseudo-Nazi flashbacks of the government's infancy and the fight scenes all seem a tribute to the original, if not a perfect adaptation (this film, however, is an achievement in and of itself and the relationship with the graphic novel is essentially trivia). The direction fetishizes the visual symbol, crowding V's lair with inter-textual contraband in a way that is at once pretentious, and also gifts the observant audience with another layer of meaning. There are so many cues to try and decipher that we never really learn what lies beneath the mask. (Ooh, cliché!) At its heart, V for Vendetta is a film about a message. The script foregrounds a concern with the power of ideas, and the constant battle to control and manipulate the media institutions of the diegetic world reinforces the film's paradox: this film attempts to undermine blind faith in the media we are presented, through a media presentation.But what message is V attempting to convey to its audience? It asks questions about the nature of power and freedom, what it means to be human, the appropriate extent of political control, revision of history and the justification of violence. But the barrage of different points and ideas and suggestions doesn't undermine the central message – it clarifies it. Whatever we do, whatever the world becomes, we as a society need to keep asking deep questions, and answering them with our actions.V for Vendetta may never receive the acclaim that it deserves, its own artistic indulgence a barrier for those who do not buy into the revolutionary and subversive undertones that permeate every aspect of the film. A work of genius, but like all genius, it is never completely accessible. This is still the most important film made this century, and one that will hopefully make its way into the school syllabuses of any truly free-thinking country around the world. Thought-provoking, uplifting, and inspiring. I have never seen anything else that compares.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An OK film,"I was pretty excited to see this one, after all the good reviews. But it was somewhat disappointing for me. The world we see is much too black and white, the characters, the set, the gravity the film is set in.Hugo W. and Natalie are great actors but given clumsy words to express the situation. Overall this film is OK. But it's also much too clean in look, the world is supposed to be dirty and evil, but yet what we see is nothing but pure advertising look images. It's also over explained and by that I mean the producers were most likely thinking that the film was to complicated, which it was not by far.However, despite this somewhat negative speech, the film is fine, but nothing more than an average flick. But I think the director (It's his first film) has a great and good future, it's a good start, great cast, but the screenplay is what was wrong with this one.

"If V is for Vendetta, then B is for...","Some people have criticised this movie because it 'only' cost $50 million. Others have criticised it because it allegedly makes a 'pinko liberal' point about what some politicians will do to stay in power. Yet more have criticised 'V for Vendetta' because the central character wears an unmoving mask for most of the film. After the 'Matrix' trilogy, a lot of film-goers expected a lot from the Wachowski brothers. Personally, I think that they have delivered.I also think that the 2nd and 3rd parts of the 'Matrix' trilogy sucked. Too many special effects and not enough plot killed off 'Reloaded' and 'Revolutions' for me, so I was relieved to see very little 'Bullet time' in 'V for Vendetta'. However, the brothers' penchant for protracted exposition and purple prose flared up in a few places. The Wachowski script is a dumbed-down, Americanised version of Alan Moore's eloquent graphic novel.And while we're on the subject of the script, people in the UK are a lot more creative when it comes to invective than the Wachowskis give them credit for. Aside from a couple of F's and one C, the predominant swearword in the movie is B0110cks. How ironic.You're probably wondering why I've given this film 7 out of 10 by now. Well, despite the sometimes ropey dialogue and overly flashy direction, I enjoyed watching a cast of mostly UK and Irish actors appearing in a film about the UK: A UK that I hope I never live to see. The parallels with Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany and every other dictatorship in history were chilling and well realised. With the wrong people in power, you can create a monstrous and monolithic dictatorship anywhere.The production designers deserve a mention for their work on 'V for Vendetta"". While the Nazi motifs are somewhat obvious, there are quite a few subtle visual references to the Britain of the 1940s and Russia during the Communist Era. This sort of detailed work makes V's world seem much more chilling and believable.V is a very English superhero and even though Alan Moore distanced himself from the project, the story of his hero/monster is now a movie. The Wachowskis may have sliced and diced the source material, but V is still very much himself; enigmatic, courageous, cruel, caring and self-contained.I think that last comment sums the film up quite well too.

V for Vrogaritrofrietz,"I don't know much about the comic books 'V for Vendetta' is based on but the film is quite an interesting action thriller, with flaws. The element of suspense is well built. Even though it's easy to predict the end, you want to know what will happen after each subsequent event and what the lead character V's next step is. It is a well crafted movie, well put together, moving at a steady pace. The cast includes talented British actors like Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Ben Miles etc but it's really Hugo Weaving who is the star of 'V for Vendetta'. Wearing a mask throughout the entire film, the actor can only rely on his voice and body language which are used very effectively! His fantastic dialogue delivery and smooth gestures are evidence of what an incredible job he's done. In contrast, Natalie Portman is miscast and fails to convince as a British woman. As an action flick 'V for Vendetta' is expected to be loud but some scenes were unintentionally funny, like the blowing up of the parliament and the Brits cheering along. I bet if it was the White House it would have created some controversy (but become a funnier movie nonetheless). Anyway, the action sequences are brilliantly choreographed. Dario Marianelli's score is another strong point. To conclude, 'V for Vendetta' is a decent enough popcorn flick for a one-time watch.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Masking Emptiness,"We've seen the image before: a white, Spartan-dressed dictator commands hold of the vacant masses. His mannerisms are stern and his message is cleardefy me or die. And, with this mental picture it's easy to segue into the world of James McTeigue's action/social commentary film, V for Vendetta.Vendetta's primary success centers around its enigmatic hero. Adapted from Alan Moore's often-lauded graphic novel of the same name, Vendetta tells the tale of the mysterious Guy Fawkes-masked 'V'an elegant terrorist if there ever was one. With the air of a modern Phantom of the Opera, V dashes through the streets of a dystopia London like a British Zorro. He's a man of the people, embracing anarchy in order to overthrow an obviously corrupt futuristic regime. And, as a result, it's hard not to get caught up with what the film throws at you. Just like the down-trodden populous that joins V's noble mission, the audience romps and rouses with every explosion and with every gloriously choreographed knife throw.Amidst the poetic violence is Natalie Portman's Evey Hammond. Small and weak, Evey becomes a protégé of V's honorable madness. Portman plays her character strongly, if a tad forced. Her emotion is real and compliments V's theatrics well.But, like V's mask, there is something darker underneath that glittering exterior. After the explosive fireworks die down, and it becomes possible to probe through the residual smoke, things aren't quite as appealing as they once seemed. At the heart of the matter, Vendetta is attempting to comment on a world that is too scared to stand up itself. As V succinctly puts it, ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" The words sound pretty, but the film fails to explore the ramifications of its message. We are never given the biting social satire of a film like Brazil or the hard hitting consequences of defiance presented in 1984. In turn, the result comes off tasting like stale bread.But, beyond the fact that 'V' doesn't give us anything new, it has the audacity at the same time to pretend that what it's attempting to say is ""edgy"" or ""subversive."" Nothing could be further from the truth. It's a movie made for the massesthe same masses that gobble up ""Rage Against the Machine"" albums and T-shirts. The same group that screams ""Power to the People"" while simultaneously voting for American Idol. And, there lies the problem with V for Vendetta. It's a movie that is attempting to say big things, but not really saying anything at all; an attractive picture, but no meat underneath. Corrupt governments are bad? Really? You don't say...This transparency is exemplified by Va character that is for all his moral speeches is nothing more than a static super hero. He slices! He dices! And, he knows how to alliteratively pronounce a lot of SAT WORDS! The void left by his static nature isn't filled by Portman's Evey, either. She seems to transform. But, really she wasn't one in need of convincing in the first place. By the time the film has ended, it is clear that V for Vendetta succeeds on a basic levelit punctures our emotions, and at the same time, is able to give us something that is visually engaging. However, once all is said is done, it is clear that a great charade has been played in front of our eyes. Portman's Evey emphatically reminds us to ""Remember, remember the fifth of November,"" but ultimately we are not told a reason why.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Remember, remember the 5th of November","I might not have read the graphic novel V for Vendetta from DC Comics and Vertigo Comics that was written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd, but after watching the movie it made me want to check out the graphic novel. Do not expect constant action scenes like The Matrix (1999), even though there are some action scenes, the movie mostly talks about government and the character named V taking down the government.Hugo Weaving as V was fantastic; he was cool to watch in the action scenes he is in, and just in normal dialogue scenes when he is talking to Evey played by Natalie Portman. I like how mysterious he is but also dignified sounding he is when talking to people he is to the people he goes after or just Evey alone, plus the main thing I liked was the relationship between Evey and V throughout the movie. Natalie Portman as Evey was exceptionally good; you understand her and her troubles involving her story with her parents or with the government in general, and I liked seeing her and V bond on similar goals.When the action scenes happen, V is cool to watch take down people either killing them or just knocking them out in quick motions that are great to watch. The action is shot well, and the way V moves around is cool in the action scenes when protecting Evey or just when he needs to achieve a certain goal of his. There is also a detective named Finch who is a detective hunting V and Evey who then starts doubting certain things and what side he is on, which I found interesting for his development throughout the movie.The cinematography in the movie is well shot and makes the movie nice to look at, either in action scenes, nice shots of London, or in certain locations where the characters need to go. With the nice camera shots of the locations there are also cool uses of lighting in dark rooms or lighting in outside shots when it is dark outside that can reveal characters in mysterious ways, how V would normally appear.V for Vendetta (2006) was an incredibly good comic book movie that people who have read the graphic novel will like, and the people who have not read the graphic novel will either like it or not like it. This movie is not going to be a non-stop action movie like most comic book movies, I do think all the government talk in the movie will be interesting and investing to watch, only if you are okay with it.

""". . . Governments should be afraid of their people!""","V For Vendetta (2005) -This film was scarily far too close to the horrors that the world is currently facing, but it was done in a kick ass way that made it cool and not as terrifying as reality or as some of the other films and TV series that I've seen along a similar theme. I couldn't get passed episode one of 'Years & Years' (2019), because the concept scared me so much and it didn't have that funky comic book feel to it that this one did.For me this seemed like the type of film the earlier 'Batman' (1989-97) attempts could have been with a little bit more effort. The others of this ilk - 'Sin City' (2005) '300' (2006) and although I didn't like the story, even 'The Watchmen' (2009) all had a vibe about them that I could appreciate, because it was obvious that the producers and directors had a clear vision and a theme. The 'Batman' films were just trying to jump on the latest bandwagons of the 90's with their attempts and failed.So right from the start, with the 'Brazil' (1985) type undertones of this film and the actual tones used, I felt that I knew their was something dystopian about it and that a Hero or even an Anti-hero would be needed to save the day.The story was very clever, with lots of twists and I definitely came away with the idea that I would have to purchase the original graphic novel to find out just how different it was and see if it was just as good or potentially even better.I have to say though, that having seen it before, it detracted from its power the second time around, because the surprises weren't new. As with 'The Usual Suspects' (1995), once I knew who Keyser Söze was it took away from the film, because the next time I watched it I was looking for the clues throughout and therefore viewing it in a different way.But this one was still enjoyable and I thought that the cast certainly contributed to that.Although, despite how much I love her (Insanely so for a gay man), I did find Natalie Portman's (Evey) English accent a bit dodgy.I also found the language track really bad in general too and without subtitles it was a struggle to understand it all. It was definitely too quiet in contrast to the backing track and I had to quickly reach for the volume buttons when the Tchaikovsky pumped out.It was a horrible version of how our future could quite easily turn out in just a few years time, but I still hope for the utopia that 'Star Trek' (1966-) has suggested instead. Perhaps it is time for the ruling parties to hear the people sing and to don their masks and maybe Guy Fawkes wasn't wrong after all, I don't know, but I do know that this was a good film, steered brilliantly by Hugo Weaving in the leading male role and with explosions and epic tension throughout.809.67/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Bold and Timely Political Thriller,"V for Vendetta (2005) is a striking and timely film that blends dystopian themes with powerful political commentary. Directed by James McTeigue and written by the Wachowskis, the film is set in a near-future Britain where a fascist regime controls the government. The story follows V, a mysterious, masked vigilante on a mission to overthrow the totalitarian state, and Evey, a young woman drawn into his radical cause.Hugo Weaving delivers a memorable performance as V, his voice and presence conveying both the character's tragic past and his revolutionary zeal. Despite never revealing his face, Weaving's portrayal of V is both compelling and intense. Natalie Portman, as Evey, is equally captivating, skillfully portraying a woman torn between fear and admiration for V's cause, ultimately discovering her own strength.The film's strength lies not just in its action-packed narrative, but in its themes of freedom, oppression, and the power of resistance. The iconic imagery of V's Guy Fawkes mask, which has since become a symbol of protest and rebellion worldwide, is perfectly emblematic of the film's message. The film asks tough questions about the limits of government power, the nature of justice, and the price of freedom, making it feel as relevant today as it did when it was first released.The cinematography, score, and sharp script all work in unison to create a tense, immersive atmosphere. V for Vendetta is not just a thrilling action film, but a thought-provoking exploration of political ideals and the ways in which individuals can fight against oppression.While the film can be seen as a call for revolution, it's also a cautionary tale about the costs of that revolution and the consequences of unchecked power.

"V for Vendetta is a well crafted and gritty dystopian film with a political story, it has a stellar cast and most importantly, it's cinema - My Ultimate Review","It was actually a long time ago since I watched V for Vendetta, but here we are multiple years later and with the preferred version or so I've read, the 4k blu-ray version. It was directed by James McTeigue (in his feature directorial debut) whilst the screenplay was written by the Wachowskis who also produced the film. What's so interesting about McTeigue is how he was an assistant director on many films; including Dark City, the Matrix trilogy and Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. All five I like. With his work and relationship with The Wachowskis, I can understand why they placed their trust on him, his direction and visual storytelling is perfect and he did create a great adaption. This was the last film Adrian Biddle worked on before his death and as always, his cinematography is stunning and brilliant. The film just looks incredible, with its stellar production and art design, there were so many talented people working on this film. The editing is truly fantastic, Martin Walsh did some award worthy work on this film, without a doubt one of the highlights. Dario Marianelli's musical score is perfect and powerful. The Dolby Atmos track for the 4k blu-ray was spectacular and so was the picture quality. One thing that I really find interesting, more now than last time I watched it, is how the film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in Great Britain. I actually think this film works better on a rewatch as V for Vendetta is extremely detailed. There's a lot of things I liked more this time around than before, the political story, the storytelling used there are so good and is the reason why some of the actors wanted in on the project, and that's completely understandable as the political allegory is brilliant which makes for such a more realistic and interesting story.In the distant future, Evey Hammond is an average citizen of the United Kingdom, which is under the rule of the fascist and tyrannical Norsefire Party. She is an employee of the state-run British Television Network, but soon, she becomes the number one enemy of the state together with an enigmatic and larger-than-life freedom fighter known only by the letter ""V"". V informs Evey that she must hide in his underground lair for at least one year, and while she is reluctant to the idea at first, a bond soon forms between the two individuals. In the meanwhile, the mysterious past of V is gradually revealed to the police inspector tasked with capturing him, Eric Finch, and it is not long until he starts questioning everything his government stands for.The film has a stellar cast, both lead actors and supporting cast. Natalie Portman plays Evey Hammond, an employee of the state-run British Television Network who is rescued by V from a gang of London's secret police and subsequently becomes involved in his life. Hugo Weaving as V, a masked, charismatic and skilled anarchist terrorist who had been the unwilling subject of experimentation by Norsefire. Stephen Rea as Eric Finch, the Chief inspector of New Scotland Yard and Minister of Investigations (the ""Nose""), is the lead inspector in the V investigation, who, during his investigation, uncovers an unspeakable government crime. Stephen Fry as Gordon Deitrich, a closeted gay talk show host. John Hurt as Adam Sutler, the former Conservative Member of Parliament and Under-Secretary for Defence. High Chancellor Sutler is the founder of Norsefire and is Britain's authoritarian elected leader. My favorite performances in this film is Natalie Portman and Stephen Rea, their strong acting helps the film in many ways, but Hugo Weaving is absolutely fantastic as V. He keeps the mask on during the majority of the film, so we don't get much acting with facial expressions, but as a character and what Weaving brings to the role, I'm sure he's one of the reasons why the character became one of the most iconic protagonists in media.V for Vendetta is based on the graphic novel with the same name which Alan Moore wrote, like Watchmen I'm sure this was a hard project to adapt but I think The Wachowskis did a brilliant job at it. It just works so well in this format of storytelling, making use of its themes but also bringing new ones to the table like numerous references to events surrounding the George W. Bush administration in the United States which works quite well as it makes it more real in a way. I haven't read the source material, yet, but I have understood that there were a lot of changes made.As a film about the struggle between freedom and the state, V for Vendetta takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including the Third Reich and George Orwell's 1984. For example, Adam Sutler primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, both common features among modern totalitarian regimes and reminiscent of the image of Big Brother. There is also the state's use of mass surveillance, such as closed-circuit television, on its citizens - reminiscent of the comprehensive mass surveillance systems currently deployed in many nations, such as China. The name Adam Sutler is intentionally similar to Adolf Hitler. Like the so-called Führer, Sutler is given to hysterical speech. Also like Hitler, Sutler is a racial purist, although Jews have been replaced by Asians and Muslims as the focus of Norsefire ethnoreligious propaganda and persecution. As noted by several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror elements from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom both wear masks to hide their disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom of the Opera. V for Vendetta is a film that critics and commentators have pondered about and written about to find themes and interpretations to the story and imagery, the film is rich in all that. V for Vendetta received few awards, although at the 2007 Saturn Awards Natalie Portman won the Best Actress award. The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007.Richard Corliss wrote for Time, ""It's a terrific movie. I love the look and the verve of the thing, the confidence of its epic design, its smart use of half a dozen noted British thesps, lending weight and wit to the supporting roles"", I after fully with his thoughts. V for Vendetta is an action film, true, and that was the main reason I watched it all those years ago.

Utopia's quite another land.,"""Who was that masked man?""From Zorro to Batman, and all other masked marvels in between, our fascination with disguised do-gooders doesn't die. Add a worthy entrant into that pantheon: comic book genius Alan Moore's futuristic avenger, V, who roams London purging it of criminals common and famous, all of whom suffer his rage at having been abused in a government experiment years ago.V for Vendetta is a superior adaptation, whose major virtue for me is the lack of quick cuts and computer graphics, the exception to the latter being the spectacular destruction of a few London institutions. V's mask has a smile that sears with irony and humanity, plain and simple, and his brand of mayhem has much more to do with brains that technology.Natalie Portman's Evey is an uncomplicated vessel of uncertainty with a strong genetic inclination toward idealism, a perfect companion for the masked vigilante, who has saved her from harm and awakened a woman of substance. Portman headlines the film, finally showing she has the class to act like an intelligent heroine and the beauty to satisfy an audience's penchant for extremes in sci-fi.Much will be made about the allegorical relevance to Bush/Blair conservatism. Andy Wachowski's screenplay and James McTeigue's direction show hooded prisoners who resemble those at Abu Ghraib, and a neo-fascist chancellor intimidating his citizens with fear of fear. Even his second in command has a resemblance to Dick Cheney, and an ultraconservative TV host looks like Silvio Berlusconi.With the entrance of Stephen Rea's chief inspector Finch, I knew this would be a complete cinematic success, for I am always haunted by his world-weary Fergus from Crying Game, an actor whose very hang-dog visage suggests a growing awareness of the world's danger and his inability to stop its eventual destruction. But not before V and his league of masked gentlemen have given the neocons a run for the souls of a dystopia only George Orwell could love and Edgar Allen Poe could depict.""Utopia's quite another land; In her enterprising movements, She is Englandwith Improvements.""

"A stylish, engaging, dramatic political thriller with smashing action and killer performances.","The only major flaw with V for Vendetta is the rather slow, lackluster beginning, but as soon as the movie really kicks off, you will be in for the ride of the year. James McTeigue, previously only the assistant to the Wachowski brothers, has made his debut here with this amazing thriller which has to be seen on the big screen.Hugo Weaving delivers the performance of his life as the mysterious V. Having to work behind a mask, his job is a tough one and I'm happy to say he pulls it off magnificently. Although we never see V, we feel for him, we care for him and we're impressed by his charisma. If you thought that the only thing Hugo was good for was playing Agent Smith, you've just been proved wrong.Natalie Portman proves that the only reason she was so bad in the Star Wars prequels was because of inept directing. In ""V"", she is amazing, showcasing a wide range of emotions, fear, sorrow, pain and relief in such a believable way her character Evey feels real and true, which makes her torture even more painful. The actress from ""Léon"" whom I knew and loved, has returned.John Hurt delivers a wonderful scenery-chewing performance as Adam Sutler, the leader of England. The plot, concerning a society where the leaders control their people through fear, voicing your opinion is a crime, and being different could mean your death, is chilling as well as pressing, and should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who blindly trusts his or her government. Like The Matrix made you rethink your entire existence, ""V"" makes you question just how much power the government should be allowed in its quest to fight everything we fear.V for Vendetta builds up carefully and ends with a fantastic action scene, and a genuinely heartfelt scene between our anti-heroes. It is not often that an action film contains important political topics, while telling a great story, showcasing amazing action, AND making us care about the characters. Absolutely amazing, I recommend you watch it right now.(r#15)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sutler = Hitler = Bush,"V for Very good.I remember finding the V for Vendetta graphic novel at a townhouse I was renting and reading it and thinking it was amazing. Used to comics being Superman and Aquaman it was so different, so many levels. Hard to follow at times but excellent. That was about 12 years ago so I'd forgotten about. Until the movie came along and it was truly great.The Wachowski Bros have done it again. Great futuristic, Ne-socialist, 1984ish atmosphere. Yes a lot goes towards the fact that if you want to be rid of crime, terrorism and poverty and such then you must give up your individual freedoms and certain rights. Sound familiar? Which is better? I dunno. But it's a great movie that doesn't just preach one side or the other. It shows you both. And the Bill O'Reilly/Ann Coulter type announcer who spews the party line is too funny and just way too familiar. And the way the government controls the media (Fox News) and twists or just plain fabricates stories to make them look good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Veracious Venerable Vendetta!,"Where to begin? I was determined to see whether or not the Wachowski brothers would stay true to the novel. With all the hype and media attention drawn to the movie, it was nothing short of perfection. For those who have read the comic, it is obvious that things have changed but I believe they are for the better. Certain situations allow you to get a sense of satisfaction that you did not get from the comic. There is already satisfaction because V for Vendetta has been brought to life! Of course, the movie does leave you thinking about society, people, and a sense of wisdom. Walking out of the theater, it made a huge commentary on our current society and government. For those who have read the comic, I think you can agree that it applies more to today than it did two decades ago. The scariest thing is that V for Vendetta can still be applied to modern day even 25 years after it was published.Natalie Portman shows a wide spectrum of emotions and talent which haven't been seen for in the Star Wars trilogy. She portrays Evey Hammond with a perfect execution. Of course, Hugo Weaving cannot be forgotten. As you watch the movie, his voice is so captivating, it sounded the way V should. Portman and Weaving were the perfect actors for the roles. I couldn't possibly imagine James Purefoy as V.So please, do not avoid this movie just because of the controversy, the politics, and the on-going terrorism events. It is a movie that leaves you captivated. V for Vendetta allows the audience to feel empathy, sympathy, and compassion. It isn't just an action movie filled with politics, it is so much more than that. V for Vendetta is the movie for our generation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Pretty Awesome,"This film is powerful; mostly because of how different it is from every other blockbuster. Set in a possible future where America is in ruins and England is ruled by a totalitarian dictatorship - the plot focuses on a mysterious rebel named V played by Hugo Weaving {Agent Smith of the Matrix}. He lives in London, wears a mask, models himself on Guy Fawkes and as such, is essentially a terrorist. It is his aim to encourage the populace to rise up against an oppressive regime, which until now, has not been successfully opposed.The story revolves around V and a girl he meets named Evey, played by Natalie Portman. Their first chance encounter allows V to introduce himself near the beginning of the film; where Hugo's background as a Shakespearean actor is put to good use in a long and slightly ridiculous monologue that is more than vaguely reminiscent of 'the architect's' over-wordy contributions to the matrix trilogy. However, this is the only point at which I felt the erudite nature of V's character was slightly overstressed.The well choreographed action sequences keep the pace of the film high as is only to be expected with the direction of the Wachowski brothers. The comic book background must be remembered when it comes to realism at certain points; but the overall premise is made quite believable with stories within the story explaining and answering the audience's questions as the film progresses.Overall, V for Vendetta is not just entertaining, but also highly thought provoking. Like a modern day '1984', it paints a fascinating picture of a future dystopia without forgetting to develop its characters, all while keeping the audience interested throughout. Don't just go and see this film if you fancy an action-packed no-brainer; you might find the plot a little too intricate and original for your liking...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

These are just a few of the questions V for Vendetta brought to my mind. Bottom line, awesome movie that should become an instant classic.

A pleasant surprise,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie really. That the Wachowski-brothers produced it didn't really tell me anything. Somehow i have the feeling that the first Matrix-movie was more or less the highpoint of their creativity, the sequels were definite disappointments and beside their visual sense they are not a reason for me to watch a movie any more.I guess more than anything i watched this expecting an action-movie. This is something else though. Sure there are a few action sequences in the movie and generally they are reasonably well-made (although not really very spectacular). So if it's not an action-movie, what is it? Well, it felt to me like some sort of mix between Orwell's ""1984"" and a superhero-comic. Much of the time the movie is devoted to semi-philosophical discussions about the value of freedom and views on justice. I guess this might put some people off, not least because it's always odd to see someone wearing an expressionless mask talk so much.The fascist-future thing has been done so many times in my opinion that i had a hard time seeing what news ""V for Vendetta"" could actually bring to the table. But still it's not a bad take on the genre, and the fact that it's very distinctly British helps as well to separate it from the pack. There are quite a lot of clichés (not least when it comes to the dictator and his appearance) but i could stomach most of them. The acting in the movie is OK and Hugo Weavings voice is enough filled with expression to make up for the lack of facial movement or other expressions.I guess whether you will like this or not depends on how much quasi-philosophical discussions you can accept, especially when these discussions happen where most people would expect blazing guns. In that respect it's much like the Matrix-sequels in that it's less action and more talking. The difference in my opinion is that ""V for Vendetta"" is a better movie for it while the Matrix-sequels lost all their appeal without the fast pace and gun ballet. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie and i think many others were too. The fact that the result had very little to do with my expectations just heightened the positive feelings.

Overrated,"Before watching V for Vendetta, I had great hopes for this movie. All my friends, that had watched the movie before me, said that it was spectacular. Besides I saw the average grade for the movie in IMDb. moreover, I have not read the comic, but i heard about the very interesting scenario.When I finished watching the film, I felt unsatisfied.Personally, I didn't like the Matrix trilogy, because of the directing style, which exists in V for Vendetta too (due to the Wackofsky brothers, I suppose. I believe there are far superior movies of similar genre that have better fighting scenes and camera shots, like Spiderman 2 or Hero, or sometimes, even Danny the Dog. The same goes about the ""adrenaline"" scenes, or the close camera shots on faces.I personally believe that V for Vendetta fails to really give to the viewers the high expected feel of emotion or of idealism, though the motive of the rebel story. Moreover, it has a feel of really speeding the story sometimes.However, V for Vendetta is a really pleasant action film to watch, with good dialogues that make the watcher to think, serving a great scenario about people, governments and rebel in a futuristic aspect.As for synopsis, V for Vendetta is a good film, but it could have been much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Guy Fawkes at its best ;),"Well,...Facsism born from fear. It has never been more actual than today. I really like the kind of story; fear dictates society and has been used by a few ones to get on top of politics and media to satisfy their greed for power and money. Mankind got suppressed by illusions created by all kinds of media, which also lays in the hand of politics. But there's hope - a fighter for freedom sees through corruption and greed and all the plans that were made to control society. His name is Guy Fawkes. So till here all is fine. Nice story, well done. So far.. But the protagonist ""Guy Fawkes"" looks ridiculous. He wears a masks that makes him smile all the way. He became a fighter for rights and humanity, the moral Institution of mankind, as he got abused as a test-person for some new kind of virus. Like ""Hulk"" he breaks through his cell and raises to seek revenge. And this was the point where I started to dislike the film. Too sci-fi, too ""Hollywood-made-up"", too much action, that it became ridiculous and no more serious, as the political and moralic intention actually is and should be. Dear people: Government really uses you to empower their chosen ones, at the cost of our life's! So I'd like to shout out:""HELLO, THIS REALLY _IS_ HAPPENING, take it more serious and erase your stupid Hollywood-action"".

"Fun to watch, but nothing more.","You have to give it to the Wachowski brothers (the writers); they do know how to entertain. But shallow entertainment is all you get out of this completely naive portrayal of totalitarian Britain post-9/11, post-bird flu, post-disintegration of America, post-closure of all underground stations in London. The country is now ruled by a dictator (Hurt) whose only source of power is numbing people with fear of basically everything around them. And for some reason, it seems that the only form of evil government to be found is an exact replica of the Nazi regime. If only the brothers could open their eyes just a little bit, they can see the making of totalitarian governments that abuse people's fears for individual gains all around them.The movie tells the story of assimilated Evey (Portman) who encounters the masked and courageous V (Weaving) when he rescues her from a fate worse than death. V is actually a ""terrorist"" who blows things up, among other atrocities, in order to wake the people of Britain from their slumber and remind them that their government is meant to serve them and not the other way round. Evey slowly unlocks the secrets of this mysterious man, uncovering corruption and unspeakable acts that consequently expose her real self.Although Weaving and Fry (as Dietrich) give charming performances, I am still baffled by the choice of Natalie Portman as Evey. Even if the casting director was forced to put in an American actress in order to boost box office returns, couldn't she at least have picked someone who can speak with a British accent? Anyway the movie is actually fun to watch. Just don't expect anything more out of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The London scenery is a perfect setting for a movie like this and it makes everything look pleasingly familiar. But there is one thing you should consider if you haven't seen this movie yet, it isn't a straight out action-movie, it also contains quite a bit of drama and history (which in this case makes the movie even better), but the movie never gets too slow and is a rare gem, that everyone should watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

What a story. The special effects are amazing and the story is fascinating.

Over the course of 1 year, things change for Evie.

They will run our lives and their will be nothing that any of us can do about it. We are all seriously doomed if Bush stays in power.

Wow.  It's good.  One might say fantastic.,"Wow. That was my first thought after seeing ""V for Vendetta"". This movie something for everyone. To interest those who enjoy shoot-'em-up movies like ""Bond"" and ""The Matrix"", there is no shortage of action. Brilliantly choreographed fight scenes and amazing cinematography make for compelling fight scenes that are both interesting and unique.

The movie takes place in a post-modern world where the US has crumbled into decay over it's war on terror. Great Britain, who has been targeted by terrorists for its support of the US, has turned to a religious, authoritarian government to protect them. The conservative government has banned homosexuals, outlawed Islam, enforced curfews on it's people, abducted citizens for speaking out, and taken control of the media. Needless to say, all of these are issues which are hotly contested with today's White House regime.The story that follows contains wit (with quotes from Shakespeare and Dickens) and imagination.

Embrace the essence,"Moving philosophical action movie does not disappoint, although is clearly in need of a trim. While the primary theme of rebellion can at it's best be cathartic, and the relationship between it's two principle characters fascinating and inspiring, as usual the Wachowski's overpower their themes with unnecessary exposition, subplots that deter rather then add, and dialog delivered that still feels like it comes from the page in it's profound, but showman-like and detached nature. What saves Vendetta from all these pratfalls however is the heavy handed yet accessibly executed instigation behind the essence of what one yearns for when they yearn to be free. In that, Alan Moore, Wachowski's, and Hugo Weaving have etched into his character V the most compelling, larger then life character since Tyler Durden. To all those who would rather embrace an ideal rather then mull over minor distractions, enjoy this film's core.

Better as swashbuckling drama than as political commentary,"ZORRO MEETS 1984 - a film review by Robert Fleeman.There is a common phrase known in conservative circles on the internet which is identified by the acronym BDS. The letters are short for ""Bush Derangement Syndrome."" It identifies anyone whose extreme hatred of President George W. Bush blinds them to the point that rationality no longer applies. To these individuals and organizations, Bush isn't just wrong about everything, he is simply the root of all evil.I wouldn't go so far as to identify the Wachowski Brothers as sufferers of this condition, but their latest effort: V For Vendetta, certainly shows some symptoms of the disease. Based on the graphic novel by Englishman Alan Moore, who intended his work as an criticism of the conservative Thatcher administration, this adaptation contains numerous swipes at the current American administration. References to dominating a people through a climate of fear, torturing dissidents and rounding up homosexuals are no doubt meant as metaphors for the Bush presidency. In this movie, simply being identified as a conservative is the same thing as being evil.Fortunately, if you are not politically oriented, it is possible to enjoy this swashbuckling tale of a lone warrior who fights against a totalitarian government which has taken hold of England in the near future. Identified only as V, this knife-wielding avenger is never seen without his costume or Guy Fawkes mask. For those who don't know, Guy Fawkes was an English nobleman who plotted with others in the early 17th century to blow up the English Parliament. Apparently, the event is mockingly celebrated every year in England, on the fifth of November. The reference for V is appropriate, given that he has similar plans for the current government which bears great resemblance to Nazi Germany and the fictionalized regime found in George Orwell's book 1984.V (Hugo Weaving) is a lone warrior until he meets Evey (Natalie Portman), a young and beautiful woman he rescues one evening from despicable members of the secret police. She inadvertently becomes his protégé, assisting V in his efforts to get to certain representatives of the government, corrupt clergy and willing members of the media. It turns out that V's efforts aren't just political, but also heavily personal as he seeks revenge for events earlier in his life.A counterpoint storyline follows the efforts of two detectives, one played by Stephen Rea, to discover the identity of V. The closer the two come to figuring out who V is, the more they become convinced that he isn't the real problem. John Hurt also stars as Chancellor Adam Sutler, the diabolical leader of the brutal regime. Hurt also starred in the film version of 1984, playing a victim of the totalitarian state.Hugo Weaving, best known as Mr. Smith in the Matrix movies and the elf king in the LOTR trilogy, does quite well given the limited opportunity to act behind V's porcelain mask. His soft, mannerly English accent is a nice counterpoint to the bizarre getup that is both stunning and funny at the same time. Natalie Portman continues her fine work (outside of the recent Star Wars trilogy), having to maintain an English accent for the duration of the film. She also undergoes a stunning physical transformation that dramatically alters her appearance.One of the things that I did like about this film is the fact that V isn't presented as just a heroic figure. He is a truly obsessed man, wrapped up in his own world, bearing more than a passing resemblance to the Phantom of the Opera. He does quite a few things in this movie that will make you question whether or not you should be rooting for his character. In some ways the true heroine of the piece is Evey.The film drags a little bit in the middle, but for the most part keeps the interest level high, as it is a fresh take on an old concept. I just wish the film makers would have left out references to current politics. It was an unnecessary inclusion and only serves to alienate a significant portion of the audience. This seems to be a continuing theme for me lately, as so many politicized movies have come out lately, all leaning heavily to the left.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
