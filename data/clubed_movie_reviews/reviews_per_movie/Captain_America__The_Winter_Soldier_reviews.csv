"On your left,,,","At the time this came out, it was without a doubt the best movie to come out of the MCU. I look forward to seeing more from the Russo bros.While I thought the First Avenger was an incredible piece of work, this sequel is even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definietly one of the best MCU movies,"Oh man, was it good to get back to a great movie again after Thor: The Dark World. This movie, unlike that one, is well constructed, written, acted and directed. There is so much to love about the movie it's hard to name it all. The plot is well thought out and realized, complete with great twists and turns to keep you on your toes. I love the spy thriller astethic the movie presents, and it complements the more straight forward action very well. It also presents its themes of trust and morality in a solid and thoughtful way. The pacing is solid, the plot advances in a very natural way, and the movie sets up its important plot points ahead of time to make the movie more enjoyable on rewatches. The movie also does a great job with its characters. Steve, Natasha and Nick are all great characters with their own struggles, while also being very likeable, and they also have excellent chemistry. I love that Steve and Nat's relationsship isn't romantic, as that wouldn't work at all with these characters. I also really like Sam, he's sympathetic and a nice addition. The Winter Soldier is a great villain as well, which mostly comes from the fact that he is just a human, not some evil monster like so many other Marvel villains. I love watching his struggles with indentifying his past and resisting the changes made to his brain, as well as his relationsship with the hero. All this is of course helped by some solid performances from almost everyone involved. The direction is solid as well, with the perfect mix of wide shots and close-ups. The fight choreography is great, one can really feel the weight each fight carries. My only slight issue with the film is the fact that the heroes seem to be saved by plotholes a little too often, for example by a bad guy waiting to killing a good guy just long enough for something to appear to save them. It feels a little stupid, but it's not a big deal and it's pretty easy to ignore if you feel like it. Overall, this movie is extremely good. It does almost everything right, its flaws are small and inconsequental, and it's just a really entertaining movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes superhero movies, or just action movies in general.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
THIS is Captain America,"A political and action thriller that has an awesome espionage spin to it. Chris Evans and his team kick butt, and Scarlett Johansson is as hot as ever. Plus, mysterious and sinister villains that pose an intimidating threat! Not to mention, the score hits it out of the park with the feels! This is easily the best standalone MCU movie imo. Hands DOWN!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Maybe the best MCU movie,"The fact that I rate this movie with 10 is not an exaggeration. This particular movie I really consider to be the best of MCU as the character development, the story, the action scenes, the direction and many more details still shock you.It could be said that this is a political drama with a strong Marvel dose in it. The dialogues are also excellent and careful written as well as the casting.
I understand that many other movies like Infinity War, Avengers etc. are considered by most to be 'better', but if you watch this specific movie twice or more, you will realize that you are facing a masterpiece in all respects. In most parts of it, you think that you are in the movie and you feel that you are experiencing the emotions of the characters. In my humble personal opinion, I will repeat that Captain America: Winter Soldier is a masterpiece and will always be my number one Marvel movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Unique, exciting and quite serious","What I love most about this movie is the villain, which there isn't really one. This is what separates it from most average superhero movies. It takes a spin and says that a whole organisation of people are the villain, but even the characters in the movie don't know who is bad and who is good. It creates a very uneasy viewing as no one can be trusted as said and shown throughout. The opening scene on the boat is so very special. It instantly opens deliberately fast paced and gets the viewer on the edge of their seat. And just once they are completely focused on the action it takes a step back and allows an amazing and sophisticated story to be told. Unlike most other superhero movies, the plot of this one actually takes risks, it is far less predictable and has a less linear story. This does make some things get muddled up, but nothing that you really need to know to understand the film. As far as characters, they're alright. I don't expect incredible character arcs from a movie like this but I really enjoyed following Nick Fury, and also Steve and Bucky's relationship. I've heard major praise about the soundtrack, I thought it was a bit underwhelming, it doesn't really make a difference. Solid movie ^-^",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best Marvel comic book superhero movie of 2014 so far!,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is the best Marvel comic book Action Superhero movie and one of my favorite films of The Avengers! Big, busy and action-packed - like the first movie, but with better pacing. It is a huge improvement over Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) I am sorry but I don't think Joe Johnston is making a good films. He even screwed up my favorite film Jurassic Park III. Great movie! I didn't like the first Captain America but I LOVE this one. Great acting, great story, great action, great EVERYTHING. Marvel Studios continues to improve upon and expand this superhero universe and it shows with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The action is turned up, the performances are top notch, plus with the addition of Robert Redford raises the bar yet again. Chris Evans certainly owns this role know just as Downey owns Tony Stark.I LOVE LOVE LOVED the Iron Man trilogy. There are lots of great intrigue moments, though I think some of the biggest ""plot points"" on this one were spoiled thanks to the marketing and broader fan base knowledge of the whole ""Winter Soldier"" subplot in the comics. Regardless, it was a fun ride, albeit predictable as far as the internal politics end goes. The themes in this one are far more ""mature"" for a comic book movie, too--it almost felt more like a political action thriller Ã  la Jack Ryan rather than a comic book based film, which made me love it even more. Phenomenal cast (the returns were fantastic as always, but the new characters also really did great work!), great music, the action sequences in this are SO awesome and generally I left this movie feeling very satisfied. I'm definitely going to see this more than once. It also makes me want to watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which I haven't actually seen yet, but apparently there were plenty of references!Overall, this was a huge improvement on the first Captain America movie, which I actually didn't liked that much but it was a good movie. I'd venture to say I liked it more than The Avengers. D: Chris Evens gave us a wonderful performance as Captain America, it was the most Action comic book film I have ever seen! This film has a heart, it is Entertained, fast paced, filled with full of actions. Samuel L. Jackson did a wonderful job as Nick Fury, finally his character did something to do in this film, like fighting with assassins and so on. I loved him in this film much better than I did in Avengers : Age of Ultron (2015)in this film he has everything in it. Scarlet Johansson did a good job a supporting cast as Natasha Romanoff she wasn't annoying in here, she was a good supporter to cap. I hated her in Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron, but in this film I like her and I have enjoyed watching her in this film screen. This is the most wildest, most colorful team of superheroes ever brought to life on the big screen, is a massive success, a fan favorite and a critical darling. Winter Soldier, a tense, dramatic conspiracy thriller that somehow makes its strangest comic book elements work wonders, is a masterfully conceived and executed sequel that takes Captain America -- and, along with Guardians, the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe -- in a bold, exciting direction. Both are outstanding films. Both boast astonishing confidence, production design, action and visual effects. Both are terrific fun. Both represent a brave new world for comic book movies. And each one for completely different reasons.Which is Marvel's crowning achievement? How do you even compare the two? Answer: you don't. Other than ranking the films by personal preference, it's a fool's errand to pit Cap, Black Widow and Falcon against Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot. You sit back, think to yourself it's good to be a geek, soak it all in, and wait for the inevitable Avengers crossover. Love 'em both. Watch both of 'em over and over and over again. Enjoy each one on its own terms. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) was probably my second favorite Marvel film of 2014 but this one Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a kick ass best film ever! This film kick's Joss Whedon's Failure Avengers Age of Ultron in to the ground! This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth.As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with another super soldier, the Black Widow, to battle a new threat from history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier. I love this movie and I don't care what anyone say! It Is my favorite best Marvel film of 2014!Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a 2014 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and the ninth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Marvel Studios Starring: Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Robert Redford, Samuel L.

Much better than the original,I'm not a cap America fan but this one had some good plot twists and was essential viewing for the rest of the avengers. Love black widow and enjoyed the plot about control and spin. Much better than the first instalment,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America: The Winter Solider,"Captain America: The Winter Solider, directed by the best two directors that MCU has on the team, in the Russo Brothers, crafted this well directed, brisk paced spy/action film, that has a lot to be praised for. The Russo Brothers took the MCU style, and completely flipped it into their own, which completely works, while becoming a model film for the MCU. They incorporated this darker and gritter tone, that essentially grounded the film well, while inevitably throwing in some well timed humor. Even though this new approach to the MCU was a breath of fresh air, the Russo Brothers set themselves up for some nitpicks, by transforming some things that were already set and stone, for the most part.The Winter Soldier does everything that a sequel should do, and that's improve on every aspect from the last film. The creative team told a juicer, more cohesive story, with better character involvement and development, while the action not only took a step up, but became one of the standout films for it's action sequences. Not only did they improve from the first installment, keeping the continuity involved, but they created one of, if not, the best stand-alone films the MCU has put out to date. The creative team utilized so many great layers and depth, to really break everything down, while adding in a tremendous amount of tention throughout the entire narrative.With Shield being the main focus of the film, I wasn't too sure on how things were going to play out, but because of the Russo Brothers creativity, I was perfectly okay with it! With Shield being center of attention, it allowed for Sam Jackson to have a lot more character moments, which had a heavy hand in the success of the film! Chris Evans is an absolute stud as Captain America and Steve Rogers! He is fleshed out much more, having the best character arch of the film. His character is a lot more complex this time around, other than being that public figure everyone knows him for. Evans steals every scene that he's in because of that genuine patriotism persona he carries, being nothing short of admirable. Scarlett Johansson was also another key contributor to the success of the film. We've seen her in a few films prior, getting a little bit more and more to do as the films go on, and she really sets out her skillset here. With decent chemistry and tention between her and Captain America, and her and Nick Fury, she shows once again, that she is capable of being an Avenger. Anthony Mackie gets his debut in the MCU as Sam Wilson/Falcon, and he is just an all around good addition. He doesn't add much as far as the superhero antics go, but he is a great compliment to Captain America, and the team. The Winter Soldier is a GAME villain! He doesn't have much to say, but his physical presence is quite enough for him to be a decent villain, with a great tie in to the series.This is probably one of the strongest screenplays by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. They wasted no time after The First Avenger, to hop right into the screenplay for this film. McFeely and Markus added a great amount of wit to this script, by making everything cohesive to the story, while incorporating some dialed down, yet sharp humor. They added a great deal of politics to the narrative, that isn't just all in your face; it flows extremely well with the story, feeling authentic.The action of the film was definitely the driving force of the film. All of the action scenes were shot so well, with many exciting and gritty action sequences! The Russo Brothers executed the hand-to-hand combat in such a professional way, and it just looked fantastic! The visual effects weren't heavily relied on, like they usually are, but when they were present, everything looked seamless.Overall, there is no reason why this film shouldn't be at the top of your list; one of the best the MCU has to offer !",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Nice plot...,"""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch Steve Rogers trying to stop an assassin known as the Winter Soldier with the help of another Avenger, Black Widow.I liked this movie because it had a nice and interesting plot that contained plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. The interpretation of Chris Evans who played as Steve Rogers was for one more time very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Scarlett Johansson's who played as Natasha Romanoff, Sebastian Stan's who played as Bucky Barnes and Frank Grillo's who played as Brock Rumlow. The direction which was made by both Anthony Russo and Joe Russo was exceptional and they did an amazingly good job on the way they presented the plot and their main characters. Finally, I have to say that ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is an interesting action movie that even if you are not a Marvel fan, I am sure you will enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I didn't remember it being this good.,"Just amazing action scenes, so well choreographed, leaves you in awe. While the story is very well constructed, makes you really feel for it. It is smart, fast, while still being heartfelt comic book adaptation. Just a great movie, that feels underappreciated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Thrilling Sequel that Raises the Bar for Marvel,"With Rogers, Fury, and Romanoff previously established, directors Joe and Anthony Russo do a magnificent job at expanding these characters â along with some secondary characters we've seen before â providing more depth to understanding their actions and how they will affect future stories. Sam Jackson has a stronger presence this time around, validating Nick Fury as a main staple in the MCU among the big boys. Captain America is stronger, faster, and a more refined soldier, equipped with better fighting skills and understanding of current technology. Evans plays the earnestness of Captain America's black and white morality with convincing finesse in an age of grey that he has yet to find a comfortable middle. And Johansson progresses the allure of the cunning and multifaceted Black Widow, while bringing a splendid and lively balance to Rogers' straight and narrow.Amidst such a tight and clever script, The Winter Soldier introduces a band of new characters, all of whom play a significant role, creating a more layered and conceivably real MCU. Frank Grillo brings the swolling mass of muscle known as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Brock Rumlow to life. Emily VanCamp surprises with her portrayal of Agent 13, whom I wish had more screen time with Cap than just two quick scenes. Robert Redford plays Alexander Pierce, a superior ranking Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., friend to Nick Fury, and representative of the World Security Council. Pierce is a wonderful look into the higher ranks at S.H.I.E.L.D., contributing new insights as to how the organization is run outside of Fury, Agent Coulson, and Agent Maria Hill. Anthony Mackie is Sam Wilson aka The Falcon, an ex-military special-ops paratrooper and a welcomed addition recruited by Rogers to help fight the good fight. Mackie fits comfortably among the cast of veteran actors and should play nicely with the other Avengers.Enhanced for combat and strength, The Winter Soldier's presence is terrifying when it comes to any action scene. Sebastian Stan does an amazing job holding his own against his targets and those who get in his way of his missions. My only gripe is that it is not explained how he obtains the immense power and skills he beholds. The connection between Rogers and The Winter Soldier is dealt with true care and excels the story of Captain America from the first film brilliantly. (Be sure to stay after the credits for a nice button leading into Captain America 3.)The Winter Soldier is not just a fantastic sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, it should also be recognized as one of the best sequels ever made. In fact, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the duo behind Thor: The Dark World, the Narnia Trilogy, and The First Avenger, have done such a great job shaping Captain America's story that this movie could almost stand on its own. There are many exciting twists and turns in this well-constructed, political action-thriller, but nothing comes as more of a shock than how important the story is at defining the direction of the MCU. What takes place in The Winter Soldier, along with an awesome mid-credits sequence tie-in, will inherently influence Avengers: Age of Ultron as well as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. â which should make the TV series a lot more interesting and reward fans who have stuck by its side.Tonally, The Winter Soldier is the darkest story we've come to encounter, raising many deep-seated questions about government and soldiers of war while also taking Rogers on an emotional journey. It also has the best action choreography among all of the MCU movies thus far. Whedon's NYC battle in The Avengers is beautifully shot and written, but cannot compare to the hard-hitting set pieces found in The Winter Soldier, each building up to the bigger whole. The Russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as Arrested Development and Community, and it's extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing. They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. Henry Jackman (Captain Phillips; Wreck-It Ralph; X-Men: First Class) also composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time.The biggest fault found in The Winter Soldier is that it does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies. Why can't Captain America call on Tony Stark to help him out or even Hawkeye who is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. himself. This is a recurring problem we have seen throughout Phase 2 of the MCU in Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Marvel Studios needs to acknowledge this hiccup if they want us to continue to believe all of these characters live in the same universe together. You cannot exclude these characters once you have opened Pandora's Box.Marvel Studios has hit this one out of the ball park with yet another gripping adaptation for fans to enjoy for years to come. By and large, Captain America: The Winter Soldier succeeds on all fronts. It is the perfect set up for future films and at the same time it increases the value of its predecessors. There is little to argue against its merits and should be regarded as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fun spy-action and a MCU standout,"It was interesting returning to this movie as it feels very out of place for a Marvel movie, in both good and bad ways. ItÂ´s more of a spy movie than mindless action, but IÂ´m having a hard time taking the serious tone serious in a franchise that produces mainly brainless action. The action is well made but I never really engaged with the serious parts. ItÂ´s an entertaining movie no doubt and definitely a standout for Marvel.Steve Rogers aka captain America is having a hard time reforming to the way of the S. H. I. E. L. D organization. New problems find Steve in form of old enemies and a new one, the Winter Soldier.So, where my primary problem lies with this movie is that I don't feel engaged in the more serious tone the movie was going for. ItÂ´s interesting to see a Marvel movie trying to go a bit deeper with its characters and their feelings and places in the world, but I find it mostly uninteresting. While I like the character chemistry and the highlighting of lesser used characters, IÂ´m having a hard time really believing it and taking it seriously. Maybe itÂ´s because itÂ´s a Marvel movie, this movie sticks so much out in a franchise with mostly brainless action and fun comments and it feels so weird to see these character become a bit real, maybe too real. I also found the dialogue just fine, in a movie where it should have wowed me more. So, I had a hard time engaging with the idea of the movie, but that doesn't make it less entertaining and has a great genre change from your typical Marvel movie.The action is so well done and framed in this movie. ItÂ´s not always shot the best, but mostly you really feel every hit and gets to see all the cool moves here. The fighting choreography is so great, tense and works together with great cutting to really make punches feel superhuman. This combined with great sound design and enhanced by the score creates this really brutal felling action movie.I had forgotten how good the score was. While it isn't always memorable, it creates these great small sound bites for character actions and melts together with the score to really elevate actions. I also really loved the theme of the winter soldier that is both haunting and iconic. Henry Jackman really hit it home with this one.Speaking of characters, I found the character interactions so good and natural in this movie. It still stands I find it a bit too much, but the character chemistry is really good. ItÂ´s nice to see these character talking together like they are real humans and hearing their problems. Black Widow and Captain America really gets to bond about each other's weird past and Furry getÂ´s to really shine in this movie. The movie also introduces the Falcon and Winter Soldier which both add a lot to the movie. The Winter Soldier is such a great character. He is such a menace and feel like such a powerhouse of a villain. My favorite performance in this was Chris Evans as Steve Rogers. He really made a likeable and lovable Captain America and really sold his inner conflicts. I also really loved both Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Furry and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, who brought a lot of fun to their characters.There is a lot to like about this movie, and on another day, I might rate it a little higher. ItÂ´s great action, spy drama and character interactions all throughout. Sadly, the movie felt too grand for itself to me, and I had a hard time really latching on to the spy drama aspect. No doubt an entertaining and well-made action movie, but making it more interesting would have really sold it to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Captain America 2, (No Spoiler) review","has an all-star cast of Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansen and Robert Redford, just to name a few, all of whom gave stunning performances. The story itself is a bit more complex than most comic book movies, as for much of it, there are three loosely related plots unfolding simultaneously, not even considering any subplots or back-stories. There are repeated combat/action sequences, involving both astounding physical and firearms feats, which are engaging as well as memorable. There are a few plot twists, some more telegraphed than others, but all acceptable; except for one incident that was taken from 'The Avengers' and 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' series, which felt cheap and used. The biggest issue that I had was that very few conflicts were actually solved, while a plentiful bounty were presented. If you're after closure, Captain America ""2"" is not for you. On the other hand, if you were a fan of 'Lost's' seemingly endless array of revealed, yet abandoned situations, you might feel right at home here. A point most aptly stated by the not one, but two mid/post-credit teasers. However, two show-stopping cameos are more than satisfying (for those associated with a certain school for Human Beings in Colorado, especially).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent sequel that outdoes the first film,"That is not to knock the first Captain America film because I enjoyed that too, just that Captain America: The Winter Soldier personally came off as superior. Some of the second half does try to cram in too much giving off an at times bloated and convoluted quality, other than that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was excellent. It is a great-looking film with stylish cinematography and editing that give off a gritty and audacious look, and the special effects and the stunts are of the quality that you can't take your eyes off them. The music is not quite as good as it was in the first but it has enough of the rousing excitement and haunting intensity to make it a good score that matches what is going on on screen. The action sequences are spectacularly choreographed and of edge-of-your-seat calibre whether it is a highway car chase or a sky battle with some of the destruction authentically harrowing, and the screenplay is one that is smart and snappy with heart aplenty. The story is mostly compelling and very cleverly constructed, it mixes action, comic-book adventure and political thriller and does it in a way that is well-balanced, that is alive with nimble nuances and in a way that the film gives off a sense that it knows what it's trying to be. It's suspenseful and exciting with its fair share of themes that gives the film emotion and depth. The characters are engaging and interesting, with their personalities deeper and more expansive, and there is a much more believable villain this time around(the big reveal was actually quite surprising). A great thing considering that the cast of cast is quite large if not quite to the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink extent; the interplay between the characters works a treat also. Anthony and Joe Russo direct astutely and the acting is fine, with Chris Evans even more confident than he was in the first, Scarlett Johansson at her fearless and Anthony Mackie fitting comfortably in his role. Samuel L. Jackson is as dependable as ever, Robert Redford in a bold move gives seasoned support and is not stiff at all and Sebastian Stan is similarly authoritative. All in all, while there are a couple of issues with the second half Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent sequel and manages to outdo the enjoyable first film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film","This film is simply exceptional in every way. The edge it has is delivering the best, grittiest action the genre has ever scene and characters that are as complex as the are fun. Why do I say that? Well...What I love about the character is that Steve Rogers has ""I'm-a-man-out- of-time issues"" but he's comfortable with the chaos that it brings. In acclimating himself to this century he is at his best. Yes, most people would be overwhelmed but because of who he is and where he's from, he's able to cope and adapt. The serum that gives him his physical edge also gives him a mental boost. It's his emotions that are raw and unaided. Time has passed since Avengers so we don't get to see his day to day amazement and adjustment. I'm glad they skipped that stuff. What we do see is the man who once represented America and has become alien to America and it's slanted values. The passage of time. Add those struggles to a full blown conspiracy film and what results might just be the best film released all year long.Steve Rogers is basically a John Wayne American. The world shifts to him and it's his job to tell everybody ""Here's they way things should be done."" We saw that in Avengers and even the first film after he gathered his Howling Commandos. Now, the powers that be are a lot more flexible in terms of loyalties and how they're going to get certain jobs done. How he handles this century's gray morality is at the heart of the film.Like most men from the 1940's, Steve keeps things to himself and keeps his emotions bottled up. (EX: the first film when he mentions his mother dying of TB and he was even embarrassed when Peggy found him mourning alone for Bucky) So, bringing The Black Widow in to this film gives him someone who is going to draw out his story, because he's never going to offer it up of his own accord. Natasha learns from him. Fury learns from him. Sam Wilson learns from him. Yet, they all give him something in return. Every character used is utilized perfectly and smartly. Falcon for example, is not in awe of the legend of Captain America. This is exactly what Steve wants in a friend and in a fellow soldier, to not have to be Captain America. Everyone fits perfectly in to the plot and allows access to different beats, tones and emotional depth. Yes, conspiracy thrillers need depth and this one has it.Captain America is probably the only superhero left in this world of the reboot who is singularly heroic. He doesn't have this dark existential quandary like other reinventions. Plugging that resolute goodness into a morally complex story means he doesn't question what he believes, but he questions whether anybody else does anymore. He doesn't question his foundation but he questions where he has ended up and what his role must now be. The conspiracy element and structure of this story helps in that Captain America is not up on a pedestal being self righteous, he's in a corner and that makes you want to root for the guy. He believes in what he's doing and the viewer is along for a great ride sharing that belief.Marvel movies usually establish character early. This one starts out fast but it's got a lot of character in it. The first act packs a punch but does it laying the groundwork for a remarkable third act. They take time showing the issues and you immediately empathize with Steve. Giving us good character depth means the action delivers more punch. And the action here is beyond great. This movie absolutely punches you in the face in the best way possible. The action has advanced a lot from the first film. How he now operates in the world and kicks butt is all very impressive.So, this is probably Marvel's grittiest movie and it's also their best sequel to date. There's a dash of humor but there's mostly a wonderful thriller, conspiracy and adventure that delivers a great great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The WS is one Badass Villain!,"What a ride! The Winter Soldier sits at the pinnacle of the MCU's best and most entertaining, 10 times better than its predecessor.

Pure Awesomeness,"Went into the movie not expecting much as I felt that the first Captain America was one of the weaker movies in Phase one of the Avengers. However, this movie was one of the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.First off, the action and fight scenes in the movie are just awesome and there is plenty of action to keep you entertained throughout the entire movie. There is also enough humour to balance all this. The characters all had their own amazing moments and the acting is decent as well. You get to see more of Nick Fury, and he was awesome in this. Black Widow is used much more in this movie and as well as being badass, she brings out more of the Captain's story. Sam Wilson (the Falcon) is great and is involved in some great action scenes. The villains in this movie were awesome as well.Quite enjoyed the story as well. There were a few twists; some unexpected, some expected. And the reveal of the unexpected twists in the final third were epic. The story is not just about Captain America and the Winter Soldier, there are darker forces at play and causes the Captain to ask dangerous questions.This movie is very entertaining, the story is decent, the ending is awesome and satisfying and I would recommend watching this. Makes for a decent political thriller as well. This will easily be one of my favourite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Captain to Die for!,"Captain America's second strike most of all impresses with hand-to-hand martial art fights, almost too fast for the 3D Camera to capture, and well-timed, old school handmade action scenes such as car chases, machine gun shootings on open streets, and spectacular explosions, using less computer generated special effects than other comic adaptations and refreshingly getting along without a Tesseract or similar plot devices to bring the story forward because this time we are presented with a kind of happy-go-lightly mixture of a classical espionage thriller a la ""Bourne Supremacy"", a touch of ""Die Hard""-one-against-them-all scenario, a little bit of ""Terminator""-menace, and of course the usual ""Avengers"" references like bombastic airship battles that all in all make ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" a quite entertaining and light movie experience.The characters are very likable especially the supporting cast with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Samual L. Jackson as Nick Fury who all together upstage the main hero Chris Evans as the ""Cap."" who begins to thaw only towards the end from his long winter sleep by showing some hidden emotions that seemed to had been frozen inside of him which gave that melancholic touch to his character making him sometimes appear rather pale although it at least prevents him from being a silly chatterbox like some other heroes. In contrast to that lies Black Widow's mysterious aura and sex appeal; an ice-cold femme fatal who is good at fighting and who also has a very human, if not fragile side which makes her approachable and even more charming; she would have deserved an own movie franchise because it's about time for female hero's to be in the front line.Robert Redford as a kind of dubious head of S.H.I.E.L.D is unfortunately visibly unchallenged by his role, his motivations are rather caricatural.A definite plus is the main villain, the titular Winter Soldier who is physically equal to ""The Cap."". He reminded me of the evil cyborg in ""Terminator 2"" with his robotic arm and his threatening charisma. They both do not talk very much and whenever the Winter Soldier appears, he seems to trigger his own gravitational field as the camera seems to revolve around him like a satellite giving his character this sense of heaviness which even more underlines his dangerousness and yet there is a secret human core that makes him more ambiguous than which is the case with most of the usual cyborgs. Plotwisely ""CA: TWS"" surprises not with the rather predictive twists but with a rather naive, but nevertheless charming comment on the current issues with data abuse by intelligence agencies and the question of how far a society is willing to give up their freedom for the sake of security in the face of a potential terrorist attack, and thus it is probably the most socially critical release of Marvel so far.It may lack of the necessary psychological as well as artistic depth and edginess of a ""Dark Knight"" that would have left a deeper reverberation with the viewer, it is also not as unique in terms of style as the first part, however, it is good enough to be recommendable, especially to Marvel fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant film!,"Now ""The winter soldier"" is everything a Captain America movie should be. While it maintains some of the humour that now has become the trademark of Marvel films, TWS is way more serious than all of them combined. And this is truly where the film feels so brave and yes different than any other superhero flicks that we have seen.Which brings me to the most important point, the plot. While of course it is not going to be the most original or complicated film of the century, there is the basic screen writing elements that so much lack from modern day blockbusters. You have the (likable) characters and a mystery they need to solve along with a racing clock. It reminded me the 70's political paranoia thrillers (3 days of the Condor - another Redford link, The parallax view, Z) and it is a welcome tone that makes the WS to differentiate itself from the rest. There are strong scenes regarding political fear, control, and information manipulation but it never feels bloated or overbearing. the purpose is to entertain even if it manages to squeeze through a bit of political views with Rogers replacing the viewer's voice on screen. At one point there is a talk about who is who which results in every man for himself mayhem in one of the most interesting sequences that you may see this year. We do not get this stuff these days!Besides the charged plot, the introduction of new characters and the mega mayhem in the streets of Washingthon DC, the Russos have found time (and they should bloody do since TWS is 2 and a half hours long!) to inject some sentiments in the proceedings - a visit to Peggy, a confrontation with Fury regarding SHIELDs actions, Bucky's memory recall, Natasha's kissing talk. They could have easily skip these ""crap"" but instead the extra running time feels adjusted and coherent with a bit of more characterization which results to bring us closer to the on screen counterparts.However, the action is what took me by surprise. The bar has been set higher now. It is truly unbelievable to think that these two directors (of the ""Community"" fame) came with such inventive ways of using Cap's shield. Finally, the shield gets to be seen in all of its glory. In addition, all the fist fights (and they are many) are excellent examples and putting the glasses to the school of frantic edit (which I truly despise) with varied and rapid choreography. A terrific elevator fight sequence probably stands out as truly memorable whereas the encounters with the Winter Soldier never feel repetitive. The Russo brothers keep changing the game from stealth and cloak missions, to car chases, to gun fires, to dog fights, to fist fights. There is something for everyone here and it is arguably among the finest I have seen. Impressive considering their credits. Real stunt work (backflips, wrestle moves, somersaults, etc), real fights and it is a pleasing sight to go away from superhero duels of the Avengers, Thor and Iron man. These characters rely on instincts and bullets. No more and no less and most of them do have some brutal moments for a PG-13 film (and blood too).The actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles. While Evans came out as a bit arrogant in the ""Avengers"" and the least interesting character, here he truly shines. First time ever, I actually bought what he was bringing on the table. This is a soldier who believed in protecting the people and their freedom. Here though, in the modern era of espionage with multiple intrigues and political events, he finds himself unable to identify which side he is on and for what. At one point he even considers himself Fury's caretaker of terrorist ""problems"". The other side of the coin is Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. It is nice to see Jackson expanding his role from 1 minute cameo in ""Iron Man"" to a fully supporting actor here. But the real standout is Robert Redford. Kevin Feige (the producer) probably knows how to do casting because so far there has not been a single acting mistake. Bringing heavy-acting-weight Redford to a superhero film is actually a bold move and while most movies do not focus on the talented cast, here the Russo brothers give Redford plenty of close ups and necessary gravitational dialogue that kept surprised me for a ""summer"" and ""mindless"" blockbuster. Antony Mackie plays Falcon believably enough and it is very good to see a great supporting turn instead of being the comedic sidekick. The winter soldier now himself is as you would have expected? probably the best villain outside Loki(!) in the marvel films. A truly unstoppable and cool killing machine that shows no remorse or regret considering his complete disregard (and destructive) actions throughout the film. Shaw manages to bring a bit of menace to a generally light hearted series of fantasy films as he has to act more with his eyes rather than sharing any scenes of actual dialogue.Is it perfect? Of course not but it does not feel that it is drugging forever or raising any boring flags. There is plenty of plot, intelligence and sweet characters moments to keep anyone satisfying. This is blockbuster at its finest, a superhero film with heart, immersive action and subtle touches of humour. Totally recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than the 1st!,"Witty and charming humor, incredible suspense, and action that'll put you on the edge of your seat. Captain America: The Winter Soldier surpassed my expectations and was definitely better than the first. This movie probably had some of the best fighting sequences and action scenes in any Marvel movie yet. That alone is impressive. It was kind of like Star Wars meets Marvel in some scenes. Unfortunately, that means the special effects were on par with Star Wars circa the 1980s, but they were well done when they needed to be, along with the cinematography. I guess that's the case for all big budget action movies. The overall movie had a heroic plot line and the characters were all incredibly written and decently acted. Although, I could tell where the writers tried to avoid holes in the plot. The big reveals were pulled off perfectly and the introduction of Falcon was great. I think, he should get his own movie. Come on Marvel...please! Anyway, I hope everyone likes it as much as I did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Shoot the camera man!,"My wife and I really enjoyed the first Captain America and looked forward to this after reading some reviews. After watching the movie I have to ask: ""What movie did you people see?"" The camera work must have been done by a three-year-old. People were moving at warp speed during fight scenes, but you could only see an extreme close-up of about one square foot at a time. Shouldn't you see the whole picture instead of checking the actors for nose and ear hair? And what happened to the human factor? It's like they put together a ten minute script and then called 'Action!'. The fight scenes were too many and too exaggerated -- plus there are only about a dozen good people in the entire show. It's like Washington DC...everybody's a bad guy wanting to rule the world. I still enjoyed most of Steve and Natasha's exchanges and there was at least two emotional moments in the movie that were good...but they didn't save the story for us.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller.","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the third film in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (after last year's Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World). Compared with the mighty giant green monster, the hammer wielding Norse thunder god or the 'genius, philanthropist, billionaire, playboy' armor man, the Captain was never quite as appealing as the rest of the 'Unusuals'. Steve Rogers is portrayed as an old-fashioned, straightforward, honest, courageous, sincere, patriotic superhero. This makes him a less-interesting, boring character. Moreover, as Tony Stark said it, ""Everything special about you came out of a bottle!""Most film-goers would know that Marvel films are famous for its bright, fun and not-so-serious approach to its storytelling, together with some catchy, witty dialogues. This film is a game changer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This time around, Marvel decided to take a different approach on things: To make a Captain America sequel with a more serious, darker plot development and more face-to-face close-range hand combat fights. What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller.Two years after the events that happened in New York city, the Captain still struggles with adjusting himself to the modern world, with no apparent social life or girl friend, which is why Natasha/Black Widow tries to introduce or recommend him some cute girls in S.H.I.E.L.D. for him to date with. He is shocked when he learns that the very governmental organisation he is working for is not what it seems to be, as the Cap said in the trailer, ""This isn't freedom. This is fear"". Soon, he finds himself entangled in a conspiracy that puts millions of innocent lives at risk.The film comes with excellent, fast-paced action choreography. Although the cinematography is a bit dodgy due to the shaky-cam techniques used for depicting the chaotic moments, the fight scenes between the Winter Soldier and the Captain is fantastic and serves as one of the film's highlights. The audience finally gets to see how the Captain's shield is utilised effectively in both offensive and defensive combat situations. It also good to see again how Natasha kicks ass in the film.All actors delivered a pretty decent performance in the film. Once again, Chris Evans and Scarlett Johannson both proved that they fit their roles well, adding more depth to the characters they portray in the film. Sam Wilson/Falcon is a welcome addition to the Marvel franchise and hopefully he will appear again in the Avengers sequel. Unfortunately, despite the film's title, the winter soldier is not a complex villain and doesn't appear much in the film. It's such a shame to just show him as a formidable physical fighter who's capable of challenging the Captain.The film is well-scripted, filled with suspense while highlighting some important socio-political issues such as government surveillance and control in its storytelling. Although the twists in the film is predictable and fairly easy to guess, the sequel is a marked improvement compared to its predecessor, Captain America: The First Avenger. The story unfolds gradually and comes with huge, surprising developments by the end of the film. Marvel Cinematic Universe is not going to be the same again. What's going to happen next? How the story is going to progress in Avengers: Age of Ultron, after what had happened in this film? Interesting.Rating: 8.5/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-captain-america- winter.htmlBe warned. This is not the typical fun, 'not-so-serious', entertaining Marvel film that you used to watch in the past. You might like it or find it a bore. In order to recognize some of the characters in the film, you need to remember some of Marvel's Phase One films. Most importantly, you need to watch Captain America: The First Avenger before watching this to understand the plot.Note: Guess you don't need me to remind you to stay for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes. It foreshadows what's going to happen next by introducing a lesser-known supervillain and two new characters, 'Miracles' (another name for 'mutants' because of screen rights issues) which going to be in the Avengers sequel, Age of Ultron. It further confirms that one of weapons depicted in The Avengers is indeed one of the six infinity stones.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Marvel movie made so far,"I have to start this review by saying that I'm a huge MCU fan. I rewatched all of them maybe once per year. Some of them are great and some of them are decent. But this is The Shiet. I rewatched it a lot of time and the movie still surprises me. The plot is smart,cursive and it's not getting boring despite the movie still being relatively long. Especially when the action starts I find myself on the edge on my seat wondering what will happen. Better than endgame and infinity war? Probably not but it's pretty damn close. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to get more into the marvel universe or just looking for a fun and intense action movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superb. This could be the best sequel the genre has seen.,"This film finds Captain America still adjusting to the modern day, while working under the increasingly morally ambiguous government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The set up is masterfully done. This is the third time we've seen the character and it's by far the most complex. The Avengers film touched bit with his feelings of what it was like to be in the modern era, but besides the deleted scenes, they had no time to dive in to the subject matter in that movie. That's not the case here. This is a wonderful character study to go along with a purely thrilling plot. This was exactly the perfect vehicle to deliver the film the character deserves at this time. What makes Steve/cap interesting isn't his abilities but the man himself. The ""man out of time"" to be exact. He must come to terms with a past that is long gone and a longing for a better more decent era. Dealing with the shades of grey of the modern era and being part of an organization like S.H.I.E.L.D. is taking its toll on a member of ""the greatest generation."" As he's finding his way, his past comes back and explodes all throughout his new life.Enter The Winter Soldier, who is an amoral assassin and an agent of shady government rogues. Saying any more about what is an ultimately cool character would be a spoiler. Fans of the books know who he is and what he's about but movie fans need to find their own way.I really enjoyed the origin and First Avenger but this movie is darker than the original film. It has a whole new flavor and that;s exactly what was needed. The 1940's romance and even the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" tone fit the first film quite nicely but would have been out of place in this story. Just like Cap, adaptation is a key. Steve is still an unquestioning patriot but he shifts from being an unquestioning soldier. This is where his old-fashioned values pay off. Questioning what is wrong and questioning what is morally cloudy is a test of true character. That is exactly why the character of Steve Rogers is so interesting. He's so much more than a super soldier boy scout. There's depth, angst and pathos to the max. He is out-of-place and he is old- fashioned but proud of that in a way. He also is an enhanced thinker so it's not like modern era gadgets confound him. It's all played just right.The story itself is a good old fashion action thriller with a ton of intrigue. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this clever. Everything about this movie is a joy to watch. Tha cast is perfect and everyone is used exceptionally well. This could be the best sequel the genre has seen. It's Marvel's best sequel for sure.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good but not Great,"I can't understand the lack of imagination in so many comic book movies. While this movie is put together well, and the acting is great, it lacks the vision and humanness that compelled the actual comic books to be so enjoyable. Kids and teens read comic books because they speak universal, mythological truths' in the language of unconscious energies. This is also known as religion. Deep down everyone understands powerlessness, inferiority and immortality within the framework of one's personal history, time period and culture. Given we grow up in families, these issues are all the more important to kids and teens, especially issues of power and growing pains inherent in the developmental stages. Captain America personifies the sensitive and vulnerable person who is transformed into a superhero with superhuman abilities in the blink of an eye. Add patriotism and unquestionable evil (Hitler and Nazism) and the formula for a great character is born. He represents the fears and potentials we all hope for but cannot achieve due to our animal, mortal nature. One reason why Star Wars was so successful was because it understood that myths are alive and well in the modern age (though obscured by Rationalism and Science) and it transferred this psychological need onto celluloid. Movies are no different than superstitions; we just don't believe them as such. But they are still private dreams in the public domain, and because of this it feels dishonest and mindlessly inauthentic to gloss this value over with endless CGI action, lack of depth, and most of all characters who are so one dimensional and simplistic they could not have come from anywhere but a derivative formula. A convenient villain with a metal arm forged in the same time crucible as Steve Rogers who looks like one of the werewolves (in human form) from Twilight and is so totally devoid of imagination the viewer is easily distracted by the most mundane of distractions. How about this for a villain: Deep in the depths of lunatic asylum, festering and wasting away in a cell of powerful medications and medical experiments, the villain one day begins to hoard his meds and slowly remember who he is and where he is fromâa Nazi experiment that used the same technology as that which was used on Rogers. And instead of a lame metal arm, when he is consumed with hatred and revenge his superpowers become more powerful, more diabolical and more fascinating whatever they may be. I'm not saying I know the political and financial ins and outs of making a great movie. But come on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel makes a bold move!,"Marvel showed pretty clearly in Iron Man 3 that they are not afraid to take risk, bend comic stories and venture into unknown territories. I was pleasantly surprised by Captain America : The Winter Soldier because Marvel is able to do surprise audience like never before. This movie has mostly everything a fan could ask for. A political drama, conspiracy theories, Chris Evans portrayal of a ""out of his time"" superhero who is trying to blend in with the world and thinks that ""Internet is helpful"", typical Marvel's laugh out loud moments and above all some mesmerizing action sequences. Threat in this movie is not as big as the one in Thor :The Dark World since only our tiny planet is at stake rather than entire 9 realms with imaginative difficult to pronounce names, but thanks to some very smart blend of direction, acting and close to perfect background scores, threat seems to be much bigger and more importantly, real this time. You actually care for the fate of entire planet and characters. You do come face to face with the full potential of SHIELD and its structure, its influence on world politics and when the actual villain is revealed, you just cannot hide your excitement. SHIELD acts as a central character in the movie and shows itself to be far bigger and complex than what we suspected after watching all the Marvel offerings. There is Nick Fury as usual hiding secrets, keeping secrets and digging secrets but watching him vulnerable in this movie is much better than watching him acting all almighty in Avengers. Chris Evans shine in this role and I can imagine he won't be at the bottom of favorite Avengers list after this movie. His portrayal of Captain America is near perfect. Scarlett Johansson is a surprise package in the film portraying Black Widow character. She gets ample screen time presence this time, even in scenes where she is not kicking someone. It is actually the first time we learn something about Black Widow, duplicity in her character just adds tension to the already built suspense in the movie. Sebastian Stan is good in his portrayal of winter soldier. He is a perfect nemesis to Captain America in the movie. I bet you haven't seen such creative combat scenes between these two ever before. Action here is not as loud as Thor movies, it is more real, every bullet which find its target hurts, every punch delivered matters, it is so enjoyable to watch just because it is so real. I wish I could write about some more characters but that will be giving away some key points. Please be assured there are some great character comebacks, some you expected, some you didn't. I was a little let down by the climax of the film by its simplicity after the real motive of the real villain is revealed, but of course you have to remember its a Marvel film, there doesn't exist any situation alien/political/social which can't be solved by few explosions and kicks. Overall it's a highly entertaining film from Marvel, I will put it behind only Avengers and first Iron Man, this movie deserves your weekend. And of course it goes without saying, don't dare to leave your seats until last credits have rolled out, you have probably all heard the rumors about Joss Whedon directing the end credit scene. Yes it is awesome and offers an insight into the next Avengers movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel Do The Kind Of Expected,"Marvel Studios continue their extravagant adventure in their 'Avengers Universe' with the second Captain America film, the third to feature the titular hero and the 9th to be set in this particular Marvel universe (until a future film merges all of them together). The material put forward by Marvel in the follow up of the Avengers film have been unfortunately a little stale, with Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World both coming off slightly dull in comparison to their previous amalgamation. Captain America has however struck a strong chord with some British cinema viewers as well as reviewers, others dispute the claims that this is 'the best Marvel film so far'.The film is unchallenging in any degree. The formula of action set- pieces, cool quips and a quick dip in the pool of emotion rarely fails Marvel and is frequented in their films but after the extravagance of the Avengers the mark still has not quite been hit. The Winter Solider is indisputably the better of the post-Avengers films but still comes off fairly dull when mounted with the high expectations one has over Marvel films, an expectation slowly being shown the light of reality. The lack of many high-scope set pieces does allow some breathing room for the cast but the consistent running and gunning does water down any emotional bond toward the cast. The running and gunning however is done exceptionally well, Capt. himself ten times more active than in his previous run in and moves away from the star spangled banner into a tighter, more cutting edge stealth beating up machine. The large set pieces are great to watch when they do arrive, the slightly larger ones could benefit with a bit more 'realism' instead of looking like a port from a video game.Though criticism can be subjective, none can ignore the matter of The Winter Soldier himself. Everyone knows who he really is, it's no disguise. But in the film he's barely a lead role, he's the equivalent of Oddjob to Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce (who does provide a good antithesis). The Winter Soldier however should have been the forefront of the film, instead what was displayed was a culturally relevant plot- line with a cool villain.The plot-lines focus on pre-emptive justice and worldwide surveillance, peace through fear, is something of relevance in our era, especially during these post-Snowden months. The resulting story comes off with a moderate sigh, the aim too ridiculously imbalanced and no daringness in the continuity. And as aforementioned, where was The Winter Soldier.A redeeming factor of the sub-titular character is however his music, the scream that plays when he enters a scene or commits an act really helps make the character seem darker. The end result ended up almost unnecessary for his involvement.That being said it's a popcorn flick and it's entertaining whilst providing a dip into the Marvel universe again before Guardians of the Galaxy. If The Winter Soldier is anything to go on it will be explosions and quips. There's nothing wrong with this, James Bond did it for 40 years. It's keeping it fresh though and if Marvel want to continue their legacy they need to quicken their pace before the hype before the next sequel is equivalent to the visit from estranged family members you'd rather ignore.Credit is due for being an entertaining film for the most part, as well as having a relevant plot-line. The Marvel universe needs an ounce of freshness however, perhaps a deviation from the ever repeating formula in favour of a more striking, surprising and emotionally engaging story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's smart, intense, well acted and superbly done. AMAZING FILM!","I'd have to rate Captain America The Winter Soldier as one of the best comic book movies ever made. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get. Superman has generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film even though it has some campy flaws. Spider- Man has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character. Iron Man has generally held the most grounded and well liked superhero film. The Avengers has generally held the title as most highly rated and best film the genre has seen. Well, Captain America TWS can compete with them all in every category. It is IMO near perfect on every level.

The first genuinely good MCU sequel,"It's funny how badly Secret Invasion botched its attempt at a superhero themed spy thriller when nine years before, Marvel pulled it off with Captain America The Winter Soldier, which also stands as the first good MCU sequel after the previous ones ranged from okay to oh no. The first Captain America film was a lot of fun, but it was also kind of goofy which, given when it's set, may have been the point. This film goes for a much more serious tone and gives us a plot that wouldn't feel out of place in a James Bond or Jack Ryan film. And I mean that in the best possible way, as the film keeps you on your toes and keeps you guessing through twists, turns, and plenty of double crosses along the way. Offsetting this stuff are some great scenes of Cap getting used to modern times while thinking back on the life he left behind, which leads to some surprisingly emotional scenes.The cast, old and new, is top notch. Chris Evans, Scarlett Johanson and Samuel L. Jackson are as great as ever. Falcon is a fun new hero with a solid introduction bolstered by Anthony Mackie's entertaining performance. And we get two great villains. The Winter Soldier more than makes up for limited screentime by being intimidating, brutal and ruthless, able to be far more than a match for Cap, and for the shocking (at least for those who haven't read the comics) reveal of who he is. And the person who controls him is held up by the legendary actor who plays them.The action is some of the best the MCU has ever given us. Because it's basically a spy thriller, it's far more grounded in reality, so when a character gets hurt, it feels like they genuinely get hurt. There's a ton of variety to the action: fist fights, gun fights, car chases, etc. And they are well choreographed and full of cool stunts. And, while there is a fair amount of frequent cuts, unlike something like The Bourne Ultimatum, the camera starts mostly still, so it's easy to see the fights and feel the blows. And, while the climax does go back to the usual superhero ""big world wide threat that the heroes must stop"" deal, it still has plenty of great stunts and choreography to help it stand up against the rest.Overall, The Winter Soldier is a ton of fun. I didn't know if I'd necessarily call it one of the best Marvel movies, but I can definitely count it among the best Marvel sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Battles Shadows of the Past,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired March 13, 2014. It has a runtime of 2 hour 16 minutes. Captain America: The Winter Soldier was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and created by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The movie was loosely based on the comic books by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. The movie was also based on The Winter Soldier by Steve Epting, Ed Brubaker and Michael Lark.Summary: Steve Rogers grapples with his new role in modern society. As a member of S. H. I. E. L. D., he strives to adapt to contemporary life while remaining true to his values. However, the emergence of a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier threatens not only his mission but also the very foundation of S. H. I. E. L. D.Review: -I appreciate that the film resumes two years after Captain America teamed up with Thor, Hulk, and the others. The action sequences were thrilling, with the chase scenes being particularly exhilarating and keeping me on the edge of my seat. The narrative is filled with unexpected twists that maintain viewer engagement throughout. Despite its serious themes, the film skilfully incorporates humour, providing a sense of levity without diminishing the weight of its subject matter. I found it compelling how the movie delves into the tension between national security and personal freedom, raising pertinent questions about government surveillance that resonate with current societal issues. The film effectively raises significant ethical dilemmas surrounding loyalty, sacrifice, and the repercussions of one's actions within a broader system. These complex issues resonate with viewers who value narratives that challenge simplistic notions of good versus evil, fostering meaningful discussions about morality in real-world contexts. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue. I was happy that it told us what was being said when it was in another language.I was impressed by how the film's cinematography expertly utilized a diverse range of shot types to enrich its narrative. Wide shots effectively set the scene and context, showcasing the urban landscapes of Washington D. C. and other locations, which gives viewers a strong sense of scale and atmosphere. Medium shots capture character dialogue while still providing background context, allowing audiences to clearly see facial expressions without losing sight of their surroundings. Close-ups play a crucial role in conveying emotions and emphasizing significant details. Over-the-Shoulder shots are frequently employed during conversations, fostering a sense of intimacy between characters and enabling viewers to engage with both speakers simultaneously. High-angle shots depict subjects as smaller and more vulnerable, particularly during intense action scenes to highlight danger. Low-angle shots empower characters by making them appear larger than life. Tracking shots enhance the sense of movement and urgency in dynamic environments, especially in thrilling car chases or hand-to-hand combat. Aerial shots offer a broader view of large-scale events and action sequences. Cutaway Shots enhance context and reactions without disrupting action or dialogue, used sparingly to build tension and emphasize character responses during key moments. Point-of-View (POV) Shots immerse viewers by allowing them to see through a character's eyes, aligning audience perspective with the character, especially effective in high-stakes action scenes. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes.The fight scenes in the movie were masterfully crafted, seamlessly integrating practical effects with CGI to enhance the storytelling rather than detract from it. I admired how the visual effects supported the narrative without overshadowing it. The film's strength lay in its ability to balance character development effectively. Unlike many superhero films that prioritize CGI at the cost of plot and character depth, this one successfully maintained emotional stakes alongside its stunning visuals. Advanced motion capture techniques were utilized to authentically bring characters like the Winter Soldier to life. This method facilitated nuanced performances that were enriched by digital effects while preserving the essence of human emotion.-I enjoyed reconnecting with the characters, especially seeing a familiar face again. The film showcased strong character development, particularly for Steve and Natasha. Steve's internal conflict regarding his place in a morally ambiguous modern world highlights a thoughtful hero wrestling with his principles. Meanwhile, Natasha's backstory and growth throughout the film add depth to her character, making her more relatable and multifaceted. This complexity enables viewers to form a personal connection with the characters. I appreciated that Natasha was depicted as an equal partner to Captain America, demonstrating her skills and intelligence without resorting to the stereotypical roles often found in action films.-The illustrations during the end credits were impressive, and I was delighted to discover additional scenes after the credits-two in total, cleverly interspersed among the credits.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 6.9 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"It's so much better than the first one. In the first half, hand-held photography and aerial photography, close combat became the main component of action drama.

Surprise, the movie still is a mega-moneymaker. That is mostly because Marvel retained an engaging cast (Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson), top- notch action sequences, and brought Captain America into today's world where moral ambiguities predominate the absolutist approach to good vs. evil.This film will be enjoyed by anyone who has enjoyed prior Marvel offerings but should probably only be seen if you are familiar with Captain America's back-story through the comics or the first movie, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cold as ice,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a fantastic sequel, one of the best sequels of all time and hands down the best Marvel sequel, it takes the MCU to a dark place that it's never gone before and is one of the most grounded and mature MCU films.Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan smash it and it has one of the MCU's scariest villains in the Winter soldier, every line of dialogue is great and it's also a really funny movie, the character of Falcon was introduced and had a hefty amount of screen time, but he never took away from the main narrative and let Bucky shine.This movie also has enthralling action sequences that are even better than the first films, the camera work is great and the music is thrilling.It also has some of the best character development and conflicts in the MCU and has some of the highest stakes in any Marvel movie, there were multiple times in this movie where I thought Captain America could die.The story is political but not that kind of political if you know what I mean, it completely grounds these characters and is an amazingly serious movie.It's a fantastic sequel, and I'm gonna give it an A.ð",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There's some great cap-shield-cap-bike stuff which feels like a great distillation of what the character is in the comics and the fights are great, but it descends with queasy familiarity into a big smashy bashy flabby final third that feels inevitable with these films (Guardians, in the same year, had the identical problem) and undermines their more unique aspects. Further to that some of the clunky politics haven't aged particularly well in the tumultuous decade that followed and the provisional title for the fourth cap film should give you clues as to what that might mean.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Yet another boring superhero movie of marvel,"I really do not understand why people are liking this movie. Yes it is better than the last CAPTAIN America movie, but it is as boring as THOR 2 or IRON MAN 3. Stupid Plot and unappealing action sequence followed by melodrama at the end.I give up. I don't think marvel movies are worth watching any more. The first half of the movie is a bit intriguing. But the second half of the movie is very boring. Even the end credits scene is boring. The worst thing about the movie is that i had no prior idea about the plot or even the new characters like ""the winter soldier"" but i could predict most of the things that were going to happen next. the storyline is really weak. As soon as any mystery resolves you feel Man! this is stupid. You feel disappointed on most of the scenes.

Solid Thriller,"I applaud the Russo brothers and the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely on a job well done in this action thriller The action is riveting as are the quite scenes between the characters. There are Good humorous punches in this script also. The returning cast are great and expanding their roles from other movies, I am trying to be vague here as not to ruin the movie. Also there are some great additions to the cast as well. Anthony Mackie does a soaring job as the Falcon (pun intended), he has a very comfortable fit to the cast and no way feel forces in. Robert Redford is a very compelling character and presence on screen. The action scenes were fantastic when I saw the resume of the Russos's movies I was a little worried, now I think they might have to worry about being type cast as action movie directors. There are a few changes from the comic book story line but they are not distracting. The Winter Solider is a movie that greatly expands and shakes the foundation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Stay for the two end credit sequences. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it. If it's action you want. Go see the Captain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another great film in the MCU,"I always thought Captain America was a corny ""golden age of comics"" superhero that had long passed his expiration date. I was shocked by how much I liked him in his first film. I was delighted to grow to like him even more in this one. They set up the character beautifully in the first movie, but he explodes as a hero here. It's hard to fault the character or this movie. Not just the MC, but the whole cast was well written and acted here. The action is well directed and tense. Battles feel much more real than most Marvel battles. There was much less obvious CGI than most films in the franchise, and it pays off. This is one of the best Marvel films to date. Lightning in a bottle. A highlight in the MCU.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Probably the best movie in the MCU, only competing with Infinity War","In terms of action, it is undoubtedly the best. All the fight scenes have such spectacular choreography; all the punches and shots actually seem to have an impact and aren't just for show. The elevator fight is the best fight in the MCU, without a doubt, and the fight between Steve and the Winter Soldier is another visual delight.In this movie, Fury is treated the best. In all the other movies, Fury is pretty much useless, only there to recruit them in the first one and occasionally give them something. In this one, they show us why he is Nick Fury, the head of S. H. I. E. L. D. That scene of him in the car against Hydra is incredible.The whole spy theme is so well done: the stealth, the action, everything is amazing. That scene of Zola revealing how Hydra was always there is magnificent. Bucky is the best villain in the MCU, only second to Thanos, of course.

New standard for the MCU,"A big step forward after the cheap-looking and uninteresting ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". The generic conspiracy thriller plot and setting are far from being original but are quite refreshing in the MCU franchise. It's probably the first Marvel movie with an actual plot. After tons of movies with superpowers and incredible creatures that look all the same, the ones that digress a little in style are the most rewarding to me. This movie manages to do that without being as divisive as ""Iron Man 3"" or ""Thor: Ragnarok"" probably thanks to the use of conventional characters like Cap and friends. The quality of the action sequences, which had been a big problem in the previous film, is remarkable here and the pacing is fairly good too (I wouldn't have minded if it were much shorter though). We also get some old fashioned shooting and car chases. I will never be a Cap fan but Black Widow definitely helped me enjoy this movie more, and the two characters' chemistry kind of worked. On the other side, Falcon did not blend in as well, unfortunately. Was he necessary?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Preposterous, Self Indulgent and a little Boring",There aren't many films where I think I may actually walk out but after the 20 minutes but I seriously thought about it. It did get a bit better thereafter though. Character development was poor. Did I care much for the characters...a little. A bit of effort is expended in trying to inject some emotion but mostly it falls very flat.I saw this film in 3D. Why did I pay a premium for this ? In some of the hand to hand fight sequences you can barely see what's happening. The effect being akin to watching clothes going rounds and round in a washing machine. 3D technology appears to be very lacking for fast close action fighting sequences.The story is weak with action/explosions being the main selling point of this movie.If you go with very low expectations you may come away feeling it was an OK movie. Unfortunately for me I will lament those 2 hours of wasted time.,4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Marvel is setting the bar high,"Yes. I never thought I would say that.I read and love the leading brands of comics in general (Dark Horse is my favorite). But when it comes to movie adaptations I think, after watching this movie I can safely say that Marvel has pushed the envelope (cough*cough*Warner)This is more than a Super hero movie. More like espionage thriller. From the first shot where it starts with a little humor it never lets you down. Humor/Action/Humor/Action with a good dose of character development. Rinse and repeat. Anthony and Joe Russo got it just right.All actors have done a terrific job. Johansson is great. Be it action or a smart quip with another character she just steals the scene. After watching Chris Evans a couple of times as a comics character I never thought he can portray Caps as good as this. But he shines.All the supporting characters are given enough screen time though I wanted to see them more. Jackson as the growling chief and Redford with his snappy dialogs are just superb. Even Smulders who just flashes for a few seconds has her moment.Special mention must be made of Mackie who as Falcon is awesome. I like the friendly banter and camaraderie between him and Caps. My only disappointment is with Sebastian Stan's character. He has done a credible job but a little more of his character development would have been more welcome.Action sequences are well choreographed. The Set pieces are mostly CGI but they nicely gel with the plot and do not overwhelm which you do not see very often.Finally Caps gets his own movie (though a second one) - a fun ride which will leave you wanting more.

After watching the whole movie, I sat there trying to determine how I felt about the whole movie. Sure, I was entertained by some parts. I love captain America, I think he's a great superhero. But, I just found this movie really repetitive. The endless action sequences, which Marvel usually does really well, just seemed too repetitive. At first, they were exciting, but it was just the same thing over and over again. I actually got bored because it felt like I was watching the same thing for two hours. Chris Evans makes a great Captain America. I am probably in the minority in thinking that the first one was better. I enjoyed how they coordinated WWII into the first one.

"AN EXCELLENT CONSPIRACY THRILLER & THE BEST & MOST GROWN-UP IN THE MCU,BRILLIANT","Captain America: The winter soldier is an excellent Conspiracy Thriller that felt so familiar to me, like a 90's Thriller like Enemy of the State (1998) or Murder at 1600 (1996) or The Fugitive (1993) you get the idea, it felt old school & that made it more grounded.
This is a much better film than the first film & is one of the best sequels ever, especially in the super hero genre!!!This Captain America movie is the best I've seen in the MCU by far & that's because of it's real,grittier & more grounded approach, there's brutal fighting & terrorist shootouts, this is a conspiracy Thriller with a touch of fantasy with it being a super hero Marvel film but even with that it's still a much darker & more mature toned Marvel flick.
Steve Rogers/Captain America is easily the best character of the Avengers & is the most interesting & most human, here he goes on an emotional journey & questions the government & powers that control everything.
This is an exciting & intriguing Action Thriller that also rings true with it's corruption & conspiracy storyline.Steve Rogers is lost, he feels alone in an ever changing world & he's basically a relic of a time when being a Hero ment something & he knew what he was fighting for but now everything seems corrupted & feels wrong, what is a true man of honour supposed to do in a world like this?The loneliness is in Cap's eyes & it's an excellent very human performance from Chris Evans, who is perfect at coming accross dis-heartened & hurt at what he sees around him.
Can he trust S.H.I.E.L.D?
Is he fighting on the right side?
Captain America is lost & unsure & that's the heart of this excellent film.
Captain America is definitely my favourite character of all the Avengers & in this action packed Thriller he cements that status.The always excellent Samuel l Jackson plays Nick Fury more serious here too & has some fantastic edge of the seat scenes.
Black Widow is excellent in this movie & show's she's one of the smartest & toughest Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D again another excellent & kick a## performance from Scarlett Johansson.
Anthony Mackie is also fantastic as Falcon, he's a good man with a good heart & you can totally see why Cap trusts him.
Caps old war buddy & best friend Bucky is a terrifying & deadly Assassin, again another excellent character & performance, he comes accross so deadly & fast like a Terminator!!!
We also have the great tough guy Frank Grillo & even movie legend Robert Redford rounding out the fantastic cast.If like me you get bored of massive explosions & buildings getting blown up & want a more intriguing & more grounded Marvel film then Captain America:The winter soldier is definitely the one.A truly fantastic,exciting & fast paced action-packed Conspiracy Thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Yet another bad 'action picture',"In a strange way I feel guilty for writing this critique because I knew I wouldn't enjoy this picture and so shouldn't have wasted the time and money. Still, in a misguided attempt to keep up with popular ""culture"", I endured this shoot-em-up to the end. Here's my take... While the main character has his moments and was actually almost convincing in his deadpan sincerity, the Black Widow girl seemed silly, with no subtlety at all - her facetious lines were bad instruments of girl power and didn't come across at all with almost no reaction from the audience. The super-bad guy has already been done in a recent Batman movie and came across as a very poor copy of Darth Vader (without any presence or enjoyable lines). Redford was completely miscast - Robert de Niro or Viggo Mortensen (although I bet they would have turned the dismal part down), or hell, Martin Short could have done a better job! Instead of an interesting, hopefully novel plot line, once again, the Writers/Director chose to moralize (in a hackneyed way) and expend unlimited ordnance; do the exploding/flying cars thing yet again. To top it off, there were stupid flying vessels and helicopter hijinx. None of the CG flying machines are as much fun as in 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'. This picture is a roaring dud and simply shows how good the 'Bourne' pictures were.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The most exciting this franchise has been in years,"When Fury(L. Jackson, tough as usual, for him and these) is attacked by an unknown enemy, the Captain(Evans, will of steel, heart of gold) and Black Widow(Johansson, sultry and devious â this uses her right, finally) find themselves(they have a great chemistry, with a charming running gag of her wanting to pair him up with a girl, going through a list of ones they both know; and with his straightforward nature, and her relative lack of integrity, they both affect the other towards them, benefiting both) with no one else to trust, except perhaps the veteran Falcon(Mackie, amiable), as they uncover a genuinely devastating truth, while on the run from a considerable force â including the elusive assassin, The Winter Soldier(Stan, terrifying, pure awesome pretty much every second he's on screen).This is just short of the level of The Avengers. It uses the strong continuity of the cinematic Marvel(as in, their own studio) universe better than any of the others, and does justice to many different elements, most of them set up prior to this. Events occur in this that will have serious consequences for future entries. The plot-driven nature and approach of a 70's political thriller(where some characters, all credible and with something to do, happen to wear a flag or the like) in a contemporary setting and with biting satire(on foreign policy, something not entirely new to these, but never before this sharpÂ commenting on mass surveillance and executions taking place before any trial against the (supposed) perpetrator) is spot-on. From a 40's war flick, with heroism and defined lines between good and evil, to the modern method of taking on the opposition â with spying, and questionable tactics(compared to one army versus another).The action all comes about naturally, it's personal, hard-hitting and, on account of next to no CGI, it's ""real"". Each intense set-piece is varied(fighting, shooting, chasing both on foot and vehicularÂ), you will remember them, and except for one bit, they feel fresh and original. Among the very few weaknesses are that Sharon(VanCamp, another compelling and strong woman) has nothing to do in this, appearing as if her important scenes were cut, and/or that she was setup for the next one. She is the only one that that goes for, a pleasant surprise considering the seemingly bloated cast of characters. This explores S.H.I.E.L.D., and how the iconic super soldier fits into it Âor, whether or not he does, at all. The 3D is unobtrusive, adding depth and atmosphere, similar to Avatar.There is violence and disturbing content in this.

Not bad..,"When I walked into the theater to see this movie, I had no idea of what to expect. But what I was treated to was a very strange plot involving a new world order and something called Hydra. This movie started off with a very strange scene involving Captain America jumping out of an airplane with no parachute. This movie had a decent cast but each actor essentially played themselves. Robert Redford was very miscast in this mess of a movie. They didn't let the winter soldier have enough screen time and they certainly didn't ask for that. What happened is that the Winter Soldier was never fully explained and he never really spoke. He said a line or two in what sounded like Russian and then a few other lines. I was very disappointed in Samuel L Jackson's lackluster performance as Nick Fury. He was also very irritating when they brought out the character he once played in that movie called Pulp Fiction. Did this movie have a beginning, middle and end? I would not call the END a true ending. Also, I am getting sick and tired of Stan Lee's cameos. The special effects are over the top in this movie to the point of making me sick. The CG effects are all very OBVIOUS. I was not happy with the way just about everything was CG.

Mixed,"This big-budget epic has the title superhero and his peers trying to fight off an enemy spy agency that is working within a broader international spy agency based in Washington D.C. One of its agents is known as The Winter Soldier.Like many other big-budget films, this one does a superb job in the technical aspects particularly the aerial camera work and the special effects. However, like many other modern big-budget films, the technical effects have taken over to make up for a screenplay that is too busy and sometimes difficult to follow. Even the battle scenes seem too busy at times.While film-making has become more sophisticated since computer-generated imagery, one still yearns for a better balance in action scenes like those from older films. The special effects were less sophisticated than today but they did much better with the ""less is more"" principle where story was concerned. - dbamateurcritic",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"All chase, no point!","I was fully hoping that this would be as good as the first. And since Americans had made it #1 after THREE weeks, how could it be a waste of $14?As best as I can recall, there was a chase, then another chase, then even more chases.

S*** just got REAL,"SYNOPSIS:
It appears that HYDRA has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D and are hatching a plan that will end up killing millions. It's up to Captain America (Chris Evans) and some other to prevent this, however, they have to get through The Winter Soldier first.REVIEW:
The Russo's are here! It's actually crazy how much of a step forward this film is from every film is before it. The technical aspects of this film are spot on. The choreography of this film was so far ahead and above any of the MCU films before it. The directing style is on another level and I don't know how the Russo's do it. They take a relatively mediocre plot and a not very interesting character like ""The Winter Soldier"" and make it one of the most interesting films and one of the most badass villains in the entire MCU. You feel every punch and kick. Finally, a normal human goes flying when being kicked in the chest by a superhuman Chris Evans. Then you have the plot twist when you find out who The Winter Soldier is and that entire aspect was very interesting and a ""holy s***"" moment. This film literally has Robert Redford! Like, come on! One issue I had with the film was at the end when someone doesn't die that should very clearly been dead. Like there's no way any regular human ever lives from it. I won't go further in the small chance someone who hasn't seen the film is reading this. In conclusion, this is one of the best films in the entire MCU and I can't wait to see it again. 8.9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Captain Crunch,"This film is mildly recommended.Wham! Bam! Pow! Like a Lichtenstein print, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is standard pop entertainment. This sequel unwisely underplays the standard fish-out-of- water scenario that gave its first installment some distinction and comic flair. In this version, humor is scant and the story is still rather predictably bland, but as for superhero thrills and action sequences, those are in abundance. The film may be slightly improved in its second go-round due to some strong CGI and well staged set pieces, but whenever the action lulls, so does its enjoyment. ï¿¼The wobbly plot goes something like this: Our hero, Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America must again fight the forces of evil, this time in the form of a Soviet assassin named the Winter Soldier. There is treachery and disloyalty within the SHIELD agency that can compromise national security as Captain America tries to unravel the mystery and save the day.ï¿¼I have to confess most of the Marvel comic book heroes are usually a boring lot, but the franchise certainly knows how to cast its actors in those coveted roles: Robert Downey, Jr. as Ironman, High Jackman as Wolverine, Andrew Garfield as Spiderman, and Chris Evans in this titled role. Evans more than looks the part, especially out of his costume, and the actor brings to his part a sweet charm and quiet strength. His interplay with his co-star, Scarlett Johansson, as Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, make the film and its characters all the more interesting. Samuel L. Jackson, Anthony Mackie, and Sebastian Stan are fine in their colorful supporting roles, and it is an added pleasure seeing Robert Redford chewing up the scenery in his pivotal role.ï¿¼But the film's plot lacks cohesiveness. It continually tries to explain itself and the characters' actions in clunky dialog and heavy-handed exposition in between all the crash-and-boom, shoot-em-up scenes. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo certainly know how to stage the film's many action shots. Along with the strong visual effects, the stunt-work is top notch and extremely well choreographed. But the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely disappoints. Characters are in need of more depth and the plot mechanics never flow or connect with the action.ï¿¼Captain America: The Winter Soldier abruptly stops and starts. The film clumsily lurches from one scene to the next. One can readily say that the film's pacing stops on a quarter. This comic book superhero movie takes itself way too seriously and should have used its super powers to have a lot more fun with its source. Captain America: The Winter Soldier just left me a tad cold.

Best MCU Movie!,"I loved Captain America The Winter Soldier! It was a great story about take care of your friends even when it gets tough, our military servicemembers can be great heroes, fight to save lives, fight for freedom, and definitely don't trust nazis. The action was extremely epic and awesome. It had some very funny moments. The actors did awesome at their roles. There were some very exciting and suspenseful moments. All the futuristic technology was very cool. Without any doubt I strongly recommend this movie, and it well deserves the title of ""The Best Film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe"". Have a great day, and goooo Captain America!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Scarlett's best performance yet,"I wasn't really enjoying this movie, but the final 30 minutes or so made up for the whole movie. The special effects are extremely good. The explosion effects and glass shattering effects were off-the-charts good. The film was visually pleasing to watch. The cinematography is really, really, really good. I loved the acting, except for Pierce. Also, in my opinion, Bucky should've been recast because the actor for him wasn't intimidating at all as a villain. This was Scarlett Johansson's best performance in any Marvel movie. There was also a very decent amount of gripping action and violence. Overall, this was a really solid and enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
'Marvel'lous fanboy dreams....,"A superhero movie with it's usual pack filled with action and mayhem. Along with the lines of political thriller and roots from the comic book storyline. Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier has everything that a fanboy can cheer for.Compared to it's weak prequel, The Winter Soldier Excels in every aspect. Whether it is story or action. Aside from the movie milestone Avengers, this might be the best movie in the MCU. Chris Evans, now in his signature role shine as ever. Samuel.L.Jackson, Scarlet Johanson and Anthony Macke are also joyful to watch. But it was Sebastian Stan's winter soldier was the treat for eyes. With cool movements and skills he steals the show.As for the downside, the plot was a predictable one, and the whole Hydra business was a bit overlooked. Aside from that Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a perfect blockbuster for every age.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely one for the die-hard Marvel fans,"Saturday night. Nothing to do. I know, let's go to the cinema! My friend suggested that we go to see this film.I recall (dimly) seeing the first Captain America film but for some reason I couldn't make any sense of the beginning of this one. It seems that I must have missed a Captain America film at some point as there were lots of references to plot events of which I was completely unaware. Understandably this significantly detracted from my enjoyment.There is a lot of action in this film; having said that there was only one point at which this succeeded in engaging my attention. Sadly all of it was fairly formulaic cartoon violence, with indestructible people able to withstand the kind of physical traumas that would leave a normal person either hospitalised or deceased. There is also some acting. Not particularly good acting, mind you; the characters seemed to be paper-thin in many cases and the cast gave the impression that they were not hugely interested in anything other than their pay packet.A plot was present but at this stage I am not interested enough to comment on it.In summary, if you are a huge fan of mindless Marvel comic films and in particular Captain America then you will lap this up and rave about it to your adolescent friends over a Big Mac while simultaneously Facebooking on your smart phone. Adults should probably spend their money on something else.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America strikes again with the thrilling sequel.,"I've seen my fair share of superhero movies, but Captain America: The Winter Soldier definitely stands out from the pack. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, this film brings the Marvel Cinematic Universe to new heights with its thrilling action sequences, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes.The plot of the movie is both engaging and suspenseful. It follows Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America, as he navigates a world where he's not sure who he can trust. When a mysterious villain known as the Winter Soldier emerges, Captain America finds himself embroiled in a conspiracy that threatens the safety of millions. The story is well-crafted, with plenty of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.One of the movie's biggest strengths is its characters. Chris Evans gives a fantastic performance as Captain America, capturing the character's unwavering sense of justice and duty. But the real standout is Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier, who brings a surprising amount of depth and nuance to what could have been a one-dimensional villain. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is also a highlight, with her dry wit and tough-as-nails attitude providing a welcome contrast to Captain America's more earnest demeanor.The dialogue in the movie is sharp and witty, with plenty of memorable one-liners that will have you quoting the movie for days. The banter between Captain America and Black Widow is particularly enjoyable, and there are several scenes that showcase their chemistry.But what really sets this movie apart is how entertaining it is. The action sequences are some of the best I've seen in any superhero movie, with the Russo brothers proving themselves to be masters of the genre. Each fight feels distinct and well-choreographed, and there are several set-pieces that will leave you breathless.Of course, the movie isn't perfect. There are a few plot holes that are never fully explained, and some of the supporting characters feel underdeveloped. But these are minor quibbles in what is otherwise a fantastic movie.I would give Captain America: The Winter Soldier an 8 out of 10. It's a thrilling, action-packed ride that will keep you entertained from beginning to end. But it's also a movie with heart, exploring themes of trust, loyalty, and sacrifice in a way that feels both timely and timeless. If you're a fan of superhero movies, or just great action movies in general, you won't want to miss this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
9/10,"The winter soldier is one of the best sequels ever in cinema. Not only does it build upon its predecessor, but it expands on it so well it can hold its merit by itself. This movie discusses politics but in a subtle way. It shows how we approach politics in general. Like Captain America, it is our core individual beliefs that motivate us. This movie focuses on Captain America to the max. This is a character-focused film without giving anything much to the plot, but it manages to fit in the massive story it has. I have no issues with the film, and maybe the antagonists could've been more explained and fleshed out in the film. But it gives enough of what the movie needs. But this film is a near-perfect film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Is this the best MCU movie? YES,"It's 2020. I'm rewatching MCU movies while in quarantine. Endgame came out last year. And it did everything we fans wanted. It's the highest grossing film right now. But even with all the fan services Endgame (& other MCU movies) gave us along with big cgi battles in 4 Avengers movies and all the colorful Guardians movies + Ragnarok, Winter Soldier still is the best thing MCU delivered us. Rather than being a fun, colorful hero vs villain fight Winter Soldier gives us something else. It's suspenseful, it's thrilling, it's badass. The action scenes are so well done especially that Cap vs Bucky (that knife flip is too good). Also the elevator scene, Cap's monologue, Falcon, Black Widow, the first action sequence everything is just perfect. My favorite thing about this movie is that it starts the journey of badass Steve Rogers (before we get started, does anyone wanna....) instead of just a guy on steroids talking about patriotism. Also the Winter Soldier is still the coolest villain (Taskmaster might change that).I normally don't write reviews. Not even on MCU movies. But I need the world to know that this right here is the best MCU movie. Even after the biggies like Infinity War & Endgame (I love those movies btw) this simple political thriller stands at the no. 1 posting of MCU. Russo Brothers didn't only delivered their first MCU film they also delivered their best MCU film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Other Captain America,"The second film about an American national hero is an order of magnitude higher than the first. Now the modern society appears before the audience, where spies, dangerous villains appear at literally every turn, and no one has to be trusted. It was this production of the picture by the Russo brothers that turned the comic book film into a good spy thriller with a well-thought-out plot and rich events. All this is ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" or in our translation ""The First Avenger: Another War"".The film voices several messages at once and develops them. However, the most important thing for me was the relationship between Cap and his long-deceased comrade Bucky, who appears here as an antagonist and tries in every possible way to annoy a former friend.Actors Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan perfectly transformed from best friends into rivals. The Winter Soldier is lightning fast, an uncompromising killer who clearly acts according to plan, stopping at nothing. A great car for elimination, which was elegantly performed by the actor. Captain America is once again a cheerful soldier who continues his attempts to get used to the modern world. It's hard for him because none of his old friends are around anymore. The actor is dramatic, especially in the scene of the meeting with Peggy. And very coolly he conveys the contradictory feelings of his hero when he recognizes his old friend in the killer.The film teaches you to be a friend until the very end, shows how strong a man's friendship can be, that even when everything is against it, even your friend who doesn't remember you, you have to give him a chance, save him, rescue him from the captivity of amnesia.The film introduces new characters to the narrative. They play not the last roles in the development of the main characters, and fans are happy to see them on the big screen.The plot of the film offers an interesting interpretation of two opposing organizations - Shield and Hydra. To tell the truth, the twist does not quite fit in my head, but it is quite perceived. And you begin to rethink everything that used to be in the cinematic universe.The quality of the staged scenes is beyond doubt. This film surpasses even The Avengers in terms of chases, explosions, shootouts and fights. It feels like it was done for real, there are a minimum of computer effects, because the directors tried to create a real picture. And they certainly succeeded. And viewers like it when they are shown real explosions and fights.This film touches on important topics. He tells us that we should always look at who your friend is, who your employer is (if I may say so, who has seen the film will understand). Not always good guys are good guys, and bad guys are bad. Our world is not black and white. It is rather gray, because there is no other way.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Weak,So another superhero movie. I was hoping it might be at least as good as the first if not better but alas this was really weak (just like Thor II). Some one needs to let movie directors know that action sequences (lots of sequences) do not make up for a really weak plot and exceptionally bad dialog. I agree with a lot of others that they should have developed Cap's story more. His time with his old girl was short and amounted to nothing but I guess they didn't know how not to make it too sad. You know that you're in trouble when the supporting characters are more interesting than your hero and all of your villains. Samuel L again rocks Nick Fury and we all know that Black Widow desires a movie of her own. I could have cared less about the Winter Soldier and poor Robert Redford was really out of place. Everyone should be glad that Shield folded because they really need to start over with some better guys. I hope the next one is a while cause I'm not looking forward to anymore action sequences.,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America the Winter Soldier,Captain America the Winter Soldier is an amazing sequel and one of the best movies in the MCU in my opinion. This film has a great villain and some of the action and fight scenes are the best in the MCU. This film is more serious and grittier the most MCU films. It feels like a political spy thriller mix with superheroes. The addition of Falcon in the MCU was great and black window was very good in the film.

Shield and Subterfuge: Captain America's Vigil in a Modern World,"In the realm of superhero cinema, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" stands as a robust testament to the genre's potential for depth and dynamism. The film, directed with a keen eye for action by Anthony and Joe Russo, is a sequel that transcends its predecessor with a narrative that is both more complex and grounded.The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to weave a politically charged thriller with the fabric of a comic book adventure. It is a rare breed of blockbuster that manages to be both thought-provoking and viscerally exciting. Chris Evans returns as Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, embodying the role with a mix of earnestness and subtle vulnerability that makes him more than a shield-wielding icon; he is a man out of time, grappling with the moral ambiguities of modern warfare and espionage.The narrative thrust of ""The Winter Soldier"" is propelled by a conspiracy that reaches deep into the heart of S. H. I. E. L. D., challenging the very ideals that Captain America stands for. The film doesn't shy away from asking difficult questions about freedom, security, and the price of peace in an age where the lines between heroism and vigilantism are blurred.Supporting Evans is a cast that brings gravitas and complexity to their roles. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is given layers that were only hinted at in previous outings, and her chemistry with Evans provides a humanizing counterpoint to the larger-than-life stakes. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is as enigmatic as ever, and the introduction of Anthony Mackie as Falcon adds a welcome new dynamic to the team.The action sequences are expertly choreographed, offering a blend of hand-to-hand combat and high-flying acrobatics that are both thrilling and coherent. The film's set pieces are a reminder that action, when done well, can be an art form unto itself.However, the film occasionally succumbs to the trappings of its genre, with certain plot points feeling predictable and a third act that, while explosive, doesn't quite match the cerebral intensity of its buildup. The titular Winter Soldier, played with an appropriate intensity by Sebastian Stan, is a character steeped in mystery and tragedy, yet the film doesn't fully explore the depths of his backstory or the implications of his brainwashing.The film's pacing can be uneven, with some expository scenes that halt the momentum built by its action sequences. While the Russo brothers have crafted a film that is more mature in its themes, they sometimes struggle to maintain a consistent tone, veering between somber reflection and quippy one-liners.""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a commendable effort that pushes the boundaries of what a superhero film can be. It is a movie that combines spectacle with substance, even if it occasionally stumbles in its execution. It is a film that will satisfy fans and may even convert some skeptics, proving that there is still room in the crowded superhero landscape for stories that are as intellectually engaging as they are visually spectacular.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best MCU movie that's not an Avengers movie,"I just think this movie is amazing. The choreography and action sequences are among the best in the MCU, even without using a huge amount of cgi.Captain America has never been cooler (except for Endgame of course) and this movie is what got me to like Black Widow so much more.The Winter Soldier is one of the best villains in the MCU, because you fear him and feel for him at the same time. The constant change in directions in regards to who Steve can trust is thrilling and the ""on your left"" ending is pleasing.All in all, an incredible movie, among the best sequels (up there with movies such as Empire Strikes Back) and together with the first Iron Man movie probably the best MCU movie that's not an Avengers movie.9,1/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Never mind the plot, it's a great action movie","Scarlet Johansson kicking ass! Need I say more? This movie is about as much what you may expect from a movie of the Marvel series. But, the story line was not a good choice in my opinion. Weak, unbelievable, grotesque. Though it doesn't matter much, because the action is great!Great weapons, stunts, fighting sequences, etc. I don't recommend watching it in 3D like I did. The film has a dark tone and the 3D makes it worse. I'm not anti-3D but 3D projections do have significant shortcomings, which I thought would have been improved over time. It depends on the type of projector I guess, how bright the screen is lit.Very cool was the Falcon, daddy I want a suit like that!

Character Deconstruction at it's Perfection,"What do you get, when you combine a 70s paranoia thriller with a comicbook action film that completely deconstructs the protagonist's entire belief system and worldview in the cruelest way imaginable? You get, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.This film is arguably the best marvel cinematic universe film to have ever been produced. It has everything you can ask from a comic-book film and not only that, it elevates itself by giving personal conflicts for almost every character in the film and packs a necessary emotional punch that you rarely see in these films.As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with a fellow avenger and S. H. I. E. L. D agent, Black Widow, to battle a new threat from history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier. I just wrote the IMDb plot synopsis because it is the best way to go into this film without any spoilers. Although we all expected it and knew it, the moment we see that face, it's terrifying and heartbreaking at the same time.The acting is just, phenomenal. Chris Evans gives the best performance he has ever given in these films and this film takes him to his darkest and lowest point of life because he loses his faith in the government, loses his best friend, is almost about to lose the love of his life, but he still has one thing clear in life and is still willing to give up his life for it which is, to do what's right, no matter if he has to go against the entire world for it. Scarlett Johansson also gives a great performance here, this is the first film in the entire MCU where her character actually seems to have some weight and stakes here. She never felt like a character before this and always seemed to be there just because she's black widow. Here however, she has some development and she begins a character arc that actually goes on to have a great end by the end of Avengers: Endgame.The soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman is also really good. The gothic theme provided for the winter soldier gives me chills every time. Amazing work.This, along with The Batman are what I consider to be perfect CBMs and I wonder if they can be topped anytime soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Best of the Captain America MCU Trilogy, A thrilling action blockbuster","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's one of the finest superhero movies ever made, it really made me feel satisfied and really blew me away on just how sharply shot the action was in this movie. It's at this point in time where the action directing in the MCU franchise really started to rise up dramatically and the action scenes in this movie are shot with clarity and prescision. The Winter Soldier is a great villan and really was the best villan in the MCU at that point. His design is slick and very modern looking and looks intimidating aswell which is exactly what you want from a superhero villan.Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers is also great in the movie as his character has grown stronger and is now living comfortably in 2010s America. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is back aswell and is awesome as always. The story has upped it's game and has become more emotional with some truly heart wrenching scenes aswell as some really good tension aswell when the characters clash against one anotherOverall a crisp, thrilling and just plain fun MCU movie with the best shot action at the time for a Marvel movie.

Crash Bang Wallop,"Every year that goes by and every film in the fantasy franchise that goes by the cgi cartoonery gets more polished and potent and this outing is no exception. Where will it end? This is an exhausting ride of cartoon violence and unremitting mayhem that although I stayed with it to the conclusion I knew was coming I was happy when it was all over and quiet descended again. Until the next time that is, when we can all start over again.The organisation protecting the world's freedom SHIELD has been found to be completely infiltrated with the different brand of freedom lovers from the alphabet soup HYDRA. Boss Samuel L. Jackson's injunction to Capt. America Chris Evans to Trust No One rings very true here: don't trust anyone but especially don't trust your own eyes. Or his for that matter. Basically many people have to die in the chase for a flash stick, but the film loses impetus once its secrets are ""revealed"" and the graphics take over. Scarlet Johannson as Black Widow succeeded admirably in looking powerful and non-sexy, Evans' life was saved at least half a million times during the picture by his titchy shield, Falcon looked a force to be reckoned with except on very flimsy wings but it was the Winter Soldier who looked impressively impregnable. I couldn't imagine such a cool savage dude ever sneezing, getting a wedgie or paying a parking ticket. The heroes â or should that be merely saviours â didn't seem to care much for the Innocent Bystander, so it was refreshing to hear Johannson shout to hundreds of bystanders to get out of the way of the baddies flooding the air with bullets. And as for the mammothly expensive death-dealing flying machines â cheap teleportation will transport us all into a new world of non moving parts; same as those flying machines when disabled with a credit card, it's right on top of us.However I enjoyed the film - less than the first because of the excessive cartoon choreography which probably doesn't play as well on a TV, but wasn't surprised or disappointed by any of it: same as all of us I knew what I was getting into. The biggest point to me: Why can't all freedom lovers whether political or religious mind their own business?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Very Good, Considering I Jumped in at the Wrong Time","I read comic books years ago but not for a long time. I have watched many of the Marvel films already released but don't have that foundation that the fan-boys have. My mistake was not realizing there was a previous movie when I went to this one. So it took a little information from my twenty something son to get me up to speed. I'm sure most of you reading this know the Captain America mythos. This is a high speed, action every minute, mind bending experience. The individual characters are interesting and complex. I still need to watch the first movie to actually figure out the whole ""Shield"" and ""Hydra"" thing and how it works and what Captain America has done. However, when you have your characters being pursued by the most formidable of villains, it isn't necessary to have an encyclopedic knowledge of all this stuff.

Epic superhero movie! 7/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this epic super hero movie, which had loads of action and a decent storyline. It was a bit long and it did lack some wit, like the Iron Man movies, but it's got loads of intense drama and action throughout. Compared to the other super heroes, I don't find Captain America to be the most entertaining because he hasn't really got any super powers like Superman or the Hulk. Anyway, the film is a great watch and the performances from the actors were quite good. I was expecting some references to the other Avengers at some point, but the director chose to focus on Evans character. Some of the lines and scenes were slightly corny but it's what you expect from an American hero who is completely devoted to the saviour of his country. In all, it's a great addition to the Captain America franchise, but I preferred the mixture of characters in the Avengers. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Chris Evans was a weird choice for this role because he plays the Human Torch in Fantastic Four franchise. He does play Captain America well and his chemistry with the other super heroes, really does work. His action scenes were quite impressive and he did show that he can fight without using the shield. Scarlett Johansson has been lucky to star in the Avengers, Iron Man 2 and Captain America 2 and she also had a role in the poor, The Spirit which also starred Samuel L. Jackson. I liked the chemistry between her character and Captain America but she really needs some gadgets. The Winter Soldier was quite impressive with his fighting skills but they didn't really go into depth about his character. The same goes for Falcon who joined the team without much introduction. Anyway, I'm sure that we will find out more about these characters as the franchise builds up, and judging by the ending, we have a lot to come.Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $714millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there epic super hero movies about Captain America saving the world. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Don't get me wrong, when the action happens this movie can be great but it's all the in between scenes that made me feel bored when watching.

Not so hot,"Instead of a real plot, the hackneyed script provided at most a minimal excuse for moving from one ""spectacular"" action scene to another.

There were some ""moments"" that could have had meaning with more development and a better plot, but without one you were left nothing.Worse for an action movie, instead of action scenes that made some sense, it had one logical howler after another in them designed to make the task of the heroes more difficult and the actions seem more ""spectacular."" Action scenes don't have to make perfect sense all the time, but they have to do so enough that they don't intrude on your suspension of disbelief.

And every character goes through their own emotional journey.The story makes and keeps you super invested the whole time. It is very entertaining.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10/10
This movie is full of fantastic themes. I think the best one is to stand up in what you believe. It is what the Captain America character is all about, and this movie shows that attribute perfectly.This is one of the deepest MCU movies. It explores so many great things about the characters, history, and different great comic story lines.5. Characters - 10/10
All of the characters are fantastic. I think this is the best we've seen Captain America, Black Widow, and Nick Fury.I absolutely love the introduction of Sam Wilson as Falcon. They nailed it, and it really couldn't be better. I love the brotherhood he develops with Steve.The Winter Soldiers introduction is very, very cool. It is perfect in every way. The way you learn more about him throughout the film is awesome. And it sets up some amazing story lines for future films.6. Acting / Writing - 10/10
Zero complaints on the acting at all. I think this is the best Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Samuel L. Jackson have been in the MCU. Anthony Mackie did fantastic as Sam Wilson.The writing in this is the best in the MCU. It shows off just how big of a deal this movie is. And shows Captain America's character perfectly.7a. Cinematography - 8/10
Nothing super special or mind blowing. But still super good. I do love the way they do the flashbacks.7b. Choreography - 10/10
This has my favorite fight scenes in the MCU. The fighting is done very fast and very well. It is very entertaining to watch. The Winter Soldier in particular has some very cool moves while he fighting.8. Score - 9/10
Captain America music is super good. And this movie delivers on that. The music for Winter Soldier is super good. It is on Hans Zimmer level. It has the same vibes as The Dark Knight trilogy score.9. Editing / Pace - 10/10
The editing is very good. I especially love how they make it feel much more serious. And any flashback scenes are edited very well.The pacing is perfect. It gives the right amount of time to set up and keep you invested in the story. I love how much action this movie has. And they do a great job making it not feel rushed, with action scene after action scene.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 10/10
This whole movie feels very real. There isn't anything that even feels like special effects. That is probably because there is a lot more practical and less CGI.Average Score:
9.7/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
9.9/10
This was my favorite Marvel movie until Spider-Man No Way Home. And it honestly still might be. It takes one of the best Marvel comic heroes, and displays him perfectly in this movie. The action scenes in this are the best we've seen. And everything to do with Shield is just very cool to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best Marvel movies yet,"This movie still holds up as one of the better written, directed and acted films of the MCU. What I found refreshing about it was that it seemed to play more as a political thriller than a superhero movie. Steve Rogers is drawn into a world where he doesn't know who to trust, and even questions his own choices. He chooses to do what he thinks is right, even at the cost of disobeying orders. The fight scenes were raw and visceral, and felt grounded. Even the concept of Sam Wilson in a winged jetpack felt grounded in reality. What I wish more Marvel movies took away from this one, is to allow their main characters room to sruggle and sacrifice.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Henry Jackman's score for The Winter Soldier is utterly bland and modern, so it fails to evoke a protagonist who is, despite everyone's efforts, neither of the above.","Let's start this out on a positive note. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo) features a likable protagonist, comfortable pacing, and some rather good plot ideas.Tying in to the growing Marvel cinematic universe, The Winter Soldier takes place soon after the events of The Avengers film (for a full grasp of the setting and characters, we're supposed to have also seen Captain America: The First Avenger).WW2 hero Steve Rogers (Captain America, played by Chris Evans) is still trying to adapt to life in the 21st century â which, in his case, entails working for a well-intentioned but overbearing intelligence organization headed by the sensibly paranoid Nicholas Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).On paper, at least, there's a great deal of dramatic potential in the idea of the honest, quietly gallant but somewhat old-fashioned soldier of the 1940s trying to work alongside a former KGB assassin (Scarlett Johansson) who lies for a living, under the command of a leader who trusts no one. Add to this some dubious anti-terrorism tactics and blurred lines between security and oppression and you have the recipe for an exciting and morally rich story.All that's on paper. On the screen, what we get is a decent set-up, a couple of distinctive â though mostly unexplored â characters, a juicy ethical conundrum that vanishes unresolved in a puff of smoke (or rather, a series of explosions), and an overdose of acrobatics and flying bullets.Let's be fair here. Dynamic, over-the top fight scenes are one of the perks of comic book movies, and this one does indeed deliver a few entertaining dustups. It also contains quite a few that overstay their welcome and wear out the old Hollywood tradition of ineffectual antagonist gunfire.While it's true that too short a confrontation at the very end of a film can feel anticlimactic, it's also manifestly true (even in the world of comic book fights) that less is often more. A shorter fight can actually pack more of an emotional punch instead of leaving the audience numb and wondering why everyone isn't dead yet.Speaking of everyone being dead, there's also the small problem of collateral damage to be dealt with here. One of the charms of the Captain America character (as set out in the previous movies, anyway) is his sincere, instinctive decency and compassion. Here, there's not even a second of anguish or even acknowledgement of civilian damage caused by his exploits and those of his enemies.Having said all this, many of The Winter Soldier's flaws would be much diminished if only the movie were shorter and better scored. The Russos could have knocked nearly half an hour off the movie's two-hour-plus runtime without losing any of the plot, humour, or characters depth simply by slimming a few obese action sequences. What remains would then benefit a great deal from a more distinctive and evocative soundtrack. Alan Silvestri's work on the first Captain America movie was both memorable and very fitting for both the historical period and the hero. Henry Jackman's score for The Winter Soldier is utterly bland and modern, so it fails to evoke a protagonist who is, despite everyone's efforts, neither of the above.http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/captain-America-soldier",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Continuously badass. In this movie he speaks softly and carries a big stick. Chris Evans (easily Marvel's best characterisation) plays a wholesome, troubled heartthrob of a superhero. He's a very watchable actor, making this film look easy.Yes, it does suffer from some overstuffed and CGI reliant third act claptrap, but even though I could see the twists a mile off, my girlfriend didn't, reminding me that these movies aren't just for comic aficionados.Being a child of so many world, it's a miracle that Winter Soldier comes out as successful and revitalising as it does.

A High-Octane Sequel,"Still adjusting to a new age and issues related to his past, ""Steve Rogers"" (Chris Evans) meets another man named ""Sam Wilson"" (Anthony Mackie) who has experience dealing with similar issues. Immediately after their conversation Steve is picked up by Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) at which time they are sent on a top-secret mission to rescue hostages aboard a vessel owned by the spy agency (named ""S.H.I.E.L.D."") they work for. However, during the rescue operation Steve (aka ""Captain America"") discovers that Natasha (aka ""the Black Widow"") had an alternate mission assigned to her that he did not know about. Angry about not being informed Captain America confronts his boss ""Nick Fury"" (Samuel L. Jackson) and after the argument he begins to question whether working for ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" is the right thing to do. What nobody realizes is that an enemy spy agency known as ""Hydra"" has infiltrated their ranks and has a deadly plan to take over the entire world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a high-octane action film which, as a sequel, is comparable to the original movie ""Captain America-The First Avenger"" produced 3 years earlier. It has an interesting plot, high-quality special effects and decent acting all around.

Captain America pretty much destroys everyone who stands in his path. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is absolutely incredible as well, she needs her own movie!I can't recommend this highly enough. I think even those who are not fans of this genre may like it purely for the action.

"Despite the plot looming towards the familiar world domination, the setup is layered with a background story that develops like photographic film.","After almost dropping the ball with last year's fiasco â Iron Man 3 â Marvel is back with a bang and it's a good bang for your buck. Captain America: Winter Soldier is a smack-down superhero film that finds itself wedged in the higher echelons of the Marvel franchise.X-Men: First Class (2011) was one of the first films in Marvel's nine film franchise to successfully graft superhero fiction with real world events. Picking up on the ethos that the world as we know it is not what it appears to be, Winter Soldier begins with a prologue similar to classic espionage thrillers. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), our titular star spangled super soldier, is air dropped onto a S.H.I.E.L.D vessel captured by Algerian pirates. Standard fare breach and entry tactics if you asked me, but before you know it, Rogers finds himself entangled in a web of conspiracies perpetrated by sleeper cells within S.H.I.E.L.D. Barely able to bridge the gap between the 1940s and modern day advancements in technology, Rogers is now weary of who he can trust. To connect the dots he must now backtrack all the way to the origins of S.H.I.E.L.D. and figure out who is the friend and who the foe â Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) or senior official Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). But even before Rogers unmasks the villain, an old threat resurfaces and proceeds to wreak havoc with a secret weapon â the deadly stealth assassin known as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan).Going in for a superhero film, it is only natural to expect high doses of CGI fuelled action. But what happens when you are 'fed' a lot more than you expect? The three-word answer to that question is Man of Steel â DC Entertainment's self embarrassing rendition of brawn over brain. In comparison, sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russo, along with returning screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely work with plausibility by wisely choosing mind over muscle. That doesn't mean action takes a back seat either. After the low profile opening act, wait exactly thirty minutes for the action to pick up and then surge towards a cliffhanger finale. Despite the plot looming towards world domination, albeit a familiar theme in similar films, the setup is layered with a background story that develops like photographic film. This is where we learn why the Winter Soldier is a diabolic mirror image of Captain America - a pawn (or should I say Trojan horse?) in a terror threat orchestrated by a shadow organization that has manipulated worldwide chaos for decades.Once again, Evans doesn't disappoint as a superhero who is a patriot first and a hero second. Supporting Evans is the super suave Scarlett Johansson returning as Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, a highly skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who turns out to be more than just a pretty face. Also scripted for this film is Marvel superhero Falcon (Anthony Mackie), an ex-paratrooper who becomes Cap's friend and vital aid during some white-knuckle aerial battles. Jackson and Redford blend in as the 'powers that be' while Stan puts on a terrific show as a villain who is as cool and powerful as Cap himself. They all contribute to the film's look and feel and each of their characters comes with at least one witty line to boot. This again echoes my sentiments on how well this film is written and directed. Captain America: Winter Soldier is a good film if you have a thing for superhero movies. On the other hand, true Marvel fans will march a step forward and even call this a 'Great' film and a welcome addition to Marvel's long running superhero franchise. And by the looks of it, this franchise is far from over; two end credits scenes reveal more to come, where the first one introduces viewers to Magneto's children. Stay seated and buckle up, that's all I'll say!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Another Solid, But Nothing To Write Home About Marvel Studios Film","Captain America: The Winter Soldier has one of the strongest first halves of any of the ""Marvel Studio Films"" to date.We learn the fate of Peggy Carter (the best female character in the MCU), Captain America's (Chris Evans) old squeeze from the first film and see the effect it has on Cap.We see Cap struggling to find his purpose in life and questioning the shady SHIELD and Nick Fury (Sameul L. Jackson) at every turn.There is some good character development of the Nick Fury character that goes beyond ""Here's Samuel L. being bad ass"" that hasn't been seen before throughout the films. This goes double for Captain America, as Evans proves he can carry a film here.The first half of the film is a solid blend of action and interesting character development that is tight and well constructed. Having been one of the MCU's hardest critics for its lack of focus on characters and their own personal journeys as opposed to almost every film feeling like a setup for the Avengers, the first half of the film integrates everything very well. Nothing feels like it's building towards something that we'll see three films from now.Everything feels like its grounded in the present, characters that have been glossed over (Fury, Cap, Black Widow) are actually given time to breathe and grow here, and the action scenes are very well choreographed and and shot.But then, like so many of the films from Marvel studios, the film collapses under its own weight in the second half.There are so many story lines that come to fruition throughout the film that it gets ridiculous. The presentation becomes so over the top that any feeling of danger that the characters were in, in the first half of the film, flies out of the window. Conspiracy theories and back stabbings that were quite interesting becomes way too bloated and convoluted for its own good.The film outstays its welcome in other words and gives us so much to chew on, that as an audience, it's like we've been fed a great appetizer and then been force fed an overdone 38 ounce steak. The flavor is great, but it's just too much to take in.Robert Redford provides an interesting take on the proceedings in his role as Alexander Pierce, a high ranking member of SHIELD and one of Fury's most trusted comrades.Technically, the film is well shot and edited. The direction is crisp and as mentioned, the action scenes are very engaging and pulse pounding. Technically, this may be the best Marvel Studios film since the original Iron Man.Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Jackson carry the film and do a very good job, it's just that once you figure out why everything is transpiring the way it has been, it's almost too ridiculous and far fetched to believe, even for a comic book film.So once again, a solid first half, and a bloated second half produce another solid, but nothing to write home about Marvel Studios film. While it is miles ahead of Thor 2 and Iron Man 3, writer/directors Joe and Anthony Russo's film is definitely the best Marvel film since the Avengers, and maybe since the first and still king of the MCU, Iron Man.It's a step in the right direction for a studio that seems to have rested on its laurels in trying to be all about universe building without making me care about the characters in the universe. This really is the first film since the original Iron Man that feels focused on the present and the here and now as opposed to feeling like a setup for another Avengers.I am interested to see if the third film in the franchise can improve on what was a solid second chapter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Overlong Film Puts Audience to Sleep!,"Captain America lacks humor, engaging plot and script, relying solely on special effects and promotions to get box office honors! And to make matters worse, it dragged on forever! It was a silent audience for the entire 2 hours, not a chuckle was heard, and when it was finally over, the audience just walked out the door with not a soul staying for credits or musical score.From start to end, this was just a mish-mash of unengaging computer imagery, with so many scenes of shoot-em-up violence, shattered glass and chaos that it got boring within the first half hour.Camera work was shaky, editing poor with overly long scenes, and actors either miscast or just reading their lines without impact.And if there was a music score, I sure don't remember it.And good acting just wasn't there. The CaptainAmerica actor used a faint persona drawn from Tom Cruise, who, with his intensity and charisma, would have raised the movie to a higher level. His strong woman cohort, played by Scarlett Johanson, was especially lackluster, with her only notable expression being frowning occasionally. And, casting an aged Robert Redford as villain was poor casting extraordinaire! Redford lacked energy, intensity, and physical presence as an actor.If you enjoy watching a Hollywood-style extravaganza with 90% special effects and actors sleep-walking through their lines, Captain America is for you!

Having a film like this seem so grounded is great because it allows the Russo brothers to use a lot less CGI in their action scenes. The action in this movie are great and as I said in my review of the first Captain America, Cap is one of the most fun characters to watch in action scenes.Chris Evans is amazing as Cap, Scarlett Johansson is great, but the stand out for me was Anthony Mackie as the newly introduced Flacon. Mackie does a great job of being this comedic relief but also being this serious and stern person.The Winter Soldier is one of the best villains in the MCU. He is extremely entertaining to watch in action scenes and has a intriguing story. I also really enjoyed Robert Redford who does a great job of being this dark political figure.In terms of gripes there is a scene that felt much different from the rest of the film because of how unrealistic it was.

Sloppy writing saved by good action and one of my most favorite emotional endings,"Re-watching Winter Soldier in 2020 after the completion of the main story in Avengers Endgame simultaneously makes this movie better and worse.Some things became clearer, but some of the stuff that the characters say and some of their actions make less sense if you have seen Endgame and Captain Marvel. For example, there were a couple of throwaway lines from Nick Fury about how trusting people made him lost his eye, but Captain Marvel film doesn't really support this. Some of the stuff feels better (like the elevator scene) if you know how cool it will be handled in Endgame. Also, Black Widow looks in this film 10 years older than she does in Infinity War and Endgame and I'm not sure why.The film is kept floating above the water by creative and cool action, good CGI that holds up even 6 years later, good humor, great pacing that makes a 2hr movie feel like a 15 min short, and, of course, the emotional ending scene. And while the writing was kinda sloppy and barely held it together, many things didn't make a whole lot of sense even by comic book standards, the friendship between Rogers and Bucky and the ending performances get me every time.

Redefinition,"In the latest era, superhero movies are mostly remembered either for its one-liners, inspirational quotes about heroism, or anything deep, but only rare has been reminded straightly by the action. The set pieces are probably too good and too common to be the landmark of a certain film, thus the genre's grander goal has gone to breaking dramatic grounds while the actual fun is unnoticeably taken for granted by the audience. Captain America: The Winter Soldier returns to the forgotten ambition by simply aiming to be exciting. Clever storyline and frantic action keeps it utterly thrilling, which results a refreshing take to action blockbusters.The title suggests that it's about The Winter Soldier, but it's mainly about what has happened to the world years after the first movie. We get to see Steve Rogers trying to fit in to the future, and look into a time that betrays the real American way of truth and justice. The film smartly takes the virtuous hero to mysteries by setting the pieces into a revelation that was already conspired from the past. Rogers has become a symbol of the old integrity of the nation, and the story contrasts it to the new government. It's a gripping speculation, and it is strange because only little involves the titular enemy. The Winter Soldier feels like an extended arc for Rogers or another cliffhanger for the next movie. Otherwise it's still well constructed.The cast is never a doubt. Chris Evans still embraces what we love about Captain America; great character of patriotism and heroism. Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie backs him up adding their team a little more personality. Robert Redford lends some real humanity to his ridiculously suspicious character, and Frank Grillo is just warming up to become the actual Crossbones in the upcoming sequels.CGI is now everything in action movies and they're not always that compelling. This movie of course has a lot of them, but the best parts are usually the ones that involves stuff getting hit, either by fists or damaged cars. The film has plenty of impressively choreographed fighting scenes and they bring reminiscence to the old school action which reminds the audience that nothing can really beat the basics. The larger action may look kind of stale, but the kinetic of the speed and destruction overpowers the spectacles, moves the audience with genuine thrills. This is the enthusiasm that superhero movies lack nowadays and it is encouraged that they should offer more face punching, knife flipping exhilaration like this.""Redefinition"" is indeed the word. While Captain America the hero represents how true justice works, the film relives why action movies are so awesome. None of the film is groundbreaking whatsoever, but how it is done is terrific and humbly fun without any pretension. It does still need to live up a bit more with the title, but the merits could ignore that fact. Besides, our blockbusters today do need some straightforward thrills like this, plus a consistent plot that explores more of its iconic universe. Some might ask for a little more depth at the intriguing first act and the Winter Soldier mystery, but it would be wiser to just sit back, relax, and enjoy what this genre is meant to be: awesome and loyal to its heroic roots.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid entry in the series,"""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a solid sequel to 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger.""

"Better than the first , but not by a lot.","Captain America: The winter soldier is definitely better than Captain America The first avenger simply because of how much clearer it got rather than how absurdly confusing the first film was this movie did some good things here and there and to be honest this was just great nothing too bad and nothing too good.The cast is great , Chris Evans did a good job he is definitely captain America himself he portrayed that character well, Anthony Mackie as Falcon was such a good character also , Scarlett Johanesson as Natasha was pretty good also , but the best one has and will always be Samuel L. Jackson as Nick fury his character is so so good I like his acting and his dialogue and his overall performance as a character very good.Some of the parts of the movie I didn't understand and didn't care about unfortunately but some part of the movie was good . Like the action sequences and the visual aspects of the film were really good especially near the end the CGI was amazing plus the dialogue was pretty nice.Overall an avarage film I expected better since it was regarded as a very very good film but eh it wasn't that bad it was a bit okay and just nice , I hope civil war will be better than the first and this , 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best MCU Movie,"This is my favourite instalment in the MCU. I love the team up movies but this is the one that tops the pile for me. It has great action, great villains and made Cap the coolest avenger but most importantly it has relevant, mature political themes that boost it from just a generic action film to a fantastic spy thriller. Surprised it only has 7.7 though.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best MCU sequels,"After sequels Iron Man 2 and Thor: The Dark World not fully living up to expectations for critics and audiences alike, Marvel Studios has learned from their mistakes and make sure they get this sequel right for everyone. After being frozen in ice for decades and helped formed The Avengers in the battle of New York, Chris Evans returns once again as Steve Rogers/Captain America that is still getting use to the new world around him and how to move forward. While he is doing that, he is also working with S. H. I. E. L. D. on a tactical team for top secret missions alongside Natasha Roman/Black Widow. After a rescue mission on a cargo ship goes a little awry, Nick Fury is being cornered by not only the worlds top leaders, but also Captain America on what is really going on behind S. H. I. E. L. D. While Fury is questioning himself what is going on behind closed doors at S. H. I. E. L. D., a deadly attack against not only Fury himself, but other colleagues of S. H. I. E. L. D. leaves Captain America and Black Widow on the run to discover the truth and uncover Hydra's plan with the Winter Soldier being one step ahead of them. With that being said, this movie manages to capture and make this film more solid than Captain America: The First Avenger. From the action, to the gunplay, to the stunts, this is a film that stands on its own and gives us one of the best storylines of the MCU while also introducing us to not only different sides of characters we haven't seen before, but new characters included. For starters, the standout character in this film is definitely Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/ The Winter Soldier. The way he captures the trauma, abuse, and the psychotic side of the Winter Soldier was pulled off masterfully, making his villain in this movie one of my favorites ever in the MCU. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce was a great casting choice as well as Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Back to what I said before, I was glad to get to see a different side of characters particularly in Black Widow and Nick Fury. I was also glad we got to know a little more about Steve's and Bucky's friendship as they were growing up. Overall by the end, the film leaves you more than satisfied and makes you want more from it while giving you hope on what's to come in the future. Rating 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but average.","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is just like every other superhero and action movie these days. Has lots of action, explosions, all that good stuff.I don't hate or love this movie, I'm just kinda split. As I said, it's an average superhero movie, it doesn't do anything ground breaking or original, but I did like the movie's storyline, I'm not going to spoil it, but it was at least a interesting one.If there was something I liked about this film, it was its fight sequences, it was pretty cool seeing well choreographed fight scenes in a movie like this, so that was a treat.Overall, not bad, but just falls with the rest of the superhero movies today.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie sucked,"What an awful movie, it was 2 hours of me, two friends and the desperation of not being able to leave from the cinema early. As a person who loves movies, I don't even know what I was thinking when I decided to go watch a Marvel movie.This movie just proves how Hollywood is nothing but clichÃ© dialog and CGI for movies these days.Captain America is a movie that had really nothing going for it. First, let's start by it's horrible plot, which seemed artificially created and dumb. Second, even though this is a movie that is supposed to be about heroism (hence the super hero!), it really had nothing heroic about it other then a guy who's power was given by experiments an is now able to fight bad guys. He has no heroic words to give (except for that one line in the movie that was super dumb) and he showed nothing to strive for.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This movie is so impressive and it is a superior sauce of entertainment .I really enjoyed it.Captain America is my favorite super hero,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a game-changing, action-packed, and emotionally resonant cinematic experience that redefines the superhero genre. Directors A and Joe Russo have crafted a film that is both a thrilling ride and a thought-provoking exploration of power, loyalty, and identity.From the opening scene, it's clear that this movie is something crucial. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, with a blend of high-octane chases, intense hand-to-hand combat, and innovative uses of Captain America's shield. The film's pacing is relentless, with barely a moment to catch your breath between set pieces.But what truly sets ""The Winter Soldier"" apart is its richly layered storytelling. The film's narrative is a complex web of intrigue, deception, and betrayal, with characters' motivations and allegiances constantly shifting. The script is full of clever twists and turns, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as they try to piece together the mystery.At the heart of the film is Chris Evans' outstanding performance as Steve Rogers, aka Captain America. Evans brings a depth and nuance to the character, conveying the sense of unease and disillusionment that comes with discovering that the organization you trust has been compromised. His chemistry with Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is undeniable, and their banter adds a welcome layer of humor to the film.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier and Anthony Mackie as Falcon. The film's villain, Alexander Pierce, is chillingly portrayed by Robert Redford, who brings a sense of gravitas and menace to the role.Visually, the film is stunning, with a blend of practical and CGI effects that create a seamless and immersive world. The cinematography is crisp and clear, capturing the intensity and chaos of the action sequences.One of the most impressive aspects of ""The Winter Soldier"" is its thematic resonance. The film explores complex ideas about power, corruption, and the dangers of unchecked authority. It's a movie that challenges viewers to think critically about the world around them and the institutions that shape our lives.In short, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a masterpiece of modern cinema. It's a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, make you think, and leave you eagerly anticipating the next installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience it on the biggest screen possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
True Character Depth And Truly A Great Film!,"The first film was about giving Steve the opportunity to be the hero he was born to be. The Avengers gave him the chance to matter in the modern era. In this movie, we get true character depth and turmoil that we never saw in those first two installments. Both were great in their own way but this is the depth we needed to see now.It was easier in the 1940's to judge right and wrong. Now, it's more difficult to gage how to combat the hidden evil that has taken root in the modern era. Threats are different now, and the debate on how to handle them seems ripped right out of today's headlines. How far to take precautionary measures? For a man who fought to serve with all his being, how much is too much? Steve is stoic and doesn't want to burden anyone with his struggles. It's exactly what a man from that era would do. Yet, that turmoil and moral self independence mixed with a ""never give up"" attitude is what makes the character so dynamic and interesting. He does struggle and he does connect with people and show vulnerability, which is tough for him to do. This does ground him and it certainly makes him more interesting.All the characters used in this film work amazingly well. The ones we've seen before are fleshed out more. I love the Black Widow here, this is her best on screen stuff yet. Her morality is basically for sale and Steve's morality is set in stone. It's more than interesting what they find in each other. The new characters just shine. The Falcon is an absolute ace. Sam seeks out a friendship and then later that friendship proves to be invaluable. The bad guys are probably the best in any Marvel film to date. Let me say that againÂ ANY Marvel film to date. One thing is for sure here, authority figures are not to be trusted and shades of gray permeate the plot's moral landscape.I really loved the hard-edged, physical action. No wire-fu or even noticeable CGI. I know it was used in the fight scenes but you'd never know it. It exactly what this character should always be depicted doing. The action in Thor or Iron Man films is different because of the nature of their powers. Here, it's all brutal yet graceful and everything works tremendously well. Cap isn't just a guy who was given the ability of speed and enhanced strength. He's been training and his enhanced mind makes him just as dangerous as his muscles. His training and ability make him VERY dangerous and the movie shows that and then some. The fights in this movie are the most impactful that I've seen in years.Overall, a great sequel that follows in the footsteps of things like Spider-Man 2 and X2 and that's a movie that's clearly better than an already good first entry.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Can be hard to follow,"First off, I saw in some of the blurbs that people were saying this movie is better than The Avengers, and I definitely disagree with that assessment. The Avengers had a whole CAST of superheroes, including Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, fighting a full scale alien invasion of New York city. This movie features one superhero fighting one nefarious government organization, although the organization in question is very resourceful and nefarious indeed.There are so many plot twists in this film, I can't really describe the storyline without ruining it. I read that it was ""inspired"" by 70's government conspiracy films like Three Days of the Condor, and it definitely seems like it was. Basically everybody is out to betray everybody at some point in this film. To be honest, the intrigue came so quick and fast that I had a hard time keeping up with it, what with my frequent bathroom breaks and messing around on my phone. I guess I shouldn't knock it for that, since I didn't give it my full attention, but I will anyway. It's not a film to multitask with.The action is, as expected, big and loud, although not quite as compelling as one of the Marvel movies where the main character has actual ""superpowers,"" like Spider-Man swinging through the Big Apple on webs or the Incredible Hulk shrugging off bullets. Captain America's foil, the titular ""winter soldier,"" is more like a cypher than an actual character, and although they try to flesh him out a bit near the end he comes off as rather cardboard and uninspiring. He also allows himself to be manipulated in a way that seems absolutely counter-productive and confusing to me. He looks awfully cool, though.Scarlett Johannsen is in this film also, reprising her role as the Black Widow, looking as hot as ever. There's a little sexual tension between her and Captain America that I could appreciate, given that their relationship never moves beyond the platonic. Oh, how I know that place so well! Anyway, I suppose her and the handsome fellow who plays Cap turn in acceptable acting jobs, although nothing to write home about. They're surprised and shocked in the appropriate spots, but nothing really emotional or demanding is expected of them. And the ""mastermind"" villain does a pretty good job of leaving the scenery intact, instead of chewing it all to hell.All in all I say this movie is definitely incredibly action-packed and fun to watch, although a little confusing if you don't play close attention. I think I liked the first one a little better, though, simply because it featured Hugo Weaving playing the Red Skull. I guess if you were to evaluate the movies ""objectively,"" however, Winter Soldier would have to come out on top. I'd have to say I give it a definite ""thumbs up,"" and four stars out of five.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extremely good action movie,"First class piece of action filmmaking where the producers took the time to get the storyline right and the visuals are never less than spot on.

"Same schema, improved execution","Such a copy pasta story pattern from other mediocre superhero movies, no invention at all in any direction, so precalculated of how things should affect target audience (btw nice side boob of scarlett). I could write long paragraphs of how this pop flick is the protagonist of anti-creative movie industry but i just remember one thing that striked me more than others. When there was a james bond moment and our beloved el capitano struggled to finish the job against the time, i just realized how this scene made me cold and absolutely not caring about anything i saw on the screen. That scene made me just feel bad, like i am less intelligent animal than a monkey, like the creators even think that some 1% of people doesn't already know how the situation will turn out, it made me feel like having a baby with a prostitute who just continues her job. This kinda summarizes the movie for me, its just the same BS in different coat acting to look new and cool and screaming at me with that lying face - come pls pay to look at me pls. Expected more from a 8 rated movie.

Instead we are given a mockery of all superhero movies to date. We have been presented with unnecessary amounts of CGI and guns and killing. Superhero movies are supposed to present morals. How can a superhero movie depict a couple of characters running around shooting at each other and killing massive amounts of people in the process. In my opinion just plain awful.

Many scenes left me astounded, such as the extended battle scene involving Fury and the police cars, and the scene involving disaster on the 41st floor. The special effects are very impressive, but the 3D is very underwhelming. Most of the time I don't even notice the 3D.Overall, I enjoyed ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" a lot.

Captain America Spy/Thriller. 'Nuff Said,"A man out of time. An espionage plot. The return of a fallen hero. The Marvel Cinematic Universe branches out into the spy/thriller film genre with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. After a successful run on television, the Russo Brothers, Joe & Anthony, were brought in to direct the sequel and unbeknownst to them, begin their journey through the MCU.Captain America: The Winter Soldier explores Steve Rogers' (Chris Evans) exploration of modern times. As he adjusts to new ideas, he works for S. H. I. E. L. D., undertaking various missions. After growing suspicious of the secretive Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Captain America begins looking into matters on his own. Sending his suspicions into a spiral, the mysterious Winter Soldier arrives, bringing many more questions than answers. Cap must team up with Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) & Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) to uncover an evergrowing threat.While introducing a subgenre into the universe, Captain America: The Winter Soldier acts as a marvelous follow-up to The Avengers, as well as its predecessor. As a spy/thriller, the film delivers an exciting and nail-biting experience. The building mystery entices viewers, as a breadcrumb trail is laid out through the story for keen eyes to follow. With old characters being brought into question and new characters acting seeming questionable, the mystery of who to trust looms, ever-present. Attempting to be more than just another superhero film, Captain America: The Winter Soldier kept the genre exciting by delivering a film that stands out with its unique hybrid story.Jumping back into the suit, Evans is a beacon of hope and integrity, treading through an uncertain world. As one of the MCU's best actors, his role as Cap is always thoroughly enjoyable. Additionally, the Winter Soldier provides an incredible force for the Star-Spangled Soldier. With some of the greatest hand-to-hand combat in the MCU films, the choreography throughout the film is impressive to watch. Every punch and kick thrown can be felt, as the action sequences are admirably planned out. From the boat heist opening scene, the audience is immediately made aware of the scaled-up action, as Captain America truly proves himself a force to be reckoned with.Welcoming the Russo brothers to the MCU, it is instantly obvious why they deserved to stick around. Carefully crafted and marvelously executed, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is easily one of the best Marvel films so far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the best in the MCU,"The film is a spy thriller mixed with some aspects of ""superheroness"" and I think that's what makes this film one of the most respected and loved in the entire MCU. It puts CGI on the side and the Russo Brothers make it a hard hitting, action packed, spectacle. The addition of Black Widow and the relationship and chemistry between her and Steve Rogers is the cherry on top of the cake for me.

A Thrilling Sequel with Heart,"Captain America and The Winter Soldier is a thrilling sequel that delivers the goods to fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chris Evans returns as Captain America, who must team up with Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Anthony Mackie's Falcon to uncover a sinister conspiracy that threatens the safety of the world.The movie is directed by the Russo brothers, who previously helmed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Avengers: Infinity War. They bring the same level of intensity and spectacle to this film, with jaw-dropping action sequences that will leave you breathless.However, what sets Captain America and The Winter Soldier apart from other superhero movies is its emphasis on character development. The film explores the emotional struggles of its heroes, as they confront their own past traumas and face difficult decisions that challenge their values.The chemistry between the cast is also a standout, with Evans and Johansson displaying a deep friendship and Mackie adding a charismatic energy to the mix. Sebastian Stan's performance as The Winter Soldier is also noteworthy, as he brings a tragic complexity to his character.The movie also tackles timely themes, such as government surveillance and the consequences of war. While it is an action-packed blockbuster, it doesn't shy away from exploring deeper issues and providing thoughtful commentary on the state of the world.Overall, Captain America and The Winter Soldier is an excellent addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a thrilling ride that will satisfy fans of the genre, but also offers heart and substance that will resonate with viewers long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Who watches the protectors?,"Thor: The Dark World underwhelmed me. A run of the mill nonsense plot with some epic action and Loki getting some funny lines.Captain America: The Winter Soldier steps up to the plate and throws a curveball.

It strips it bare as a malevolent, infected bug that is not fit for purpose.Captain America has to go off the grid when Nick Fury tells him to trust no one. Shield agents are going rogue. Fury is left impotent and the ultimate question the movie asks. Is Robert Redford's character Alexander Pierce a turncoat?The Russo Brothers hark back to the 1970s conspiracy thrillers when filmmakers focused their attention in wrongdoing at the heart of government in an era of the Watergate scandal. Movies such as Three days of the Condor and All the President's Men, both starred Robert Redford.The Russos wanted to imitate this with a Marvel twist. With the revelations that various governments in recent years in the name of national security have monitored vast amounts of computer databases to track our internet or phone usage. This film has touched a nerve.We still get Marvel action heroics with big action set pieces. Captain America is more questioning but Chris Evans still cannot bring much life to what is a sturdy but dull comic book character.He still gets a better deal than The Winter Soldier who seems to be in deep freeze.

Surprisingly good,"I half wanted to see this, as I'm not the biggest fan of Marvel's film franchise. The first Captain America was less than convincing to say the least, and he's never been anywhere near my favorite comics character. But here he's a badass! The action sequences are pure eye-candy. CGI is kept to a minimum (or at least -- the minimum a superhero movie would allow). The fighting choreography is fast paced and varied, the Cap isn't overpowered or getting his ass handed to him all the time (like movie Wolverine). His powers are developed in an ingenious way and don't deviate from the source material, to please the Avengers fans out there. Chris Evans' performance is solid, even though the Captain can be annoying at times with his naive outlook on today's world. Still, those are only fleeting moments, and overall, the character is quite likable. There's definitely a nice dynamic with Scarlett Johansson, who is convincing as a more fleshed out Black Widow. The tone of the movie is quite different from other Marvel blockbusters: it's much darker, more inspired by high tension thrillers. Obviously, the plot doesn't hold up to any Robert Redford classic, and isn't all that deep but then who would go into a Marvel movie expecting Citizen Kane or the Manchurian Candidate? The weak link here is the antagonist, who is definitely poorly handled. I didn't remember him from the first movie and honestly didn't care about the emotional aspect of his confrontation with the Cap. These appear as relatively minor flaws compared to the rest of the film though, and the highlight really is the action sequences.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Just okay for me.,"I tried not to read much prior, although I saw the high rating and read a few reviews, so maybe my expectations were too high going in. I thought it was better than the first one although I didn't think much of the first one. My biggest complaint is they really could have done with some better editing and cut it down 10-15 minutes as it just dragged in spots. While I very much like character development, some of those scenes just went on a little too long, but more than that character development should slowly build and set the stage of things to come and get you hyped up like in Avengers, however I just didn't get that same feeling here at all. I kind of liked the whole conspiracy gig at first, but at the same time it was a bit of a re-hash as well once things finally came out.The one thing I did really like is Cap was noticeably stronger in this one. Able to fall a long way down and land on solid ground, jump out of a plane from high up and land in the water with no chute, and able to take on a horde of people when seemingly outnumbered. So that was cool and I liked that they beefed him up quite a bit as he was little more than a pompous dork with a shield in Avengers. But my other gripe is I don't think he picked up a single weapon the entire movie. Yeah I get his shield can be an offensive weapon too, but I'm sorry when he's walking up to a horde of gunfire and his only defense is that shield, surely you would think a bullet or two might hit his legs, so that aspect of him only using his shield just kind of bugs me. Even in the first movie and Avengers he used guns to some extent, but not here that I can recall at allFar as other characters, Scarlet / Black Widow being in the movie was pretty much a treat as she's just sexy as hell and you know she'll never get her own movie, so why not put her in as a side kick whenever possible. I liked how they were kind of building something between her and Cap but it just fell flat and didn't go anywhere. Fury also got more air time in this which was good. Far as the Falcon, I really don't know what to think. You get introduced to him early and like Cap know he's a veteran and righteous guy, then don't see much of him and then all of a sudden Cap and Widow crash his pad when they're desperate and then all of a sudden this guy who you know nothing about is stashing a futuristic pair of wings and seemingly a semi super hero as well? What the hell??? It's not that I disliked him but it's just as if he came out of obscurity. They tried to develop his character a little from the beginning but didn't really do a good job IMHO. So kind of a mixed bag there. I liked the winter soldier although he was the one guy I wished got more air time. I like how they developed him and who knows where we'll go from here with all that. Can't really say anymore on that.To sum up, I saw it in IMAX 3D which is really the best possible viewing experience and overall I wasn't wowed over and left thinking it was just decent. I was bored through the first 20+ minutes, it started to get a little better. The whole conspiracy thing started off intriguing (intentionally leaving this vague here) but ultimately I just thought was kind of dumb upon the big reveal and one of those ""Okay, reallyÂ"" moments rather than a ""whoa that was a cool twist!"" they were trying for. The final buildup and battle made for some decent action but was also very straight forward, unoriginal and telegraphed, so no big surprises there which would have been nice. I guess when you leave a movie and end up saying to the buddy you went with ""Well, the trailer for Spider man 2 looked awesome!"" that kind of sums it up. Overall I rate as a 6/10 (5 being an average movie)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Very good, all in all","Entertaining!'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' makes for an enjoyable flick. Chris Evans does great work as the lead character, while Scarlett Johansson gives her most fun to watch performance in the MCU up until this point; it would've been great if she had such a role pre-'The Avengers', so she wouldn't have felt so out of place to me in that.Anthony Mackie and Robert Redford are notable in their respective roles, as is Sebastian Stan - even if, to be honest, his character's connection with the lead didn't quite hit as hard as the film attempts - at least for me. I didn't really believe how his character came about and how Barnes acts throughout, Stan does well though. Samuel L. Jackson is also good.Everything else is exactly what you'd expect from a film of this size. Great effects, entertaining action and a satisfying story.

Another soulless horrible Marvel Movie,"The dialogue is absolutely horrid, the acting uninspired and considering what they have to work with it's no wonder.

"A fine, bold entry in the Marvel canon, if not an entirely successful one.","There's no denying that Marvel Studios is - by most industry standards - almost ridiculously brave. Its president, Kevin Feige, has given the green light to any number of projects, decisions and personnel that would make most studio executives faint from horror. He trusted, for instance, out-of-left-field directors like Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon and Kenneth Branagh to helm his studio's riskiest and most expensive projects. And here comes Captain America: The Winter Soldier - one of the bravest decisions of them all, if not an entirely successful one.After fending off the Chitauri invasion of New York, Steve Rogers (Evans) again tries to settle down to life in a country - and century - he no longer knows. The young man with the old-school values starts working for Nick Fury (Jackson) in S.H.I.E.L.D., an agency meant to protect ordinary people from external threats, but finds himself asking a lot of worrying questions about the way things are being done. ""You're holding a gun to everyone on Earth,"" he frets manfully at Fury, ""and calling it protection.""When it becomes clear that the methods and machines of S.H.I.E.L.D. have been badly compromised, Steve teams up with the two people he's decided he can trust - results-oriented Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) a.k.a. Black Widow and war vet Sam Wilson (Mackie) a.k.a. The Falcon - to get to the bottom of a nefarious conspiracy that threatens to destroy Earth as he has come to know it. Oh, and he's also being chased by another genetically-engineered super-soldier: the titular Winter Soldier, who might possess a secret or two of his own.There's an enormous amount to love about Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It is, truthfully, the boldest entry in Marvel's canon yet, and not simply because it dares to bring superheroes into the gritty, twisty world of spy thrillers. That, by the way, is a great touch, particularly in a really quite spectacular car chase through the streets of Washington D.C., one that culminates in a literally heart-stopping encounter in Steve's shadow-lit apartment.What the film really dares to do is shake up the mythos of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. Across several films now, Nick Fury has emerged as the sardonic but unquestionable defender of what's good in the world. It's somehow fitting that the most red-blue-and-white of superheroes should be the one who uncovers all the shades of grey. It's a storyline that upsets the comfortable narrative of S.H.I.E.L.D. and its enforcers to date but also disrupts the way ahead (including, intriguingly enough, for Marvel's companion television series, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.).Directors Anthony and Joe Russo - best known for their work on cult TV sitcom Community - demonstrate a great flair for character development. This is a talky and occasionally silly picture, its plot getting more outlandish as it unravels, but the Russos make up for the occasional deficits in logic with a lot of heart and depth. Steve's attempts to battle his survivor guilt allow him to connect with both Natasha and Sam, and there are some quietly effective moments when it becomes evident how much Natasha has come to care for Fury. Steve also gets the chance to re-connect with a couple of familiar faces from his long- buried past, which allows him to come somewhat painfully to terms with his strange, new-found life.The film fares less well in terms of its unwieldy script, which marshals its unlikely elements together quite effectively but is - at the end of the day - formulaic and a tough sell. The big conspiracy lying at the broken heart of S.H.I.E.L.D. manages to be both predictable and ridiculous. It's a narrative twist that feels a few decades too old, like Captain Rogers himself: a relic of a certain type of Cold War thriller on which this film is clearly modelled (think All The President's Men), rather than an idea that better captures the nebulous shifts of the world's current political climate.The film also frequently begs the question - more so than Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World did - 'Where the heck are the rest of the Avengers?' It beggars belief that only Steve and Natasha are reacting to the events of this film, which are catastrophic and earth-shaking enough to suggest that their old team-mates should really have popped in at some point.The cast goes a long way towards making up for the hokier parts of the script. On paper, Steve is a rather one-note good guy, fighting for old- fashioned ideals in an unrecognisably debauched world. But Evans gives him heart and creates a huge amount of sympathy for the shield-wielding Captain America, particularly in a surprisingly emotional last-act confrontation with the Winter Soldier. This film also gives both Johansson and Jackson more to do than in any other Marvel movie to date, and they're both so electrifying that you'll continue to wonder why they haven't yet received their own flagship movies.The decision to cast Robert Redford - still hopelessly debonair at 77 years of age - as Alexander Pierce, Fury's commanding officer and confidant, is a canny one. It's a nice callback to the 1970s thrillers that made Redford's name and no doubt inspired the grit and feel of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Redford delights in the role, and helps make it appear more complex than it really is.When it comes down to it, Captain America: The Winter Soldier can leave a little something to be desired when taken on its own merits. Frequently, its grand ambitions outstrip the logic and power of its script. As an extension of what has become the world's biggest franchise of blockbuster films, however, it's an unmitigated success. It's brainy, dark, and boldly rips apart the entire underlying narrative of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In that sense, at least, there's no doubt that this is one of the finest blockbusters you'll see this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Team Cap,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an absolute masterpiece of a superhero movie. Directed by the Russo brothers and starring Chris Evans, this film not only delivers on incredible action and suspenseful sequences, but it also examines deeper themes about trust, loyalty, and the true cost of freedom.The movie follows our favorite super-soldier Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, as he works alongside fellow Avenger Black Widow and new ally Sam Wilson, aka the Falcon. Together, they uncover a conspiracy within SHIELD, leading to a heart-pumping conflict against the titular villain, the Winter Soldier.What truly sets The Winter Soldier apart from other superhero movies is its impressive storytelling. The plot is tightly woven and keeps the audience on the edge of their seat throughout the entire film. There are plenty of twists and turns that not only make the story engaging, but also raise important questions about the role of government and the sacrifices made in the name of security.The film's action sequences are breathtaking and incredibly well-choreographed. Captain America's fight scenes are both thrilling and emotional, and the fight between him and the Winter Soldier is one of the best superhero battles ever captured on screen.Chris Evans gives his best performance as Captain America, bringing depth and emotional weight to his character. Scarlett Johansson is fantastic as Black Widow, showing off her exceptional range as a character. Sebastian Stan also delivers a chilling performance as the mysterious and dangerous Winter Soldier.Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a true masterpiece in the world of superhero movies. From its superb storytelling to its fantastic action set pieces and standout performances from its talented cast, the film is the epitome of cinematic excellence. It is a movie that not only satisfies its comic book roots but is also thought-provoking and emotionally resonant, leaving a lasting impact on audiences long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up. 3D technology appears to be very lacking for fast close action fighting sequences.The biggest fault found in The Winter Soldier is that it does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies.

Strong physically, stronger in his principles. A hero who does not give up on anything, much less injustice.Scarlett Johansson, Samuel Jackson, Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan are all incredible.The combat moments with incredible choreography are also a highlight.Not in vain, despite 35 MCU movies and many other series, we always remember ""Winter Soldier"" as the best.It is not a perfect movie, of course, but for Marvel fans it is in that place that even after years, it is still relevant.Unfortunately, Marvel has not been up to par again, much less in recent years, and movies like these are just nostalgia.A real shame.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still very good,"I never saw this one in cinemas, instead watching it for the first time in 2016 right before the release of the third Captain America movie, Civil War. This is the first time watching it since then, and like revisiting Guardians of the Galaxy 1 recently (another 2014 release), I was happy to see The Winter Soldier still holding up well. It combines paranoid spy thriller stuff with the usual large-scale MCU action well, but I do think it's at its best when it keeps the action grounded. I quite love how the sci-fi elements are down-played here, mostly saved, in a way, for Guardians Vol. 1, which was the most sci-fi-heavy MCU movie at the time of its release.It's just great to see what looks like real explosions and car crashes, and such ordinary locations used for much of the action (until the final act). I feel like they were trying to replicate the action of The Dark Knight here, and they pulled it off pretty well. It's also very reminiscent of the Bourne movies... but yeah, they do end up doing the usual MCU thing of making things blow up to a pretty ridiculous level for the climax. This and Shang-Chi are the two big ones where I loved the style of action they went for in their respective first two acts, but found the action near the end to be not quite as impressive, even if it's ""technically"" bigger and more spectacular.Still, the ending works well enough here, and the film does do a solid job of setting up the world-ending stakes stuff and building up to it. But I think the film's at its best when it's just Captain America on his own, with only a handful of people he can trust. The first two acts are largely great, and then I think the third act is still good, but not quite on the same level.It's also a bit weird how many people get shot here, with bullets definitely hurting some more than others, but even then, there is a sense of real stakes here, for much of the movie. And I think pacing-wise and when it comes to action, it's much stronger than either the first or third Captain America movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Best of All Marvel Films to Date,"In fact, this film is what I secretly wished every other Marvel film was like. It has been since the first ""Iron Man"" that everything is done so absolute: from the top, dark, brooding action down to great character development.Steve Rogers is adapting to today. Meanwhile, Nick Fury is just about to find out about a dirty little (but huge) secret inside S.H.I.E.L.D. Trying to figure out what is going on, the Captain and Natascha Romanof are the only ones he can trust (along with a few others). And when the lines are crossed and all secrets are revealed, there comes a much greater threat than what was expected and even Captain America himself finds his dilemmas on the fairs of justice and evil.Captain America before this movie was the least progressed Marvel hero. The main reason that happened is the first movie being called ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". I mean, seriously, we all just sat through that flick just to return to see the Avengers.But the directors (the Russo brothers) took that poor constructed storyline and wounded structure, and made it work on much farther levels. The continuing narrative demanded greater personalities and more accessible dialogue and, of course, better action. I was stunned by all three.It has been said before, so I am not the first to point it out, but this is actually the first comic book movie since ""The Dark Knight"" that deals with political interests, friendship and past causes to today's expense. It brings all of that together displayed equally and fashionably. It also manages to make us care for lesser attended characters, like Captain America himself, who is know done properly (no offense Marvel).So if you liked Avengers, you'll love this one.

Roaring action and fun,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier turns out to be about some guy named The Winter Soldier, rather than Cap himself being a winter soldier (you know, because he was in deep freeze). Well, with that mystery solved, I settled in to watch what has become a rather typical comic-book movie: intelligent, evocative, thrilling, and entertaining.Here's your quick-and-dirty summary to set the scene; comic-book nerds out there, please correct me if I'm wrong, because that'll prove someone's reading this other than me. The movie takes place after the events in The Avengers. Captain America (Chris Evans) is trying to assimilate into the present day, and he leads an elite forces team. In the opening scenes, his team, aided by Black Widow (Scarlet Johanson), infiltrate a SHIELD boat that's been commandeered by terrorists who have a beef with SHIELD. Cap and the Gang roust out the bad guys, but Cap is somewhat surprised to see Black Widow grabbing info from hard drives. He's soon briefed by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) that SHIELD is involved in a huge defense program called Project Insight: three enormous helicarriers that are linked to spy satellites, the better to knock out threats before they happen. Shades of Minority Report.Fury has joined forces with the World Security Council and its leader, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) for this enterprise, and true to comic trope, there's soon skulduggery afoot. It's not hard to see who's treacherous and who's not, but that's part of the fun of these movies, anyway. As a result of the cloak-and-dagger atmosphere, Captain America and Black Widow, along with new superhero Falcon (Anthony Mackie), who sports an exoskeleton with wings and weaponry.The movie forces Steve Rogers, aka Cap, to face parts of his past that he might be better off leaving alone. His girl from back in the 1940s, Peggy Carter, is convalescing in a home for retired people, Steve's apparently last living link to that past. But Steve's straight-arrow, black-and-white moral compass seems oddly out of sync with the gray areas of the present, which makes Black Widow a great match for him. You know, opposites and all of that.This is a movie in which secrets upon secrets are revealed, like layers of an onion and often just as odorous. Anyway, although it's not tough for Cap and Black Widow to determine who the bad guys are, stopping said villains is another problem altogether. This leads to several fantastic action scenes, very well choreographed and a treat to watch - even in 2D, or perhaps especially in 2D.I sat, by necessity, in the second row for this movie, which meant that my head was inclined as if I were talking to a giraffe with an overactive pituitary gland. It also meant that I needed to focus harder on the action before me, because at that distance the illusion of the celluloid tale can more easily be broken. This movie captivated me throughout, pardon the pun, and it's a terrific vehicle for both Captain America and Black Widow, not to mention the slippery Nick Fury himself.I did wonder, as the plot centers around something that could endanger the entire world, where was the rest of the Avengers squad? Tony Stark is mentioned once (but not Iron Man), and we see a portrait of his father, but that's it for connections to The Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, and Iron Man. If the world's about to be harmed, you'd think that would rise to the importance level of those guys, right? Okay, that's nitpicking.It's true that the movie's plot is familiar and that many of the characters, being based on comic-book characters themselves, lack real depth. But these problems are minor, because the action scenes - hey, this is a comic-book movie, not some weepy melodrama! - is so exhilarating. Great care has been taken to curate the Marvel Universe in cinematic form, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not only a fine standalone picture but also a elegant lead for the next Avengers movie - not to mention future Captain America movies.

The Winter Soldier surely surpassed them.People consider Captain America to be freedom and justice encapsulated into a super-human body. As S.H.I.E.L.D (the organization Captain America aids) becomes more and more powerful, people with alternate perspectives begin to corrupt the freedoms of the public. When times turn dark, it's hard to see who's really on which side.Sharing numerous parallels with modern society (and past cultures), it introduces how passive and compliant citizens are to governments that readily take advantage, commit heinous crimes and infringe on the very rights these respective nations are built upon. People are resistant to change when they have a pleasing, comfortable lifestyle.

A game changer within the MCU,"#MCUrewatch. Captain America: The Winter Soldier really feels as a game changer within the MCU. After the huge success of Avengers, the subsequent two films (Iron Man 3 and Thor 2) kinda felt repetitive. The MCU was already feeling predictable in the early stages of Phase 2. But then came Captain America 2 (and followed by an even better film; Guardians of the Galaxy). What makes Cap 2 great is first of all the great work of the Russo brothers as directors. No wonder they became the go to directors for Marvel. How they stage action sequences is fantastic (especially the Fury assassination and the tense elevator scene). The film feels more like a very strong action thriller than a superhero film. Secondly, the Russos managed to make the somehow dull Steve Rogers and interesting character. Sure, he's still no charmer such as Tony Stark but his dilemma (a man out of time, struggling with themes as trust and following orders) is worked out quite well in this film. The overall feeling of paranoia (great casting of 70's paranoia film icon Redford) is present and feels makes for an unnerving feeling.

The heroes must take on a looming existential conspiracy that threatens the whole world... There is also a major discovery of the true identity of someone thought to have been lost long ago.

Captain America is back,It is always pleasure to watch a marvel series. And this one rocks with Chris Evans carrying out his another fight against evil.

Entertaining and Action-packed,"Oh man. I am so fired. Wow this movie was awesome. It was full of action scenes. The fighting, shooting, and car chasing scenes were well-handled, entertaining, and intense. The Winter Soldier looked so cool and threatening. I loved the scene where he sat in the dark, as well as the first couple scenes where he first appeared. He gave such ominous presence. The story became more complex and thrilling than the First Avenger. It was surprisingly emotional toward the end as Cap interacted more with Winter Soldier. Overall, the movie was incredibly entertaining and action packed. Had a great time. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Bright, Noisy Take on the Political Potboiler","A nice rummage through the genre bin in search of a hybrid that hadn't yet seen the light of day: the action / adventure / superhero / political thriller. It's enjoyable enough, if a touch on the shallow, superficial side. Though it runs a bit long, I don't feel like the drama was given quite enough time to simmer and skeptics will see right through an early plot twist involving a major death (or two). The action scenes look and feel great, though, with an emphasis on physical effects in lieu of CG that pays big dividends. Scarlett Johansson gets a lot of screen time, much more than I'd expected, but feels purposeful and at-home, where Anthony Mackie's equal turn as Falcon seems forced and irrelevant. Of course, Chris Evans is vanilla but strong in the leading role and Sebastian Stan is appropriately cool-looking, if slightly under-explored, as his momentary nemesis the Winter Soldier. They probably should've kept the mask on longer, though; he seems far less menacing and visually striking without. I'm really struggling to understand why this didn't feel more substantial than it did. Even Cap's most appealing personality quirk - his disconnection from the trappings of modern society - gets little more than a cursory glance. Good but middle-of-the-pack in the Marvel family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The best stand-alone MCU film,"One of the best sequels of all time, and definitely one of the top five comic book films ever made.Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is a superior sequel in every sense, but mostly in the thrilling espionage direction The Russo Brothers take.A lot of MCU films struggle with a lot of separate yet similar problems.Consequences in the film don't have rippling effects in the MCU despite the film emphasising they doA lot of uninteresting and one-dimensional villains with bad or barely any motivationUnjustified sequels only for sequels' sakeNegligence of previous filmsInability to tell a self-contained story that serves the arcs of its main characters and expands upon themNo unique vision or personalityI believe this film is able to avoid all those MCU issues and deliver an incredible political action thriller that happens to be set in the MCU.What stands out to me the most is the direction, which felt necessary at this point in the MCU, one that felt fresh and intriguing. Also, the action in this film is a huge step-up from anything we had seen before in the MCU, and became a blueprint for every film after it. It's really underrated how much you can feel the force behind every punch and every time the shield is thrown.Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce is incredible and the HYDRA revelation is executed really well, and is a game changer for the future of the MCU, without it feeling like it was done at the expense of the arcs of the main characters.It's able to balance the parasite that is growing inside of S. H. I. E. L. D. and what it means for every character, as well as the menacing introduction of The Winter Soldier.The third & action-packed final act may be a bit overdone and cliched, but the fight between Steve and Bucky is able to hold it all together really well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Epic Sequel That Raises The Bar,"It's ironic that with the week that The Falcon & The Winter Soldier came to Disney+ the next film in my Marvel review series is the one that saw both characters debut - Captain America The Winter Soldier. I watched the film today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Steve Rogers trying to adapt to the modern world working for SHIELD when a mysterious enemy called The Winter Soldier targets him.Main Character
Chris Evans once again plays Captain America AKA Steve Rogers and he is fantastic in this film, he has transitioned from the naive boy scout and is a really well developed character here. Evans has a charm and charisma that really works for the character and makes him so likeable but you see how his ideals really come out and conflict with this modern world that he has become a part of. He is great in the action scenes and provides the emotion needed for a really great super hero.Supporting Characters
Scarlett Johansson plays Black Widow again and she is also great here and a spotlight is really placed on her here more then in previous films and she shines. Her character is given really great development and you see how her friendship with Rogers has changed and adapted since The Avengers and it makes her the most interesting she has been in the films here. Samuel L Jackson is always great as Nick Fury and he is the same here, his character is examined closely here and the dynamic between his methods and Rogers believes is highlighted and explored in an interesting way. He is also part of one of my favourite MCU action scenes in this film so there is that. Robert Redford plays Alexander Pierce and I always find it crazy that one of his last roles is in a Marvel film and he is also really good, he is just a solid hand in his role and he seems to be having a good time. This is the first time we see Anthony Mackie as The Falcon and I actually forgot just how good he is here, he is a really nice character here and his down to earth nature really fits well alongside the Avengers we already see on screen. Sebastian Stan plays The Winter Soldier and this is one of the best villains in the MCU, he is mysterious and a really awesome threat to the heroes and feels like he is truly capable of taking out Captain America.Story
The story for this film is really great, the whole character of Captain America gets explored in depth and this film has a clear message to it which it shows in a mature and unique way. Then there is the interesting stuff involving the villain of the film and what that means, with twists that are genuinely surprising it mixes to have a story that will keep you engaged throughout.Script
The script is also fantastic, a really good mix of humour and drama. This film is funny when it needs to be but it also hits some emotional moments that feel deserved and like they actually have weight to them. The film keeps you on your toes with its developments and it is written very well in this case which rises it above other films in its genre.Style
This films style is one of the best parts of the film. The action scenes are some of the best you will see in not only comic book films but also action films in general, this film made Cap one of the truly best fighters in the MCU and that is great to see. Hell, every character is great in their action sequences and they all feel so different that it never gets dull.Overall
Overall, this is a truly epic film. The Winter Soldier has intrigue, great characters, great action scenes and twists and turns. This is one of the best MCU films there are and comic book film fans and just film fans alike will love it.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America : Kick-Ass,"Better movie then the 1st part. More action, more interesting story, more Captain's kick-ass fighting against all characters in the movie. Chris Evans is muscle man without serious acting. This is best movie role for his acting talent. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is perfect for this role, but for example she has talent for serious movie like in The Prestige. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in this movie have (in my opinion) best ""running away with car"" scene ever. All other characters not very important. Robert Redford as present Hydra leader has role of some business man that can do what ever he want until he dies. Falcon has cool wings but Iron Man can fly without wings...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Political Thriller makes this a fun outing for even the non superhero fans,"This is the best of the Phase 2 Marvel movies. It's what ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" should have been. While its definitely the most serious of the movies, it still manages to have little moments of subtle humor that we've all loved since ""Iron Man."" Nick Fury plays his biggest part yet in this movie, and Black Widow is an important factor in the plot as well. Even though this is a superhero movie, it's not just turn off your brain and enjoy. It has a complex plot that you have to pay attention to. As always stay halfway through the credits, and until the end. Both scenes are extremely important to the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

a step in the right direction,"I initially enjoyed the first Captain American, though, after seeing this, I see how it pales in comparison.The Winter Soldier, while it has great action set pieces, solid acting and enough twists to keep people guessing, also features a retro-spy thriller plot that was refreshing in this particular context.Captain American is under attack. Not just by the Winter Soldier, but by the forces who he is fighting on the behalf of. This leads to some moral questioning and some re-evaluating what he stands for and why.This sort of introspection is a welcome reprieve from wall to wall action. While The Winter Soldier has plenty of that, it offers a plot that borderlines on The Captain's paranoia, which, as it turns out, is well placed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Highly Entertaining,"After commanding a successful rescuing mission of hostages from pirates in a ship, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) meets Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) very upset since Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) had different objectives from his. Nick explains that he does not trust anybody but discloses the latest top secret project from SHIELD called ""Operation Insight"" that will launch three aircraft carries to the space linked by a satellite to protect the world. There is an attempt against Nick by the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and Nick goes to Steve's apartment and delivers a flash memory to Steve. He tells that SHIELD is compromised with infiltrated HIDRA agents; then Nick is badly wounded by three shots and goes on surgery.Secretary Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) asks Steve why Nick was in his apartment but he refuses to tell. Soon Steve is considered traitor and hunted down by the SHIELD agents and he teams up with Natasha and Sam ""Falcon ""Wilson (Anthony Mackie). Now they investigate the reason why Nick was chased and they discover a lethal secret plotted by the HIDRA.""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a highly entertaining adventure with non-stop action. The predictable story is not bad and the special effects are top-notch. Chris Evans seems to be a juicer but is a great Captain America; Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johansson and there is nothing else to say; Falcon has great lines with humor; Emily Van Camp is cut and the villains are great.

Great movie,"This movie was absolutely great in my opinion; it might even be my favourite Marvel movie at this moment.The beginning already sets a bit of a mood for this movie. We see Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, and he is starting to get used to this world, the 21st century. He is a charming and a bit quirky guy. Especially the relationship between him and Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow, is absolutely amazing! She is a strong female character and that is so great to see in a superhero movie.The movie soon turns into a conspiracy spy movie esque setting, we see old characters returning. Basically: S**t just goes down.At some point there was a bit too much action in my opinion. Not overwhelmingly much so as it distracts you, but still, a teensy bit too much. The soundtrack is great though, the characters are amazing; it is just a pleasure to watch it.No spoilers here, so just go and watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It has solid cast and action, but cautious delivery of espionage premise, persistent flaw of plausibility and shortage of humor make the movie rather uninspiring.","Improving on live action stunts and using a more contemporary plot, Captain America: The Winter Soldiers is a better movie than its prequel, although it's somewhat dry in humor. The movie is what one might expect in a superhero flick, great explosive action scenes, and perhaps more with its spy thriller aspect. However, the chemistry between characters isn't maximized, the humor is severely lacking and with a social commentary element of national security, the movie could've done more instead of resorting to unenterprising conclusion.The plot revolves around espionage, a modern subject which strings together conspiracy theory and relatable cause. This gives the original comic identity a fitting rejuvenation of modern day interpretation, but it lacks depth and only scratches the surface of the issue. Enemy of the State from more than a decade ago did a better, more harrowing portrayal of information surveillance. The movie is also vexed by several action movie flaws, such as characters conveniently meet or flee in certain scenes, quizzical plot device and a rather clichÃ© use of indoctrination.Chris Evans plays the role of Captain America / Steve Rogers pretty well. He's not a simple minded patriot rather a man given the position of hero and yet still has his doubts. The cast of Evans is a good choice, he looks suitable for the character without trying to be a superhero. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff delivers as the femme fatale, although this might be a restriction as well. There are some scenes where the character could be more genuine or emotional, but bravado remains a more prevalent trait.Anthony Mackie as Falcon / Sam Wilson does a proper job of creating a partner persona for Captain America. Even though he's still in sidekick role, the character as a veteran and counselor for others with PTSD can be developed further. He shows some compatibility with Captain America, plus the bond of soldiers is a good foundation. Samuel L. Jackson is undoubtedly charismatic as Nick Fury. There's an imposing and sly atmosphere he brought as the leader role.Despite the decent cast, they don't have much affinity. Evans and Johansson look awkward, granted their on-screen relationship isn't a romantic one, but it doesn't feel that they possess much sense of camaraderie. The jokes between characters just fail to entertain; they are written in mediocrity and delivered with the same level of lackluster nature. It tries to display more personal appeal or witty charm, but doesn't really excel in either.The stunts are definitely better than most superhero or action movies. Instead of relying too much on CG, the movie opts for faster more aggressive live action fight scenes. This is a great direction due to raw intensity it presents during the action; the way the Captain's shield is intriguing as well. It doesn't mean that it's short on CG spectacles as there are many mandatory shootouts and explosions throughout the movie, and they are also appropriately translated to 3D, the computer generated effects are simply used in moderation effectively.Captain America: The Winter brings great solid cast and mix of action and CG, but cautious delivery of espionage premise, persistent flaw of plausibility and shortage of humor make the movie rather uninspiring.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A sequel well worth watching...,"""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" was a step up from the 2011 movie ""Captain America: The First Avenger"".This is a great combination of action and special effects, and actually spiced up with a proper storyline that proved entertaining and also has the audience at a bit of guessing game as well. The plot line was very nice and well thought through, and it had several layers to it, which made for a more complex and enjoyable movie experience.The action sequences are great and they are filmed equally great. Lots of great fighting, adrenalin-filled action and testosterone.The acting throughout the movie was good as well. And it was actually surprisingly nice to see Robert Redford in a role such as the one he has in this movie.One thing I don't understand, though, is that you have a guy running around with a shield, why doesn't the goons and villains just shoot at his exposed legs? No, they have to shoot directly at an impenetrable shield of course. It just doesn't make any sense.Ah well, for a movie in the super hero genre, then the Captain America movies are actually some of the better and more enjoyable, as it is fairly devoid of super-human powers.""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" provides good entertainment and if you enjoyed the first movie, then you should most definitely watch this one as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid Follow Up to Develop Story with Real Implications Mixed In,"This is one that I believe I I caught it on DVD ahead of seeing the next movie in the series. I liked where they took the story that first time around. I'll be honest, I didn't remember a lot though until rewatching with Jaime as we head toward Infinity War and Endgame.What I like about the Captain America movies are grounding them with real political issues. We are dealing with spies and conspiracy theories. Hydra didn't die in the past like Captain America (Chris Evans) thought. He is working with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson). They also add Falcon (Anthony Mackie). They're pitted against a new villain with ties to Captain, The Winter Soldier.Aside from a solid story, our acting is good. I'd say they fit the characters. This again is a CGI fest. I had some issues there. The movie is still good though as a slightly more grounded super hero. I think this is a good, entertaining popcorn movie.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good,"Captain America again has a shield the size of a large pizza. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods, and there are fisticuffs back and forth. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is a gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people, but it's also intelligent, heartfelt and riveting. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not too bad, but action too unbelievable and story a little far taken. A lost opportunity.","Action wise, this is a good movie, but the problems start here when you have e.g. three heli carriers going down directly in the city or exactly where they lifted of, respectively. Or the very unbelievable falcon. On the other side, you have ordinary gunfights, so this is quite far stretched. Then we have the story around Hydra, which is completely implausible, added by Caps old friend Bucky. Btw, the title of the movie ""The Winter Soldier"" is quite misleading, cause he is only a quite minor part of the story. So, regarding this, you get the usual Hollywood big style action and effects show, but way, way exaggerated, and a quite lame story. The interesting thing may be the underlying message, if there is really one. By this, I mean the fact that the whole Shield structure was undermined and by this doing the exact opposite of what if was intended to. If this is so, there could be hidden critics to US policy, but I wouldn't call this for sure. If so, Cap would have to fight the system itself in the next part. That would be something! Taken this aside, good, but predictable standard Hollywood action. Nothing to get too excited about. Which is sad, because in this Captain America incarnation Evans got better, the transition to the modern world worked out, the combination with Captain America has a lot of potential and you start to develop a relation to Cap because he is (almost) on his own, has to fight the odds and doesn't feel like a invincible guy, you can see that he is ""enhanced"", but still human. Especially the fight in the elevator is great and good old style action. Instead they focus again on high tech and simply go to far with all this heli carrier, falcon and ""kill them all"" thing. That's why it is a lost opportunity.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Captian America saved by story,"I wasn't expecting much story in the movie. I was expecting some world destruction like ""Man of Steel"" or ""Thor: The dark world"". But this movie is much better in terms of story, characters, humor and action.This movie has no jaw-dropping special effects of awesome CGI imaginations, which is good because we had enough of that already. Instead the scrip rely on humor to make the action scenes more interesting. The writers have kept the story interesting so that you don't just yawn through the talking waiting for the action scenes. Of course the movie has usual, predictable, lucky escapes and some logical loop holes here and there, but that doesn't distract much to reject the movie before it ends.Overall, it's a good movie, worth the cinema ticket and some way adds to the marvel universe that's developing pretty quickly.

A step up in quality...,"Another year, another collection of Marvel films, and fresh off the starting blocks is this sequel to the surprisingly decent First Avenger. A tour de force of action and humour, this is Marvel studios at their best. Chris Evans does a great job of playing Captain America, giving him the charisma and soul that he seemed to lack in the Avengers. Johansson was convincing as Black Widow, and seems to be getting noticeably better at acting with every film she does. Samuel L Jackson provides old school relief as Nick Fury, and has a much more substantial role this time round. The only disappointment for me was the Winter Soldier himself, who after being introduced as a mysterious and seemingly indestructible and lethal antagonist, gets watered down massively prior to the conclusion.

He and a fellow Avenger callled Black Widow become fugitives, and try to bring down a sinister conspiracy.
The unquenchable thirst for advancements in technology to solve potential conflicts is the main theme.

The best MCU movie,"The first twenty minutes or so of this movie establish so much so well, it feels like the Marvel franchise has finally grown up.The opening scene takes place around the Mall in Washington D.C. as Captain Rogers takes in his morning run, lapping a young ex-soldier several times. When the two finally speak, there's a grounded sense of community between the two stemming from their dual tours of duty in wars separated by decades. It's the physical detail that Sam brings up about the over-softness of mattresses contrasted against the reality of their sleeping arrangements in the theaters of war that sells it so well. Rogers and Sam have this immediate connection because of that shared experience that makes Rogers showing up to a group therapy session for veterans instantly believable. He's not showing up because he's Captain America and it's what Captain America would do. He's showing up because he's got his own scars and wonders if spending time with others who have similar experiences could help.That's the kind of grounded reality that storytelling should reach for. It's not about being grounded in a recognizable physical reality but in a recognizable emotional and human reality. The movie around that emotional core is still ridiculous with a super soldier created by a magic blue serum, another soldier with a metal arm that's been repeatedly frozen over the decades, flying aircraft carriers, and a suit with jets and wings, but because it pays attention to the human element so well that crazy stuff gains a more entertaining dimension because it's at service to an actual story dealing with characters that feel real.What's most interesting about the film's construction is that it uses the human element so well in a paranoid thriller context. The presence of Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is no accident. His presence calls to mind Three Days of the Condor and All the President's Men.Captain America is sent on a mission into the middle of the ocean to rescue some SHIELD operative on a boat that's been taken over by French-Algerian pirates. Cap succeeds, of course, and his partner Natasha (Black Widow) is there with a secondary purpose, to steal information from the ship. Rogers rankles at this undermining of his authority over the mission and confronts SHIELD director Nick Fury about it. Fury insists that secrets are necessary in order for him to effectively lead the organization and that Rogers is going to have to get used to compartmentalization in the modern world. After Fury brings some concerns to Pierce, a member of SHIELD's governing body the Council, Fury gets attacked on the streets of D.C. He escapes to Rogers' apartment, gets shot through a wall, and Rogers gives chase to the assailant, The Winter Soldier, who is actually Bucky Barnes, Rogers' best friend from childhood who had been brainwashed into being a killing machine.Rogers and Natasha begin to suspect that SHIELD has been compromised and after a couple of instances of SHIELD proving that beyond a reasonable doubt, the two go on the run. They essentially go back in time in finding the original bunker that SHIELD operated out of, inhabited by the computerized brain of Dr. Zola, the Swiss scientist who had helped Hydra in the first Captain America movie. Hydra, he reveals, had infiltrated SHIELD decades before, sowing chaos around the world and taking control of the organization as a whole.This is one of the only times Marvel dealt with geopolitical issues in any meaningful way. The idea that an intelligence apparatus that nominally represents the will of the people is actually deeply rooted in its own version of state interests feels almost ripped from the headlines. The idea of outsourcing killing decisions to a program and using drones feels just the same. And yet, the movie never gets bogged down with it. It takes a side against these things and plows forward, understanding that it is more action movie than political treatise. What this does is create an interesting canvas on which to tell this story, lending credence to the emotions that Rogers is going through as he sees an organization that had earned his trust fall before his eyes.Of course, Rogers decides to fight it out, and he recruits Sam, the Falcon, as well as Natasha. We get a great extended action sequence across three helicarriers as they rise against a ticking clock that the heroes are fighting to beat. It really comes to a head on the third ship when the Winter Soldier and Captain America face off. These aren't just two people on the opposite sides of good and bad at the dictates of a screenwriter, these are people with pasts and ideals that throw them in conflict. But, instead of wanting to see Rogers simply win against Bucky, Rogers needs to save Bucky from the fate he's found himself in. It's a non-traditional way to end a large action sequence, and it works really well because of the emotional work done early. It all fits as well because of the thematic underpinnings. Rogers is haunted by his past and worried about his future. Bucky is a physical manifestation of that worry and concern. He was the friend he lost in battle, but he also represents a more hopeful future if Rogers can reach him.Action scenes overall range from being filmed too close to coherent within that shaky-cam box. They're edited really well, but I just wish the Russo's has pulled the camera back a bit more and kept it a bit more still from time to time. There's a visual thing that feeds into everything as well. Captain America begins the movie in blue suit (as he's doing SHIELD's dirty work without realizing it), but when he decides to fight SHIELD in order to reclaim his own ideals, he grabs the World War II era suit in the Smithsonian, fighting his final battle in the good ole red, white, and blue.It's intelligently assembled, emotionally assured, and overall a very good time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Not just a comic book movie, but also a political action-thriller!","With Rogers, Fury, and Romanoff having already been previously established, Joe and Anthony Russo do a pretty damn good job directing the expansion of these characters by providing more depth to understanding their actions and how they will affect future stories â of course, this is a comic book film so there is always going to be some underdeveloped characters there to advance the plot or deliver snappy one-liners.I enjoyed Sam Jackson as Nick Fury more in this film than previously, I felt he had a stronger presence this time around. I never quite understood what Nick Fury does, I mean think about it. He assembled The Avengers and all, he sometimes gives them orders but other than that? He always felt somewhat underdeveloped to me, like a character who could only exist in the presence of The Avengers and who would disappear and reappear as they came and went. That's why I love what they did with his character in this film, validating Nick Fury as a main staple in the Marvel Cinematic Universe among the big boys.Chris Evans is pretty much as you'd expect from what you've seen him do, he truly was the best casting choice for Captain America. Is he amazing, acting wise? â No, not by a mile. Is he good enough? -Yes definitely. This is a comic book movie, we're not exactly going for an Oscar for best leading actor. That being said, Evans portrays the earnestness of Captain America's black and white moral with a decent enough finesse.When we meet Rodgers in the film he has matured since The Avengers, in The Avengers he was almost immediately thrown in to this huge task of saving the world along with the others after just being awakened. Here he has had time and is now stronger, faster, wiser, he understands modern technology (to an extent) and he is now also equipped with better fighting skills. All around he is basically now a much more refined soldier. Whilst having brought up Cap's improved fighting skills, just a quick FYI, this movie is clearly the most superior Marvel film yet when it comes to the fighting choreography. Just splendid.The film introduces a band of new characters, some heroes, some foes. But all of whom play a more significant role than previous Marvel films have given their side characters, which helps create a more layered and conceivably real film (and cinematic universe).The Winter Soldier's presence is terrifying when it comes to any action sequence, Sebastian Stan really does do a remarkable job holding his own in the intense fight scenes. The connection between Rogers and The Winter Soldier is dealt with true care and excels the story of Captain America from the first film brilliantly.I have to mention something that really caught me by surprise. This is not just your average comic book movie, this is also a political action- thriller. And one that is done well at that, it's hard making a good comic book movie and the Russo's did it with elements of a political action-thriller. That alone, earns it a spot in the top 3 Marvel's Cinematic Universe films for me so far. Tonally, The Winter Soldier is dark. Grimm. I've noticed this seems to be the tone aimed for by Marvel in phase 2, Thors sequel was ""darker"" than it's predecessor as well. The film raises a lot of deep-seated questions about the government and the soldiers of war while also taking Rogers on an emotional journey.What still baffles me is the fact that the Russo brothers come from a background of directing television comedies such as Arrested Development and Community, I remember seeing the directorial announcement Marvel/Disney put out about bringing them on to direct and I was instantaneously turned off by the idea. Don't get me wrong, I love Arrested Development and Community and I think what they did there was amazing bit I just couldn't see the reason they's put them up to this. It's extraordinary how well they handle a big budget action blockbuster from cinematography to pacing. They do infuse their own style of comedy with fun references and a cameo other than Stan Lee, functioning properly within the confines of the tone and story. The score was also awesome, not the most memorable ever but awesome nonetheless. Henry Jackman composes an adrenaline pumping score that sets the right mood every time.Now, I did have some gripes with the film and the main one being this one.The Winter Soldier does not address the whereabouts of other heroes or where we are in terms of the time line of the other movies. Why can't Captain America call on Tony Stark to help him out or even Hawkeye who is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D. himself. It's even illogical for them not to receive a call from Cap given what Cap learns and how vital that info would be to anyone who is working or has ever worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. This is a recurring problem we have seen throughout Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. Marvel Studios needs to acknowledge this hiccup if they want us to continue to believe all of these characters live in the same universe together, otherwise the viewers will drop their suspension of disbelief. You cannot exclude these characters once you have opened Pandora's Box.Marvel Studios has hit this one out of the ball park with yet another gripping adaptation for fans to enjoy. It is the perfect set up for future films and at the same time it increases the value of its predecessors.Be sure to stick around for the credits because there are two after credit scenes. All things considered, this film will receive a strong 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Little Better Than the First But Still Not Buying Into Captain America,"I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. Hopefully that prevents my review from suffering many unhelpful votes from Marvel fans just because I think Man of Steel and TDK trilogy are more watchable, more interesting, and I felt more involved in those movies.This movie had its moments and to be honest, nothing is really wrong with the movie. It does what Captain America is about. Maybe that is the problem. I agree that this movie is fun, but I don't think it is great. It did seem somewhat predictable and maybe that is why I don't feel this movie is a 9 or 10 like many others.I think Marvel is smart in cashing in on the 'to be continued' type of endings for all the Marvel movies. Like others of the Marvel Universe phases, this had some type of ending after the credits. But to be honest, I had no idea what it was even talking about. Similar to Winter Soldier. If you aren't a die-hard Captain America fan, you just won't feel satisfied as you would with Batman or Superman.In short, the movie is good, not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Action Movie!,"""Before we get started, does anyone want to get out?""After the rather dull ""Thor: The Dark World"" I thought we'd be in for more of the same with Captain America ""The Winter Soldier"". I have never been more mistaken. Man, it's so great that we get to see a national treasure on the run from his own corrupt government. This particular thread throughout the entire film gives it a distinct ability to explore its own subtext. It does this in a way that no Marvel Cinematic Universe films have done to date. Everything is palpable for the most part and done with a sense of never ending rhythmic urgency similar to last summer's excellent ""Star Trek Into Darkness"". The Russo brothers best known for their work on shows like ""Community"" and ""Arrested Development"" are clearly fans of the Bourne franchise from which much is lifted and transfixed as a suitable narrative framework. Yet they somehow manage to disseminate their own particular voice over proceedings. They do this in spite of overwhelming producer pressures at the same time. This film is as riveting and enthralling an action thriller as you're likely to see all year.""On your left""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Clash of Real World vs. Comic Book Action,"I was a fan of the first Captain America primarily because the director chose to evoke the pulp comic version of WWII (like Indiana Jones and the director's own Rocketeer). This film decides to steer into political intrigue territory, a genre I happen to be a fan of. To make that evident, Robert Redford is cast to represent the political characters he played in the past (3 Days of the Condor, All The President's Men, The Candidate, and later in Spy Game). The action centres in Washington D.C., with S.H.I.E.L.D. turning into just another bureaucracy.Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers, a man who seems lost in time and place. He is a superhero, but can't settle in an era that he didn't grow up in. The hole in our main character becomes a problem in the screenplay. At one point he is asked what he makes him happy, the answer is ""I don't know"". If the audience can't a get a sympathetic grip on this somewhat two dimensional character, will we care if he gets in harm's way? The main problem lies in how Captain America is so broadly drawn. Like Klark Kent, he has an unobscured view of right and wrong, and the only motivation needed is what is good for our country. So it is necessary to depend on the supporting characters to fill that hole. One could fault the actor Chris Evans, who unfortunately did not help his career being in the mid-2000s Fantastic Four. In that short lived franchise, he played an annoying show-off, again somewhat two dimensional. Does that mean Evans lacks depth in his acting? Since I liked that boy scout mentality in the first Captain America, I find it appropriate he retains that naivety as he tries to discover who is corrupting SHIELD's intentions. Scarlett Johanssan is the female lead, providing the kind of sexy and tough role that Angelina Jolie used to dominate. She has become well established as Black Widow, and doesn't need much character exposition. She is given plenty of opportunities to fight bad guys. Samuel Jackson has the most to gain from any of his appearances in previous Marvel films. His background gets a boost by making him a protÃ©gÃ© of Robert Redford, and anchoring the character of Nick Fury in a more gritty real world situation compared to a more fictional comic book history.The balance between action and tension building drama can seem a little talky, especially as the true villain is explained in the third act. This can be a welcoming moment of character development, especially if Steve Rogers can find happiness. But his relationship status still remains unresolved (as plot bait for subsequent sequels). I found that the big twist about the main villain to be a little lame, but my understanding is that the comic book universe prescribes it. I thought it helped to bring back some of the more appealing elements from the first film, so it has good potential.I am still a fan of Captain America as much as perhaps Ironman. His bright-eyed view of justice is appealing and does a lot of inventive moves with his shield that he carries as a projectile, amongst other things. All the action scenes are up to snuff in high caliber destruction and high volume firepower. I was less intrigued by the bureaucracy, but the screenplay smartly injects action just when the dialogue needs a spark (at one point borrowing from 'Mission:Impossible""). Once I returned to the theatre to watch it a second time, the comic book elements seem to clash with a real world approach. The character of Falcon, for instance, has a backstory from Afghanistan, and attends PTSD meetings. But it is hard to keep that kind of grip on real world when in the next scene we are back to the James Bond gadgets and superhero flying vehicles. Trying to please both worlds and kind of getting away with it is better than not trying to build intrigue and leaving us with empty characters destroying lots of stuff.Compared to the similar price tag given to the most recent Marvel release, Thor 2, the film feels big and sure of itself, keeping the momentum going after the big-bang explosion of the Avengers. I still prefer the first film for it's style and nostalgia, but the Russo brothers find their own tone and keep the momentum chugging along past the two hour mark. There is a big story to tell, and I didn't feel like there was any wasted screen time. I guess the best compliment to how well this Marvel machine is humming is the sense of excitement of what the next installment will provide.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Grey, Bland, Dud. In Other Words, ""An Exemplary MCU Masterpiece""","MCU fans will tell you, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is great. Better than great. The internet is clogged with reviews from endless Youtube pseudo-critics and Marvel shills whose entire cinematic knowledge stems from Breaking Bad and The Dark Knight, calling The Winter Soldier a game-changing masterwork. It is not. It's every bit as dull and uninteresting as every other ephemeral episode of The Marvel Cinematic Money-printing Machine. And it's aggressive mediocrity is yet another piece of evidence in my continuing theory on MCU apologists; they're idiots.That's harsh, I know. Some fans out there are perfectly content admitting that a movie like The Winter Soldier offers only disposable pulp thrills. However, it's the people claiming The Winter Soldier as 'innovative', or 'revolutionary' that really irk me. The chief reason given by these idiots is that Captain America: Winter Soldier is a superhero movie that is also a ""70s political espionage thriller"". Let's break it down. Yes, Captain America 2 contains elements of political espionage. The storyline involves two political organizations, S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra, a covert assassin (The Winter Soldier, Sebastian Stan), and Robert Redford (He's from the 70s). This is called window dressing. Surface decorations that evoke the feeling of a conspiracy thriller. What The Winter Soldier does not have is the actual structure of a political thriller. It's an efficiently made, TV-style superhero flick. The good guys punch the bad guys, the cars crash into each other, and the big CGI heli-carriers crumble like peanut brittle.There's nothing wrong with a superhero movie that only does these things. A schlocky action movie can be very enjoyable on that basic level, but only if the film embraces its core identity. When a movie like this fails, it does so because it wastes energy trying to be something else. Captain America: The Winter Soldier pretends to deal with issues. It pretends to be about real figures. But it's pretend. S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra are made-up, and as much as directors Anthony and Joseph Russo want you to recognize these things as analogous to our real institutions, you can't when it's all connected to a silly comic book world where a guy named Falcon flies around blasting machine guns at faceless goons.The cost of this focus on being a half-prestige picture is that nothing is allowed to go over the top. Want more proof that this film's champions are idiots? Look at the fight scenes that they praise as masterclasses in filmmaking. A fist fight in an elevator. Revolutionary! Look at those punches and kicks! It's unlike any other film I've ever seen! A fist fight on a highway. Brilliant! Hand to hand combat! Never before has a hero used his fist to punch another man! #Masterpiece! I can't be living on the same planet as these people. The action in Captain America 2 is not only not revolutionary (That is extremely obvious), it's flat-out bad. Hand to hand fist fights are usually boring by nature. It takes a real master of film craft to overcome the blandness inherent in such a scene. Cameron can do it, Raimi can do it, The Russo Brothers can't come close. There is absolutely no sense of invention in the action. No passion. No ideas at all. Just punches, filmed with detached digital murkiness.I can't think of a better way to describe Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The whole thing is detached. It's a filler TV episode. Efficiently produced, with the faÃ§ade of something meaningful, but completely uninterested in personality, life, or genuine fun/excitement/thrills. It's boring, transient garbage that managed to fool stupid people into thinking it was great. Well idiots, you get what you deserve.31/100",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The movie is OK & worth seeing but there's no tension or suspense knowing what the next movie will be like.,"""That's not freedom, that's fear."" Steve Rogers (Evans) is still trying to adjust to life in the modern world but he does have Natasha (Johansson) and Nick Fury to help him. Thinking there may be a problem inside the walls of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury warns Rogers not to trust anyone. He takes this to heart and when Fury is killed Rogers becomes a fugitive from the organization. He must now fight the mysterious Winter Soldier in order to avenge Fury and also to clear his name. The first thing I will talk about are the good things about this movie. The Avengers movies seem to be leaning more to the adult side with a real story line and leaning less on the special effects that earlier comic book movies fell back on. This one is no exception. It is dark and has depth to it to make you interested in what is happening rather than what is blowing up. They all do a great job of tying into each other which makes it feel like one long story rather then separate stories they attempt to tie together. On the other hand the fact that they keep pumping these movies out is what made the main plot of this movie not work. The whole movie has to deal with the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D. becoming corrupt and Captain America being an outcast. The fact that they have already started to film Avengers 2 and have announced Captain America 3 takes away all the tension and suspense of Rogers and Fury's story lines. From the beginning you know that Fury will be fine and Rogers will clear his name and fix what is wrong with S.H.I.E.L.D. If they wanted to really have the viewer wonder what will happen they shouldn't have announced future plans for the series. To me the Avengers movies have become more of franchise done solely to make money rather than movies done to tell a story. While they do make a killing when they come out they are starting to cheapen the industry and are watering down the product. There is failure to see that the longer the series goes on the more it will take away from what has been done so far. If you don't believe me now you will when Iron Man 6, Captain America 5, Thor 6 and Avengers 7 all come out. Overall, the movie is OK and worth seeing but there is no tension or suspense already knowing what the next movie will be like. I give it a B.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One of the conflict-ridden stories in the MCU,"While living his modern life, Steve Rogers fought alongside S. H. I. E. L. D. to eradicate the covert evil that threatened their existence. This time, Steve has to face the Winter Soldier who is none other than his past friend.The story of Captain America in the Marvel Universe is undoubted. An interesting heroic story with a series of Chris Evans performances that look mighty. Continuing from the first film, The Winter Soldier comes with a more interesting story than the first film. Introducing Winter Soldier as the antagonist and Sam Wilson as Falcon who becomes Steve's new partner provides a fairly dense story and conflict. Conflict is a dense problem by presenting a political story in it. The presence of Hydra in S. H. I. E. L. D's body makes for a good and somewhat unexpected storyline. The depth and density of conflict can be seen from the many new problems that arise gradually. Also brings good action action. The Winter Soldier brings to the story of the Marvel Universe hero film that is memorable dark and deep. It can be seen from the plot that is able to describe Steve and Bucky's relationship which looks close and emotional. Also Steve and Natasha's relationship in their romantic story. In addition, The Winter Soldier is also fairly capable of providing changes and nuances that are different from the previous film.

"From the directors of ""You, Me and Dupree""","After director Joe Johnston's savagely disappointing attempt to bring the Marvel superhero Captain America to life three years ago, the creative minds that brought us ""You, Me and Dupree"" (Anthony and Joe Russo) somehow get a crack at the sequel, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". Though it sounds like I'm ready to rip this movie, to my surprise ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" was (for the most part) quite entertaining, with visually stunning action sequences throughout. But even more surprising, especially because this was made by the guys who directed ""You, Me and Dupree"" (I don't know if I mentioned that disturbing bit of trivia already) is how this theatrical release also contains much more well timed laughs than I bargained for.If I'm not mistaken, Captain America is less of a goody goody and more of a ""bad ass"" in this installment. Right away we get to see him in action, throwing people around and basically kicking major butt. Thus, a huge reason as to why ""The Winter Soldier"" works as well as it does, has a lot to do with the directors keeping the octane at a relatively high level and not boring me to tears. Any real flaws here (and there are a few) would only be noticed by audiences who attempted to actually break the plot down.The Synopsis: Just as Captain America aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has nearly adapted to life in the modern world, a beaten and bloodied Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) shows up in his apartment, where we learn that S.H.I.E.L.D has been compromised by a villain from Captain America's past. He is also confronted by a bad guy who goes by the name of the Winter Soldier, whose strengths seem to match up suspiciously well to that of the Captain's. The story itself is pretty good, even though it is bogged down with a lot of double and triple cross espionage-type twists and turns that I didn't quite understand. But much like the last Iron Man film, where ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" runs into trouble is with its villains; one played by Robert Redford and the other the aforementioned mysterious Winter Soldier. Even though the movie starts out with an awesome fight sequence between the Captain and George St. Pierre, the main villain is an old man named Alexander Pierce (Redford) who spends the whole movie in one room and the other is the infamous Winter Soldier, who is made to look pretty intimidating for a while (again, kudos to the direction) playing an evil version of Captain America. But even his storyline leads to revelations which softened his villainous exterior and a final battle which left me cold and wishing that I could fast forward to the post credits teaser clip. The fact is, for having his name included in the title, the Greek tragedy-esque connections between Captain America and the Winter Soldier was far more fascinating than actually watching the Winter Soldier do anything; which is a problem.Side Note: I guess I must mention that this film also stars Scarlet Johansson, who by design plays a huge role, reprising her character, Black Widow. As if audiences had demanded she get more screen-time, Johansson is in 80% of the movie, wearing her signature form fitting one piece and seducing every male ""bad guy"" to nearly an inch of their lives. Anthony Mackie is also in this playing the Falcon, a sort of side kick to the title character. He flies around and stuff, but that's about it. Moving on.Final Thought: ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is impressive for a Marvel sequel, but still (as far as Marvel films go) its more along the lines of the first Thor film than the first Iron Man film, mainly because the character of Steve Rogers is still very two dimensional. And before I get hate mail, this is not a direct knock on the movie, but more so of the character himself. I understand that the ""total good"" characteristic of Captain America is by design. My point is, I don't believe it translates all that well to audiences who nowadays would rather see a shades of grey antihero, than an old school hero whose morals are impervious to a dynamic character arc.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brother,"In general, it exceeded expectations, because before I watched it, I was always thinking how to make a movie with captain America without super powers, high-tech equipment, a shield and patriotic beliefs. Marvel has added a lot of spy movies to its usual emphasis on visual effects, and they've done it so well that many ""professional"" spy movies have been put to shame.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a disappointing sequel to say the least.,"It might have not came as a shock to others but the first Captain America movie of 2011 came out of nowhere for me. I found that the Captain American origin story in that movie to be one of the more interesting origin stories around and very much original. Steve Rogers was the slightly built soldier in World War Two who makes his way to the present day through a block of frozen ice. Captain America was a superhero that eventually brought the war, the Nazis, a cool villain and different time period to the Marvel universe in Captain's first ever film.Now in 2014, Captain America is back with the sequel Captain America: The Winter Soldier directed by new directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. After Nick Fury (Samuel J. Jackson) is gunned down by a villain named White Soldier, Steve Rogers is now is a fugitive on the run and who must get down to business and solve the S.H.I.E.L.D vs HYDRA espionage battle in the Nation's capital.Like the first movie, this sequel has a nice cast. Nick Fury is given more to do in this movie and even though the character goes some predictable ways, he still should be the character you most look forward to in upcoming Marvel films. As he was in the first movie, Chris Evans is flawless as Captain America. He plays the character as a very likable Captain America and adds depth and chemistry to the role. Scarlett Johansson is back as the Black Widow who again brings sexuality through her tight outfits. The newest member of the cast, and a very impressive character indeed, is Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce. Redford's character can be described as unlikable and it is very impressive for an actor like Redford at the age of 77 to be doing high levels action scenes as he does here. The only character that is lacking is Falcon (Anthony Mackie) who really does nothing noteworthy or interesting but a character that maybe I could see some change or development for the next film. Last by not least is our great villain, the White Soldier who does come off as creepy and pretty cool twist comes to him yet again.I do question the film's running time and structure. You have to question as to why this film is as long as there are many obvious places that it could have been cut down. The pacing is all over the place and the action often comes randomly. The action scenes are still very well done and do show off the big budget of this film but they are all kind of the same. The settings are numerous and kind of all over the place and the movie does drag big time.Of course, one thing this sequel is doing is setting itself up for another sequel that has already been announced for 2016. This one works fine for what it is but between the other recent Marvel movies including two Thor films, three Iron Man films, the Avengers and the first Captain America film, it really comes up lacking. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a disappointing sequel to say the least.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Formulaic,"Formulaic, boring. I wasn't compelled to care about the characters or the story. Interesting moral dilemmas always ended in the clichÃ©d sentimental choice. For example, the climax, Capt throwing away his shield and most probably his life for his ""friendship."" I would expect Capt America to be intensely responsible for his life, for he has the potential to save millions or billions of people many times over. His choice was illogical and irresponsible to the larger context of his life and humanity. The way his character is morally structured, it didn't make sense.I'm always baffled by these superheroes/saviors/good guys who are chased around and have no problem causing mass destruction and loss of life.

Tiresome action scenes - with SHAKY CAM!!!,"These super hero movies are getting tiresome. One 1 man against 100? No worries.

To be honest even I was thinking, heck a few million baddies (or potential baddies) for the good of the many billion goodies? Yeah go for it.Or maybe it was because I had become desensitised by the shaky camera action scenes that just left me cold and made me want them to end as soon as possible. If you can't film action scenes without waving the camera around then you shouldn't be let loose with one.And hands up - did anyone really think he wasn't going to get the 3rd chip in place before they opened fire?

"Captain America sees another strong entry in the MCU series with solid work from Evans, Johansson, and Mackie and a thrilling story.","In the aftermath of The Avengers, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) continues his work as an agent of S. H. I. E. L. D. under the direction of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and alongside Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) but finds himself increasingly conflicted with the moral shades of grey and compartmentalization of modern warfare and spycraft which are significantly less clearcut than his days in World War II. As S. H. I. E. L. D. prepares for a new surveillance program, Project: Insight, for launch, Nick Fury who has voiced concerns with the project is subjected to an assassination attempt barely escaping where he goes to Steve's apartment to tell him S. H. I. E. L. D. is compromised giving him an encrypted flash drive and telling him to trust no one before Fury is killed by an assassin known as The Winter Solider. Now on the run from both S. H. I. E. L. D. and the Winter Soldier, Steve with the help of Natasha and former Army Pararescueman Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) attempt to unravel the conspiracy and understand what the imminent threat is.Following the release of Captain America: The First Avenger, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely returned to pen the sequel that would be based on Ed Brubaker's run on the character and continue to examine Captain America as ""a man out of time"" contrasting his traditional values of right and wrong in a world where the enemy is rarely wearing flags/colors or even in plain sight. The film would also be the first major entry in the MCU from brothers and directors Anthony and Joe Russo who based on the strength of their work on the TV series Community were given the highly competitive position beating out several other directors. While I was rather mixed on Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World as entries into the second phase of the MCU, Captain America: The Winter Soldier stands at the same level of quality as the first film and The Avengers.Once again Chris Evans is just perfectly cast as Steve Rogers/Captain America as he embodies all the best values of the character but also gives him solid pathos as a man who is out of his element with the world having relegated his past as a relic and the scenes where he visits an exhibit in the Smithsonian of the Howling Commandos or a now 90 year old Peggy Carter who is stricken with dementia are quite heart wrenching but the character never lets himself become overwrought from it and continues to move forward finding purpose within his drive to do good. Scarlett Johansson continues to be good as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and with the two of them paired up for a considerable amount of time they make a set of leads with Steve's more forthright approach contrasted well against Natasha who's more comfortable with ambiguity and falsehood having been exposed to this line of work longer than Steve. We also get a solid addition to the universe with Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson who Steve Bonds with over their shared experience as servicemen and the scenes between them at the VA are quite good.In terms of story, The Winter Solider does a solid job of having Captain America face off against the muddled modern world by taking inspiration from the classic paranoid and conspiracy thrillers of the 70s (the filmmakers have cited Three Days of the Condor and Marathon Man as such). The movie starts off with a great hook with Captain America forced on the run after being told S. H. I. E. L. D. has been compromised and it creates a feeling of helplessness and desperation that carries through the whole film until the climax. As with the first Captain America film this one also provides us with some of the best villains we've gotten to see in the MCU (way above the Dark Elves from The Dark World) and the themes of freedom versus security are explored in a manner that while fitting within a comic book universe do still have real world parallels that make for good food for thought.Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a welcome entry in the MCU and only serves to cement how great of a character Captain America is. Evans is wonderful as the character and Johansson and Mackie are great allies to the character and the story is rich with twist, turns and revelations that just work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Shall We Play a Game?,"Greetings again from the darkness. Many were unimpressed with the first Captain America movie, though I have always had a soft spot for the most heroic and genuinely pure of the superheroes. This sequel opens with Steve Rogers trying to acclimate after a 70 year sleep ... he thinks the internet is pretty cool. It is a bit surprising that the Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe, known for You, Me and Dupree) are the ones who load up on plot lines within a Marvel movie.Starting off with big time action sequences, the movie then morphs into a geopolitical weave of intrigue between SHIELD and HYDRA. New to this maze of distrust is Robert Redford ... proving once again that Hollywood doesn't trust guys wearing suits in fancy offices. In a twist, Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) find themselves the target of a manhunt by those they work for. Then they drag The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) into this ... his flight suit is a nice effect. All of this happens after an unexpected action-packed sequence featuring Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson).The multiple plot lines and emphasis on trust issues all correlate pretty well to some of the things going on in the world today. That adds an enjoyable element that really brings relevance to the Captain America character. Because of this the repartee between Cap and Natasha is limited ... we get some, but much less than what we have come to expect from other Avengers-related films. And it's probably a good idea to go a different direction with the Avenger who really is different from the others. Don't miss the extra scene in the closing credits ... it's the lead in to The Avengers movie coming in 2015.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Kick Ass Action makes up for Dubious and textbook plot,"Steve Rogers works with S.H.I.E.L.D. in the sufficiently successful second installment.Rogers is the dutiful soldier following orders under the direction of Nick Fury and guidance of Natasha Romanoff while working for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. When it becomes apparent the agency is compromised, Captain America must contest authority to discover the rogue agents and combat the Winter Soldier.Though Captain America: The First Avenger did not insinuate a clear plot for a sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier follows the Marvel movie method of success with excellent action scenes, cheeky dialogue and satisfactory story lines. To compensate for a mildly contrived and formulaic plot, Marvel Studios ups the action ante with seriously well choreographed action, fight and stunt scenes.The first impressive scene occurs right at the cusp of disappointment, thankfully for the screenwriters. Not groundbreaking but saliently well orchestrated, figurative hats-off to the Stunts department and fight choreographer James Young and stunt coordinator Thomas Robinson Harper. The Winter Soldier action scenes have the unique ability to be easy to follow while being energetically charged and fast paced. A substantial downgrade regarding the overall impression of the film would have taken place were it not for the steady onslaught of remarkable but integrated imagery.While still coming to terms and not quite okay with the casting of Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, The Winter Soldier features her prevalently to make up for the lack of her own film and story arc. In doing so, the whole first thirty minutes of the second film is a bit sluggish, forced, and complicated, in order to integrate her properly into the Captain America milieu. Once the film finally gains speed, the audience is relegated to inferior and basic textbook 'bad guy' behavior that cheapens the Marvel brand.Though dubious at first, in the end the relationship dynamic between Fury, Romanoff and Rogers is reasonable enough to make way for the final Captain America installment of the franchise.See FULL reviews of recent releases by going to our website!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

High-quality sequel,"Going through the Infinity Saga for the first time, I was under the (false) impression that every movie in this 3-Phase saga is linked to that grand arc, but turns out after 9 films so far all we've got are a few short end credit scenes. Thankfully not an issue, as we do get solid character development in every film (even the terrible Hulk one) and now in Phase 2 the quality of the individual movies has taken a step up.Winter Soldier is more thriller than superhero flick, and pays fine homage to vintage conspiracy movies of 70's to 90's. The cast all work well with each other (Samuel L Jackson finally getting some quality screen time) and unusually the music-score has a few outstanding motifs which go beyond the standard orchestral fare, especially with scenes involving the Winter Soldier character. Reminded me of how Dune's dramatic blasts of musical-score elevated what was happening on-screen.Camera movement & editing is improved over previous entries, holding the image a little steadier and a little longer. The plot & pacing develop nicely. Really no significant weak spots. It misses out on a higher score as my 9's & 10's have something substantially awe-inspiring about them.

"One of the best sequels of all time, ranking up there with the likes of Godfather 2 and Empire Strikes Back","For years I was wondering out loud how a Captain America film would work without it coming across like a colossal joke. Fortunately, Captain America the first Avenger worked beautifully... which begs the question... how do you make a sequel to Captain America work in modern day without it being a colossal joke? The answer is simple... you bring back the brilliant writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen Mcfeely and the Russo brothers to direct.The Winter Soldier is a comic book/political thriller. While in part being a commentary on today's world that's very relevant to our current social climate and fight against terrorism, it also serves as a cautionary message as to how easy it is for evil, powerful men to fool people into believing they are the good guys... I'll let you draw your own conclusions from there.Chris Evans continues to be amazing as Captain America. The man somehow is absolutely perfect despite his resume containing characters such as Johnny Storm and that guy from Not another Teen movie. Sebastian Stan is also awesome as The Winter Soldier, and the beautiful Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow, and newcomer Anthony Mackie is really awesome as Sam Wilson/The Falcon. I was slightly annoyed he wasn't fighting with the Avengers in Age of Ultron. Before I forget, the absolutely lovely Cobie Smulders returns as the smuldering hot agent Maria Hill... get it?And of course Sam Jackson returns as the charismatic Nick Fury.

Time to have the sidekicks.,"The second movie in the series directed by Russo brothers. This time the story set in the modern world only if you are not taking 'The Avengers' in the account. The cast was expanded, I mean the sidekicks were introduced. Looked the strength of the 'good' has doubled, but the villain was also equally good. The first praising words goes the directors for handling it well and hope they are going to repeat the same magic for the next movie as well.This story commence just after 'The Avengers'. Captain America and Black Widow are sent to free hostages and collect some data. Soon after the Shield director Fury is targeted by an assassin called Winter Soldier. After this incident the weight leans on Captain America, he becomes the prime suspect. With the help of Black Widow and a new wingman called Falcon, he seeks the truth. Unexpectedly the story strikes with a twist and exposes the man behind it. Once everything revealed the tension arise between good and bad before it ends with a convincing solution.''Before we get started, does anyone want to get out?''The escape scene of Samuel L. Jackson was awesome and I wanted it a little longer. The new addition, Falcon was another brilliant, just like the sidekick Robin from the Batman world. The story was okay, but the excellent performances and visual narration were the movie's strength. The 3D effects were better than I expected. In a few scenes I thought the villain Winter Soldier was better than the Captain America. He was a surprise package, if you just ignore the antagonist tag he can surely be your favorite from this movie. Even I liked his costume and he also performed some great stunts.One thing I fascinated about this production house's movie are the post-credit scenes. Yeah, this movie had one too, but that particular scene created lots of curiosity. A good movie and will definitely pass the test being a follow-up either after 'The Avengers' or to 'The First Avenger'. Again Marvel did a wonder job. Just keep those coming, and it will be well backed by the audience if it is worth. The good days are just began for sci-fi and superhero themes. I think I said it every time during Marvel's movie reviews.

The Cap is finally cool,"Before the monster success of Guardian's of the Galaxy Marvel had one other 2014 release; the second installment in the Captain America franchise, The Winter Soldier. This time, we're out of the 1940's and into present day, allegedly two years after the events of 2012's The Avengers. The Captain is still trying to adjust to 21st century life, a task that becomes a lot more difficult when S.H.I.E.L.D. commander in chief Nick Fury comes to tell him that the agency in charge of organizing and peacekeeping with these superheroes, is compromised and that there's a great big shitstorm headed in the direction of Cap, Black Widow, Fury, and the rest of the ""good guys."" Then, to make matters worse, Cap's world is rocked when he encounters the film's sub-titular (assuming that's a word) character, an incredibly dangerous assassin known only as The Winter Soldier.I really have to give Marvel kudos for what they are able to do with their wide span of stories and characters. With such a wide array they are able to make each of their films vastly different in tone and genre. In the span of a few months the studio was able to release a political espionage thriller and a tongue-in-cheek sci-fi space opera all part of the same wonderfully vast universe. I love that they are able to do this so effectively, and I have unending admiration for their ability to have each of their films feel like a breath of fresh air, never rehashing the same superhero narrative.In the same way that Guardians of the Galaxy succeeded greatly at being a sci-fi epic with a comic book backdrop Winter Soldier works equally well as a political spy thriller with a comic book backdrop. It might not have the depth of films like Three Days of the Condor or All the Presidents Men, but it certainly succeeds at matching tone and style, and then injecting itself with a healthy dose of Marvel Studios explodey action set pieces. These two elements go together surprisingly well, albeit the superhero presence certainly helps.The Winter Soldier is an unabashed action packed spectacle that never lets up on the explosions or gunfire for too long. This is a Marvel film that packs a punch and it's proud of that. The film, for better or worse, takes itself more seriously than previous Marvel flicks. The usual cheeseball sense of humor that Marvel movies has is far more subtle in Winter Soldier, with high stakes action and emotional weight attempting to take its place. On one hand the film's grave tone is a downfall because you can only take a movie about a a guy in blue following around a one-eyed Sam Jackson so seriously. On the other hand, it's nice to see a Marvel film geared towards a slightly older and more mature crowd, contrasting Guardians of the Galaxy's younger target demographic, a demographic that I guess I still fit into. Regardless, I still stand by my breath of fresh air comment.Now I want to take a second to talk about the film's titular character, because some serious improvements were made here. The first installment of Cap's franchise didn't get me too worked up and I think the biggest reason was that I couldn't connect to Captain America's do-goody boy scout character devoid of any internal or personal conflict. Cap is the same golden boy as he was in the first film, but he's learning and coping with how you can't trust just anybody in a society full of deception and hidden agendas, and watching Steve Rogers as a man just trying to deal with this harsh reality is far more interesting to me than the do-no-wrong Captain of the first film.Also, the Cap is just more badass in Winter Soldier. On top of being a more engaging character, he kicks literal ass. The fight choreography is wicked thrilling, and Cap's extensive use of his iconic shield makes him so much more memorable than he's been in his previous appearances. I think Winter Soldier finally made this superhero cool, and no longer just some pretty boy goody-goody.The Winter Soldier may not be the deepest story with the best acting and the best script, but when we're talking superhero films it's still pretty damn good. It suffers from on-the-nose dialogue and unnecessarily lengthy exposition, reminding us that this is a Hollywood franchise film, but still manages to be another Marvel success. Even if The Winter Soldier isn't the greatest movie in the world the studio should be immensely grateful to directors Joe and Anthony Russo who took the only Avengers member I hadn't yet warmed up to and finally making him a true American badass.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Surprisingly and satisfyingly good sequel,"In the cinematic world of the heroes of Marvel Comics, we had the Second World War origins of Captain America in the 2011 movie, starring the engaging but not exactly charismatic Chris Evans, before seeing him back in action the following year in the team effort that was ""The Avengers"" in the US and ""Avengers Assemble"" in the UK plus a cameo role in ""Thor: The Dark World"".Now we return to an outing with him front and centre in modern-day Washington DC. The flamed-haired, leather-clad Black Widow (an excellent Scarlett Johansson) - whom we saw in ""The Avengers"" - is back as his side-kick (and I do mean kick) and later they are joined by the flying Falcon (Andrew Mackie). Their foes prove to be more ubiquitous and nefarious than we could imagine with the titular Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) - flowing hair and metal left arm - especially formidable and (for Captain America himself) unlikely. S.H.E.I.L.D. has never looked more formidable with Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) joined by Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) and some amazing weaponry.Those not immersed in the Marvel Comics world may sometimes wonder what is going on but, as an action movie, ""The Winter Soldier"" certainly delivers with a cracking opening sequence and regular vehicle chases, shoot ups and fist fights before the whole thing concludes with an aerial battle reminiscent of ""Star Wars"". The special effects work well. But the film also taps into the current Zeitgeist of widespread fear that the agents of law enforcement, who are supposed to be protecting us, are hoovering up digital data, subverting any notion of privacy, and eliminating threatening assets - some 20 million, it seems - before those concerned even know that they are supposedly a threat. In the massive list of credits, space should have been made for the addition of whistle-blower Edward Snowden.A trade-mark of all recent superhero movies is the inclusion of a clip at the end of the credits. In the case of ""The Winter Soldier"", there is not one but two such bonuses, so stick around to the end and be sure that ""Captain America"" will be back and with the same successful directors (Anthony & Joe Russo).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Johansson's performance contributes to the film's overall depth.The Winter Soldier, portrayed by Sebastian Stan, emerges as a formidable and mysterious antagonist.

The fight choreography and hand-to-hand combat scenes showcase the physical prowess of Captain America and his adversaries.This movie successfully addresses contemporary themes, including government surveillance and the price of freedom, adding a layer of relevance to the superhero narrative. The film's willingness to explore moral ambiguity and question authority sets it apart within the MCU.The Russo brothers' directorial style injects a grittier and more grounded tone into the film, reminiscent of '70s political thrillers.

That being said though, I thoroughly enjoyed Captain America: The First Avenger, released in 2011.The most impressive aspect of the first film was the credibility of the storyline. Albeit, one based on a comic book character. It did not overuse computer generated imagery (CGI), and the way in which Captain America was brought from the 1940s, to the 21st century was (given the genre), plausible.The same cannot be said for its sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.Even for a movie based on a comic book superhero, the storyline is, dare I say it, comical. While the premise and origin of the assassin known as 'the winter soldier' is perfectly acceptable, everything else in the film is just too over the top. However perhaps the films' biggest fault lies in that it seems to completely ignore the existence and events of 2012's 'The Avengers'.Given the circumstances Captain America finds himself in, it is unreasonable to think that other members of The Avengers would not be called in to assist him. Particularly given that the algorithm the film centres on comes up with Bruce Banner's (The Hulk) name as a future threat. Not to mention the discovery that Tony Stark's (Iron Man) father's death was not an accident, as previously thought, and the fact that the fate of the world is at stake.This was not the case with either Iron Man 3, or the second Thor film. Both were released after The Avengers, yet both followed on smoothly from the events of that film. In Iron Man's case, coming to terms mentally with what occurred in The Avengers, and Thor having to team up with his adopted and now imprisoned brother Loki â the villain of the ensemble film.The film makers could have concentrated more on the antagonism and personal connection between The Winter Soldier and Captain America. Instead it is just one small part of a convoluted myriad of senseless sub plots that do not really come together, nor fit in with previous films set in the Marvel universe.Of course the special effects are amazing, but there is nothing new of note, and it has all been seen before. If anything, the film relies too much on CGI, which while being momentarily satisfying, is hardly memorable.The acting is solid, but nothing more. Although given what they have to work with, the cast hardly be criticised for that. Even Robert Redford's presence in the film cannot raise it above its own mediocrity.However, despite all of the above Captain America: The Winter Soldier does provide a couple of hours of escape from the real world. And as long as you leave logic, and any great expectations at the door, those two hours can also be entertaining ones.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It will not disappoint,"An thoroughbred action film through and through.

Manages to Be Better Than the First,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)*** (out of 4)Captain America (Chris Evans) is still trying to come to terms with who and what he is but now he must face someone he remembers from his past. It seems the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is the strongest creation and it's up to members of SHIELD to try and stop him as well as a criminal (Robert Redford) wanting to cause mass destruction.CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER is a rare sequel that actually manages to be better than the original film. That's not to say the first film wasn't good but this one here pretty much adds a lot of steroids to the action and makes for an overall much better film. The cast is certainly in top form and directors Anthony and Joe Russo certainly know how to milk an action scene for everything that it's worth.There's no question that the highlights of the movie are the extended action scenes that features some terrific looking CGI that perfectly mixes in with the live action on the screen. It's really amazing to see how far technology has come over the past decade and this film certainly looks tremendous. The action scenes contain so much chaos and destruction that it's really a wonder that this stuff can be pulled off. There's one great action sequence after another and this here certainly makes the film.Evans is obviously quite comfortable in his role as Captain America and he's perfectly able to bring the human element that the story needs. The supporting cast is equally good with Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie all doing nice work. Stan is also extremely good in his role as the villain and when you've got someone like Robert Redford it just brings your film to another level.CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER is a fun, fast and over-the-top summer movie that actually delivers a good time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Overall it is enjoyable, but it suffers from the same pacing problems that we witnessed in the first fiilm","Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is struggling to adapt to life in the modern world after being suspended in a coma for a number of years. However, he is forced to put his objections aside when director of SHIELD Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is shot down by an unknown assassin. After some digging, Rogers learns that there is a much bigger conspiracy involving Fury being gunned down and sets to work to get to the bottom of said conspiracy...Captain America: The Winter Soldier overall is a decent enough film (certainly in the second half), but sadly the same problems that plagued the original film seem to plague this film and the main problem being;PACING; the first 10-15 minutes or so are great; some fast paced action and a basic set-up to the story, but then things kind of grind to a halt. Some of the scenes in the first half of the picture revolving around Captain America seemed a little too self-congratulatory and don't serve as much purpose as the running time suggests (there is some purpose to some of what we witness which becomes apparent as things manifest later in the film, but personally I felt that proceedings dragged on more than they needed to).Having said that when the main story does develop it is actually pretty good and is more expansive and deeper than the story that we witnessed in the original film. Once you're hooked it's pretty involving and I did like the way that director Anthony Russo retained the light-hearted approach that Joe Johnston applied to the original film. The humorous exchanges and light touches within the film made it palatable and digestible which did serve the film well over its rather generous 120 minute plus running time.The acting from the principal cast is mostly good with Evans really getting into the skin of his character; it was more difficult for him to achieve this effect in this first film (for obvious reasons), but he does a solid job here. Anthony Mackie is also excellent and offers strong support. Scarlett Johansson is also very good and I think I may have finally fallen in love with her voice; she could read me my miranda rights and I would still take notice and that's not even acknowledging that she looks hot as hell here. If we're talking about acting then Samuel L Jackson does OK, but this particular role is not really stretching him, but what does let this film down slightly is Robert Redford whose inclusion in the film seems a little too obvious and I would suspect that most people would be able to see who is and what he's about more or less straight away.Overall, Captain America: Winter Soldier does work as the plot is richer and more deeper than the first film, but it does suffer from the same pacing problems as the first film with one cast member who is too obvious as highlighted in the above paragraph. However, in summary, like the first film this is worth watching, but also like the first film it isn't quite the spectacular blockbuster that it thinks it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A job well done,"As I'm not from US and have never read a comic book unless you count TIN-TIN, I didn't grow up with the DC\MCU characters.Though i've watched superhero movies only spider-man interested me.So I went to the theater to watch captain America winter soldier with almost a clean-slate where Captain America is concerned. I actually only watched the first movie few days before watching the second when i heard it was coming to the theaters. The movie surprised me so much it made the top three of my favorite action movies of all time within the first half hour. I was so impressed with Russo brothers work. The movie was a skillfully molded masterpiece from the first second to the last credit scene. The scene where Bucky looking at his information in Smithsonian gave me the chills. Sebastian Stan's character in the first movie had the same importance and the influence in developing Steve Rogers character as Peter Parker's uncle. He is the one who influenced and drove him to push his limits and use his new found powers for good. And Bucky's untimely death gave him the ultimatum in his fight against HYDRA, go big or go home.And finding that his lifelong friend had survived and put under so much pain and torture and forced to do unspeakable things. As well as learning the war between good and bad is not as black and white as it used to be during world war 11 makes him question his loyalties. Who in this gray-scale world can be called good or bad? Is SHIELD any different from HYDRA if they are the two sides of the same coin? Something else i like about this particular movie is that the mostly focused relationship is the brotherly bond between Steve and Bucky not the overused love story of superhero and his love interest. The way Steve's words managed to go through decades of brainwashing and memory deleting? was heartbreaking. And it's not like Bucky suddenly remembers everything and fight the bad guys with Steve but that simple line manages to make a crack in the shield. Enough to make Bucky question his life and his handlers. All in all the best superhero movie I've watched in a long long while.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Winter Soldier delivers a knock-out punch to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a triumph of superhero filmmaking. The plot, which delves into the political intrigue and moral ambiguities of modern espionage, is both gripping and thought-provoking. The action scenes are expertly choreographed and shot, blending thrilling set-pieces with character-driven moments in a way that feels both seamless and satisfying. The performances, particularly Chris Evans as Captain America and Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier, are top-notch, bringing depth and nuance to characters that could have been one-dimensional. The film also manages to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe in meaningful ways, setting up future storylines and character arcs in a way that feels organic rather than forced.

The best 70s political thriller that could have been made as a comic book action film,"Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 7/10The Winter Soldier is the second film starring Chris Evans as Captain America. The first was set almost entirely in the 1940s, and documented his origins. It was a black-and-white good vs. evil story of the kind that is very dated by today's standards... which is exactly what it needed to be, to set up the character that is Cap, the 'Man Out of Time', whose obsolete, simplistic value system often comes into conflict with the complexities of the modern world.In this film, The Winter Soldier, we see him some time into his new life in the present day, long past the initial disorientation which has been done many times elsewhere and didn't need to be seen again. However, he still has some adjusting to do, as a major institution on which he depends - the covert military operation S.H.I.E.L.D. - turns out to have corruption in it. This was the stock in trade of a number of conspiracy thrillers during the 60s and 70s, during which the world learned to distrust. It's a lesson Cap has to learn at an accelerated pace, in an emulation of those films like 'All the President's Men'.To this end, the choice of Robert Redford as the calculating villain at the centre of the conspiracy is a knowingly ironic one. Redford starred in AtPM, as well as other thrillers of the type. In fact, over the 40 years of his film career, he has generally been one of Hollywood's most prominent liberal spokesmen, as well as one of its biggest stars.On Cap's side are two characters who have served to weave together the Marvel film-verse, even though neither has ever had as prominent a role as they do on this occasion. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is a counterpoint to Captain America: a hero who has learned the bitter lesson of suspicion, and perhaps been blinded by it. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson is the de facto co-star (and love interest?) as Black Widow, who goes on the run with Cap. She gets some real emotional scenes and carries them off in a way I would barely have believed if I had not seen 'Her', in which she gives a performance of unprecedented subtlety, showing me for the first time that she really can act.What the film does well, it does *very* well. The action scenes are exciting, with some cool touches in the fight choreography, and the political allegory, if a bit unsubtle, is forcefully put and well illustrated. If I have any criticisms, they are as follows:1. The Winter Soldier character himself was pretty peripheral to the overall plot, and his story was never very well explained. I was left feeling like there was a lot more to tell, but surely this, being the movie with him in the title, was the one in which that should have been told.2. Toby Jones' character, Dr. Arnim Zola, giving what amounts to a massive plot info-dump. Having to explain so much of the story in one expository lump is a sign of lazy writing. His explanation for doing so is not very good either.The modern comic book action and the tense, morally ambivalent political games don't quite sit comfortably alongside each other but, if you were going to put them together, this film is probably the best result you could hope for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Surprisingly Dim-Witted and Generic Superhero Flick is a Step Back for Marvel's Story lines, Scriptwriting, and Fun","I am absolutely shocked that this movie was praised upon its release. Going into the new Captain America movie, I was kind of excited. When I had originally seen the trailer, I had thought that the movie looked kind of stupid, a generic action movie, but with the rotten tomatoes consensus: Suspenseful and politically astute, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a superior entry in the Avengers canon and is sure to thrill Marvel die hards, and the great reviews, I decided to give this film a chance. It was everything the trailer promised it would be, generic, boring, and all around a waste of time. The bare hints of intelligence are passed of nonchalantly at the beginning as unimportant remarks about world security to make the film seem intelligent, while the plot turns, including the main plot twist that's supposed to be a shocker, fail to surprise on any lever whatsoever. It's like the filmmakers didn't care whatsoever, and just because it was a stupid action movie and not hyper- stylized like the other Marvel movies, people were like ""oh wow, it's so smart and exciting."" Two words: it's not. This is a film that wastes the viewer's time, devolving down to overlong action sequences, cheesy one-liners, false intelligence, and overwhelmingly cloying attempts at patriotism.

An action-packed adventure,"The second installment of this superhero's film series does not disappoint, as Captain America: The Winter Soldier combines a solid story with a heavy dosage of exciting action. As any sequel should do, it offers the audience an overall improvement of the first film in all departments, with all the main characters being further developed and the action sequences also being upgraded to much higher levels of exhilaration. Although the first Captain America film proved satisfying, the continuation of the franchise is far more compelling, as the film is able to optimize its capacities, allowing Captain Steve Rodgers to truly shine, thus enabling the viewers to appreciate his role as the ultimate soldier. Along with it being well-designed and fiercely action packed, the film also manages to use a very interesting storyline to reinvigorate the Marvel Universe and the world of the Avengers.

BUCKY!,"""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a 2014 action/adventure film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and starring Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America. The film takes place two years after the events of ""The Avengers"" and finds Rogers working for S. H. I. E. L. D., where he uncovers a conspiracy that threatens to endanger the world as he knows it.One of the biggest strengths of the film is its plot, which is a tense and thrilling political thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film's screenplay, by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, is well-crafted and keeps the story moving at a brisk pace. The film's themes of security versus freedom also feel particularly relevant in today's world.The acting in the film is top-notch, with Chris Evans delivering a standout performance as Captain America. Scarlett Johansson is also excellent as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, and the chemistry between the two characters is electric. The supporting cast, which includes Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, is also strong.The action scenes in the film are well-staged and exciting, with a mix of hand-to-hand combat and high-tech gadgets. The film's cinematography, by Trent Opaloch, is also impressive, with a mix of wide shots and close-ups that help to create a sense of tension and urgency.The direction by the Russo brothers is confident and assured, with a good sense of pacing and a strong visual style. The film's score, by Henry Jackman, is also effective, with a mix of memorable themes and tense, suspenseful cues.Overall, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a fantastic entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with a strong plot, excellent acting, and well-executed action scenes.

A huge improvement over the first with a touch of tone from The Avengers! Let's hope it carries on that way.,"It's been three years since the First Avenger made it to the big screen and has made his move going through the Marvel marathon starting with his first solo movie and then continuing with 2012's crossover Avengers movie. He's played by Chris Evans, the guy (the actor not the other one) that played Johnny Storm/Human Torch in Marvel's Fantastic Four movies if that sound's familiar to some.As Captain America/Steve Rogers still struggles settling into the world he's living in after defeating the Hitler-like villain Red Skull in World War II and then waking up in the modern world in the disappointing first movie, a new threat comes in sight: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier. But with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury (the 65-year-old Samuel L. Jackson), Falcon (Anthony Mackle) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) beside him, he can defeat the threat once and for all. If it is possible to stop him.Unlike many badly developed super villains like Parallax from the dreadfully disappointing ""Green Lantern"", Red Skull from the first Captain America movie and General Zod from the last year's dreadfully unevenly paced Man of Steel, the Winter Soldier is not a badly developed super villain; he could be one of the best. He wears a mask that seems far more complex than the one Tom Hardy's Bane wears in The Dark Knight Rises. At one point I thought it was played by The Hobbit's Richard Armatage (Thorin Oakenshield) but he wasn't, it was played by Sebastian Stan.There's a new hero in town: Falcon (Sam Wilson, real name), a new superhero that can fly like a talented bird of prey. He is played by Anthony Mackle who you may recognise from last year's ""experimental"" Gangster Squad. When he and Cap have screen-time together, I thought it was familiar to the Iron Man duo (Robert Downey, Jr. and Don Cheadle). Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow probably has more screen-time than in previous films. Her hair style's changed from short to long, but her fight scenes certainly haven't changed.This is probably a Marvel movie we've been waiting for. If you've watched 'Avengers Assemble' you may find a few elements in this a little familiar. This is proof that the Marvel movies are getting better. Before 'Avengers Assemble', some of the Marvel movies were average. It was the 'Thor' and 'Captain America' predecessors that sucked, and a little of the Hulk remake (not completely) but no way the Iron Man predecessors sucked, although it was said that Iron Man 2 wasn't as good as the original, it doesn't mean to say it sucked.So this is how the sequel is and should be taught as: bigger, better, and darker than its predecessor. Because the predecessor was set back in World War II time, it had old fashioned superhero set-pieces meanwhile this one has modern Avengers-like set-pieces. Although this is way better that The First Avenger, I'm not sure whether this even beats off Iron Man 3 but it is the best Marvel film since it though.Like I've said, it keeps close to 'Avengers Assemble', but doesn't beat it (probably next year's Age of Ultron will very well do). The action is exhilarating but unlike Iron Man 3 and Avengers' action, this action had less excitement in its heart to thrill me. I'm not completely criticising it all, but one little inch in perspective. This is a BIG sequel but its action had no heat-pounding substance to blow me away; I don't know it may be me or 'it'; you'll have to see for yourself.Ah yes, the one I must never forgot: the 3D. Now here's my verdict: good but not challenging enough. It's eye-popping, with the close-ups of faces, but in this one no stars and stripes shield comes flying at you or other catchy effects. It could be worth seeing in 3D if you're really bothered, but I don't think it matters, the experience is probably mainly for 2D but it's up to you.Like Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, The Winter Soldier is a ""true"" sequel, even if it's trapped within the Marvel universe. It's not like Star Trek into Darkness where you could actually watch that sequel before the first one and it actually makes sense, the first Cap America you need to see before this one otherwise you probably won't know what the heck is going on (well maybe in the first act).Although this is probably the best one since Iron Man 3, its hero probably isn't the best of the Avengers. Some may find him a little boring. He has a steel shield that can be used for throwing and bouncing off things like a boomerang; without it, he can only use his fists. Not many powers for him. He's like Thor: he has a steel hammer that he throws and comes back to him unhanded. Don't you like superheroes with only one piece of weaponry and that's it? I don't really notice that. I just respect superheroes the way they are; not with how much weaponry they've got.Marvel still goes on with humour, especially after 'Avengers Assemble' that was funnier than probably any other superhero movies at the time. A little amusing when Sam Wilson/Falcon asks Cap which people would be the bad guys during a fight. I would ruin the answer for you. There are still some wacky action moments too. There's one when Cap single-handedly takes down a ship in less than 10 seconds. But it's too quick to get you enthralled.Captain America is going well and hopefully will keep doing it as well in the future. Who knows what he has in store for his next outing. And by the way, stay for the end credits; otherwise you'll miss something special",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is the best mcu movie period.,"I don't know how did they do this but this movie is just amazing. The characters are very intriguing and well rounded.

Captain America is lost in this new, alien world (for him) and he tries to find himself in new enviroment. I really like this movie because it tells a story, is expands on the world and characters in it. The heroes of this movie face certain challanges on their way and they must use their skills to overcome them. They feel very balanced but you can feel when they are vulnerable not like jane thor or again, america chavez which are just invincible. In newer films when the heroes just have to believe that they were the best from the begining, there is no tension and in this one you are sitting on the edge of your chair for the whole time. They know that this is a problem with the newer installments because captain marvel had to be sent to some distant galaxy in one of the films because she is just to powerful.

An unexpectedly good super hero movie,"By the time I sat down to watch this I have already heard quite a lot from the comic fans that this is beyond what they actually hoped to see. Captain America being sort of a side roll in the Avengers and the first movie being somewhat less attractive than many other Marvel flicks I had mixed feelings. But Captain America: The Winter Soldier bitch slapped me and caught me at the first punch. And it's simply overwhelming to witness that this has being one of the best super hero movies up to date and for over two long hours it's just intense and gripping as its first 10 minutes. And Chris Evans just climbed my favorite super hero ladder a few notches with a Ka-Boooom.I don't want to waste my words explain the plot a lot. It does what super hero movies supposed to do and it's heroic, adventures etc with lots and lots of plot holes. But hay no one expect top notch script from a superhero movie so it doesn't matter. But what it really matters is that Captain America: The Winter Soldier pulls off all the unimaginable and far-fetched stunts so easily and the viewers are kept on the edge of their seats and it gives no time to relax. The sheer amount of mind blowing action that appears within short intervals are just awesome. And the interesting thing is one after the other they become stronger and better and has its unique twists to make them differentiate from the previous.What make Captain America: The Winter Soldier so good is that it's brilliant flow. There is no second wasted and no punches thrown in vain. And there is awesome sense of tense and unrest steadily built without putting too much pressure or indigestible acceleration of events. And visually the movie delivers a feast with super good CG combined with live action.Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an unexpectedly good super hero movie. And it's being a while since we have witnessed one. And it can be simply enjoyed even if anyone does not have a thorough knowledge about the previous movie or the Avengers at all. So it's a very good standalone entertainer. Though I have no high hopes for a better Captain America in the next movie as Hollywood has this certain trend of bigger action and poor movie as the franchisees grow I have truly enjoyed this one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not My Favorite. A Filler Movie,"I never understood why this movie has such a high rating. I've seen it many times over the years and every time it feels like i'm watching it for the first time, because its not a memorable film.I like that the movie takes its time. It really dives into character building and getting to know everyone more. But it overdoes this to the point that the movie loses its momentum and becomes slow. It's a very simple plot and yes there are twists and turns which make it fun. But at the same time it's almost boring because of how slowly its brought out. The action is lacking. And some of the action scenes are too quick to follow with how much the camera cuts from scene to scene.One of the big things I did not like about the movie is how they show the Black Widow. They have her weak, vulnerable and needy. She needs the strong Captain America to save her all the time. She's afraid. And that isn't her character. It's the only movie they downplayed her too much. The other odd thing is the flirting between her and Captain. Just no please. It's odd too, they keep hinting to relationships, but there isn't one. We don't get to experience a high bond between characters in this movie. They tried to do this with the Falcon and Natasha but it fell short.The one thing I did find, this was the first time I had seen Agent Carter and Agents of Shield first before watching this movie. It helped a lot. Watching the Marvel series along side the films make them fall into place better and makes me feel a deeper loss for what happened to Shield. But it also made this movie feel more like an information filler movie that was building up to the upcoming movies. It was setting up new characters that would soon come into light.Not a bad movie, but not my favorite.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America 2 is amazing,"Oh yeah, after watching Thor: The Dark World, I was disappointed. This movie, unlike that one, is a well-construed, written, acted, and directed movie. There is so much to love about this movie it's hard to name it all. The plot is so well thought out, complete with great twists and turns to keep your eyes glued to the screen. I love the spy thriller aesthetic that this movie presents, and the action is amazing. The themes of ""trust no one"" are executed in a very solid and thoughtful way. The pacing is solid, the plot advances in a very natural way, and the movie sets up so much, and there are so many hints that I love. The movie does a great job with its characters. Steve, Natasha, and Nick are all very likeable characters with their own struggles; while also being likeable, they also have great chemistry. I love how Steve and Nat's relationship isn't romantic, as that wouldn't work at all. I also like the addition of Sam Wislon; he's very sympathetic. The Winter Soldier is an amazing villain; the reason I liked him was that he is only half human, making him relatable, not just an evil monster. I love watching his struggles with indentifying his past and resisting the changes made to his brain, as well as his relationship with Steve.Sebastian Stan gives an amazing performance. The direction is also solid, with the perfect mix of wide shots and close-ups. The fight choreography is great; each fight scene feels cared for and not rushed. I do have one small issue with the film, which is that the heroes seemed to be saved by plotholes a little too often, for example, a bad guy wating to kill a good guy just long enough for something to appear to save them. It's kind of stupid and not a big deal, and it's pretty easy to ignore if you feel like it. Overall, this movie is amazing. It does everything right; it only has some very small and almost unotible. I recommend it to anyone who likes superhero movies or just action movies in general.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cap Better on a Team not Solo,"Captain America is a real throwback superhero. He embodies honesty and nobility. Truly, he's a superhero that all should look up to.He doesn't do it for me.Whereas the story of Winter Soldier was pretty good, Captain America (AKA The Human Torch from Fantastic Four) was exactly what I thought he would be. Stronger and faster than the most athletic man he can fight multiple foes; and with his shield he can even fight armed enemies. It's not that impressive. There have been so many Marvel and DC comic heroes to hit the big screen that a strong good fighting superhero no longer sparks my interest. I like him as part of the Avengers because he's not carrying the show, but on his own... I prefer bigger, faster, stronger, superer.But I wonder what happens if Captain American joins forces with the Fantastic Four??",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a movie that turned superhero cinema into a spy thriller with political overtones.","This story was a breakthrough for the MCU, changing the approach to the genre, adding tension, moral dilemmas and intrigue to it. Steve Rogers is no longer just a symbol of patriotism - he is struggling with inner demons, distrust of authority, and a search for himself in a new world.The duet of Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan takes the drama to a new level: the relationship between Captain America and the Winter Soldier is the heart of the story, adding emotional depth to the action. The fight scenes are perfectly shot - the scene on the escalator and the battle in the elevator have already become classics of cinematic action.All in all, this movie is a perfect example of how Marvel can simultaneously delight action fans and offer interesting topics for reflection. Even those who are not a fan of superhero movies will find something for themselves here. Absolute 10 out of 10!---This review emphasizes that the movie is unique in its genre, addressing serious topics while offering exciting action.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
this sequel is better than the first film,"I actually liked this movie, which was surprising because I thought the first Captain America film was boring and not entertaining. But this was the exact opposite. It had an entertaining plot and you could follow it. The winter soldier was good too with his metal arm. Even the guy flying(Falcon) had good special effects. And I liked how the plot basically let you know from the start that Robert Redford's character was not all he seemed to be.BTW: Did anyone really believe Fury kicked the bucket?

One of the Better Superhero Action Thrillers,"Belatedly by nine years, this movie review is late. Wow. I apparently missed a lot of the superhero action in this one as well as several bang up plot twists that I should have caught. Been missing Marvel movies for a while, I guess. There is good pacing that emerges with a multiplicity of thrilling action scenes as well as psychological saturation of the bad guys really giving it to the good guys over and over again until the predictable ending along with some acceptable loose ends for subsequent Marvel movies. One of the more entertaining, frustrating in a good way, captivating superhero movies surprisingly. Really one needs to watch it to really and viscerally come to understand the experience for a pure action thriller movie. Hard to describe in just words.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
for better...and worse,For (mostly) better or worse this sequel is quite different from the first avenger. Better: the plot is much more sophisticated with the feel of a spy thriller and a villain on the ground presenting an almost compelling contemporary case (especially with the controversial power of the cia these days). Worse: the lack of a strong emotional center in the cap that the first film had.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier does not emphasize Captain America (Chris Evans) very much, it seems. The movie feels a bit like another mini-Avengers movie, bringing back Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and introducing a new character, Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to assist Captain America.The plot, while intense, seemed a bit too intense. I found myself wondering at times during the movie why more of the other Avengers didn't help, as once again, the fate of the world (or at least the nation) is thrown into peril.The Winter Soldier, while an interesting villain to face off against Captain America, feels a little under-emphasized to be Captain America's nemesis in a feature movie. The plot and main action stifle a subplot that otherwise could have served as an interesting plot on its own for Captain America to navigate.However, the acting is well-done, and Captain America does amazing feats as expected. The movie is filled with the visual spectacle of an Avengers movie. But the movie could have been better if it had more focus on a single clear struggle, such as the struggle between Captain America and the Winter Soldier, rather than get bogged down in a larger plot that could have been better suited to a multi-hero story.Really, what Captain America: The Winter Soldier needed was more Captain America, and more Winter Soldier.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie,"In the movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Steve Rodgers, who is Captain America, teams up with an Avenger to take down an assassin named Winter Soldier. Captain America is finally getting used to normal life after being in ice for 70 years, when he is faced with a new challenge against a familiar opponent. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, there is very minimal amount of CGI used for their scenes. The Russos wanted to make it look as live action as possible, so if they could build it, they did, if they could do anything, they did, to try and use as little CGI as possible. I think that the Russo brothers did an amazing job picking the actors for this movie. The main two actors in this movie, to me, that really bring this movie together are Chris Evans, as Captain America, and Scarlett Johansson, as Black Widow. These two actors are the two that people will look at to see if they want to go see this movie. In my opinion these are the two best actors for the job. They work very well together, and they are great at acting out their characters. For me, I think that this would be a perfect movie for people who have read all of the Marvel comics, and people who know a lot about Marvel. The picture quality, and the fighting scenes in the movie make you feel like you are inside the movie. The plot really lets you get close to the characters, and makes you want to stay and watch longer. Finally the actors for this movie are perfect. I do not think there is anyone who could play those characters better than the actors that do in that movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Was entertained by a movie that I thought was going to suck,"I Know there are probably worse super heroes out there. But Captain America is probably my least favourite of the more well known ones. A Superman rip-off who throws his shield at people? Ye, great. I almost gave this one a miss. But when almost everyone recommended it too me. I was nice enough to give it the benefit of the doubt.Now I haven't changed my mind about the first movie. It was still fairly lame, rushed, and had a lot of poor decisions in it. But they really tried to up their game in this one. I have to say. As Much off a goof-ball as Captain America is. The More straight forward, yet action packed approach this film takes works more in its favour. I was entertained by a movie that I thought was going to suck. And I always love when that happens.""Captain America â The Winter soldier"" is a stand out ""Marvel"" movie, in that its rekindled my interest in the series for the first time since ""The Avengers"" was awesome.

Espionage Superhero,"As Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with another super soldier, the Black Widow, to battle a new threat from old history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier.This was a very clever plot idea. Rather than the super villains of other heroes, have Captain America take on his own spy agency. This is the sort of thing one might expect in the Nick Fury comics, but Cap fills the role in nicely here. (Apparently Cap is replacing Fury, as now we see that he had the ""Howling Commandos"" in World War II, a group formerly lead by Fury in the traditional continuity).Apparently the Russo Brothers wanted to keep visual effects to a minimum, and this was a wise choice. Unfortunately, the effects kept in look really bad. How this got an Oscar nomination is unclear, because the scenes are just so animated-looking. Cap on the plane, attacking it with a shield? Could probably have been done without effects, and now looks silly.At least we finally got to see Samuel L. Jackson in an impressive car chase.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Pass the Popcorn! review,"Captain America: The First Avenger was somewhat strange â it combined an interesting origin story with goofy plot elements and dumb action sequences. In the world of superhero movies, there is an unofficial rule that the sequel is better than the first movie. Luckily, this is the case with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Not only is 'The Winter Soldier' clearly superior to 'The First Avenger', but this movie is also (arguably), for now, the best movie in the Phase 2 of Marvel Cinematic Universe. That being said, Captain America: The Winter Soldier isn't as good as everyone makes it out to be (it currently has pretty high ratings on both IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes).The movie follows Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) as he tries to find his place in the modern world, and that definitely isn't easy for him â the world clearly changed and even S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't what it used to be. He is most worried about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s project Insight, which is basically a plan to launch 3 next generation Helicarriers to the sky to neutralize, from above, any possible threat. The situation gets more complicated when Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) gets attacked in broad daylight, and Steve Rogers doesn't know who to trust anymore â could it be that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised? Of all the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America: The Winter Soldier feels the least like a superhero movie. There's a certain James Bond/spy movie vibe to it, and Kevin Feige, the movie's producer and President of Marvel Studios, went as far as to describe it as 'a 1970s political thriller masquerading as a big superhero movie'. In spite of being described as a '1970â²s political thriller', 'The Winter Soldier' is still a relevant movie, in the way that it deals with some major recent events (the post 9/11 world and WikiLeaks). This new direction in Marvel movies is definitely a brave one and should definitely be applauded.Visually, the movie looks great, which could be explained by another novelty in the Marvel Cinematic Universe â the use of visual effects is reduced to the minimum (which was the decision of the movie's directors, the Russo brothers). The action sequences are well shot and edited and rank amongst the best ones I've seen in Marvel movies. As for the actors in the movie, some of them played their characters so many times now, they need no special analyzing (Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson & Scarlett Johansson), and the newcomers did a satisfying job â Robert Redford was believable as Alexander Pierce, Anthony Mackie's The Falcon was nicely introduced and Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier was alright (despite he doesn't really play that important a role for someone who has his name appearing in the movie title).Even though Captain America: The Winter Soldier does many things right, it still suffers from the same flaw many movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe do: the villains are not that good. By now, 9 movies have been released in the MCU, all of them producing only one memorable villain â Loki. The villains in Captain America: The Winter Soldier are forgettable at worst, and average at best. Not that a movie necessarily needs a great villain to be great itself, but it definitely helps if the audience has an interesting villain to help them sit through the movie (with its runtime of 136 minutes, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the second longest movie in the MCU, which is a little too much for a solo superhero movie). Also, as the movie progresses, it gets increasingly worse, with its action packed third act suffering from some ridiculous elements. Undoubtedly, all these elements â the bland villains, the runtime, the inconsistent quality â are precisely what keeps Captain America: The Winter Soldier from reaching its full potential.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Overrated as usual, they pretend to tryed but never did","Its really concerning the mount of positive Reviews this Movie got, as it is for all Marvel so called Movies. Even frighning those Reviews stating that this Movie has a Story ... well....it doesn't, not really.The Story: They just pretended to five an James Bond/Conspircary like Story but it was far of, with nonsense logical hoops but all that was more like a sidekick. This Movie don't know what it wants to be so you get from everything a little and endup with a mix of something thats nothing.The Action: is as usual nonsense but at least a bit less as we are used to from Marvel and there where fine funny details in it. But at the end overdoing like Marvel likes todo - well its a comic...The Acting: Well, there was no real room for such. Specially Robert Redford had almost no lines and his scenes often didn't make any sense. At the end we have a high level cast but wasted their potential.Bottom Line just another average Marvel crap flooding the cinemas these days, questionable WHY people and critics are so over the top.

I probably liked it a lot because it's more like a Mission: Impossible movie than superhero one.I liked that not only the characters, but the story is connected with the previous movie. The plot is quite predictable, the twists didn't work for me, because it was obvious who the leader of the enemy would be and I knew who The Winter Soldier is. This is an interesting character study on Steve Rogers, Nick Fury, Black Widow and The Winter Soldier. I liked that a lot. The story also had high stakes, I was genuinely concerned for the characters.

"An action-paced, fight-heavy popcorn movie","(65%) A perfectly fine entry into an ever growing and expanding series of movies.

I liked that Nick Fury had more than just an extended cameo with maybe the most exiting part of the whole movie. The action overall is very good, with a number of almost Raid style hand-to-hand fights, only of course the're not as brutal or bloody, and there's more going on in terms of story here than the usual big-budget blockbuster.

Then finish it. 'Cause I'm with you 'til the end of the line.,"When viewed in the context on the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe and the superhero genre itself, it's easy to see that the Captain America films are some of the best. The first one was a authentic war period piece from the 1940's, and now The Russo's Brothers, with their low filmmaking experience, take what the first set up and expand it to make a phenomenally film know as Captain America: The Winter Soldier.This was always my favorite one. Even when I had seen it in theaters back in 2014 I knew that this was the one I was waiting for. Not only did The Russo Brothers improve on the first but decided to make a spy thriller instead of a superhero film. That's what I think makes the film itself so good, it's ability to be a superhero film second. Their idea to make it a primary espionage film is spectacular.Both directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, The Winter Soldier is a marvel to see on screen. Their slick and darkish tone with the character of Captain America coincide perfectly. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the visuals are brilliant. The action is shot perfectly with well choreographed fights and great editing. Along side a menacing and unique score the film is boosted up to the sky with it's technical aspects.Bringing his own flare and charismatic genius once again, Chris Evans is awesome as Captain America. He is so energetic and just feels so real. The casting is something Marvel Studios I feel always gets right. Scarlett Johansson was a great addition for Captain America as she brings her usual great moves and her spy like demeanor. Anthony Mackie, Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan, all these great actors giving their all in roles simply *made* for them. I couldn't see anyone else in their roles and their chemistry is fantastic.Some may see my rating as a bit too high, but to me it's perfect. The Avengers may be their best film but, this is my *favorite* MCU film. That's saying a lot, because I watch these films so much I lost count, I've probably seen this at least ten times. What Anthony and Joe Russo did with this and really the entire superhero genre is stunning, taking an interesting character and bringing in an unfamiliar genre to add was pure brilliance. In short, Captain America: The Winter Solider is top tier God level filmmaking and one of my favorite superhero films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
DECENT MCU INSTALLMENT,"It was refreshing, once in a while, to watch a film not being so much about the protagonist once and for all. This second installment of the Captain America films ventured deeply into another story arc so much that one's attention might slowly slip away even for big fans of the franchise. MCU staples such as actors Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson were good as usual. However, additional actors like Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan failed into bringing something fresh into the film in terms of acting performances. The action scenes and stunts were flawless as usual.

I could hazard a guess that these are all young people, who have literally been raised on Hollywood sawdust and can't even tell a good movie from a bad one.This film boasts a bunch of big actors, but no big acting. The dialogue is wooden, as usual. The plot follows an incredibly stereotypical screenplay arc. In other words, it's exactly like every other blockbuster nowadays.Product placement is very liberally added. The soundtrack is uninspired and aims to propel the movie along with thumping. Plot elements from the last movie are introduced but do not enhance the story at all.Scarlett Johansen is particularly bad in this role. She is in the movie to lure female moviegoers but her delivery is cringeworthy.Finally, the film aims to appeal to paranoid, Ed Snowden types who believe the government is spying on them.

more than just a comic book adaptation,"It's two years later and a disillusioned Steve Rogers, now residing in Washington D.C., continues his shaky affiliation with S.H.I.E.L.D. while still struggling to find his place in the contemporary world.

Chappy Watched: Captain America - The Winter Soldier,"Wow! Sh*t went down in this movie!Never really been a fan of Captain America, he would be medium to low on my ladder of Marvel characters but these movies are pretty awesome!One of the things that I love most about all these (Marvel Studios/Disney) movies is all the little name drops and hints to the Marvel Universe that are dropped all the time.Something that is always in the back of my mind when Cap is down and out, where are the Avengers? Black Widow is obviously in it and obviously you aren't going to have them all together in a non-Avengers movie but it's always this little thing nagging at the back of your mind when the lead character is in trouble.I really liked the addition of Sam Wilson aka The Falcon to the team in this movie, looking forward to seeing more of him in future Marvel movies, as well as the rest of the cast but goody two shoes Captain America was something that kind of started to get on my nerves.At this point as we head towards the end of Phase Two, I feel pretty safe and confident watching these movies. There are still levels of good and bad but even with the bad they are still good movies to watch.A great cast with a great story that will obviously have a ripple effect through the movies and TV shows.If you have watched the other part of MCU than you will probably already have seen this but if you haven't â it's definitely worth a watch.Already have my copy on its way from Amazon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The metascore figure of 70 out of a 100 is much closer to the mark, although still a little high in my opinion. All I can surmise is that possibly the majority of IMDb users who have voted 8 or above stars for this film are teenagers lacking the forward thinking ability that comes later in life which renders many films, such as this, highly predictable and slightly boring despite the obvious fortune spent on CGI.

Much Better than I Anticipated,"With a much needed change in direction, endlessly fun action sequences, and the best acting Marvel has had to offer up until Infinity War- Captain America The Winter Soldier is a giant improvement upon its predecessor. Although I did enjoy this film very much, I still have a few complaints. The plot of this film is a bit bloated at times- throwing information at you at rapid pace that it can be hard to keep up with everything as it goes on. The look of the film can also be a bit dull, mostly subtle grays and slightly grittier shots- but thankfully the film itself is able to pull it out of feeling the same way throughout. I loved the acting in this movie, all the stars really stepped it up a notch, including Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury- giving his best performance throughout the MCU so far. I'm glad they gave more depth into Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow- not forcibly sexualized like some films before it, and I truly enjoyed Chris Evans and Anthony Mackie's chemistry on screen- something that for two action stars is not always very easy to do. The action scenes are incredibly well done throughout, the Russo brothers truly live in the excitement of each shot, as if they are making it to enjoy themselves- and really it works so well. The film is decently entertaining, a bit bloated as I stated before, but it definitely keeps your interest for its nearly 2.5 hour long run. In the end, Captain America The Winter Soldier may not be Marvel's best film, but it is a great step forward for the franchise and for the infamous titular character himself.My Rating: 8.8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A whole atmosphere of espionage, action thriller, a sense of constant threat that grows and unfolds over time","Even in the comics, the Captain was always closer to reality. In the first film, he was fighting Nazis. In the aftermath, current controversial topics like drone bombings, illegal espionage by the NSA and WikiLeaks, the publics temptation to surrender their civil liberties in exchange for a sense of security. At one point in the film, for someone who trusts in human potential, Steve Rogers decision to wear his classic uniform again at a defining moment represents a man who faces a corrupt present with ideological weapons from the past, aiming to create a better future.With just over two hours of projection, there is time to develop Captain America/Steve Rogers. This man's honor is even more evident and put to the test with today's conflicts. In fact, it is interesting to see the Captain, who slept for decades, still looking for an adaptation to today's world, of new inventions, technology and the behavior of society in general. And let's face it, two years is a short time for those who have lost decades of humanity. Steve's notebook in which he writes down tips of things he has lost in the past few decades and should update himself is a great example of this. This conflict of the past adapting to today's world was an expected theme.Other important aspects that place Rogers in his current emotional state at the beginning of the film, is Steve's melancholic reunion with his aging girlfriend Peggy (Hayley Atwell). The hero's quest to locate himself in a world whose morals are portrayed in increasingly gray tones is his main conflict. Has the good man now been relegated to a simple museum piece In fact, Steve's visit to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History exhibit does not have an egotistical character, but it does show an individual recalling the values for which he fought and bled. Seeing that chapter of his life, returning in a painful way, both in Peggy's illness, in the threatening form of the Winter Soldier and in the ghosts of Zola (Toby Jones) and the fascism of the organization HYDRA.
In Captain America the Winter Soldier, certain aspects already present in the characters first film are even more present and guide the entire narrative of this plot. There is a whole atmosphere of espionage, action thriller, a sense of constant threat that grows and unfolds over time, involving conspiracy, betrayals, investigation, spectacular escapes, persecutions in the correct pace of spectacular action. Here, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo move the action according to the narrative amidst many dialogues and an intriguing plot. The action is never exaggerated and unbalanced, besides being directed with extreme competence. Directors abuse high-speed action scenes on highways, in bold camera frames that put you into the action and, for the most part, shot in broad daylight, which makes it much more complicated to hide any misuse of effects, which never happens. Another merit is the high number of scenes of corporal fight, without abrupt cuts, seeking to use more open plans and sequence plans.These action sequences and visual effects are present from the first to the last minute and, as always, are impeccable. We witnessed a great sequence, right at the opening, when the Captain, alongside his team of trained SHIELD agents, invaded a ship hijacked by pirates and, shortly after, the attack suffered by Nick Fury on the streets of Washington, in addition to the persecution of the Winter Soldier to the Captain, Black Widow and Hawk around town, and obviously in all the action present in the last act of the film after the discovery of the great conspiracy involving HYDRA, which extended its tentacles within the spy agency SHIELD and seeks to materialize a megalomaniacal plan involving the aircraft of the Insight project. Incidentally, this last act can be compared in scale and quality to that seen previously in The Avengers.Anthony and Joe Russo have a simple plot in hand, but it is complicated at certain times by editing, especially in explaining the main plot at the old Captains training site, but that does not compromise understanding. In general, the viewer will see, as in the previous films of the other characters, an evolution in the character's narrative line, which will bring consequences at the end of phase 2 in The Age of Ultron. The combination of an impactful action in a context that mixes espionage, suspense, unexpected twists is very well dosed. Even though the film has a more serious tone, with a real threat to the characters, humor, even to a lesser extent, is present, as it could not help missing. Together with The Avengers (2012), it is perhaps the best film from Marvel Studios, and represents a huge leap in quality for the studio.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Dull, dragged out, clichÃ©d and predictable","When I started watching this movie I was hoping it would be better than the first Captain America, which I found severely lacking and bizarre. I am a huge Avengers fan, I love the character of Captain America, I loved the Iron Man movies, the Thor movies etc, but somehow the Captain America movies just fall short. Now, this movie has great acting, it has relatively good dialogue. It introduces a new character right at the beginning, and he has some great charisma and he's very likable. But the plot to this movie is as the title of my review says, clichÃ©d. Every action performed in the film is predictable. I got so bored while watching it, I was almost constantly checking my phone, and they could have made it a lot shorter than it was. There were so many unnecessary scenes and dialogue that did not improve the movie in any way. The ""major"" plot twists barely had an impact on me. All in all, good acting but poorly executed.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a rare case where a sequel is better than the original.,"Here you have superheroes and superspies and secret conspiracies and superheroes fighting and explosions like bang! Cool cool.It's hard to describe Marvel movies, finding new words and expressions every time, so we'll have to compare it with the first part.Budgets have grown, the graphics have become better, and the overall intensity of events is more serious. And then there's the Winter Soldier. The main decoration of the film. In general, it was because of him that I wanted to review this work.Such a movie comic can even be called such a word as: CINEMA.

Genuine thriller,"What many others have said, this is a real movie with a story and characters, plus first action action sequence direction.

First great marvel movie,"This was the ninth MCU movie and hands down the best one yet (IMO) when it was released.

Overrated movie.,"A fine mediocre movie. Not too good, not too bad. It is so overrated. Bad action scenes with shaky cams and tons of cuts. The story is OK. The villain is really good. Had charisma and charm throughout the movie. The movie was boring throughout with some cool scenes in it. The character development for Falcon is poor. He is not given any origin story. No flashbacks yet he is the main sidekick of Captain America. The ending was cheesy. You might not like it. The CGI in the movie was noticeable and seemed fake. Fairly, this movie is one-time watch only. This movie was maybe one of the finest Marvel movie but it is not the best. This movie is overrated among fans.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Winter Soldier is the best Superhero movie I have ever seen.,"Its more real/gritty but by no means too real world tone fit beyond perfectly with the political action thriller style to which the film aimed for. But don't go thinking that made it lose the campy awesomeness of the Avengers Universe. It was still a superhero movie! It was still bad-ass!Speaking of bad-ass. The Winter Soldier himself is incredible. An interesting backstory, that Comic fans will already know. He wasn't quite unstoppable but was close to. But that 'not quite', is crucial because it made him feel real. And that realism made him feel even more dangerous. And The Captain, Wow! For all you saying he's pretty useless compared to the likes of Stark, Banner and Thor. NO LONGER! Oh my, there is so much ass kicking done with that shield. And more importantly so much relatable personality. Fury was amazing as always! Falcon was incredible and hilarious, a great new character! And Black Widow...give her, her own movie now!!! I will write it for you if you want Marvel! Just Please!The final act was incredible, the acting was fantastic and there was some beautiful quieter scenes. The writing overall really knew exactly when and where to focus. There is a twist for the whole Avengers universe at the end, and a very intriguing mid Credits scene, that's all I'm saying.Flaws? There was a few things in the plot that didn't make the greatest sense. But its very hard to notice this. There was a couple of points I felt giddy the camera work was so fast and energetic. That might be because Grand Budapest was the last film I saw, but some longer shots and less cuts would have been appreciated sometimes.Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier knew exactly what it needed to be. And it executed that perfectly, creating one of the most entertaining films, I have ever seen. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Avengers meet The Bourne Identity,"In an attempt to stop evil things from happening, Captain America teams up and fights the good fight. No, I'm not talking about the Howling Commandoes or the Avengers. It's Agent Hill, the Black Widow and Falcon he teams up with. One might call this a ""light version"" of the Avengers, but movie-wise it goes toe-to-toe with it and even stands a chance of winning.For one; CA:TWS has a superior plot. Plotwise, the Avengers - a great movie in all respects â was basically a MacGuffin chase with a big random fight in the end. CA:TWS is a political thriller, a spy movie if you like. Choque full of intrigues. But with Super Heroes...The characterization in this movie is pretty amazing. There is depth added to the already established characters of Cap, Fury and Widow. The relationship between Cap and Fury has obviously evolved since the last time we saw the two, as Cap is now on first name basis with Fury. On the other hand, the trust issues that are glimpsed at in The Avengers have grown to an extent of animosity. We also see Cap dealing with his new reality and seeking closure for his old one. Then, last but not least, the way Falcon is introduced is flat-out BEAUTIFUL.As for the bad guys... it is pretty obvious to figure which is which. They do have a Deus Ex Machina on their side, namely the Winter Soldier â after which the movie was called. However, in the first two acts he remains rather side-casted; quite like Malekith in Thor: The Dark World. Towards the end, this little problem gets fixed more.Then... o my... the cinematography. It is beautiful. The 3D works best in the quieter scenes, when you have time to take it all in. And thankfully, the movie has plenty of that. But it does not only have quieter scenes. The action scenes are equally beautiful. Although the movie is not completely free of shaky cam, it is not overused. Actually, the use of shaky cam is so fitting, you barely notice it's there. The effects are as much practical and as little digital as possible, giving the movie a feel of reality that is very rare these days.If all of this isn't enough, the movie is superfluous in call-backs, tie-ins, references and easter eggs that give the movie so much for viewers who are familiar with the universe as established in earlier movies. Mentions of Iron Man, Bruce Banner, Stark Industries, and so forth. And also, we get the first mention of Dr. Strange.This movie is the best phase 2 Marvel movie thus far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America The Winter Soldier Film Review,"Captain America The Winter Soldier is a thrilling throwback to 1970s spy thrillers and an excellent action adventure. Sprinkled with humour it does what every good sequel should do, surpass the first in every way possible. Twists and turns are aplenty and the 2 hour and 16 minute runtime moves at a swift pace and the viewer is never bored as there is such variety.The film deals with the titular hero Captain America aka; Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), attempt at adapting to modern times. This notion was severely lacking in The Avengers and cut to help with the pacing of the movie. An emotional scene that was supposed to be in The Avengers, was when Steve Rogers met Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), after not seeing her for years. It evoked a sense of sadness as she was the last link to his past. Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) 'Falcon' is introduced and becomes Captain America's sidekick in the vein of Batman's, Robin. Captain America's mistrust of both Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and the organization Shield in general are another big focus in the movie.The film does an excellent job at fleshing out the characters, particularly Steve Rogers, Black Widow and Nick Fury, and in doing so makes the viewer care about them in ways not seen before in any of the previous films. This is especially the case with the Black Widow, who we see more of and Nick Fury who tells about his grandfather who operated a elevator. The main villain of the movie alluded to in the movie title is The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who is one of the best villains in a Marvel movie, so much so that he could become a fan favourite, like Loki. The Winter Soldier is menacing, intimidating and an unstoppable force. He has an air about him similar to the Terminator and the fact that he can go toe to toe with Captain America and be a major threat to him throughout the whole movie, is something special compared to other villains in movies, who are all talk but can't back it up.The fight choreography and action sequences were some of, if not the best, I've seen to date. The first battle between Captain America and The Winter Soldier on the highway is a clear highlight of the movie. The Winter Soldier gives Captain America a run for his money and was able to take on Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon at the same time without breaking a sweat. The same could be said for the CGI and effects which were stunning.There was not much hype for Captain American - The Winter Soldier, yet ironically it is the best Marvel Studios film released, far surpassing The Avengers, which will surprise people who haven't seen this film. I highly recommend this movie. Although you can watch it without seeing the first Captain America â The First Avenger, or The Avengers for full appreciation of the series I recommend that you view these first as you will get so much more out of the movie. Make sure to stay until the end of the movie, as there are two post credit scenes, one of which helps lead into The Avengers 2.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is what you call a ' SUPERHERO MOVIE ' !!!,"Alright so he's my favourite Avenger !!! I just love his class.. his uniform ..his shield . I mean everything. The first CAPTAIN America was good for me . But other folks hated it . They called it a dull , boring and humourless flick . It was everything that a superhero flick should not be !Now post Avengers (2012) . Both the marvel movies (Thor 2 and Iron man 3) were lamentable !!! I mean seriously shitty !! They tried to add humour and action which was totally fallacious to me and in the process they freaking spoiled the movie . I mean Thor was still okay but Iron Man 3 , I literally wasted my money .Now coming to Captain America 2 . Two words - SHEAR AWESOMENESS !! It was visually SUMPTUOUS . Breathtaking 3D effects and an awesome plot . They brilliantly mixed the prequel and the sequel . The character development and cinematography was epic !I will give it niner cause I felt he ending could have been better . The suspense was unfolded very easily . There should have been more struggle . But SHEAR AWESOMENESS as mentioned before !GO FOR IT !",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Thin Plot, Lots of Action","About a third of the way through this movie (a bit confusing if you're new to the intersecting story lines), after THOUSANDS of rounds of ammo had been used by supposed expert marksmen, with little or no injuries, I began to wonder--is this part of the mindset of those people, mostly young ones, who wreak havoc on our schools, a shopping mall, a Jewish Community Center? I don't want to use this as a forum to be preachy, but I go to movies to be entertained and/or educated, and the amount of mayhem in this movie is disturbing, especially given such a thin plot. There are a few twists and more than one time I was jolted by a sudden visual effect, but after a while it becomes tiresome--ran about 30 minutes too long. Even the man sitting a few seats away from me, who was obviously delighted with the first few battles, apparently became weary of the incessant fight scenes.I am SO surprised Robert Redford agreed to do this, and we all know that while Samuel L. Jackson is a fine actor, he will do just about anything for a buck. No one is going to get any acting nods for this. Keep that in mind if you go, and be prepared for a LOT of violence.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Comic Movie Ever,"I would like to start off this review by quickly speaking about a 2012, masterpiece film, Marvel's Avengers Assemble. It was HUGE! There isn't any film that I can think of that would be as big as it, excluding it's next two sequels. But Captain America: The Winter Soldier, although not being as big as the Avengers, in all honesty was better. Sure, you can ultimately disagree. Feel free to and do all you can to try and persuade me into changing my mind, and eventually saying ""Wait! Yeah, I was wrong, Avengers is still better, and I was stupid to think otherwise..."" - ain't happening. Captain America: The Winter Soldier, although not being as hyped up for, and as big as the Avengers, in my opinion, was slightly better, if not quite a far bit better. It's by far my favourite Marvel film so far (alongside X-Men: First Class).Let me tell you this- genuinely, it's more interesting to watch, has better action-scenes, has better dialogue all-round, has better weaponry, has better characters (and they're developed quite beautifully may I add), and above all else, has better directing.Chris Evans returning in his recurring role as Captain. Steven Grant Rogers, the ultimate super-soldier who is upfront against James ""Bucky"" Barnes (a former friend of his who becomes a super-assassin and hardly even recognises or acknowledges Steve for who he is).The film is literally full of action-packed, thrilling scenes, intense scenes, incredible visual effects, superb and interesting dialogue and much more. Seriously, this is the Captain America film, and more importantly, Marvel film you've all been waiting for. It really, really is. Recommended to all fans who have yet to make their minds up whether they wish to see it or not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More of a thriller,"It's rare that we get a serious Marvel movie these days since the first Iron Man but this was totally mind blowing. Captain America: The Winter Soldier too a risk and it worked. This was more of a thriller than just your ordinary super hero movie. This is the Dark Knight of Marvel. The story unfolded and a steady pace and for once no loop holes. Well written. This film dealt with real life government issues such as how far should the government go to keep us safe. The fight choreography leaves Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America in the Avengers by a gap. I have never seen so much character development in a Marvel movie as much as Captain America. In this movie we really get to see Steve Rogers flesh out his abilities. I am usually against Marvel movies so for me to incredible compliment this film is saying something. This is a must watch. Do watch it in cinemas. Truth is Captain America: The Winter Soldier beats The Avengers, Thor: The Dark Under World and Iron Man 3 by a gap.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Why is there no ""Star Spangled Man"" in this? I don't know but Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still a great addition to Marvel's Cinematic Universe.","Freedom is something that we all want; the freedom to work, freedom to play and freedom to live life. But now that the NSA has been exposed to having been tracking your social media pages, email, and phone, there has been a split debate over whether we still have personal immunity. Some say that they don't mind the extra eyes as long as there being used to catch potential bad guys. But a lot claim that if we're being spied all the time, then doesn't that defeat the purpose of having private lives? How can we sleep knowing that the government could be looking at you or me as a threat to the country?I've always felt fine with the extra security as I have nothing to hide, but I can understand why others could feel compromised by their computer trails being tracked. They could hit the wrong link and that web history would forever be imprinted on you; maybe not on a computer, but in some possible super computer hidden is a military/government building. It's only conspiracy theory, but it's reasonable theory. The Marvel studios decided to take a stab at the whole government surveillance controversy in its latest superhero story, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.Like the previous sequels of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, we see where Steve Rogers ""Captain America"" (played by Chris Evans) is after the events of The Avengers. He's currently residing in Washington D.C. where he works for S.H.I.E.L.D. as he struggles to adapt to a modern society. His latest mission has him, agent Natasha Romanoff ""The Black Widow"" (played by Scarlett Johansson), and other S.H.I.E.L.D. representatives to save one of their ships from Algerian pirates. The assignment proves successful, though the Captain finds Romanoff extracting information from a computer. He was not reminded of this objective and he starts to question the purpose of the mission.Top agent and leader of the avengers Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is ambushed by assailants as led by the mysterious Winter Soldier. Fury's seamless death leads the Captain to be question by senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce (played by Robert Redford). This causes the Captain to become a fugitive target from the agency he swore to help. He escapes from the headquarters to meet with Romanoff. They use information from a USB drive given to the Captain from Fury to lead them to an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D facility that reveals that Hydra, the evil organization from the first Captain America movie is alive within S.H.I.E.L.D., secretly operating within the ranks to take over the world.When you really look at Captain America compared to the other heroes, all he really does is lead the others that have real super powers. The Captain only has enhanced strength, which made me question whether his films could work on their own. Captain America: The Winter Soldier crushed those assumptions by proving that the Captain just may be the most interesting avenger of all. He may be a strong fighter, but he's still scared and out of place within the modern world.Chris Evans proves again that he is the Captain; patriotic but never over the top and conservative, but open to letting people making an impression on him. Scarlet Johansson and Samuel Jackson deliver their promised performances with fun and chemistry. Redford takes a great turn in character that I can't give away. Unlike the first movie that was a nostalgia trip of WWII movies, here we have more of a modern espionage thriller turned blockbuster with a hint of political commentary.Captain America: The Winter Soldier took more chances with it's scenarios then the previous film, making this one much superior. It also delivers on the action, giving incredible fighting sequences that's more then shield throwing; it's good old-fashioned blunt fighting and martial arts. It goes with what it knows and finds ways to make them better. Get ready for two amazing sequences that are on par with The Avengers.I'll give this ten winter soldiers out of ten. Marvel and Disney continue to prove that they know their comic boo movies and I'll be ready to be watch the next one, Guardians of the Galaxy, on the opening night.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The best film in the MCU, besides The Avengers...","Putting The Avengers (which is an entirely different level of cinematic entertainment) aside, The Winter Soldier ranks as the best among the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. With great action sequences, suspenseful moments, and emotional unravelling flow of events, this film strengthens Marvel Studios' status as not just giving quality entertainment, but also giving fans & audiences the thrill of cinematic experience, while also adding new dimensions to the easily predictable superhero genre.The film starts a bit slowly by re-accounting viewers with Captain America and his story, so it sets up the situation & emotion for the main plot. The first half an hour felt rather boring & casual, but it didn't really matter when the remaining one and a half hour is full blast entertainment filled with action, drama & suspense. The action sequences are great, despite being less superhero-ish, employing hand- to-hand combats, gunfires, and shield bashing. So, after a specific event happening in about the half hour mark, the movie takes a turn, and suddenly Cap finds himself surrounded by enemies & shrouded by trust issues, and the suspense takes over.The strongest aspect of this film is the unfolding plot. Now, Marvel being Marvel means there will be twists & reveals in between. For the sake of this review, I'm going to throw a bone and divide it into the little twist and the big twist. The little twist (comic book fans will know) is what accounts for the existence of drama, striking hard into the personal life of Steve Rogers himself. Meanwhile, the big twist is a game changer. It changes a big part of what we know in the universe, and brings in a bigger threat in place, thus changing the future of the cinematic universe.On the little pieces, this film (as compared to others in the MCU) is the one which has the most connection to the other films, both past and upcoming. This film has drama flowing through in the personal life of Steve Rogers, and one good thing is that it didn't follow Thor: The Dark World's sense of humour (otherwise it would be a permanent identity of the franchise) but still manages to give audiences the laugh. And yes, this film has mid-credits scene and post-credits scene, and they are the best yet, so I highly recommend you to stay back until the very end.On a side note, SHIELD being a major part of the film, introduces the sense of a political thriller and the vague concept of intelligence, which is what I previously mentioned as the extra dimension in this film. The soundtrack plays a part too. While not every minute of it is great, but when it needs to, it brings added suspense & thrill to the action. And with the help of it, the Winter Soldier's presence on screen is chilling and worthy of a mysterious yet ruthless villain. The fight sequences between Cap & Winter felt awesome, both physically & emotionally.Note 1: I will be writing a spoiler-filled discussion in two weeks time.Note 2: My claim is fixed: The Winter Soldier is now my favourite character in the Marvel Universe.VERDICT:Good: Great action sequences, Full of thrill & suspense, Brilliant unfolding plots, Decent soundtrack, New dimensions to the genreBad: Slow startSCORE: 9.0(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best MCU solo movie yet. Terrific!,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is all you would want from a Marvel film. It has plenty of action, great CGI, decent character development and a cool villain, which in my opinion was lacking in the Marvel films until now (maybe except Loki).Chris Evans nails it as Cap again and here they show us how he is struggling with his adjustment to the modern world and his mistrust in SHIELD's actions. Jackson also does it again as Fury and fans of the character will be happy, since he has more screen time in this one. The real show-stealer, however, is Sebastian Stan/The Winter Soldier. He is just awesome and there are couple of surprises regarding him here and there.The CGI is really good, shown especially in the final battle. There is a bit of shaky cam in certain places, but it is not distracting and you will be able to clearly follow the action. Regarding the 3D - I didn't find it disturbing, although I will enjoy my second watch in 2D.Regarding story and character development, there is a lot of attention paid to the first film. The film also makes you care about the characters and creates the feeling that they really are in danger in certain moments.There are couple of twists, but I found most interesting the main plot twist, which will make you look to the previous Marvel movies with a different eye and wonder how will this affect the future installments.Last but not the least, stay after the credits. The film has one of the best after-credit scenes, which will make you desire a certain future Marvel film even more.Overally I gave the film 9/10. I found both IM3 and Thor:TDW enjoyable, but this is a big step above both of them, on par with the first Iron Man, and maybe only below The Avengers. It is really entertaining and I recommend it to all Marvel fans out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
No rhythm.,"I said I was done after The Avengers. I kind of wish I stuck to my word. I kind of like Captain America, at least I like him most out of the gang because I like Chris Evans a lot, but his movies have been mediocre at best. I thought the guise of 70s political thrillers would make a difference for The Winter Soldier until I remembered that I don't actually like many 70s political thrillers that much. The biggest problem with the film is that it has no rhythm. It has quiet talking-loud action syndrome with uninspired set pieces, unpolished effects, melodramatic dialogue and unconvincing fight scenes. It tries to have atmosphere but it feels more cobbled together than anything. Now I kind of like its idea, the idea that Captain America is unfamiliar and anxious about the surveillance of our modern world, but it feels blown out of proportion in a way that's illogical and needlessly convoluted. It can be mildly entertaining at times with witty one liners and clever action (Scarlett Johansson excluded) but its biggest crime is it drags. It makes me wonder if kids really enjoy this. The Russo brothers should stick to comedy, clearly they were swamped with notes from execs. It's not a bad film but it's barely average. I'll see Guardians of the Galaxy eventually but hopefully I won't be duped twice. I'm out, Marvel.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Winter Soldier is a great antagonist and the action scenes are among the best in the franchise.

The whole film seems like a military-spy thriller in a superhero setting. The action scenes are excellent, and the action is fast and tense.Most of the new movies in the MCU series are unwatchable, so this reminds us of that phase when they really tried to make a good movie, and not bother the viewer with unnecessary things.I skipped some of those movies, and some I didn't even try to watch, because I don't want to waste my time since I've been disappointed more than once.Everything works great here, the actors, the action and the plot. Chris Evans is always great as Captain America, and the others are great too.Scarlett Johansson is an excellent choice for the role of Black Widow, and her character is well written. Sebastian Stan did well in the role of Winter Soldier, another interesting character in this film.The directors excel in these kinds of films where there are a lot of action scenes, but the film works in other parts as well, definitely one of the best films in the whole series.Exciting, fun and fast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Captain needs more to stay relevant,"Captain America's first solo venture in Joe Johnston's 2011 film was met with a relative ho-hum reception and rightfully so thanks to a pedestrian like telling of an arguably far more interesting character, but due to 2012's mega hit The Avengers, Captain America found a whole new level of popularity and the prospect of seeing him defrosted into a modern day solo scenario all of a sudden became a much more appealing venture. With TV comedy mainstays the Russo Brothers behind the helm, hopes were high that the Captain would shun the mediocrity of the first instalment and deliver in what is really a cold war thriller masked in disguise as a superhero adventure, but finished results suggest that Captain America remains alongside the Hulk, the weakest of Marvel's solo journeys.It's hard to pinpoint exactly what disallows Captain America to truly achieve its potential, yet despite this being far more polished than its World War 2 set predecessor this venture still feels frustratingly light on heart and soul and Rogers/Captain America as a character feels distant inducing cold when we really need him to be the beating heart centre of a pretty stock standard predictable heroes v villains tale. In saying this it's a nice change of pace that for much of this film you feel as though you're watching a thriller not an average CGI beat-em up that sadly feels undone by a more stock standard and overlong finale. It's almost as if Marvel didn't truly have the confidence in shunning their usual 3rd act shtick and it will be a joy to one day witness a less mundane us against the world last act. While what ends this blockbuster may be more typical, a major plus for Winter Soldier is what occurs sporadically throughout, thanks to the direction of the Russo Brothers.The Russo Brothers bring a fresh perspective to many scenes throughout Winter Soldier, from an untypical car chase sequence involving Nick Fury early on, an elevator dust up that feels like something out of the Raid and a neat freeway showdown with the titular Winter Solider feeling like a Heat showdown, there are great moments in a film that seems torn between becoming something different yet playing to what the audience expects/wants. Humour littered amongst the film also at times strikes a nice rhythm, which is to be expected from the men who have crafted some of Arrested Development and Community's strongest episodes and the brothers draw out nice turns from Evans (despite not an overabundance of charm, which he is capable of) and Johansson, yet the supports don't achieve too much with Robert Redford wasted in his role as Alexander Pierce.You get the feeling that there is room still to grow for the Captain America solo brand but you also can't shake the overwhelming sense that his best work will always be a part of the Avengers ensemble. A hard time seems to be had figuring out exactly how to portray the Captain and a hero that spends a majority of his time throwing a shield at bad guys can only really be taken so far. If Captain America really wants to take itself to new heights a throwing out of the rulebook must take place, an occurrence that happens mildly throughout this film only to be reigned back in again by the Marvel schoolmasters. Winter Solider isn't particularly bad, but it's also entirely forgettable and for superheros that is a mortal sin.2 and a half convenient escape holes out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My top fav MCU movie that I've seen so far,"As the title of this review states (if the rating I gave it wasn't hint enough) I absolutely adore this addition to the MCU. Perfectly cast, top-notch acting and stellar script, The Winter Soldier takes the series a whole new direction. It is filled with intrigue and nothing is as it seems. There are so many twists and turns and to quote Rotten Tomato critics it's ""politically astute"". Awesome, awesome movie. Captain America is now my top favourite Avenger alongside Black Widow.
It's quite brutal and violent, but not overly graphic. It's themes are entertaining and the emotions hit hard, which along earns this movie a high rating.
I can't stress it enough - if you haven't yet seen this Marvel movie, then sit down and watch it!!! You won't regret it",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Captain America 2 (2014) Overrated or one of the best Marvel movies?,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"", ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" are films that are always cited when it comes to the best films in Marvel, and along with those there is always ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", But does he deserve this position? Many say this is an excellent film and I strongly disagree, I think it's just a good, almost great film. Maybe he's excellent by MCU standards. The choreography, script, direction and photography are things that everyone mentions when praising the film and they are 100% correct, these things are wonderful. However, compared to other films outside the superhero subgenre these qualities are only good. Something that takes the film down is the third act, as the first two explore a much more intimate investigation without a lot of giant stuff and by the end it becomes a generic superhero movie. But, overall, it's a very good and fun movie with many qualities.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mcu films are rarely this good,Most mcu films focus too much on corny jokes and often have rather rushed plots with very forgettable villains. It's hey I was so surprised with this movie. The plot was fast paced and the action was highly entertaining. For once marvel has made a villain right. Winter soldier is amazing (but still not comparable to red hood to those who think that) but they did a great job making this.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another Marvellous Marvel Movie,"I am a huge fan of Marvel movies, so I wasn't about to let this one slip by. As expected, it did not disappoint. It is being touted as the best movie Marvel has ever made. Personally, I can't be sure about that because it's hard to choose, but I can say this with certainty: it is my favourite movie this year so far.It has all the following elements that I love in a Marvel movie:* Amazing action scenes * Awesome special effects * Good plot * Suspense (it had me biting my freshly manicured nails and I had to stop myself) * Twists (I can think of 3 major ones that had me go ""whoa."") * Hot actors (the Cap, Chris Evans, is sooo handsome! And those shoulders, wow!) * Humor (though this is more serious than the other Avenger movies) * Heart * Romance (just slight. There was more bromance, though, I think.)It's the kind of movie that both men and women would like. And kids, too.When I saw Captain America part 1, I thought Captain America is the most ""heroic"" of all the heroes because he is very noble. This movie further cements that belief. Steve Rogers has the heart of a hero. (And the face of a god.)Just like in the first Captain America movie, I was in awe of all the amazing things he can do with that shield of his, which he uses not just for defense, which is what shields are for, but offense as well. I told my seat mate, ""That is not a shield, but an all in one gadget - weapon, vehicle, umbrella!""Also as always, the ending is set up for a sequel, and there are a couple of scenes after the credits, so make sure to stay for them. (We missed the second one again, dammit, Marvel.) And I'm getting quite good at spotting Stan Lee's cameo appearances in all the Marvel movies.I am purposely not discussing the story because I went in with zero idea on what it was going to be about, and that made the surprises more pleasant for me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain Scarlett Winter,"That's just about right, that should've been the title, honest.I didn't have huge expectations when I went to see this film and I was right. The entire film is captured in the trailer and there is not much left to see on the big screen.The plot: Captain Steve ""America"" Rogers played by Chris Evans returns for the second time to the save the world, and by world I mean America, from the faintly remembered HYDRA, the hi-tech Nazi Unit in Captain America 1. There are a lot of references to the first film, better watch it once to refresh your memory, if you can sit through that one again. The film entirely revolves around 3 characters, mainly Steve Rogers, Falcon and Black Widow and the occasional kick-ass appearance of The Winter Soldier. Kinda makes you wonder throughout the film where, at least one other Avengers member is. The film is littered with clichÃ©s, references and many highly obvious plot points that you could predict the story and leave the cinema 30 minutes into the film.The movie is action packed and certainly better than it's predecessor. The Winter Soldier scenes are intense and the sequences are very precisely coordinated. Cinematography, directing are plus points and the occasional humor is appreciated in an otherwise blatant Avengers: The Age of Ultron set up.One time watch, for Scarlett Johansson and The Winter Soldier.(Don't sit through the credits for the post credits scene, isn't worth the wait.)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Right off the assembly line,"Straight off the Marvel assembly line, Captain America: Winter Soldier has a convoluted plot about S.H.I.E.L.D being compromised and a mysterious villainous soldier who has a link to Rogers' past. A half assed attempt at subversive material about surveillance, is a couple of throwaway lines of dialogue. A sequence showing a Captain America exhibit at a museum, is a poor expository recap of parts of the first film and why Rogers would show up to an exhibit of himself so he can be reminded of his own past is forced and silly. Who needs memories when you have a narrator and museum artifacts to remind yourself what your purpose is. The new addition to this material is Anthony Mackie who is forced into this story like a jagged puzzle piece. In typical Marvel fashion, the third act is generic action that takes over the narrative. Very little of it is exciting or practically staged - it's mostly animation and feels pre-visualized by committee filmmaking and has no real vision. A soul deadening scene at an Apple store add to the assembly line feel. This is featherweight stuff that's easy enough to sit through, but it feels more like a product than a film and takes absolutely no chances.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain's Orders: Check out this movie!!! Read our review to find out why!,"So arrives yet another much anticipated Marvel movie, the surprising thing is that most of these movies actually manage to live up to the hype. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is no exception.To give away anything is to risk spoiling the experience for you, so I must tread carefully.Winter Soldier is more a sequel to the original rather than to the Avengers but if you haven't seen the original there is still plenty to enjoy here.Set in the modern day, Cap is now part of a SHIELD covert ops team which includes Black Widow, all under the helm of Nick Fury. A nice intro sets the scene as a reminder that Cap is pretty badass. However, things turn very sour soon after returning to base leaving Cap seemingly alone to save the day and not knowing who he can trust.Action set pieces are tight and well choreographed and although it never approaches the spectacle of Avengers, Iron Man or Thor, the stakes are seemingly much higher and it is made clear from the outset that no one is safe, these are characters that can bleed and die!The bad guys have their own super soldier dubbed the Winter Soldier who is seemingly stronger, faster and more badass than Cap. Can Cap win this one? Watch to find out!This is a solid action thriller. The 2 hour plus run time goes past fast and the action scenes are nicely interspersed with interesting espionage twists and turns that stop you from disconnecting from the movie or feeling bored. There is a satisfying finale which leaves the future for Cap and his team surprisingly open ended. It will be interesting to see where things go from here for Cap 3.Seeing Cap in action is really cool, regardless of whether he's taking down people stealth style in near silence or whether he's taking down huge fighter jets single handedly. For once it's actually believable that someone can be a one man army!Black Widow is even more impressive this time round and there is an undeniable chemistry between the two which helps to really engage the audience. She has quite a few action scenes of her own and Johansson is now clearly far more comfortable in the role than she ever was before. Black Widow was a mediocre side character in Iron Man 2, pretty damn cool in Avengers and now an essential character frequently stealing the lime light from our protagonist.I know I have kept this review pretty vague but rest assured this is a pretty awesome movie and a worthy addition to Marvel's movie catalogue.Check it out and don't forget to stay behind for TWO, yes like Thor: The Dark World there are TWO post-credit scenes!!!Enjoy!Rating 9 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Big, Bold, Exciting - a true triumph","Saw the film today, my intention was to see 300 but no showings during the day in 3D so opted for Captain America, with some reluctance I might add. The original was OK but with so many comic book hero movie releases I thought this would just be another instalment of, keep the characters in public consciousness until we finally created a great movie ( latest wolverine an example of this).This film re-writes the genre and takes cinema to a new level. Absolutely stunning visuals, compelling script and great performances especially from Redford - screen stealer every time.I will not divulge the story because many reviews do this aptly so no need for me.I was absolutely blown away and remember thinking throughout the film - i want more of this - up until the end when I was generally sorry to be leaving the cinema. This films grabs hold of you from the start, never lets you go or interest wain and throws you out at the end as if you have just experienced the cinematic equivalent of a fair ground ride.Go, it will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Amazing ""Winter Soldier""","Simply fantastic. Any doubts gathered from the first Captain America film wash away completely as ""The Winter Soldier"" brings the story back full circle while advancing the narrative of the Avengers. Following more of Captain Rogers assimilation back into society after the events at NY, the movie gives a fleshed out look at the person under the costume. Finally, after often being tossed aside as a minor Avenger, people can see so much more of who this leader is.Humor and action start off the film, and the intense drive continues throughout the rest non-stop. The introduction of Sam Wilson at the start, and the conversations the two soldiers hold as they share their experiences, provide a much needed outlet for the Captain. We see his character develop greatly as he struggles to cope with the past that he's left behind and the future ahead of him. Chris Evans once again gives such a fitting and enthusiastic performance as the troubled Captain America, followed by a large and great supporting cast as many old and new characters come in.Even with so many things going on, the story progresses quite smoothly. And while it ties in to the Avengers, the characters and the plot hold for themselves so well, the film is an action-thriller that could essentially stand on its own. Ignoring the superhero aspect, it conveys modern day concerns and themes about government and privacy in society. It holds many elements of a classic spy and espionage film and does not fail to entertain. Add in the superb fighting, explosive sequences, powerful sound design, emotional weight from the already established characters, and you get one intense ride.The characters, plot lines and melodrama can seem a bit cookie-cutter at times but within the realm of an individual ""Captain America"" film, it's acceptable and works well. With ""The Winter Soldier"", Marvel has created another great addition to their movieverse. It's both captivating and sad to see Rogers deal with his life now, and the film does a flawless job of letting people learn more about him. Simultaneously, there are plenty of references of what's to come. As always, there are the post- credit scenes from Marvel that are very exciting, so make sure to stay past the film's end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel does it again,"While I'm really enjoying these Marvel movies and I'm looking forward to every one of them, I was a bit sceptical when I heard that they wanted to make this a ""70s paranoid thriller."" Could they really pull it off to make a 1970s-style spy movie that also works as a big modern superhero blockbuster? The answer, of course, is yes. Whenever we're not in the middle of one of the many massively spectacular action setpieces, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" feels very much like a film in the vein of ""Three Days of the Condor,"" helped of course by the presence of Robert Redford.One of Marvel's best decisions was, rather than making this purely another Cap solo picture, to team him up with Black Widow and, to a lesser degree, Anthony Mackie's Falcon. While Chris Evans is strong in the role and certainly capable of carrying a movie on his own, the addition of Scarlett Johannson is very welcome. She puts in her best performance in the role here and their interplay and teamwork are one of the coolest aspects of the movie.With some of the ""Phase 1"" Marvel movies, there were often complaints that they felt like stepping stones to ""The Avengers"" rather than stand-alone movies. But whereas ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is even more closely connected to the Avengers movies, it felt to me almost like a full-fledged sequel to The Avengers that can absolutely stand on its own (while also being very much a sequel to the first CA movie). Or maybe it's just that I'm much more invested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this point and the connective tissue thus feels like a bonus rather than a distraction.All in all, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is immensely entertaining, both as a big superhero action movie and as a 70s-style spy thriller. Definitely up there with the very best of the Marvel movies. Oh, and don't leave the theater too early: like Thor 2, this one has mid-credits AND post-credits scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Too much action?,There is a lot to like about captain America. Unlike most of the other superheroes Captain America seems very beatable. His superpower shield isn't in the same league as some of the other marvel superpowers. This makes it a lot easier to relate to CA.Captain America: The Winter Soldier starts with fears that SHIELD has been infiltrated by unknown enemies. Captain America must act alone and cannot trust anyone which obviously leads to troubles. The film is very well acted with Scarlett Johansson being particularly good. The plot is OK and there's only one real gripe I've got with the film. During the action sequences it is very difficult to keep up with who's who. There are a lot of action sequences as well. Think I would have liked the film more if a few of the action sequences were cut and the film had a running time 30 minutes shorter. I'm quite sure that people who like Marvel superheroes/action films will love this though.,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I can't think of a word good enough to describe this,"The first thing I said to my boyfriend when the movie ended is ""I'm almost positive this is going to make the top 250."" And the first thing I did when I left the theater was look it up, and there it was, the rating of 8.3 making it (unofficially) in the top 250.Do not be put off by The First Avenger, for Winter Soldier blows it out of the water. It's riveting from start to finish. Both old and new characters alike are woven perfectly into the film, some we never even considered twice. There's just the right amount of dialogue between action scenes to entice you, but not bore you. And fear not, the action is plentiful, exciting, and executed wonderfully. Very satisfying.I wish I had to more to say about this, but I really don't what else TO say other than that this movie is fabulous. And in my opinion, this is the sexiest and most bad-ass Scarlett Johansson has been in any of the Marvel movies. I thought she was trying a bit too hard in the other ones to be mysterious but knowledgeable while still trying to be sexy, but couldn't quite get it and came off a bit dull and uninteresting. But as far as Winter Soldier goes, Natasha Romanoff definitely just became my woman crush. This movie is a must see, if not a must own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America VS S.H.I.E.L.D.,Captain America:The Winter Soldier starts the new marvel era off with a lot of action. Winter Soldier takes the classic Nick Fury VS S.H.I.E.L.D story from the 80's and gives it a good sharp twist and makes it a Captain America Story. But one that travels the Marvel universe. S.H.I.E.L.D has been infiltrated by HYDRA. the entire organization has been taken over and on the eve of SHIELD'S biggest plan for world security . they plan to launch three helicarrier drones. Each Drone has the firepower to decimate a country. When a tense conversation with Captain America leaves Nick Fury thinking he tries to go into his files to find out more. Only to find out someone has blocked all access. Fury is targeted for termination. When he very narrowly escapes an attempt on his life he goes to the apartment of Steve Rogers. And asks for Captain America'a help. Fury is attacked in cap's apartment by a shadowy assassin called the Winter Soldier. He's as fast as Captain America and as strong with one cybernetic arm. And the Soldier is totally ruthless. As Fury lies dying in Cap's apartment he gives him a flash drive containing all of SHIELD'S secrets and tells him to trust no one. Cap takes Fury to the Hospital and contacts the Black Widow who was close to Fury. As the two heroes watch over Fury. Cap is ordered to SHIELD just as Fury dies. Steve hides the flash drive and goes over to see SHIELD'S Director Alexander Pierce. It is here Steve learns of how far Hydra's reach is. Steve is questioned by Pierce. When Pierce isn't satisfied with the answers to His questions he orders Steve Rogers killed.. Steve fights his way out of SHIELD. With only the Widow for help Steve must find out the answer to what Hydra is up to And to stop it. He also must confront the Winter Soldier again. Steve and the Widow recruit Sam Wilson a highly skilled former soldier code named the Falcon for good reasons. As Cap gets closer to the truth. And as he assembles his allies to take out SHIELD. He finds out the sinister truth about Who the Winter Soldier is.CAPTAIN America : THE WINTER SOLDIER . is a fine action story that puts super heroes into a world best occupied by James Bond. and makes it work. Stay for the after credit scenes. And you'll find out just how far the ripples of this film go. A high degree of writing and skillful direction moves this film above the rest of the marvel films. Add in some fine acting and you got a great popcorn film. the Only Drawback to me was Robert Redford. While Redford is great as Pierce. It seems as if they ran out of things for him to do in this film. which is a shame. Redford adds a lot of class to this production. And he underacts to his credit which gives his scenes with Samuel L. Jackson's Fury a bigger and better dimension. After All His Pierce isn't a screaming Villain from the old cliffhangers who rub their hands and cackle in evil delight. He's a man of this age and this century who knows how to do things skillfully and hide them in plain view. All in All Winter Soldier is the best Marvel film released thus far. And that's saying something.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good balance of characters and plot,"In recent years it seemed to me all too often that action movies directors and script writers felt like they had to choose between characters development and a coherent plot, this one strike the balance as close to perfection as I've seen in a very long while. It does help the actors (as I've said more than once - good actors can work wonders when they have properly written characters to work with), and even more important as far as I'm concerned, it helps in examining the moral core of the whole sci-fi comics concept. The inherent fascist undercurrents of the entire super hero idea. This concept has been dealt with by all the real good comics adaptations, both on screen and on print.Bottom line, it's a fun ride with added value to boot, if you like sci-fi comics adaptations, this one is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Rich in conspiracy and brimming with gripping action, this sequel takes the franchise - and the entire Marvel universe - in an exciting new direction","Compared to his Marvel stablemates Tony Stark/ Iron Man and Thor, Captain America was always on the surface a duller superhero, devoid of the personality that drives our iron-clad man in a suit or the sibling rivalry that afflicts our hammer-wielding Norse god. Put it simply, Captain Steve Rogers was as straightforward a hero as you could get - there was little that was complicated about his retro red-white-and-blue patriotism, nor for that matter his stout-hearted courage and sweet sincere decency.Joe Johnston's origin story 'Captain America: The First Avenger' played smartly to these traits, emphasising the uncomplicated heroism of our square-jawed strapping spandexed protagonist as he fought against a band of power-mad Nazis known as Hydra at the height of World War II. Contrast that to the modern-day setting of this sequel from returning writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and you'll see why it's an entirely different kind of film altogether. Yes, this is a film built on Captain America's anachronism, one that emphasises just how out of place his old fashioned virtues seem to be against the realities of this modern age.It isn't quite the fact that Steve doesn't have much a social life yet, which is the reason why his fellow SHIELD operative Natasha Romanoff or Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is constantly suggesting cute girls they know whom he could ask out; it isn't even the pop-culture of Steve Jobs, Marvin Gaye and Star Wars/Trek that he needs to catch up on. Rather, Steve's real displacement lies in his beliefs and values about authority and control. Indeed, when he learns from SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) about the organisation's plans to develop a new fleet of massive helicarriers whose long-range weaponry can neutralize threats from way up in the atmosphere, he chillingly opines ""This isn't freedom. This is fear"".If that fusion of mass surveillance and drone warfare seems to bear some form of real-world relevance, know that it is entirely deliberate. The past few Marvel movies have built SHIELD into an almighty organisation at the reins of a security council with no democratic oversight, tasked with the mission of protecting the peoples of the world against threats of a superhuman nature at all costs. And so, it is only befitting that the entire enterprise is now called into question, as Nick begins to suspect that there are much more sinister forces at work within SHIELD that may or may not have to do with his boss Alexander Pierce (played by none other than Hollywood legend Robert Redford).Now Redford isn't the kind of actor who would readily take up such a role in a blockbuster franchise, so there must have been something which he saw in this that went beyond just another superhero action movie. As it turns out, he was right. Taking over the directorial reins from Johnston, co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo (best known for their work on TV's 'Community' and 'Arrested Development') pack their film with elements straight out of a 1970s conspiracy thriller, complete with Redford playing a familiar liberal crusader type that is slowly and surely turned entirely on its head.To reveal anything more about the similarities between SHIELD and Hydra would be spoiling the satisfaction you'll get discovering their parallels, but suffice to say that it all points back to the Nazi organisation which Steve had thought was quashed by the end of the last movie. The relation between the two also explains the identity of his titular nemesis The Winter Soldier, whom Marvel fans will know is in fact the reincarnation of Steve's closest wartime buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and whose inevitable confrontations with Steve acquire some unexpected poignancy in the busy action-packed finale.Lest it may seem that the geopolitical commentary has overshadowed the meat and potatoes of a Marvel product, we can reassure you that Joe and Anthony Russo can handle big-scale action sequences just as deftly. The opening mission in which Captain America leads an elite strike team to liberate a supposed SHIELD boat seized by pirates is stunning to say the least, as our hero turns out to be a lean mean fighting machine in addition to his superhuman strength, going at his opponents in never seen before bone-crunching goodness. A thrilling vehicular chase sequence involving Colonel Fury further confirms that the Russos' penchant for shooting action in hand-held for maximum gritty realism - and even though there is plenty of intrigue within the yarn, the action is pretty much relentless as well, with more than enough spectacle for good popcorn entertainment.His third time in the role, Chris Evans proves to be more and more an absolute fit for the character. More so than before, Evans' disillusionment adds shades of complexity to what used to be simply a straight-up hero, notwithstanding the fact that his good looks and winning appeal are still more than enough to win over the female members of his audience. Johansson is an excellent foil to Evans, her sass and cynicism in nice complement to Evans' (perhaps naive) positivity. They make a great pair, and you'll quickly find yourself rooting for them to be a couple. In supporting parts, Anthony Mackie turns up now and then as a paratrooper veteran Steve turns to for assistance; but there is no doubt the scene-stealer here is Redford, who brings understated menace to a whole new level.And so, instead of being content as a straightforward sequel, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' takes the franchise and even the entire Marvel universe in a wholly different direction. There is still good and bad, heroes and villains, but what is clearer here is that the best of intentions could manifest itself as quite something else altogether. Action, intrigue, humour and even as political commentary, this sequel packs it all and is quite simply one of the best Marvel films to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America : The Winter Soldier and the Paranoia of Fear,"Directed with the sure hands of brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (TV's Community) from an excellent screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is easily the best of the stand alone Marvel films and a thrilling action film full of big surprises and twists with far reaching consequences. A superior sequel like X Men 2 and The Dark Knight, it raises the stakes of good story telling and intricate plotting of comic book adaptations in the guise of a political thriller.Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans) continues his adjustment to 21st century life after his thaw from the deep freeze (in Captain America: The First Avenger) and befriends a fellow veteran, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). On a typical mission for S.H.I.E.L.D., Cap and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) lead a team of agents to rescue a pirated ship which turns up an interesting bit of information. Meanwhile, as S.H.I.E.L.D. readies the major launch of a defense system in Washington, D.C., there are growing concerns expressed by boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to his superior, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). As suspicions multiply, all hell breaks loose when there is an assassination attempt on one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s own. The conspiracy leads Captain America to a confrontation with a mysterious, formidable figure, The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), whose strength and skills are extraordinary. With only a small circle of comrades, everything Cap has come to value comes crashing down. Loyalties are tested and just who will survive a major shift in the world order is just the beginning of an insidious plot.For fans of Cap, these are grand times as the filmmakers have chosen a major story arc (The Winter Soldier) from his comic annals and incorporated Silver Age characters, e.g. The Falcon (Mackie) and Batroc. Recently, super hero films have chosen to bend the rules and take chances with tradition. This film goes much further than any previous Marvel adaptation. It features a good mystery, topical subject matter on individual privacy, and significant plot twists so much so that it is essential for the viewer to watch them unfold without any spoilers. The smart script contains witty lines amid a pervasive feeling of mistrust and paranoia. When Cap responds to Fury's state of the art weaponry to combat threats and says, ""This isn't freedom. This is fear,"" it sums up the theme of the story. Think of this as homage to 1970s conspiracy classics like Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man. The film also employs moments that references Mission Impossible, The X Files, RoboCop, and 24.Acting is uniformly strong as some old, familiar faces return, and a few new ones get introduced. By now Evans has become the embodiment of the iconic hero, retaining his sense of justice, duty, and morals, virtues which are downright refreshing in a post 9/11 world. Rogers is a Rip Van Winkle out of his time and still learning to assimilate the world changes and cultural references with amusing results. Evans' chemistry with Johansson is believable yet ironic since their two characters have vastly different backgrounds. In a costarring role, Johansson's Black Widow is resourceful, smart, and deadly as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative whose history is only beginning to be scratched. Perhaps Black Widow should have her own film! Jackson's Fury has an expanded role and reveals more facets of his mysterious background. Robert Redford (All the President's Men) has a significant, atypical role as a high level official, and he is outstanding. His presence alone adds legitimacy and authority to the film. Mackie (The Hurt Locker) is an ideal buddy in arms to Evans. Emily VanCamp makes a good first impression as a young agent, and Cobie Smulders (returning as Agent Maria Hill) provides solid backup.The many impressive action sequences are noteworthy for their ferocity and meticulous detail, but the standouts are a mad, opening car chase through the streets of D.C., and a remarkable fight in a glass elevator that surpasses the gem in Die Hard: With a Vengeance. There are moments of intense hand to hand combat that recall the best moments of the Bourne films on steroids. You've also got to love that shield; the film wisely displays all the creative ways Cap's shield is employed in combat. The violence here is realistically depicted and not cartoonish which pushes its PG-13 rating. Extensive use of hand-held cameras and more live action special effects than CGI lend a stronger sense of realism. D.C. locations make a splendid backdrop for much of the film.Taking super hero filmmaking to new heights, Captain America: The Winter Soldier successfully interconnects what we know from previous films and effectively challenges you to reevaluate everything in the Marvel Universe. It certainly helps to have seen the previous films, but there is sufficient background and context that a casual outsider would still enjoy it. (Fans of TV's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will have a field day as the events tie directly with the show.) Though the film ends with open ended story threads that beg for another sequel, consider this as The Empire Strikes Back of Captain America. That's not such a bad place to be.(As usual, don't forget two post credit scenes which are significant.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfect Sequel and a bridge for Avengers : Age Of Ultron,"Captain America - The Winter Soldier Review I missed out watching the First Avenger in theater when it got released. Well, Captain America will always remain as an the sanest/sensible one among all the other heroes of the Marvel Universe in the Avenger Lineup. The promos of the movie already gave the viewers a peek over the neck and neck dual between the Winter Soldier and the Cap. Now for the movie, it carries a good pace with itself and the story-line brings the gap closer to Avengers : Age of the Ultron. Chris Evans as Cap Am, gained some extra pounds and is well toned to look more huge, especially in 3D . Chris Evans have come a long way from playing a goofy Pyro in Fantastic Four. Good to see him back donning the American Colors. His action execution has improved, thanks to the wonderfully choreographed stunts and possible competition from Seb Stan. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow continues her role with a mysterious past and an aging future. She looks terribly old in certain parts of the movie. In other areas, she performs her stunts with ease and shares a good rapport with Cap Am. Anthony Mackie as Falcon, in his debut ""superhero"" movie dons the Stark Industries powered Wings and assists them in the final stages of the movie. I personally think he deserved some more fire power as he looks a bit vulnerable in that part. Tony... Could you help him with that ? Sam J as Nick Fury. There is nothing to describe his character. We all know how Sam J takes any role and how easily he fits into a character like Nick Fury. Robert Redford as Pierce. Good to see Redford back again in the universe. Even if it was only for one movie I guess Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier. Perfect match for the Cap's moves. A level higher than the Super-soldier sometimes. Playing a villain to a superhero is not easy especially when its in the ratio of 3:1. Would love to see what the future holds for him. Also the future of Rumlov's. Good to see the Russo brothers keep the continuity of the Captain America adventure. Let's hope they do continue as they are raising the bar for themselves. Stunt Directors and VFX : You guys are the unsung hero of almost every movie in 4. It is high time people start taking you seriously. Hats Off. Do no forget to sit through the end credits. They are 2 of them. PS : Also watch out for Stan Lee Now, for Guardians of Galaxy... Ooga Chaaka Ookha Ookha !!! Rating : 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Simply Outstanding,"This review is purposefully vague to avoid spoiling any major details, and that is going to be extremely difficult mainly because almost everything that happens in this film is plot important. So, let's just go with the barebones.The performances given by Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and especially Samuel L. Jackson are damn near perfect.What else is damn near perfect is the way the film is structured. This is not a superhero movie. It is a SPY THRILLER with superheroes in it. Yes you read right. This is a conspiracy flick, and directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo do not let the big name superheroes get in the way of the plot. The script is fantastic and... well... I actually can't find anything wrong with this movie.This has become one of my favorite marvel films. and it holds the potential to be yours too. I implore you to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brace yourselves...Winter is coming...,"As a distinguished Marvel fan( DC as well), I have found problems in adaptations that feature my favorite Marvel characters. I have criticized 20th Century Fox and how they deal with the X-Men Franchise. Recently, I have been proud of Sony in their dealing with the Spider-Man Franchise. However, No other studio has devout attention to their characters than Marvel Studios. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is Marvel Studios's finest film to date( possibly even better than The Avengers). This movie excels in every way possible. The story, script, and characters have to applauded in this movie. This movie deals with themes of Government Espionage, Conspiracies, and The true cost of Freedom which i found surprising while viewing this movie. The Biggest Shocker of the movie was *SPOILERS* when Cap and Widow find out that HYDRA has been secretly working among SHIELD in order to achieve their greatest goal: ORDER among society by using PROJECT INSIGHT: a SHIELD sort of satellite that eliminates threats to SHIELD. HYDRA uses this advantage to wipe out their threats to society in which they think will allow safety all over the world . The movie has a fair number of twists as you see SHIELD agents actually revealing their identity as HYDRA agents (Jasper Sitwell and Alexander Pierce). I was very much surprised to see this. *END OF SPOILERS* Christopher Markus and Stephen McFreely has done a great job in writing this movie. The directors: Joe and Anthony Russo has also done a great job in their direction of this movie. I had a few concerns with the 1st act due to the action and how they rushed events that were crucial to the story. The Winter Soldier was a great opponent To Cap. He had this menacing stature which i found good. *SPOIlERS* But, the true villain is Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. His performance was good. I would loved to see Pierce's involvement with HYDRA more though. Chris Evans as Cap. did a great job and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had a great character development in which alludes to her past ( I hope to see this element explored in Avengers: Age of Ultron). *END OF SPOILERS* Overall, Captain America: The Winter Soldier deserves my ""GREAT JOB"" seal of approval. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Amazing, Keep it up Marvel","This movie was an excellent addition to the Marvel: Phase 2 collection. Effects were incredible, character development was great. We really get to see more of Cap and Widow's personalities that we didn't get to see in Avengers.I love, love, love, that we get to see some of our Marvel Heroines stepping up and kicking some ass. In this film we definitely get to see some of Natasha Romanoff and Maria Hill's skill in taking out the bad guys.I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, this film had me laughing, crying, and gasping out loud. Chris Evans gave a brilliant performance as Cap but the real stand out star was Sebastian Stan, he brought the Winter Soldier straight to life, like he jumped right out of the comics. It was a great surprise to see how much work Stan put into his portrayal of Bucky and it definitely showed on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
MY REVIEW: Captain Leading from the Front!!,"Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. Sometime it does not matter much if your leading superhero is not throwing one liners one after another like Iron Man or has enormous amount of power like Thor or has delicious anger issues like Hulk, because Captain America is our pure old school hero who will talk no non sense and won't accept lies and at the same time he is irresistibly good looking and carries his shield like a medal for himself. All this provide Captain America a distinct identity in Marvel Cinematic Universe. To balance the fun, beautiful Scarlett Johnson playing agent Natasha, her boss Nick Fury played enjoyably by Samuel L. Jackson and loyal sidekick to captain played by charming Anthony Mackie provide enough jokes. To complete the story, we have a ruthless mercenary The Winter Soldier who is amazing with the mask but surprisingly average without the mask. Movie takes its own sweet time before starting the action in full blow when Nick Fury is attacked by the evils. Action scenes are full of well edited man to man fights and climax is overblown much in the lines of The Avengers. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It is a blast for MCU fans and must try for superhero lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of The Best,"For more reviews, visit cinegrade.orgIn the past few months there have been many reasons to be excited for the sequel to 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger."" From Black Widow's promised prominence in the plot to the intrigue of how Captain America himself will adjust to the modern world, the hype for this movie has been overwhelming to say the least. On top of that were the glowing early reviews, some of which saying that ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is even better than ""The Avengers."" I'm sure the question on everyone's minds is: ""does this live up to the hype?"" You bet.The sheer amount of suspense and political intrigue in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" would make it a fine sequel on its own. However, not only does this film manage to surpass the excellent first installment, but in some ways surpass ""The Avengers.""Taking place after the events of 2012's ""The Avengers,"" Captain Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans reprising his role) struggles to adapt to a world shrouded in fear and obsessed with security. Now working for the government organization S.H.I.E.L.D, Rogers faces the conflict of being ill-informed of his recruiters' ulterior motives and hidden agendas. The retro, simplistic era of the 1940s is far behind him, and Rogers must use his skills and wits to take down a possible conspiracy inside of S.H.I.E.L.D. Coming along for the ride are Black Widow (played reliably well by Scarlett Johansson) and newcomer The Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie of ""Pain and Gain""). Together they must take down a force none of them expected to face.Unlike previous Marvel films like ""The Avengers,"" and ""Thor,"" the plot of this movie is much more down-to-Earth. In today's world of NSA controversy and outright paranoia, many plot elements in this film give it a very modern and relevant feel. In many ways, this is a stark contrast to the retro, swashbuckling feel that the first ""Captain America"" gave off. This is a perfect way to tell the Captain's story; Steve Rogers has been thrust into the modern day against his will, and after the fantastical events of ""The Avengers,"" he is just now starting to be affected by today's mentality of security. It's indeed very interesting plot foundation for a superhero film.As well as being a fine continuation of the first film's story, the new elements that this film brings to the ""Captain America"" series are quite good enough for the film to stand on its own. Even those who didn't care for the first movie could get a kick out of them. Among the new characters is The Hawk, an ex-military superhero introduced in this film. This character is immensely likable, partly because of Anthony Mackie's fine performance, but mostly because they introduce him from the very beginning and flesh out his character.Also joining the cast is veteran actor Robert Redford as the sinister Alexander Pierce. Redford is the type of villain that is rather refreshing to see in a superhero film: villains unaided by superpowers or violence and who carry the story with wits and malice alone. He doesn't need a mech-suit or psychic abilities, but he is a fine menace for the First Avenger to go up against.In addition to the fine new characters, every action set piece in this movie is both exhilarating and an absolute thrill to watch. What makes them even better is that they are accompanies by a gripping story with plenty of shocking and even emotional twists and turns. Even after seeing aliens invade New York in ""The Avengers,"" this movie's more grounded approach to storytelling gives a sense that the stakes are higher than ever in the Marvel Universe. Fear not though, this movie is far from a dark one, and there is plenty of that good ole' Marvel humor to give some levity. I'm pretty sure that audiences won't be prepared for how intense the story alone is.It's not very common that audiences get an April movie that's not only great, but exceptional. ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" is indeed a masterpiece, and as much of a bold statement as it seems, it is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. The amount of sheer quality it possesses makes it an absolute must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Well everyone, this movie has re-incarnated Captain America in a very audacious and engaging way portraying the character's charisma in a radiant style.","Marvel Comics have been having a dream run with their comics - turned to superhero flicks breaking box office records in the last few years and also have gained a worldwide fan foundation for the same. Captain America: Winter Soldier is the latest offering from them which is a sequel to Captain America: First Avenger which released in 2011. Now many might have an opinion that this might just be like the first part which was indeed termed as ""An Ordinary Superhero Movie"" and Captain America was also framed as the dullest character in the franchise that just came along with Tony Stark and Bruce Banners in The Avengers (2012) in a normal sidekick role. Well everyone, this movie has broken those jinxes and has re-incarnated Captain America in a very audacious and engaging way portraying the character's charisma in a radiant style.The movie opens 2 years after the events of The Avengers and we are shown that Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) and Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are working for S.H.I.E.L.D under the supervision of Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson). During the mission of saving S.H.I.E.L.D agents in a boat captured by pirates, Steve Rogers comes to know that the mission had some other motive in it about which he had not been informed. Suspicion gets rooted in him and he suspects that something else might be going big without the knowledge of S.H.I.E.L.D. The events turn Topsy turvy when Nick Fury faces life threat as group of assassins disguised as cops lead by powerful assassin known as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) attack him while the blame for the same falls on the Captain America. Now we are introduced to Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), a senior member of the S.H.I.E.L.D who had earlier worked along with Nick Fury who meets Captain America in private and in turn frames him as fugitive responsible for things going wide of the mark. From here the story kicks off into an action thriller with Captain America running for his life and also in search for the reasons for him being deceived. Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) joins with Captain America to bring out the truth behind the conspiracy which may become lethal for the world.The movie works well from start to finish with everything rightly placed and paced with the correct momentum. Be it the conspire getting developed, the well cinematographic action/combat sequences and the twists in the plot, directors Anthony and Joe Russo along with screenplay writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done a estimable work in keeping things intact which unfold at the right time keeping the audience hooked till the end.Some of the most very attention-grabbing scenes in the movie would be the hand-to-hand combat clash between Captain America and Winter Soldier, The Elevator mash up and the well shot climax action sequences which paves way for each character in the movie to save and give their best for the last. The characters in the movie have been well designed and portrayed on the screen with everyone given equal importance in story and screenplay.The movie has lots of surprises in it and sure to leave the viewer with a smile and anticipation for what is to come forth in the next sequel and furthermore if you haven't seen Captain America: First Avenger even once means please make sure that you are updated of its events and happening since both movies are interconnected else you may feel that this movie going out of league into another horizon. For fans of Marvel Universe, Superhero Action Flicks and most of all Avengers Franchise, this movie worth watching for its neat and best work and do stay till the final end credits.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Blown Away,"Well you probably don't need a review to go watch a MARVEL movie these days. They are just shifting gears of awesomeness. I am writing one just for my satisfaction.Captain America The Winter Soldier is another shift in this Avenger's gear but with full throttle. This film is much more grittier than the 1st one yet manages to deliver the Marvel brand humor too. The story is about Captain America taking on the hostile organization inside S.H.I.E.L.D who has the Winter Soldier at their disposal. This movie has non stop action, probably the most in The Avenger's franchise, yet it never bores you or tires you.Chris Evans cakewalks through his role. Antony Mackie has done really well too. This time we see a different Nick Fury in this film with Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johannsen as black widow delivers a compelling performance. Special mention to Sebastian Stan for the cold faced Winter Soldier. Do wait and watch the post credit scenes as they leave us wanting for more.I don't have to specifically tell everyone to watch this movie. I know you will be. But do watch as soon as I can and enjoy this one hell of a ride!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captain America Rocks Your World -Semi Spoiler Alert,"To add something different, the psychological punches this film delivers are exceptional. Watching the trailers someone is being asked to save the world one more time--well it turns out it's not Cap being asked to do it! That is electrifying when you find out who is being asked to ""save the world,"" and under which eye's view. Awesome psyche effect. Another is pitting old against new--Cap's old costume, Falcon's old suit against mega machines--are all ways to underscore old values winning out over big gun technology. This film keeps you guessing who is on which side, and you never know, until the chips are down. A question for all is, if you were the tech being commanded to pull the switch, what would your choice be? The movie invites these questions boldly to your mind, as you are put in the place of any of the individuals. The villain scenes are great in how calculated some are, and how blindly following others are. It's just as terrifying how politicos murder their everyday workers as it is how a super weapon takes a mouth bit in without question. The information age plays an important part in exposing evil as it does the weaknesses and threats any individual could be to the powers that be. No one is immune to the character assessments the characters can at any time choose to be true to or go against when the time is right. Awesome!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best action scenes ever filmed,"There has been amazing fight/action scenes in previous superhero movies but the ones in this film just bring them to another level. Also the fact that Cap has no real super powers and has to fight everyone hand to hand just adds more realism to the fight/action scenes.IF there can be any complaint it's that it almost doesn't feel like a ""real"" super hero movie. I mean Cap doesn't have a secret identity, he has no real powers, and the enemies he face don't have real ""powers"" either. So everything feels very grounded and realistic. So the movie ends up having a very different feel from the Avengers/Thor, or even Iron Man. It feels more like a Bourne style movie where it's more like a political thriller (with incredible action scenes).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The greatest comic book film so far,"On a personal note, after Batman Begins, after The Avengers and after the evolution of the comic book movie from a cult audience pleaser to an award winning blockbuster, I thought to myself. Well where could it go from here.The answer is, here.From the first moment to the last breath, this film totally blew me away on a level I couldn't predict. With Iron Man and The Avengers itself getting most of the critical praise and fan support it was clear to me that Chris Evan's, Steve Rogers was in need of a boost, many fans also argued that ol' Cap got the least amount of treatment out of the Avengers. If this is so then I chock it up to him being the proverbial 'fish out of water' for that film.From that last statement I can go on to say that the 'fish out of water' thing is a central thing to this film as Steve Rogers fights to face his new place in the world, having been thrust from WWII into present day in the span of a heartbeat. And Chris Evans handles this pressure with excellence, Evans is loaded with a powerhouse performance throughout and aided by a stellar supporting cast including Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson, Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury, Cobie Smulder's Maria Hill, Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce, Frank Grillo's Brock Rumlow and Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier.In stark contrast to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) films we have seen so far, this film can be truly accessible for 'semi' intense comic fans as well as the die hard as the films genre feels more along the lines of an epic action/political thriller than the spandex laden days of old.Trust me, you need to see this film man. The Russo Brothers have created the MCU equivalent of 'The Empire Strikes Back' here and it does not disappoint.If The Avengers left you on the edge of your seat, then The Winter Soldier will leave you hovering in the aisle!FP",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not nearly as good as the first......,"Ya know special effects will only take a movie so far...... That is what this film struggles with in my opinion. This sequel to captain America had entertaining action sequences, but whenever somebody wasn't getting shot or cars weren't flipping, the movie was pretty boring. I just didn't have a good rims with this film like i thought I was going to. I thought the movie kinda drug along in places, and I spent a good portion of the film being bored. I know this movie was pretty darn successful as far as critic and audience reviews go, but I just wasn't that impressed by it. Also, the script and dialogue really was not that great at all, pretty dull If you ask me. I will say that Chris Evans did do a good job, as he did in the first film. I didn't really like Samuel L. Jackson in this movie, I didn't think his performance was up to par. Scarlett Johanson did well with her source material. Overall I think a 4/10 is fair.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Thrilling in every way,"This movie brings out the best in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Every character from Steve Rogers to Agent Maria has their own development. The storyline is exceptionally well crafted to a fulfilling and satisfying ending. The CGI is impeccable as well (and I thought the CGI in Iron Man 3 was already good!).Winter Soldier has many action sequences as well and I'm sure this will please many die hard Marvel fans. There were many humors as well, albeit they are somewhat mild, but the combined effect of the right placement of humor is extremely gratifying.The acting of Chris Evans and Scarlett are amazing too. Love seeing both of them together as they always bring out the funniest moment of the movie. Sebastian Stan is a good choice for villain for he brings out the darkness of Winter Soldier and many hidden stories of himself.If you've watched The First Avenger, it's a no doubt that Winter Soldier is a must watch for you. In fact, it's a must watch for everyone, even those non-Marvel fans! Stay till after the credits have finished rolling for the post credits scene.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I loved this sequel!,"I went into this film with a lot of expectations and I must say they were surpassed.Once again Marvel gives us another entertaining film leading up to Avengers Age of Ultron.The action in this film was exciting,fun and very intense.It was light hearted in tone which helped the film a lot.It had a lot of subtle moments that i did not expect.Chris Evans continues to own this role and really does a great job.I loved Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow:She's sexy,tough and a really exciting presence on screen.The winter soldier himself is very hardcore and If you see the film you will know what i mean.Veteran actors like Samuel L Jackson and Robert Redford do a great job in the film to their credit.If you go see it keep 2 things in mind:Go with an open mind and stay after the end credits.Trust me its worth it.A very solid sequel and to me It gave me more thrills than Man of Steel and The Dark knight sequels.Yes that's saying a lot but that's just my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Packs a high standard of excellence. One of the Best All-Time.,"All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Captain America The Winter Soldier is such a movie. It's the best big budget movie that I've seen since Avengers. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining an intriguing plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of true patriotism, honor, duty and puts it all together in one amazing package. This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the thrills. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Steve Rogers. His never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes this hero more interesting then most. He remains the ""good man"" his creator instructed him to be in the first film even through the most trying of times.This movie delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stunning,"I just finished watching the new ""Captain America""; and, I have to say, I was stunned!I mean, yes, I kind of thought I would like it a little bit. It is a Marvel Comics/Disney production, and they have been making some incredible special effects movies lately; but the previews in no way prepared me for what I was about to see. They said they were going to take the ""tough guy"" image up a notch, but I think it was more like three. If you are an action fan, you will enjoy this movie. I would describe it as kind of a ""Bruce Lee meets Iron Man"" movie. As a martial artist, I rarely see choreography that good (outside Lee, perhaps Steven Seagal or Matt Damon in the Bourne series).It is very Hollywood after all, so some of it is way over the top; but, again I say, I was stunned! The amount of talent that God has given is simply awesome.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
