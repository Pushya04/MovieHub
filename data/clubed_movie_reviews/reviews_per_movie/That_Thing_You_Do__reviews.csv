"Familiar tale told freshly, with appealing cast","We've sorta been down this road before: 1960s pop band makes it out of their dead-end hometown for Hollywood, but fame and fortune unravel the fun. Still, this picture has remarkable focus, careful period detail, and a lovely cast that rarely (if ever) strikes a false note. If some of the young actors sometimes seem like they're doing Tom Hanks impersonations, that's okay because director Hanks (himself a co-star) seems to know these characters inside and out--and he likes them. We in the audience are quick to respond, and even the conventional parts of the movie work because Hanks rides over clich√©s with verve and enthusiasm and wit. Not a raucous comedy a la ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" (which is what it looked like to me in the ads), this has its share of subtle moments. There is a mean-spirited dig at the Frankie & Annette ""Beach Party"" flicks, and the ready-made romance at the end is sugar-coated, but ""That Thing You Do!"" is immensely likable. It has a huge heart. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"sweet, nostalgic story of a rock band","My guess is that Tom Hanks is a really nice guy. He certainly seems like it when he's interviewed, and since he wrote and directed this movie, and it's really nice, too, that seems to be more evidence.This is a very small movie. It has no pretensions, but just tells a simple story about a small-town band that makes good. It paints a nostalgic picture of the 60's -- I grew up in a small town during that time, and life wasn't so idyllic in my town -- but it isn't trying for gritty realism. The cast is attractive and more than adequate (some are quite good, including Hanks as the band's manager), and the story is observant enough to be an enjoyable confection. It's very nice family movie (my kids liked it, and so did I).",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A great little film with cult movie ambitions,"""That Thing You Do!"" is a perfect film about a group of guys in the mid-1960's inspired by Thelonius Monk-type jazz and Beatles-esque pop music. With one hit single, they are catapulted to clean-shaven, teen idol stardom. The band ""The Wonders"" could easily have been the 60's pop group ""The Turtles"" or ""The Beau Brummels."" The film's plot is fairly simple, yet it doesn't veer off into the typical VH1 Behind The Music avenue of excessive sex and drugs. Matter of fact, they aren't even mentioned. Written, directed and starring Tom Hanks, ""That Thing You Do!"" is honest and easily palitable for younger audiences. It rarely strays away from its theme: The climax and downward slope of musical fame. Viewers can also appreciate several 60's pop culture bones, thrown by Hanks himself to a nostalgic audience of youngsters such as myself. Plot occassionally gives way to hype and music, but that's okay. I was sort of looking for that. I really appreciated the ""The Wonders"" drummer relationship to ""Dell Paxton,"" a jazz musician that's obviously a Thelonius Monk reference. Check them out jamming together during the third act of the film. Now THAT'S what I call truly remarkable music. The song ""that thing you do"" could easily have been a number one single in 1965. It's a simple, hook-laden piece of popcorn that's catchy on a near paranormal level. It was written by members of the modern pop/rock group ""Fountains of Wayne."" One can only wish for more music such as this today. There's enough innocence in it to guarentee parents' wide-eyed approval ... and just a bit of angst to attract the attention of hormone-raging teenagers the world over. Definetly an excellent movie for your shelf ... right next to your DVD copies of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""The Beatles Anthology."" Also ... check out ""The Beau Brummels."" Rhino Records has issued a great best-of package. One has to wonder if Tom Hanks had them in mind while writing the script. They had a few hits, though none will be as remembered as the poppy ""Laugh, Laugh."" A true gem from 1960's rock 'n roll.",,Anonymous,Music
Still humming that title track.,"In the mid-1990s, Tom Hanks was on the top of the world. He had just won two Oscars in a row and starred in the innovative phenomenon Toy Story. Frankly, he could do just about anything he wanted. So he went ahead and made his directorial feature film debut, a love letter to an adored era, the explosion of pop music in the 1960s. That Thing You Do is a pretty routine but charming flick like an alternate Beatles fame tale. However, the story takes a pretty straight trajectory. It rises, rises, rises, keeps rises without much interruption, then there's the fall, then soft landing then credits. It suffers from lack of meaningful conflict, instead just showing the cracks til the inevitable explosion within the band. It's okay for mild entertainment, just a little bland. Wish he chose a better lead than someone who just looks like him. Steve Zahn is the only zany highlight who livens the picture up. But it all hinges onto its title song, which is very catchy, if quite 90s. The disappointing thing about the film is it doesn't explore the joy of discovery in this early pop music. Instead, kids just nod when things feel right. It needed much more energy and confidence, but it's a generally inoffensive film.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Meet The Oh-NEED-ers!,"Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll, an era in which even the wildest music still reflected a certain innocence, long since gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap and Grunge.  It's 1964, and `That Thing You Do!' is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie, Pa., who call themselves the `Oneders (pronounced Wonders),' but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the `Oh-NEED-ers.'  Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig, Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy, like when Ringo joined The Beatles, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.It's a lively, upbeat tale in which luck, talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of making it in the music business, including the adrenaline rush of hearing one's own song on the radio for the first time, as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he also shows the downside:  The creative differences and in-fighting which plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one time or another, the personality conflicts and petty jealousies that are apt to surface at any time, and the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude, insensitive record label executives who could care less about the talent that is putting the coins in their coffers, as long as they're selling records.For the most part, Hanks keeps it lighthearted and cheerful, which-- along with the original songs (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an entertaining, fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  He sugar-coats the dark side of it all to a certain extent, which makes the bad things that happen a bit easier to swallow, though it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again, he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his story, and after all, `this' is the film he wanted to make, and he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks captures a sense of time and place with this film, and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film, `A Hard Day's Night,' intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent `Almost Famous.'  All three films are fairly true to life, but with varying degrees of honesty.  It's a matter of whether to `imply,' as Hanks has done, or to be explicit, as Cameron Crowe chose to do with his film.With this film Hanks proves that he is equally as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it; he knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and when, and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some nice performances from his actors, especially Scott, Johnathon Schaech (Jimmy, the lead singer), Steve Zahn (Lenny, on guitar) and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Jimmy's girlfriend, who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden notoriety.  Hanks also turns in a notable performance himself, as Mr. White, the representative of one of the labels interested in the Oneders.The supporting cast includes Ethan Embry (The Bass Player), Charlize Theron (Tina), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Giovanni Ribisi (Chad), Chris Ellis (Phil), Alex Rocco (Sol), Bill Cobbs (Del Paxton), Peter Scolari (Tony), Rita Wilson (Marguerite), Chris Isaak (Uncle Bob) and Kevin Pollak (Boss Koss).  What `Happy Days' was to television, `That Thing You Do!' is to movies; a film that evokes that perceived sense of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the `Good old days,' the better they get.  In reality, they may not have been better, but Hanks preserves that illusion by giving us a picture of the way we'd at least like to think things were.  And it's more than a pleasant diversion; this is a feel-good film you'll be able to enjoy time and again, because it takes you to a place you'd like to be-- a place you've been to before at one time or another, in one way or another, if only in your mind. And that Hanks can take you there so readily is not only a credit to his talent, but another fine example of the pure magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
How to Build a Pop Sensation in Sixty Days or Less,"A ride through the music-making machine with a wholesome, mid-sixties one-hit-wonder. For years I thought I'd hate it, based on trailers and tone alone, but was pleasantly surprised. The film's got some issues, no doubt - especially the horribly tacked-on, telegraphed romantic ending - but it's got a lot of soul and I actually started to like the little tribe of stereotypes as we spent more time together. The theme song is appropriately catchy, too, without being grating like a lot of the era's pop records. Which is important, because it plays no less than once every ten minutes. There's good stuff here, with a nice leading performance from (who?) Tom Everett Scott as the band's hip, friendly drummer, but it's also clearly a learning project for writer / director / supporting actor Tom Hanks. Could've been much better with a bit of a trim and a wilder fire burning behind the lens.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Refreshing Throwback,"I remember when I first saw this in the '90s and thinking, ""Wow, what a shock: a modern-day movie with no no villains, no nasty people and nary a cuss word."" I kept waiting for that stuff, and it never appeared. It also has a nice sentimental ending.The story is a simple one about a group of average guys who form a band and become one-hit wonders.Tom Everett Scott, a young Tom Hanks-lookalike, is an appealing lead and Liv Tyler looks very, very pretty in the female lead role. The band in this almost-old-fashioned musical, is good to hear, too. They are a throwback to the old movie musical days of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. Yes, you hear the same song (the movie title) over and over but's a great song which is very catchy. The rest of the music is decent, too.Speaking of Hanks, he plays the promoter of the group. It's not a huge part but Hanks, as always, is entertaining. The whole film is, and, is refreshing to see.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Catchy Tune Propels The Film,"A Pennsylvania band scores a hit in 1964 and rides the star-making machinery as long as it can, with lots of help from its manager (Tom Hanks).There is nothing really new here. A cast of fresh-faced kids (and a young Liv Tyler), rising up in stardom, and stumbling along the way. We all know what happens if we let fame get to our heads and we leave our friends behind.What makes this film stand out is the catchy tune. Even though they play it a dozen times throughout the film, it never really gets old. Had the song been not as good, the film would drag and certainly would not having the staying power it does. (Not unlike ""Eddie and the Cruisers"", which is very much anchored by its ""Dark Side"" song.)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A very good movie to say the least.,"First things first, i have to hand it to Tom Hanks. The man can direct and act. ""That Thing You Do"" is a movie with no antagonist, no good guys and yet it's a great movie. It follows the story of the Wonders, a band Eerie, Pennsylvania who make it big with their hit single, ""That Thing You Do!"" They are then picked up by a major record company and are headed off on tour. The rest of the film follows the relationships that blossom and wilt within the band as they climb the ladder of success.This is a sweet and innocent movie with no other intentions than to tell a story.

personification of Tom Hanks,"It's 1964 Erie, Pennsylvania. Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) chases flirtatious Tina Powers (Charlize Theron) and unhappily works at the family appliance store. Faye Dolan (Liv Tyler) is the girlfriend of Jimmy Mattingly (Johnathon Schaech) who leads a band with Lenny Haise (Steve Zahn), T. B. Player (Ethan Embry), and Chad (Giovanni Ribisi). They get Guy to join after Chad breaks his arm and come up with the name ""Oneders"" (supposedly pronounced Wonders). Guy's fast beats force the band to change their song ""That Thing You Do"" during a competition. The guys sign with manager Phil Horace living out of his camper. They go to Pittsburgh. Mr. White (Tom Hanks) signs them to Play-Tone Records and promptly changes the spelling of their name to The Wonders.This is very much the personification of the Tom Hanks and his sunshine personality. It is fun, mostly happy, deliberately light even when the movie touches on darker issues, and has a catchy tune. It's good that the song is catchy because the movie plays it a lot. The visual is immaculately perky 60s. This is a happy Disney version of an one-hit-wonder rock group. The actors are beautiful. This is not to say this is a blindly perky film. It doesn't dig too deeply in the darker corners.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Job Tom,"This is a music band movie so invariably I was looking for discovery, ascendancy, peak, drama (drugs, egos, creative differences, a girl), collapse, introspection. That is the formula right? Fortunately, ""That Thing You Do"" didn't quite follow that formula.Tom Hanks writing debut and feature length film directorial debut wasn't bad at all. TTYD is a movie about an early 60's garage band from Eerie, Pennsylvania that made it big. We did get the discovery, ascendancy, peak, drama and collapse, but it didn't have the gravity that so many other music band movies have. The entire movie, even at its most somber moments, was delightfully light. This is a movie you can watch and enjoy without waiting for that real down moment that sucks its viewers into a dark hole. Good job Tom.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A simple fable from simpler times,"Oh sure, we've all seen what this movie's about - the rise of a All-American musical group in the early sixties. And it's chock full of the kind of fellas you'd expect to see in a band, too: the shy one, the wild one, the cute one, the smart one. Obviously these kids are patterned after the Beatles, and Tom Hanks wisely wrote into this one the fact that the ascension of the band takes place shortly after the Beatles' own climb.Overall, there's not a whole lot that's out of the ordinary for this movie. There have been countless movies about music groups or solo artists who achieved success (some against horrible odds), only to crash and burn after a short stay at the top. Some are based on fact, some are fabricated by the always-creative (!) minds of Hollywood. And this movie's not all that different. It's fairly predictable from start to finish, but what might set this apart from all the others is its undying charm. There's not an unappealing performance to be seen, including Hanks himself (and he directed, too, so if you don't like it, you know who to blame). Each of the young actors involved is very engaging, especially Tom Everett Scott as Guy, and Liv Tyler as Faye. There's not a false note in the entire movie, and these kids really light up the screen both with their musical performance and their unerring acting. It's a solid directorial debut for Hanks (if you don't include an episode of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" for HBO).",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Unless you were there.,"THAT THING YOU DOUnless you were there. Unless you were of that age, that time and particularly if you were a male and trying to force your grimy little fingers into a ""C"" chord on a Harmony acoustic guitar that was semi in tune¬Öwell, you will not understand the depth that this movie has. This movie and ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" capture something that was so real, so tangible but has slipped so completely away from any succeeding generations grasp that to try and film it's time and moment seems impossible. And yet, Tom Hanks did it. I don't know how he managed to grasp the era and the people so well as I thought he was a little too young for that time period. He nails this every boy's fantasy with wit, wisdom and just a touch of sadness. The cast turns in, a spot on encapsulation of people that will be very familiar to any struggling band member from the period. Tom Hanks himself turns in a solid performance as a man apart of, yet removed from the music itself. Men of his age at that time all actually read the Playboy philosophy espoused by Hugh Hefner and secretly wanted to be as cool as one of the Rat Pack. He did a super job of directing this effort and keeping the frenetic pace. All of this brings us to the music, which for the most part is expertly crafted (and I was surprised to see Hanks wrote some of the music also) to remind us of the era. I enjoyed all the songs for what they are. It is ""homage"" which is not exactly copying but using the elements to pay tribute to the influences that shaped the music of that era. People who grew up in the 80's or 90's have no conception of what the music was like then. They can hear it, and yes even appreciate it, but they don't understand that it was rarely on TV, it was not the background music for every commercial you heard or saw and radio stations that played it were decidedly looked down upon. It was not woven into the fabric of life like it is now. It was new, it was dangerous and you had to search it out. You had to want it. That's why I so enjoyed this movie. Even with some of it's false steps and it's occasional heavy handedness that would over power the subtleties of real life I found this movie a guilty pleasure that is completely satisfying and an absolute joy to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Lacking a bit of depth but breezy and enjoyable with a nice sense of period,"In small town America, a group of friends gain a new drummer in the shape of Guy Patterson and a new band name in the ""One-ders"". Getting the crowd going at their school competition with their catchy number ""That Thing You Do"", the One-ders get offered a gig at a local bar. The local buzz takes a few minutes to get going but soon their song is the talk of the town's youth and they decide to print the record up themselves. When a small time manager picks them up they get a few more gigs but things really start to move when they get signed by Play-tone and manager Mr White. However with increasing fame comes the adrenalin rush of success but then tensions, creative differences, distractions and all the stresses of their 15 minutes.Acting as writer and director, Tom Hanks draws on the idea of fame and the setting of the mid-sixties to create a film that is fun even if it never consistently has the depth that it needed to make it more of a memorable affair. The plot is the rise and eventual fall of the band ¬ñ this is not a spoiler as the point of the film is that they will be a one-hit wonder; it is enjoyable on this level because it has much that is recognisable and easily referenced to the experience of real groups down the years. It doesn't make these references in a heavy way but mostly with good humour and pace; only really towards the end does the script stumble a bit as it seems to realise that it needs substance to make a good ending and then tries too hard with too little. Outside of this though, it mostly moves very slickly and made for an enjoyable watch even if it isn't that memorable. It was amusing without ever being hilarious; well set in the period without ever having a lot of style to it and interesting without ever really getting beyond the basic pigeonholed characters (goofy one, creative one, girlfriend of the band etc).The cast helps by matching the breezy feel for the film but they do tend to struggle when anything more is asked of them. Scott is a point in case; he is asked to carry the film, which he does do when it is all slick but the attempts at substance see him seemingly unsure of what to do. Tyler is in the same sort of boat but is still a good presence. Zahn is funny without being annoying; Schaech has a clear character and plays it well and Hanks makes sure he has a good support role for himself. The support cast has lots of faces in there with minor roles for Cobbs, Ribisi, Theron and others.Overall this is an OK film that is enjoyably breezy and ""nice"". It references well enough to be recognisable but it doesn't have a great deal going on just below the surface that it could have done with to really make it memorable. Like the Wonders themselves, it is fun and slick when it is on but when it is over you'll find yourself quickly moving on to the next film with not too many memories.",,Anonymous,Music
"Good, fun escapist fare","I'll have to admit some bias going in, as I was growing up in Erie, PA during the '60s. Having said this, my first impression is that the movie completely nails it - not only from the overall perspective of what the music & media scene was like back then, but also from the fact that it very accurately captures the total spirit of Erie during the period. This is no Oscar contender, but is a very enjoyable take of young dreams, good friends & what can happen when unexpected success comes into play. A good choice for a weekend afternoon escape.The story on how the movie came to be is from Tom Hanks & his family taking a cross-country roadtrip in the early 90s. They happened to get off the interstate at Erie one day around lunchtime & Tom fell in love with the city (which is for the most part still the same as it was back then)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Hanks You For The Music,"To date, Tom Hanks' only directorial credit is this humorously affectionate look back at that moment in American cultural history when the Beatles arrived and inspired hundreds of youngsters around the country to form their own groups. Many commentators have attributed the Beatles' success to their touching down in New York in the almost immediate aftermath of the JFK assassination but Hanks chooses not to allude to the tragedy in any way as he focuses on a group of youngsters in the small town of Erie, Pennsylvania where things appear very much back to normal.Sure enough the lads form their own four-piece band, write and perform their own song and gain traction locally by winning a local talent contest. It's actually a catchy little number and once they record it and are passed by their enthusiastic local manager onto Hanks' big-time manager, they're signed to a big label and we see the record ascend the charts and with it the group's profile.It all ends in metaphoric tears as the band implodes to join the list of one-hit-wonders but there's no great harm done as love at least blossoms between the drummer and the moody guitarist's girl-friend while the rest of the band emerge unscathed, the main songwriter staying on in music, the others returning to civvy street.The central character is probably the drummer who, like Charlie Watts, is really a jazz buff but like Ringo joining the Beatles it's his unexpected introduction to the group which triggers their success.There are innumerable clich√©d situations for writer-director Hanks to contend with, from the group's growing excitement at making a record, hearing it for the first time on radio, having it picked up by a major label and finally it hitting the charts but he handles them all with aplomb as we join the group on their short-lived journey to stardom.It is all very clean-cut as we see very little sex or drugs but lots of rock and roll in the narrative but the young cast, including future notables Charlize Theron and Liv Tyler, enter into the spirit of the piece with the necessary energy and enthusiasm. Filmed in a fast, bright and colourful fashion, it succeeds in evoking the era and it's fun to play spot-the-real-life-counterpart throughout the cast from Hanks' Brian Epstein-type manager to dee-jay Murray The K, beach-movie actress Annette Funnicello and TV impresario Ed Sullivan.The soundtrack is catchy too in this fun, undemanding and of course nostalgic look back to more innocent times, when dare I say it, music was music.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"A Hoot; comes very, very close to being a great movie","I didn't see That Thing You Do (TTYD) when it came out, and it's too bad. This movie will--strange to think--rank up there with ""Stop Making Sense"" as a classic concert film. Interesting that 1) they're not really comparable, since SMS is real concert footage and TTYD is a mockumentary, and 2) Jonathon Demme is in TTYD!Is this a timeless movie? Close. Darn close. What's great? Actually--almost enlightening--Hanks' writing is really quite wonderful. The dialog is almost a rare example of direct, effective, ""connecting"" film writing. The casting, directing, and acting is great. The editing is very effective. The sets, costumes, general ""look"" is a delight. The music is very, very effective. So much subtle craftsmanship goes into stuff at the right levels of detail, that you might accuse the film of failing to be like a genuine ""rock 'n' roll experience"" because it's almost too crafty. But I think they pull it off.What's wrong with the movie? Not much. The ending flags a little. The pre-credits posting of thumbnail future bios of the characters is a cheap device; but again I think it doesn't eclipse the power of the mythic payload (the moral) which ultimately has to do with the power of love. And I don't say that in a wishy-washy sense. What is love? According to this movie, it's that multi-dimensional experience which includes not just finding ""that special someone,"" but also finding your path. It reminds me of an exchange I had with a work buddy who hoped to write ""that big hit tune"" and retire early. I loaned him a record by Fred Frith, which put him off entirely. ""This guy won't ever get anywhere,"" he said. But I patiently explained that he (my friend) and I get up in the morning and go to our corporate jobs. This guy (Frith) gets up and goes to the studio. Who's the success? That's a big life lesson, and I think this movie nuances that very effectively. It can even translate to any of life's pursuits, not just music.I found myself being continuously delighted by this film. At the risk of sounding like a green ass, I want to plug this film's attention to a time-honored aesthetic virtue: Hard work. This film is a labor of love, with equal attention to the inspiration AND perspiration.I can't believe how much I like this movie! I feel like a bobbysoxer saying it! I resonated with this movie on many points. Let me give you one example. I was in a little band once and was something of the ""muse"" of that band. Something I always marveled at was how ""the creative process"" people talk about is actually a very simple and practical reality when you're actually being creative. One of the sweet, simple high points of working up a number is the act of picking the tempo. If you've ever done this, you know what I'm talking about. Picking the tempo is a profoundly rewarding act, and of course that's just one small aspect of the process. So the scene near the beginning of the flick where the drummer overrules Jimmy and establishes an uptempo beat to what was supposed to be a ballad is a profoundly resonant moment for me. And the direction and editing bring together an almost perfect picture of the very real and profound joy that this brings to people.There were many, many moments in this movie that affected me in much the same way. If you haven't seen it and you love ""concert films,"" check it out.(NOTE: I wrote a little ""trip guide"" to TTYD!, which can be found at: http://www.ronazajac.com/That_Thing_You_Do_Comments.pdf .

An OK movie I guess,"Nice little flick by Tom Hanks, about a group of teenagers from Erie, Pensyllvania becoming the next big thing in the sixties with their band, the Oneders (that's Wonders). One would expect the movie follows the routines set in this genre, but somehow it stays clear from it. The hot-shot manager (Hanks himself) is even pretty nice and the band don't break up because one guy thinks he's more important than the other one (what you would expect after drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) is considered the heart of the band while he's just in it for a couple of months).Too bad though there is this one thing always at the background: Faye (Liv Tyler). She's involved with singer Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) but somehow Guy is interested in her too. Not that it's an issue throughout the movie, but you always feel it's going to end up like that. But, until that point, the friendship in the band is there and they're just having a good time while their single is climbing the charts...Small roles as well for (now) oscar-winner Charlize Theron as girlfriend of Guy, Giovanni Ribisi as original drummer of the Oneders (until he broke his arm), and Chris Isaak as Uncle Bob. Oh and I love Holmes Osborne as the father!Star for me though is Steve Zahn as Lenny. He's so funny!

To this day I don't believe Tom Hanks is the next Martin Scorsese, but to be fair he does an apt job here and his cheesy, breezy vibe that he lends to the film suits it very well.Essentially a story about a small-town Pennsylvanian band in 1964 who hit it big after one of the members is replaced, and their manager turns out to be Tom Hanks (gasp!).""Almost Famous"" is a far superior examination of a rock band's ups and downs but this is alright as far as Friday night entertainment goes.This movie is not the best but it is easy to watch and will deliver exactly what the people who watch it expect: a few laughs, a few smiles, some likable characters and a happy ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining and mostly musically accurate for the period,"I just finished watching this again tonight and am still impressed by the little details that Hanks gets right such as the period guitars and amps (loved seeing those blond Fender Bassman amps), awful PA systems and other musical trappings of the period.  The music is infectious (I liked the song they played in Wisconsin that Lenny sang - can't think of the title) and there's a lot in there that I still remember about having a garage band back in that era.  There's just so much right about this movie that I'd recommend it to anyone.  Another impressive score for do-it-all Hanks.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
That Thing You Need to Stop Doing,"Hanks playing a kinda bad guy in a throwback musical drama? Yeah, that sounds interesting. Never quite gets to Platinum status though. If I watched this when it came out it might feel different but to watch it now I feel like this story is just so common that I know all the movements before we ever actually get there. That aside, some of the performances are alright but then you look at our female leads, Liv Tyler is terrible here. She has all the emotional resonance of drywall and yet she's supposed to act as this emotional crux of the movie and it just never feels the least bit believable. The woman is just not a good actor, she's constantly bland and flat in everything, and in this case she's too central to the story for that and it really destroys what is meant to be a poignant part of the film.I'd call this a skippable one. It's not bad but it doesn't do anything particularly well enough to warrant seeking it out at all. Maybe if you're a big fan of one of the actors in it, but beyond that, there's just not much here.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
That Moment You...,"Smile with gritted teeth at your kids art project and have to pretend it's great, because you love them very much and you encouraged them to paint in the first place ....That's what this film is like, when you realise the legend Tom Hanks wrote and directed it. This was something he had been formulating in his mind during the promotion of Forest Gump. It would be fair to assume after all the great films he had starred in, Tom would know what it takes to make a great movie.... remember he wrote this after starring in the epic Forest Gump.Unfortunately this film is bland as beige paint. Nothing is really wrong with the way it looks or the acting, but nothing is right about this picture. It lacks any kind of spark or magic star dust that Hanks experiences regularly on set.How on earth could he think this film would be fascinating, exciting or even interesting? The plot is perfectly straight and narrow, with no twists or turns. It takes no risks or explores any off shoots ... it simply goes straight ahead without even glancing around for a single memorable moment.Tom Hanks is a fantastic actor, who stars in legendary films and yet for some reason wrote a mundane, uninspiring flick, that is so easy going, you could go to sleep for 45minutes, wake up and immediately pick the story back up.A college film would likely have more imagination than this waste of reel.Pointless",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Quite a weak film,I had hoped for more and wished this was a diamond in the rough. Instead it ended up being a film that should have been shelved and not progressed. Despite a decent cast and starting out well this film goes nowhere. I wondered what the point was about this film. We're all aware about One Hit Wonders but nothing in this film makes me care enough about what happens to them. A flimsy weak film.

That Thing You Do - A Review By Jo Henshaw,"That Thing You Do! In every life there becomes a time when that dream you dream becomes that thing you do.That Thing You Do begins with a group of friends practising for their college talent show. Their band - the amusingly named One-ders win the contest with their catchy song - That Thing You Do. But this is only the beginning of their success story. In a blur, the newly renamed Wonders become a hit - playing at their local clubs, and then moving on to a national tour with Playtone records under the guidance of Mr White (Tom Hanks) The beauty of the film is there is no conflict, just the excitement and exhilaration that the band feels as they become celebrities and this is can't be shown better than in the scene where they first hear their song on the radio and they are literally dancing in the street, you can't help but feel happy for them too. Tom Everett Scott plays the charming Guy Patterson - the electrical store assistant who becomes the  band's drummer and a national sex symbol with his trademark sunglasses.  Lenny (Steve Zahn) is the carefree guitarist who sees the bands success as a huge lark and just throws himself into enjoying every day. Jimmy (James) Mattingly II is the band's creativity - writing the songs - and also its serious side. He sees the commercialisation of the wonders as stifling his creativity and is reluctant to sign anything to do with his music. Liv Tyler is also a delight as Jimmy's girlfriend Faye and the band's biggest supporter. The success of That Thing You do lies in the little things that are so easy to miss yet are the glue that brings the whole film together. Watch out for how well Guy's family react to his success and how the bands first drummer with the broken arm keeps turning up. Also notice how it is Guy that keeps looking out for Faye. It is these little things that will bring you to the film and that find you leaving with a smile and a desire to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

To be honest, I didn't even realize that this was a true story, but I wondered because it sounded familular. It is a bit clique, but has little twists here and there. It brought me back to back to a more peaceful time that I wish was still here to this day. When music wasn't about hate or teenage things, but peace and fun and dancing.

Different Sort of Fab Four,"Inspired by the success of The Beatles, a group of friends try to make it big on the music scene in the mid-1960s in this film written and directed by Tom Hanks. The Academy Award nominated title song is very catchy (and probably should have won the Oscar over 'Evita') and some of the band's other tunes are decent, yet the biggest sell-point here is all the parallels to The Beatles, including a similar involvement in the motion picture industry; the film is very cleverly done in this regard. There are less hurdles than one might expect though as the band rise upwards. Their first manager (who meets them in a rundown van) seems a little fishy, but turns out to have a heart of gold, and same goes twice over for their second manager, played by Hanks himself, who lectures them about treating their girlfriends right and so forth. In short, everyone is a little too pure at heart for the film to have any real edge; there is no producer trying to sell them short as in 'The Harder They Come' and all the messages about not letting fame get to their heads are fairly simplistic. Still, there is much to enjoy in the music and genuine 1960s ambiance that Hanks manages to recreate as writer-director, plus a running gag involving their misspelled band name is funny each time. This is an undeniably pleasant look at the music industry of yesteryear even if it lack a bit as a drama.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
One Hit Wonders,"I get this movie. And i like this movie, i would give it a 7.5 but i cant. I think all of the actors were rather good and I'm surprised none of them have made it in Hollywood. Liv Tyler is a super cutie might i add. I also think the set production team nailed every detail of the era, it made the movie feel very authentic. and that's what this is- its a story that may not be true per say, but it is soo real and authentic to rock and roll/music industry in the early 60s.
BUT
I kinda don't think this movie works on all levels. The rising action is literally an hour and a half. For an hour and a half i kept wondering what was going to happen... The climax happened rather abruptly, and came a bit too late in my opinion. But i suppose thats how these things happen. Thats life!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
And now there's a 'director's cut'?,"I've been seeing this movie on cable for several years...all the way through a couple times, but pieces many times. It seems like I can't pass it up when I'm flipping channels. And it happened again today, but to my surprise, it was a different, longer movie. I don't recall the original running time, but today's version must be 30 minutes or so longer than the one I've been seeing for years. At 2:35, it should have been too long, but it didn't seem like it.Lots of times the director's cut is just a reattachment of footage from the cutting room floor, and sometimes it is footage that should have been left there. I can think of a few exceptions: Jacob's Ladder is one. Aliens is another. And as it turns out, That Thing You Do is still another. The extra scenes, which were cleverly edited out of the short version, add a great deal to the story. They help to fill out the characters and explain attitudes.Some of the add-backs were no more than a few seconds, but those few seconds--like the cut to the ""cootie"" DJ playing the record after hearing it live--were like the end of a sentence. They made the first part make sense. Others, like the group nervous and suspicious about their new manager not coming through with with air play of their record, are doubtless part of the garage band routine. And more screen time for Liv Tyler can only be good.All in all, I have to say the re-edit made it a better movie, at least for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
LOVE this movie!,"As a child of the 60s and a musician, I loved this movie from the first few minutes of it. The sets, the clothes, the music, and everything down to the small details is represented here to give a true feel for what the early to mid sixties were like, minus the politics and Vietnam. Before radio music became a commercially diluted and corporate industry there were ""garage-bands"" galore and many of the little-remembered names of the genre started out as such. The Wonders in ""That Thing You Do!"" could easily be a number of bands that were a one-hit-wonder (or two or three) and then just disappeared from the scene. Nevertheless, they all helped shape some of the best music of that era, and Tom Hanks perfectly represents that phenomena in this movie. If you remember the early 60's fondly, you should truly enjoy this film and it will probably bring back fond memories. The depiction of Erie, PA during this time-frame is probably representative of many small to medium size American towns and certainly brought back great memories for me of better times gone by. The music rocks, the dialog is hip, and the love story rounds it out perfectly. Buy this movie and then buy the CD soundtrack; you won't be sorry!

Light but charming film,"Overall, I have to say I enjoyed Hanks' feature directing debut(this is not, by the way, the first time he sat in the director's chair; he directed a segment of a Showtime film noir series; I think it was called CITY OF ANGELS).  He did a convincing job not only recreating the time, but also the music, which sounded like period music without being a pale shadow of it. He also made a wise choice for his lead; Tom Everett Scott may not have moved on to bigger things yet, but as this film shows, he's destined for them.  Steve Zahn is funny as always, Hanks does well playing a company man, and Liv Tyler is quite luminous(though I could have done without the ""thousand kisses"" speech; that was melodramatic).  On the down side, I'm not a big fan of Johnathan Schaech, but his character was too much of a caricature.  And sometimes it was just too light.  Still, this was overall an enjoyable movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Bravo, Tom Hanks!","This movie doesn't so much have a plot as a trajectory. Nevertheless, it is better to see it yourself than to know where it is going. Suffice it to say that it is about a rock band, and how its members, friends and family respond to its success. As such, it is in the slice-of-life genre.Given its nearly 2 and a half hour length on the directors cut that I saw, and recommend, it works remarkably well. After awhile, I wondered if something would happen, some disaster or twist of fate, some bad guy to thicken the plot, and noticed the movie was rather long. But I wasn't bored at all, and was enjoying seeing the story unfold. In the end, the length was just right.Also, I am not a rock fan, so I was a bit skeptical. It didn't matter. In the wrong hands, this could have turned into Partridge Family cornball. But it is solid.To all this, Tom Hanks deserves the credit as writer, director, and low- key star, who appears late in the movie. It's a first class job. Not an earth shaking masterpiece, but a well-crafted, thoroughly enjoyable movie.I am a stickler for anachronisms in movies like this. This is a period piece set in Erie, Pennsylvania, circa 1964. The Sixties was a fluid time, where the culture changed every two years; 1964 was different from 1960, 1962, 1966 and 1968. The fact that one of the band members enlists in the Marines, without any mention of Vietnam, is a good measure of the mood and innocence of 1964, versus 1966, when the war had become politicized. America was at its best around this time, and it was all downhill from there.The movie captured the spirit of this window of time. Tom Hanks was 8 at the time, so he could not rely solely on memory, and must have done some historical research to fully understand the period. Whoever was in charge of props did a fantastic job of assembling lots of appliances, radios, recording gear and lots of cars. This is a movie that got it right. I loved when Skitch handed out pocket transistor radios to everyone in the band - back then an AM radio would have cost about $10 to $15, very expensive at the time, about $50 or more in today's dollars.The only anachronism I found was when Skitch tells a customer the appliance is available in avocado. Avocado was a notoriously common kitchen appliance color in the 1970s; I see it was introduced by GE in 1966, but became a tidal wave around 1968-1970. It was one of those fashion things, a late Dating Game chic, when all of a sudden everything was avocado green (or harvest gold), color coordinated so people could have an entire kitchen of avocado, lucky you!. And then avocado, predictably, disappeared. I found a post, ""The Death of Avocado"" that observed it was a mistake to put a trendy color on a long-life appliance, which looked obnoxious after coordinating avocado room decor disappeared. No kidding. I was just a kid at the time, but I could see that coming.See how sensitive the cultural timeline is for the Sixties? Actually, I would say what most people think of as the Sixties began around 1963-64, with the Beatles and the period of this film, and lasted till Nixon's resignation in 1974 (although some place the beginning of change at 1959). After that, the years unfolded in a homogeneous miasma, distinguished mainly by the gradual introduction of new technology, like the VCR, the Walkman and cordless phone sizes.That an appliance color was the only missed stitch in the movie indicates just how good it was!The acting all round was excellent. There were no caricatures, even with the doorman at the LA hotel, who had some real depth to his role. And, although I read here there were pro musicians actually dubbing the music, the actors were totally convincing that they were the ones making the music.""That Thing You Do"" fits most closely the mold of ""Breaking Away,"" which also featured a cast of talented young actors, and a skeptical, practical father representing the secure, dull path. Both are about life, dreams and fallibility. They both offer a lesson for young people. And in both, in the end, they turn a corner and life goes on.This is an enjoyable, memorable and thoughtful film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A very well-made film but lacking in substance.,"The film is undoubtedly well made, with all the advantages of a decent budget and a talented, and often experienced personnel; it looks good and the portrayal of the early 60's media circus is interesting, but the story and characters are pretty formulaic and predictable, with conventions such as the cheeky, funny one who chases after women (original role model Harpo Marx?), the happy, wisecracking black doorman and the really cool veteran musician... I wont say what's predictable about their respective contributions to the narrative, because I suppose that would count as a spoiler, but if you've seen a few biopics, romantic comedies or Disney takes on how nice the world is, you'll be able to work it out for yourselves! After all, I don't want to be a politically correct kill-joy, and I understand that not all films have to make reference to interesting historical/social ironies, but to show two happy black stereotypes without a nod to the inequality of the values of the record company majors of the time seems glossy to a fault. There were elements of American Graffiti peeping through the characterisations, I suppose, but this film, whilst having comparable style, lacks substance, like a meringue.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

You had to live it to really appreciate it.,"I find myself mesmerized by this film.  I identify with its characters because either I had friends who had similar situations (playing in a local rock band, trying to make good), or I myself went through some of the same ""growing pains"" of adolescence, such as parental upset, and the joy and sorrow of a first love.The songs (especially the title tune) are catchy, yet simple, and at times annoying (due to overplay), but, hey, that's the way rock 'n' roll was at the beginning of the ""British invasion"".  At least they have a good beat and are easy to dance to!!Baby-boomers will appreciate how Tom Hanks catches the true flavor and feel of the era.

"Sweet, Down To The Point It Got Saccharine","Tom Hanks is a real steamroller who goes well and mighty. He did many great movies and he seems to do no wrong. Yet, here he seemed to be all correct again, with this funny little film of a young band getting famous and then falling apart due to several factors all gotten together at one place. Here, the story seems to be OK, yes, as a drummer I do support all those technical difficulties the band encountered and all those conflicts they had. Yes, the studio / TV / gig routines are shown pretty well. Yes, the band seems to be very real, they play as if the actors play all their parts themselves. Yes, Liv Tyler and Charlize Theron are gorgeous sexy ladies. Yes, the band is a very funny gang often. And then, many NO's follow. No, the characters do not endear or grab you by their struggles or triumphs. No, the love line does not seem to be deep or decent. No, the final conflict does not smack of being real and mundane. It seems that Hanks tried very hard to slide along the surface without diving any deeper. There is no deep slant drilling of main heroes, there's only some sweet light slight tiny touches upon their psyche. This is a light little teen comedy with a very large chunk of certain shallowness and naivety, seemingly all coming from blurred recollections of Mr. Hanks himself. Oh, and I am sorry but does Mr. Zahn not irritate with his character all through. This obvious shallowness of all four main heroes seems extremely annoying, and this fluffy-puffy sweetness of Liv's Faye leaves nothing but a cloy of too sweet candy. Where Hanks succeeded is in biting certain sides of TV / cinema routine. Where he fails is depicting band's true evolution. And oh, all those jazz sentiments, they are so out of place that one can only rub their eyes in utter shock. Yeah, the overall feeling of very lightweight teen pop comedy never left me. It was nice, it was sweet. Decent or deep it was not. My rating - 7 Nice try, but not more",7.0,Anonymous,Music

A pre-biopic that lacks oomph!,"Before it became the internet's favourite slur, Baby-Boomer used to describe that generation born after the Second World War. This movie is not that generation's movie, that would be American Graffiti, but it is nonetheless a love-letter to the Boomer culture. This movie did not really do it for me, but if you were alive in the 1950s then you will totally get it.It make sense that Tom Hanks wrote and directed it. He is the most emblematic actor of his generation, especially after Forrest Gump, which was also a celebration of events that Baby-Boomers lived through. This movie is characteristically Hanksian, that is to say it is not offensive in any way. It is rather wholesome in the sense that nothing bad happens. It is the story of kids making music, they are successful for a while and then they are not anymore. Which in itself is somewhat Boomer: the band is at the pinnacle, they have everything they could ever want, and then they just throw it all away. Which is a nonissue! A generation that lived in times of unrivalled prosperity and does not even know how good they had it.Of course, the movie does this unintentionally. There is an absence of tension in this film. There is an attempt at drama, but the characters are not likeable enough. Except for Tom Hanks' avatar Guy, none of these kids are cool or charming. For me they felt spoilt and whiny. Guy on the other hand is too detached to have conflicts with anyone. It leads to the band having issues that you don't really care about either because they're ludicrous or because there are no real consequences. When Tom Hanks' character is introduced, you hope that the movie will finally take off, but it stays relatively low to the ground. The movie needed more of the annoyed manager that cannot keep up with the antics of his stars, but even the issues Mr.White encounters, like Guy going on a (mild) bender, are easily resolved.The movie compensates by being accurate on the sets and wardrobe, on the whole look and feel of the 60s. The music itself is cute and a lovely homage to that 60s naive pop-rock. Yet, while being completely aware of the shallowness of it, there is also a deference to jazz and in the soothing power of music in general. It is also on point when it goes on the description of the music industry, and it interesting to see behind the scenes of that hit-churning machine. In other words, it works better as a period piece of 60s America than as a tale of rise and fall.Yet, there is something remarkable with this movie given how much biopics have changed since Walk the Line and Ray. Nowadays these films follow a very repetitive formula, which while enthralling is also less and less effective. This at least is unique and sincere enough that it does not feel clich√© and predictable.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

These include: 1) the One-ders first producer was an uncle whose experience is limited to recording church choirs -- Sir George Martin's forte was comedy before he began producing for the Beatles; 2) Tom Hanks, as the group's manager, stands off to the side wearing sunglasses, exactly like Brian Epstein can be seen doing in concert footage of the Beatles;  3) the group struggles with a name, as did the Quarreymen/Moondogs/Silver Beatles/Beatles; 4) the drummer's name is never revealed, a nod to Ringo Starr/Richard Starkey -- the luckiest drummer in Liverpool. There are many more....",10.0,Anonymous,Music
saccharine and tedious,"Where does one begin when presented with such a dire film? A bunch of squeaky clean middle class white all American wannabe rock and rollers with one very repetitive tune scream whenever it makes the radio station. I was screaming by the end as well. Apart from the bad acting and embarrassing dialogue ('i am Spartacus')the most offensive aspect of this drivel was the representation of the black members of Tom Hanks world. Dial a clich√© because here comes the bell hop who's incredibly helpful but not with the bags but distilling wisdom and sorting out their personal probs. Sure, and in this Hanks fifties dream world the white kids really dig him and not a whiff of racism can be smelt above the perfumed presentation. Then the drummer really digs the good ole blues boys and they dig him. I know i am from UK but wasn't there some race riots or something in the US around this time. Maybe i am mistaken because according to Hanks everyone got on just fine, it was more like the Truman show than any attempt to portray truth. But this is a Hanks vehicle so one must expect the picket fence sentiment rather than the harsh reality of racial strife and racial oppression.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

One of my all time favorite movies!,"Hear me out. I know so many people will tell me it's crazy to list this cheesy movie as one of my favorites. And in a way I agree. With so many phenomenal movies out there, why pick one like this? The answer: because it's fun. I love serious movies. Some of my favorites are very serious. But the main goal of a movie is to be entertaining, and if I just want to watch something that's going to let me have fun and escape the world for two hours, I rarely have to look further than this often overlooked masterpiece. We've all come to expect greatness from Tom Hanks, and in his directorial debut, he certainly delivers, both onscreen and behind the curtain. I firmly believe that Steve Zahn is a comedic goldmine, worthy of far more accolades than he gets, and this is his best work. The songs are catchy and reminiscent of the 60s charm they are intended to represent. It's just a great movie to have fun and sing along to. I maintain that some movies don't need to be any more than that.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

We need the O-needers,"The O-Needers rock my world. LOL, OK so it's the One-ders, I get it now. OK, this movie takes place in the 1960s, when a lot of young guys started to create rock bands, i.e. Jim Morrison and John Fogerty. Unfortuneatly unlike Morrison and Fogerty the One-ders only had a one-hit song. That doesn't really matter though does it, because the song is really great, it was actually written by Tom Hanks, and it's played by the 4 gentlemen in the band. The song is called, ""That Thing You Do"", hence the movies title, and it's a really great song, nicely recorded and it's a catchy tune.OK, so 4 guys get together in there garage and write this song, and they at a talent show and decide to start a record, which turns out to be a mega-hit, so they get a manager who gets them a couple gigs, and eventually Tom Hanks comes along and discovers that he can do more for the band than there previous manager, which he eventually does. However like all great bands from the 60s they have their rise and unfortunate fall. This movie explores that, and it does so in a great story.I gave this movie 10 out of a possible 10, because it's a great movie, filled with great characters, a terrific story and a catchy soundtrack. It's got tons of lines mostly that come from Zahn. If your like me and you love rock and roll bands, this is a great story, I love it, it's one of my favourites!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

He is so fresh in his writing and story line.

I wish it had all been left in. Even in the theatrical preview, there is a scene where Lenny and his gal pal are eating spaghetti together and that is nowhere to be found in the movie.

A great film in all departments,"1. Tom Hanks so expertly captured the time period--not one false noteor image. (I know--I grew up during that time.)

One of those great ""hey there""films. (Hey, there's Alex Rocco, Peter Scolari, Charlize Theron,Warren Berlinger, Robert Torti, Rita Wilson, etc. 3. Love those costumes!4.

thin,"Exactly the kind of movie one would expect Tom Hanks to make: if Fonzie and Richie, Ralph and Potzie formed a garage band and got lucky. All set up pleasantly enough, but about 45 minutes in one begins to wonder, ""Is something gonna happen soon? Is this all this writer/director sees when he looks at life?"" Nope, nothing happens of substance, certainly not between any of the characters. Just a glibness that mirrors the actor/director/writer's trademark glibness. And blandness. Mr. Hanks has little time for detail -- except he did make the choice to cast as the lead a guy looking very much like a young Tom Hanks. This is all not to say there are not good performances from some of the good actors assembled -- Liv Tyler's personal work is a revelation, for example. It is the writing and directing at fault: this movie covers familiar ground, already done effectively in THE IDOLMAKER etc., but without any apparent deep personal connection. Hanks has cast himself in the Ray Sharkey manipulative manager role, and just has not got the depth -- but the shallow, derivative, woefully underwritten script doesn't help . . .",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Onederful (No spoilers),"This movie has been a staple in my family for years and it's one of my/our favorites. It's such a feel-good, innocent comedy of a small-town band that hits it big. There is more than just the band aspect though; there are themes of love, growing up, and adventure here. The characters are fun to watch and each of them have their own sort of charm they bring to the band, my personal favorite is the quotable Lenny, who has tons of funny one-liners that I quote from time to time. All of the actor's chemistry works well and the movie is set in the 1960's and has references plus good set design that my parents seem to remember from the 60's, even though it was past my time, it's very charming.If you like a good soundtrack, if you had/have any dreams of making it in a band, if you like fun quirky characters, or like the style of the 1960's you should give this one a shot!*Note

Highly underrated movie,"That Thing You Do is a very underrated film. It has an excellent story line and great character development. Like many ""one hit wonders"" from the 1950s and 1960s, this story follows the meteoric rise of a group from their garage to national sensation in a few months. It shows you a behind the scenes look at how a hit record was developed and with a little luck and lots of talent can change the lives of the people involved. It shows how success can change some people for the worse and with others, it can enhance an already inherent goodness. In the end, the film becomes a love story that has simmered under the surface the entire time without one noticing. It's an immensely satisfying ending to a super entertaining movie. One of Tom Hanks' overlooked classics.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Liv Tyler makes it special,"Critic Roger Ebert wrote a review which begins: '""That Thing You Do!"" is the first film written and directed by Tom Hanks, and not surprisingly it is as sunny and guileless as many of the characters he's played: The movie may be inconsequential, but in some ways that's a strength. Without hauling in a lot of deep meanings, it remembers with great warmth a time and a place.'
Well said, Roger. But I would add that Hanks has assembled a perfect cast. All the stars shine brightly, but it would be a travesty to not single out the supernova of a performance by Liv Tyler. Although she is low-key for much of the film, there are at least two of her scenes which are truly amazing. In one of them she displays more pure unbridled joy than I can ever recall seeing in a movie. The other scene is very subtle and moving. What would otherwise be a solid 7.0 rating for this movie, in my book gets bumped up to a strong 8.0 because of her performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
a movie with a heart that makes you happy!,"Surprisingly fresh and funny directing debut from Hanks.This is the story about ""the Wonders"", a local band in Erie (PA) who gets a major hit nationwide called ""TTYD"". The movie starts with the band entering a sort of music amateur competition. Since the drummer injures himself they replace him with the jazz-inspired Guy Patterson (Scott) who is so much better. They win this and begin an incredible journey up to the top ten of the chart. I think you see the whole plot now, and what happens. Pretty obvious actually.Tom Hanks also wrote the movie (and some of the songs!!!), and I wonder where he got the idea. Does he have a musical past? Anyway, he does a wonderful job. The script and the dialogue are fantastic. I really like the way he ends one scene to begin with another. There is always a clever line here, most of them uttered by Steve Zahn.I don't know if this story is based on a real band but frankly, I don't care. This movie is funny, warm and with a heart, it is very entertaining and it puts you in a good mood. Mostly because of delightful characters, who fits well with the colors of the film and the great setting. And of course, the music is fantastic. Keep in mind that this movie is kind of a /musical. So, even if you aren't that nostalgic you have to somewhat envy those growing up in the sixties, after seeing this movie.The actors aren't Oscar material, but they are casted very good and they are credible. I think Tom Everett Scott (the smart one) does a very charming performance and of all the movies I have seen; the only performance. Hanks himself plays Mr.White, owner of Playtone Records and manager of the Wonders. Jimmy, played by Jonathan with the last name that I can't even pronounce, is the singer and songwriter (the talented one), and the ""bad guy"" of the band. Liv Tyler is his girlfriend and she is the kind of actress who you really seriously can fall in love with. (Good for her she doesn't look like her father!). Charlize Theron has a small part as Guy's girlfriend. Unfortunately, she rather dates dentists than musicians. Steve Zahn plays Lenny (the funny one). Hank's wife Rita Wilson plays a waitress and I have never seen her this good looking. Also starring Chris Isaac and Kevin Pollack. And Jonathan Demme as the director of a superb musical number with ""Captain Geech and the shrimp shack shooters"".I would call this a ""Sunday"" kind of a movie. When you are tired after the weekend's escapades and you want to get that ""depression kind of feeling caused by the fact that it is Monday tomorrow"" out of you head.

Classic movie with classic songs,"""That Thing You Do!"" represents any music band's dream of having a successful career along with a song to take them to fame and rising to downfalls at the same time. The film is about a drummer name Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) who works at his father's appliance store while his friends are out there having a good time in a rock band with no title to call themselves. Guy is needed for his gift after the band's drummer Chad (Giovanni Ribisi) breaks his arm where they perform their song ""That Thing You Do!"" at a local high school gymnasium and become an instant hit. The band members include Jimmy (Jonathan Schaech), the lead vocals and lead guitarist, Lenny (the hilarious Steve Zahn), the second guitarists and vocals who happens to be the comic relief and smart-ass of the group, and T.B. Player (The Bass Player, played by Ethan Embry) where they have a groupie, Jimmy's girlfriend Faye (The lovely Liv Tyler). After being a success by singing their famous song through various places including a pizza parlor, the new band who call themselves The Wonders, find a manager where they go through a cheap gig before the big guns comes to the boys.Mr. White (played by Tom Hanks) replaces their formal manager and heads the band into a tour with other famous singers. From there the band gets to find out the ups and downs of being in a band where members decided to leave, girls get in the way along with some of them from home break up with them (ex. Guy's girlfriend leaves him for the dentist) and nobody wants to follow the rules.The film was directed by Tom Hanks where not only does he show what goes on in a band, but brings back the atmosphere of the 1960's where it feels like I'm watching a document about the American version of The Beatles. Plus, the soundtrack itself is hot! I'd still play the songs from the fictional band on my CD player, thinking to myself that they're only pretend and not real. Yet, the songs are a classic just like this movie. Now go put on some shades and watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun but didn't fill me up!,"I am a bit surprised at all the positive reviews of this movie.  I love Tom Hanks and much of the work he's done, but, this movie disappointed me.  The story is fun and paints what seems like a reasonably accurate picture of the music business, especially in the 60's when one song would get you everything, including dropped like a hot potato when your light flickered.  The problem was in the character development and the flow. Several characters are introduced and given enough camera time to make you think they are going to be vital to the story, then, poof, they are gone from the story.  Some, like the bass player, stay to the last 15 minutes then disappear.  It was easy to see that the drummer and Liv Tyler would end up together, just hard to tolerate how long it took.  The chemistry between the characters was not compelling.  The relationship between the lead singer and Liv was hard to believe. He never seemed to have any interest in her from the beginning.  Lastly, the wrap up prior to the credits is nearly intolerable.  It might be funny in a picture like Animal House to give the follow up bios of the characters, but, in this movie it was a lame catch up on the disappearing acts and hardly believable for some.  If the movie was meant to be light hearted and superficial, it should have stayed light hearted and superficial.  I don't think Mr. Hanks knew exactly what he wanted.. there was either too little drama or too much, too little emotion or too much.  There was no balance and it made the movie feel like it was moving 45mph through a parking lot with speed bumps every 30 feet.  I'd like to see it made by a more experienced Tom Hanks to see if he would change it in any way.",,Anonymous,Music

The humorous parts were actually funny, and thesomber parts were realistic. The characters were original and memorable, especially Mr. White, played by Tom Hanks. The song ""That Thing You Do!"" is a great song, it has a very Beatles feel to it, as does the entire movie; it conjures up images of the Beatles' movie ""Help"".

Takes you back to the simple days of rock & roll,"The scenes I found most interesting displayed the reality of the rise & fall of entertainers. How the new rising stars were ""it"" & the ones that had songs starting down the charts were considered the ""has-beens"". All within a matter of a couple months. It's over that quick.I have read several comments on here where reviewers compared this band to the Beatles, The Byrds or the Turtles. These are bad comparisons. These were MAJOR bands with many hits. The Beatles were considered Gods.""The Wonders"" were a ONE hit, flash-in-the-pan group. I compare them to other mid 60s bands like ""The McCoys"" (Hang on Sloopy) The Beau Brummels"" (Laugh Laugh) ""The Easybeats"" (Friday on my mind) ""The Standells"" (Dirty Water) and other American garage bands that had one huge hit & then quickly faded away.It follows them from the beginning, thru their rise & fast pace of fame & the fall & back to their normal life again.This film captures the feel of being young & in a band during the early-mid 60s when there were thousands of bands like ""The Wonders"" in America that hoped for that big break & to get their 15 minutes of fame.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

You'll get a better feel of things and of more realism than this tired bit of fluff.  Hanks could have wanted to do a movie about paint drying and they would have let him.  No one liked the song, no one knew who the guys were, no one was interested in this band.  No one emerged as a teen heartthrob or went on to other things (Liv Tyler apparently took Bruce willis away from Demi Moore if thats anything).  the band and song was so obscure, everyone kept referring to them as the Oh-need-ers instead of that catchier interpretation, the Wonders, spelled Oneders.

"""That Thing"" is wonderfully done with irresistible style and substance","That Thing You Do! (1996): There are so many great things about this film that it's impossible to single out just one. The script, the acting, the characters...to paraphrase that old car commercial, who could ask for anything more? Oh, and throw in some pretty darn addictive music to boot. Add everything together, stir well and the result is a terrific directorial debut for Tom Hanks. ""That Thing You Do!"" tells the tale of a (fictitious) band, The Wonders, who literally become an overnight sensation after winning a talent competition and soon find themselves experiencing the highs ¬ñ not to mention the lows ¬ñ of becoming rock stars. The band members ¬ñ Guy (Tom Everett Scott), Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech), Lenny (Steve Zahn), and the unnamed bass player (Ethan Embry) are perfectly cast, as are supporting characters such as Jimmy's girlfriend Faye (Liv Tyler), Guy's brusque father (Holmes Osborne), mattress tycoon Boss Vic Koss (Kevin Pollak), down-on-his-luck drummer Chad (Giovanni Ribisi), jazz great Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs), with the best being Lamarr the hotel doorman (Obba Babatunde). Despite Hanks' considerably large amount of screen time as the band's manager, his role is restrained enough so as not to overshadow the film's young players. The acting is superbly enhanced by the terrific script; the dialogue is razor-sharp and at times very humorous, with the funniest moments involving the conception of the band's name (spelled ""The One-ders"" early on as a gag on the Beatles, it's constantly mispronounced as ""The O-neders"" before finally being changed to the literal spelling). Nothing ever resorts to condescension, explicit language or sensuality, or forced comedy. You can't help but share in the Wonders' ecstasy when they hear their single on the radio for the first time. The title song never gets boring even though it's played a grand total of 11 times (yet only twice in its entirety). The production design is outstanding, especially Guy's father's appliance store (where did they find all those gadgets?). TTYD is recommended viewing for any budding rock band, or simply for those who want to travel back to a time when music wasn't polluted with countless no-talent, assembly-line boy bands, misogynist rappers, and the like.

That Thing You Do,"I love this movie. It is one of those movies I watch if I have a bad day. It cheers me up and is so entertaining. It is meticulessly filled with nostalgic details, and silly, fun music. The characters are flawlessly played, so many good actors participated in this film. It is a fun and wholesome movie, my teenage daughter loved it too. It is even more fun if you have ever known anyone in a garage band, and who hasn't? It mirrors many events from the Ed Sullivan era when the Beatles became big. A great tale of the ""one hit wonder"". Fiction in a very historical early '60's setting. This movie represents the light, fun side of early Rock n Roll, which is often over shadowed by the cruel, senseless events of war and the fight for civil rights that was happening during this time. Tom Hanks wrote, directed, acted in it, and even was involved in writing much of the music. His wife has a small part in it as well. I remember seeing Charlize Theron for the first time in this movie and thinking what a great actress she is. Same for TB player, who never has a real name in the movie, and Tom Everett Scott. The song was actually nominated for a Grammy award, it's real catchy! I bought the movie, and the sound track and wore them out.

Those Things They Did,"What a nice movie. There was a time when a garage band could put together a hit, find someone to listen to it, and get on the charts. Here, a group called the Oneders (pronounced Wonders) writes and performs a song and manages to get noticed by a record producer, played by Tom Hanks. Soon, they find themselves on a band competition where the emcee announces them as the o-need-era. When the achieve a reasonable success, they face the challenges that many bands did, artistic direction. One of the undermines things be not taking the whole thing seriously, and the women in their lives cause other issues. Their lack of experience in the big, bad world is also an issue. How far can they go with what they have. This is a quiet, charming story that focuses in on the lives of these everyday guys.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
More like a Movie of the Week,"This film was pure popcorn, neither substance nor taste, just fluff.  The story line was about as timid as a network movie of the week, and the acting was second-rate.

"Does anyone else hate the word ""film""....","... as a replacement for the word, ""movie""? I mean, do they even USE film anymore? I just think it's pretentious. If film was still around they could almost get away with it, but in the age of video it's DOUBLY pretentious.I really liked the movie itself, but I was 1 when the Beatles broke up, and not into history very much, so I didn't get a lot of the parallels. Even so, and even though all of the bands were fake, the music itself was pretty good. I was surprised at what you could do without genuine bands to do it; if I remember correctly, Tom Hanks wrote or co-wrote all the songs. Kudos to him, and maybe that's a good idea for a second career for him, not that he needs it. I like the movie a lot. It takes you back not only to when music was more innocent, but when America was, I think.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The fun is fueled by a very catchy song and a highly likeable cast,"That Thing You Do is a simple story about rising to fame, but the fun is fueled by a very catchy song and a highly likeable cast. Steve Zahn is my personal favorite, Tom Everett Scott is solid as the emotional center, and Liv Tyler really does a fantastic job in her role, as well. Tom Hanks may have only directed two movies, but this is definitely the best of those two.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Perfectly done,"It seems that most actors and actresses eventually want to direct movies, but when they do, there's always suspicion that it might be little more than a publicity stunt. Well, I can say that Tom Hanks's directorial debut was very good. Portraying a 1960's rock 'n' roll group's rise to fame, ""That Thing Do You!"" makes one truly nostalgic, even if you didn't live through that era (I was born long after the '60's had ended). Obviously, the band portrayed is loosely based on the Beatles, but that's no crime. It's a very cool movie. Even more interesting is that I now know that it was one of Charlize Theron's early movies: she plays the Guy Patterson's (Tom Everett Scott) first hubby. Within a decade of course, she became the first person from Africa to win an Oscar. Liv Tyler also showed the same flair that she would bring to later movies. All in all, really neat.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Movie !,"There is no doubt that Hanks gets to grips with the subject matter of the film. I found there were no ""flat spots"", the editing and pacing were almost perfect.The characters are clearly defined and the film develops like a thunderstorm, with the inevitable dissipation at the end. Most of the reviews i've read reflect what I think, although I'm curious as to the origin of the saying ""One Hit Wonders"".Having been involved for many years with Music and playing in bands, it's easy to relate to the dream of making it. I like the scene where the Bass player goes missing and a replacement is found. The boys aren't sure about his ability to play and begin to question the fact, only to be bowled over by a succession of riffs that blow your socks off.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A familiar tale, but oh so fun...!","Sure the story of a one-hit wonder rock'n'roll band has been told before, but so what? This movie is fun, fun, fun!One reviewer commented, upon first release of this movie, that ""if you're going to feature a single song several times in a movie, it better be a damn good one"" (or something along those lines...). 'That Thing You Do' certainly is a catchy song.Kudos to Tom the director for making his actors learn their instruments and actually BECOME a real band for the movie. That way, the titular song doesn't become repetitive because we get to hear the 'evolution' of the song's arrangement over the course of the story. Starting of course with the simplified garage version all the way to the slick and assured rendition on the television showcase appearance.Lest we forget, they had other songs in their repertoire as well. Many of them were co-written by Mr. Hanks. Is there no end to this man's talents?This movie was obviously a labour of love for Tom Hanks, and it shows. I don't think he had any illusions about it becoming a blockbuster or having it significantly add to his income in any way. I think he just wanted to give us a glimpse into what could have been had he taken a slightly different career path in his life. And for that, I for one am grateful.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Tom Hanks gave life and affection to this project, which easily reminds us of the golden years of rock-and-roll.","The film is a very nice story that revolves around the world of ephemeral ""rock and roll"" stars. In 1964, a group of youngsters from Pennsylvania suddenly emerge from obscurity when their garage band, the Wonders, achieve fame and success on the back of a single song, ""That Thing You Do"". Believing in a potential that might not exist, the scouts of the music world waste no time and the boys get a contract with a major label, which is waiting expectantly for equally good songs. However, sudden fame will test the strength of the group, the maturity and responsibility of that guys and their ability to resist the temptations that money and notoriety always make possible.Tom Hanks is more than a protagonist, he is the engine that pulls the film and makes it possible. He had achieved fame at the expense of good comedies like ""Big"" or ""Money Pit"", but he had his consecration in films like ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""Philadelphia"", ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Apollo 13"". In addition, he already had two Oscars on his shelf, so he had the means to leverage a project he liked, and there is no doubt that he liked this one, and it was the lever that made it go forward. And contrary to what often happens in these situations, he didn't want the lead role: it's in a reasonably more modest role that we see him, a role where he doesn't fail to stand out.The main role is assured by the band's boys, played by Tom Everett Scott, Johnatton Schaech, Steve Zahn, Ethan Embry and Giovanni Ribisi. All quite young, still at the beginning of their respective careers, all capable of relatively slick and honest work, especially Scott, who is given a little more visibility. We also have to highlight the pleasant participation of Liv Tyler and Charlize Theron.The film is quite light, lively and cheerful, even in the most tense moments, and in which it takes paths that could make it denser, more dramatic and profound, which it always avoids. That was a conscious choice, I'm sure, and that's debatable. Where the film stands out is in its attention to historical details, in the care with which it seeks to recreate the era and environments through the choice of suitable props, good costumes and make-up, as well as a set of excellent sets. And being such a musical film, the soundtrack is unavoidable and vibrant, with songs that stay in the ear and where the main melody, created especially for the film emulating the aesthetics and taste of the time, deserves a very special highlight.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Those Things You Have to Do (as a Band),"The fun and convincing story of four young guys in a local pop band in early 60s America who make a record, and what happens next...
As they progress in the US pop business, the film paints a picture of the business at that time, including characters ranging from a very doubtful would-be 'manager', whose office is his truck, to Tom Hanks' slick, go-getting record company executive. The soundtrack features very accurate pastiches of 60s pop songs styles, including Motown and pre-Beatles pop ballads. And of course the title song, which we get to hear a number of times as the band promote it on TV and on tour, giving the feel of what it's like to 'live with' a song as you take it on the road and end up playing it for the fiftieth time while that night's audience are hearing it live for the first.
The life of the band as four guys is convincingly portrayed - love lives, struggles with management, artistic compromise, artistic influences and differences between themselves - giving the film a reality, depth and colour.
I won't spoil the ending, but this enjoyable film portrays four young guys (and their best friend girl) having the time of their lives while also facing the struggles that their dreams and choices, and life itself, bring. Well worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The music is top-notch, the story is very good and the plot keeps me watching the whole movie without getting bored. Any struggling musician can appreciate this movie for what band members go through trying to make it in the music business.

Excellent film that lifts you up and makes you want more!,"That Thing You Do was a total enjoyment. I think that it should be a template to what all movies should be about.

With the exception of a couple of choice words, this movie would have been near perfect. Once you see it you will want to see it again and again. It's extremely entertaining with a magical quality that makes you hunger for more. Mr. Hanks should quite proud of all of his work in this film. He has accomplished many times over what many fail to do. Speaking from real world experience as a musician that almost made it, I can say that this movie is right on the mark of realism. All of the cast did an excellent job of making this film very believable. That thing you do could have have truly been right out of the annals of our history.

One hit wonders are always memorable!,"One hit wonders are always common in music. The cause of that, not enough ideas, next song doesn't click, strife in the business, stress of traveling, etc. You name it, it's there. ""That Thing That You Do!"" is a marvel of a movie about a fictional boy band in the 1960's who get their big break with the help of a determined manager named Mr. White(Tom Hanks). They are know to the U.S. as The Wonders(Oneders) The band get their show on the road when Guy Patterson(Tom Everett Scott) becomes the new drummer after the original breaks his arm. They go places to perform, and Guy meets jazz drummer Del Paxton(Bill Cobbs) who warns him about bands and success. He did take heed. After the performance of a variety show, the band starts to suffer. Egos clash, and head-butting with other members split the band. Some of the members form a new band, Guy and Del start to make music of a different tone, choosing Jazz over Rock-n Roll. What started with a band, ended with a new opportunity. Hanks did a great job making this movie, Liv Tyler did a spectacular performance playing Faye Dolan. She was important to Guy, and Lamarr(Obba Babatunde) was a very resourceful and wise bellhop.

Fun Relaxing Movie,"That Thing You Do! is the first motion picture directed by Tom Hanks (who also stars in the movie) and tells the story of the band The Wonders, who during the 60's had a one-hit wonder single, That Thing You Do!The story follows four friends from Erie, Pennsylvania who form a rock'n'roll band together called ""The Oneders"", who are later known as the ""The Wonders"". We follow along as they rise to success, promoting their new single all over the country and achieve national fame. As a director, Tom Hanks captures perfectly the style of the 60's and you're instantly transported back in that world. The clothes, the cars, the people, everything looks great to the last detail.The main character, Guy Patterson, is the drummer of the band and it's eerie (no pun intended) how much he channels a young Tom Hanks. In fact, at first, Hanks didn't even want him in the movie because he felt he looked too much like him, but his wife convinced him otherwise. The rest of the supporting cast includes Liv Tyler, as the girlfriend of the band's lead singer, Steve Zahn as the guitar player and Tom Hanks as the band's manager, Mr. White.This is a nice feel-good movie, perfect for a Sunday evening when you just feel like lying on the couch and enjoy a great movie.

And Hanks works in so many old friends plus the record company he created for the movie now actually exists to carry all the soundtracks for his subsequent works. I like the music, all of it, from the featured tracks to the subtracks to the background noise of the other performers. The chronology is very believable as are the sets.

I loved the music because although it was all original, it sounded like those songs had somehow been part of my life, growing up in the 60's. I like Tom Everett Scott as Guy.

Liv Tyler does the best of the principal cast, but three of the supporting roles give it life and one of them all but steals the movie.  Bill Cobb as a jazz musician and Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks' wife in real life) as a waitress have very good parts and shine in their scenes.

Great Movie...BUT....,"Everyone in the cast did an excellent job, but really, Tom, you could not have been more insensitive to Ethan Embrey. The poor actor was not even given a name. You wrote this, and you kept referring to him as ""the bass player."" If you want to know who really sparkled in this movie with fantastic facial expressions and personality, it was Ethan. Tom Hanks may be a genius, but thank God he's not a doctor; his bedside manners would be awful. :) Have more compassion next time, Mr. Hanks. Besides, his character was a fun-loving guy who had a passion for being in the Army. It is odd that they mentioned the bass player's name who replaced Ethan in the movie, so what was the point, Tom? Oh, and by the way, I know why you selected the actor you did to portray ""Guy."" He has mannerisms like you and facial expressions too. You trained him well. So, tell us, why mention all the band members' names in the movie, and once... instead of saying Ethan's character's name, you said Faye? I wish you read these comments. You just might learn a thing or two. Anyway, loved the movie. The tunes reminded me of what the Beatles would write. Plus, did you HAVE to have the camera man when the band was live on television focus on ""Wolfman,"" and then you have someone say...""too scary?"" What is that all about? He is no more scary than Mick Jaggar!! But, let's face another fact; Mr. Hanks has always been typecast, so maybe this showed a more ruthless side to one of his many characters.

Go Tom Hanks!,"""That Thing You Do"" is an excellent film on its own and Tom Hanks does yet another marvelous job as an actor in the role of a record-label rep, however, even more marvelous was the discovery that it was also a Tom Hanks production project (the first, I think). Furthermore, Hanks' production label--""Play Tone""--is also the name of the would-be record label in the movie. Discovering these parallels gave me a whole new appreciation for this movie. The film centers on a group of 5 teens (4 male musicians and the lead singer's girlfriend, Fay, who hangs with the band and helps out at gigs) who form a band in the late 50's and head to the top with their first major hit, ""That Thing You Do"". The band ecstatically leaves behind small-town Erie, Pennsylvania after offers come in and Fay accompanies them on tour under the guise of being their costume mistress. Their wide-eyed experiences outside of Erie, their naive view of the music industry and their approach to fame makes this journey funny and interesting. At the center of the story is ""Skitch"" Patterson, the band's drummer, who is substituted in at the last minute for a gig when the band's regular drummer is injured. His nervousness changes the pace of the band's music, and ultimately, their lives. The film follows Patterson's perspective of the band's experiences and it's interpersonal relationships--like that of Jimmy and Fay. Jimmy is the talented lead-singer whose songwriting gives the band it's boost to success, and Fay is his sweet and soft-spoken girlfriend who is incredibly devoted to his talent and instrumental to the band. The two have been inseparable, but as fame grows, so does Jimmy's ego, much to Fay's dismay. Skitch has his own heartbreaks and successes, which he sees behind his trademark sunglasses, earning him the nickname ""Shades"". Similar in storyline to ""The Committments"", this movie uses good humor, music, and acting to carry you through a solid, fun and, at times, tragic, script. With Tom Hanks acting AND directing, you can't go wrong with this film. It's clean enough for kids, romantic enough for dates, objective enough for diverse groups, interesting enough to own (watch over and over), and easy to follow.

Not only does it have a great soundtrack, showcase some incredible vintage music instruments but also has an early appearance by the now famous Liv Tyler.Having spent over 20 years in the music business combined with being a musicians daughter, this film tells it like it is. It's a very truthful behind the scenes look at what it's really like in the music business. Producers, stage shows, traveling, the television stuff. It's all a very accurate picture of how it was at the time. One of the most truthful scenes, is where the character ""Jimmy"" approaches the mighty Sol Syler (record company Pres/Owner) to get an appointment and is strongly rebuffed when Syler tells his assistant ""Will someone get Fabian out of my face!"" This film is a delightful look behind the scenes at what it's like to be on the road performing in the 60's. It's a very entertaining film and in my opinion well worth the time if you don't over analyze and just enjoy it for what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Del Paxton's Age ALL WRONG,"Love the flick, but something bothered me recently when I caught it on the tube.The year is, what, 1964, '65? ""Del Paxton"" is obviously a bebop-era jazz pianist. Trouble is, the character is about 60 (that's the age of the actor who played him at the time the movie was made, anyway).That means he would have been born around 1905. He would have been active during the ""Roaring 20s,"" and during the ""Swing"" era. I doubt that he would have made a transition to ""bebop"" by that time. Those guys were all born in the 20s and 30s, so the character of ""Paxton"" is really about twenty years TOO OLD for the era in what ""That Thing You Do"" takes place.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Wake me up, before you go-go","This is a gentle, light, fluffy, reasonably well-observed film that is virtually devoid of conflict or passion. My wife fell asleep watching it and I only stayed awake because I was trying to spot the musical references, such as the band's equipment becoming better as they became more successful (they switched to Rickenbackers and Fenders from unidentifiable makes of guitar).The title song is (probably deliberately) overplayed in the movie and is easy on the ear and yet, a day later, I can't really remember it all.Everything happens way too easy for the band and even when they fall apart, the band members don't seem to care, so why should we?If you want to see a more gritty approach to this subject matter, with way better songs, more laughs, more passion and more realism, try Slade in ""Flame"".",,Anonymous,Music

The cast's enthusiastic performance of the song make it all the more convincing.But inderlying all this comical exuberance are Tom Hanks' own philosophical views.

Hanks has a true grasp of early 60's America,"From the opening sequence introducing Guy Patterson's mundane life working in the family appliance business I knew that writer/director Tom Hanks knew this era like a pair of comfortable old shoes and slipped them on and took us on a too brief walk through small town America in the early sixties. The opening song ""Loving You Lots and Lots"" playing over the opening credits and establishing sequences really set the tone when ""Safe"" music could still be popular alongside ""evil"" rock-and-roll. I felt like I stepped into a time machine and what was really impressive to me was the fact that ALL the songs used in the movie were all originals! Not a single archive song was used to set the time frame. This little movie deserves more respect and I would love to have the Powers That Be issue a special DVD version sometime in the near future with a Tom Hanks commentary. So why a 9 and not a 10? Liv Tyler's role wasn't as solid a character as it could have been. No, not liberated as such but maybe a bit less whiny during the break up scene. I didn't really like her character untill right at the end when she and Guy get together. A very comfortable movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

My kind of film.,"Say what you like about Tom Hanks, but at least he didn't use his clout in Hollywood to write, direct and act in something overwhelmingly pretentious. That's just one of the many points in the film's favour - others include its infectious good nature and its appealing characters (when the title song by the Wonders is played on the radio for the first time you're as excited as the characters are). It doesn't overstay its welcome, and the only problem is that the ending is a bit abrupt. But it's so darn agreeable and fun that it doesn't matter.  As a lifelong Gerry Anderson fan I was thrilled to see a TV screen showing his series ""Fireball XL5,"" I love TV theme songs (and the fictional one for ""Mr. Downtown"" is a cracker), and I seem to have a soft spot for anything with Liv Tyler (so I guess I'd like ""Stealing Beauty"" then).

This movie had some fantastic touches,"There have been a lot of ""rags-to-riches"" garage band movies; I appreciated Tom Hanks' ""That Thing You Do"" more than any of them.  The title song plays throughout the movie, nearly a dozen times (though the whole song plays only once or twice), and it is a catchy tune indeed.  The scene at the talent show where a performer's nervousness accidently creates a hit song is pure magic.  The scene where the band hears the song on the radio for the first time is both funny and touching.  The scene that made a major impact on me, reflecting what the movie is all about, is when the audience is singing along with the band in their final appearance in the movie.  Inspirational. Tom Everett Scott, who more than once has been compared to a young Tom Hanks, makes his character likeable and funny/confused at the same time. The dual-track communication between Scott's character and his girlfriend is subtly humorous, more so in subsequent viewings. This movie is one to watch over and over, just to capture the magic of the scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

This is the first time I've seen this film and I wished I would have seen it earlier. I don't know why, but it just didn't appeal to me, but I sat down earlier this morning and watched it. Following the band was easy throughout the film and the heartache everyone faces in their respective careers tugged a little bit at my heartstrings.Hands down, one of the better movies in 1996, a time when I was trying to pick myself up and dust myself off, and a time when I should have taken the time to sit down and actually watch this film, instead of waiting almost thirteen years.Oh, and about my opening summary, the one thing that could have made this movie a little better for people just as old as me or a little older would have been a scene where the ""Bosom Buddies"" co-stars, writer Hanks and Peter Scolari, could have appeared together.

However, I liked it then and appreciate its subtleties as it passes by all these years later on cable. It has quite a few elements I missed the first time around because the song and the attention to '60s detail had me reliving my childhood. There is something irrepressibly elating about the affect the meteoric rise of the song has on young people from a somewhat remote town in PA. I wonder how many people my age daydreamed about something like that happening to them? And the scene when they first hear their song over the radio evokes memories of soaring joy on those rare occasions when something came out so right.

Always nice to see Bill Cobbs, here as ""legendary jazz great Del Paxton"" - Cobbs has been in 65 films in the last 20 years, I know him as Orvis in The Color of Money (""Orvis, last time I saw you you were sweeping up in McGears"").

Hanks pulls out all the stops!,"Tom Hanks pulled out all the creative stops to put his picture ""That Thing You Do"" together, and it shows--magnificently.  Audiences could confuse a movie with lightness of tone as unsubstantial, but serious subjects and heavyhandedness are not prerequisites for greatness. It's quite possible for a movie to be light and airy, or frivolous and charming, and still make a grand impression.  I won't stretch my point by saying ""That Thing You Do"" is a great movie, but it's the kind of work that pools all the pleasures of moviegoing:  laughs, music, dreams of material success, passion, romance--and serves them up in generous measure.And finally, a role that allows Hanks to reveal the sharper, more creative, less lovable side of himself, that is to say, an adult--with ambition and focus and drive, a distant cousin of Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco.  Hanks takes on twin roles: publicity agent grooming a talented fledgling rock'n'roll band for stardom; and writer/director behind the camera orchestrating all the myriad ingredients that make this movie a rousing success.  He shows a sophisticated way with a wisecrack, and an equally mature facility for storytelling.And hats off to Hanks for the cast he assembles! As Lenny Haise, the lead guitarist of the band, Steve Zahn could not have not have made me laugh any harder.  Mr. White may think him a fool, but Zahn's Lenny takes his place among the best of fools; Shakespeare's Falstaff or Mozart's Papageno have nothing on him.  He's the restless mover of the narrative.  Without Lenny's impulsiveness, the band would not have made the leaps and bounds it did in so short a time, and every quick step of the way Zahn makes of it heady fun.The tomfoolery doesn't stop with Lenny.  Tom Everett Scott in the lead is forced into a kind of princely strait-jacket, but the actors on the sidelines like Holmes Osborne and Claudia Stedelin as Scott's parents; Kevin Pollak as Boss Vic Kosslovich, a two-bit impresario from Pittsburgh; and Alex Rocco as the blissfully crass Sol Siler leave us smiling long after the story has left them behind.  (When Rocco spits out something like ""And will someone get Fabian away from me?,"" I almost fell off the couch, doubled over with laughter.)Sort through this movie, and you'll find a gift at every turn.  It chimes in a variety of music styles, the best pop offerings coming from Adam Schlesinger (who wrote the title song), Scott Rogness, and Rick Elias with a good deal of the filler music being Hanks' collaborations.  It showcases some dazzling musical numbers--""Dance With Me Tonight"" is the centerpiece.  It sends us visions of Liv Tyler, Charlize Theron, Rita Wilson, and Kennya J. Ramsey to mull over.  And it conjures up a time when America was still at peace with itself.  Need we ask for anything more?",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"A fast-paced look @ the life of a 1960's rock band.  A great depiction of the look & feel of the times.  In a league with movies like ""A Hard Day's Night""!","I really enjoyed this movie. ""That Thing You Do"" is a fast-paced look @ rock 'n roll music in 1960's America. Set in Erie, Pennsylvania, the movie did a great job of re-creating the look and feel of the times. It does for 1960's teenagers what ""American Graffiti"" did for the '50's. At the same time it is not at all unlike the Beatles ""A Hard Days Night"" - 60 days in the life of a rock 'n roll band. The ensemble cast was excellent. They did a great job of depicting what '60's teenagers in America were like - a much more innocent & naive world view than that possessed by kids today. Tom Hanks also did a nice job in a limited, for him, role. He adds a little real world experience in contrast to the idealistic Wonders. The movie is worth watching for the soundtrack alone! Unlike George Lucas's ""American Graffitti"", the soundtrack here consisted entirely of works written specifically for the ""That Thing You Do"". This serves to give you the feeling that you are discovering the music of the Wonders along with the rest of the country. It's not just another re-hashing of golden oldies. The new old hits played in this movie help to create a world very similar to what really happened, yet different. The Wonders become a real group, playing their songs, rather than the millionth rendition of ""Johnnie B. Good"". If I hadn't known better, I would have sworn that the songs played by the Wonders and the other acts in the movie were actual hit songs from the '60's. The music really fit the times. It's a fun, enjoyable movie. I would recommend it for anyone!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Casablanca"", it ain't. That doesn't keep it from being good.","Previous reviews explain the movie and characters pretty well; I want to add one writer's point of view.This story was obviously a labor of love for Tom Hanks. Had he not had the Hollywood pull that he enjoys at this point in his career, the project would never have seen the light of day. Most films emerging from this process are, quite frankly, crap. But this is Tom Hanks we're talking about; the man is incapable of doing anything at less than outstanding levels of quality, and he often achieves greatness.""That Thing You Do"" is merely outstanding, but it allows Hanks to be outstanding while wearing five different hats. The more cynical point out that it covers little new ground. I would disagree -- I found it refreshingly daring that in an era where the public insists that some barrier be broken before a piece is considered to be worthwhile, Hanks had the fortitude (and power) to see this through and get it made.Furthermore it set the stage, five years before 9/11, for less-in-your-face fare to be embraced by those seeking more in the way of feel-good entertainment.The world is a teaspoonful of better because this film is available to us. The world of movies could probably claim a gallon. But you're in no danger of getting a cavity from seeing it. For that, I recommend ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"".",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An Impressive Directorial Debut for Tom Hanks,"THAT THING YOU DO! was a warm and affectionate valentine to the world of pop music in the 1960's which marked the directorial debut of two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks. Hanks lovingly examines a phenomenon that was practically an epidemic in the music world in the 60's...the ""One-Hit Wonder."" This film is the story of a garage band in a small town who call themselves The Oneders who have perfected a nice little ballad called ""That thing you do."" The night they perform the song publicly for the first time, the drummer doubles the tempo and, as an up tune, the song is a smash. They record it and it even gets radio play. The group then meets a Mr. White (Hanks), who agrees to manage the group and get them national exposure. He changes their name to The Wonders because they keep getting introduced as ""The Oneeders"" and books them on tours of state fairs and even gets them on TV and in a beach party movie, all on the strength of this one song, but when the group pressures White to make another record, that's where the problems begin. This movie accurately portrays the way a musical act in the 60's was able to catapult to stardom on the strength of one record and then disappear forever. The film is beautifully mounted, with imaginative direction by Hanks and Oscar-worthy art and costume design. Tom Everett Scott lights up the screen as Guy, the drummer whose change of tempo changes the lives of the group forever. The film also features impressive turns by Jonathan Schaech as the arrogant lead singer, Steve Zahn as the fun-loving empty-headed guitarist and Liv Tyler as Schaech's girlfriend. Take note of my favorite scene in the film where the members of the group hear their song on the radio for the very first time...the joy depicted here is infectious as is this film, which proved to be an impressive directorial debut for Tom Hanks.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

His skills are called upon when a small band in his hometown of Erie, PA loses their drummer (Giovanni Ribisi) to a broken arm. There's Jimmy (Jonathon Schaech), the narcissistic lead singer, Lenny (Steve Zahn), the goofy lead guitarist, and T.B. (Ethan Embry), the naive bass player. Accompanied by Fay (Liv Tyler) and their manager Mr. White (Hanks), the five members tour all across the country promoting their hit song ""That Thing You Do"".The film is a cute and light look at the early 60's music scene, which saw the rise and fall of many young, one-hit wonder, bands.  If you want to spend two enjoyable hours of fun, you can't go wrong with ""That Thing You Do"".  And if you grew up in that era, the feeling of nostalgia adds an extra level of enjoyment.All in all, with its excellent cast, script, music, and production design, ""That Thing You Do"" should be high on your list of rentals.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Every single person in the movie has such a strong personality to them that it is like sitting at a bench at the mall and just watching people and having it being fun and interesting.I was able to relate to all of the characters at a very personal level which I enjoyed. The whole story ends up being about the kiss at the very end which is a bit much. You almost fell like you are one of the band going through what they are going through.I still haven't figured out what Tom Hanks character is up to the whole way through this movie. Is he scheming and just so jaded that he doesn't care that he didn't get what he wanted in the end? Are all of the minor characters in his employ seeing to it that the kiss happens?

Of course, Lennon was actually engaged, if not already married!I truly don't get tired of this film. Just a feel-good movie.

I liked how you heard ""That Thing You Do"" evolve from a slow ballad, to a raw song with lots of potential, to the smash hit rock song that it became.Another thing I liked was, there wasn't a lot of ""name dropping"" in the movie, in terms of other bands, artists, etc, with the exception of Virgil ""Gus"" Grissolm and Gina Lollobrigda.  It would've been easy to do so, but it wasn't done and the writing was good in the sense that they seemed believable.A few bits of trivia from this movie:  Some things you already know and some maybe you don't.-The bass player (Ethan Embry) was never given a name.

I wasn't around in '64, but older Erieites are extremely impressed with the mention of many local hangouts back then. It was especially nice to see a mention of a local college, Gannon (my alma mater).The movie itself was very well-done. It was a nice story of an overnight success and how people take advantage of their youthful ignorance. Tom Hanks does a nice job as the manager. I like how he doesn't play the same old characters in every movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The best film I've ever seen!!!!!!!,"I love That Thing You Do!!! I've seen it 22 times yet and can't get enough of it! I love Steve Zahn, he's the best actor all over the world!!!!

I tried to get the soundtrack in Germany, but, you wouldn't believe it, you can't get it here. It's very difficult, but I just can tell you that I will love That Thing You Do! forever and there is no film like this one. IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Nice story of the dreams of a ""one-hit wonder"" group,in Beatles-era America","The humble beginnings,meteoric rise and equally quick descent of a band of average,perceivably clean-cut kids from semi-rural Pennsylvania is the entire premise behind this movie,which boasts the movie directorial debut of Tom HAnks(his only film directorial job to date). While I cannot claim this a wonderful,masterful film,it was certainly good enough for me to give it multiple viewings.The central hero is Guy Paterson(Tom Everett Scott,congenial and average and thus perfect for the role),a JAzz-loving drummer who works in his dad's appliance store. HE is the central architect of the band ""THe ONe-ders""(And there's plenty of pronunciation goofs awaiting that!),which latch onto the burgeoning rock scene with a few popular tracks that get local airplay. When the band,consisting of guitarists Lenny(Steve ZAhn,never out of a job),T.B.(Ethan Embry)and lead singer Jimmy(JOnathan Schaech) get spotted by an enigmatic-yet-paternal music representative named White(HAnks,at full ease),their star progressively rises to the point where their demand goes national and their egos grow in separate ways. IN the mix are the lead singer's sensitive and naive girlfriend(Liv Tyler)and the spoiled Barbie-doll hanger-on(CHarlize Theron,who almost slips through the cracks of this film).Of course,the lead singer being an egotistical ass and Guy being a sensitive,recessive fellow,the budding romance is as predictable as the weather.HAnks' sympathy for the era as screenwriter and director,goes a long way to making this easy to watch. Ditto the casting of then mostly unknown younger actors to fill out the major roles. There is the perfect balance of bright,wide-eyed optimism of youngster wanting to be the next big thing in rock 'n roll and the reality of the business that makes this film neither sugary or cynical. I could nitpick as to elements that made this movie imperfect,but I'd just as soon not,since this movie has such a friendly,unique quality that I'd feel remiss in picking on it. While you need not be either an aficionado of 1960s rock and/or be from that era,it certainly wouldn't hurt in order to enjoy this movie. Or at the very least,this should appeal to the sentimentalist in anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Perfectly Charming Movie!  It Makes You Smile and Feel Good!,"I was born in 1961.  My earliest memories go back to late 1963.  This movie brought back memories that I wish I could relive.  Before the world went to hell in the late sixties, the world and life seemed as sweet as it was portrayed in this movie.  Roger Ebert, in his review of this movie, said, that, if this movie does anything, it makes you smile.  He was right.  I found myself sitting through this movie with a smile on my face and with a feeling of contentment.  I sometimes wondered whether I had ""glorified"" my memories of those years, but this movie confirmed that I was right.  Those were some of the best years that this country ever experienced.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great music!,"I just saw the film on TV, and really enjoyed it. It warms your heart to see kids like these who are so passionate about their art. Plus the movie has a great soundtrack. The song 'That Thing You Do' makes you wanna get up and dance, and so do most of the songs in the movie (and, in my opinion, most of the songs in the 60's!). Bottom line - it's worth dancing, uh... I mean, watching!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Tom Hanks is also a great songwriter. Great movie!,"I love this movie!  When I have a bad day or have the ""blues"" I slap this movie in and enjoy not just the great music but the great interaction between the leading cast members which include Hanks' look-a-like Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn, Jonathan Schaech and as notated in the credits: ""The Bass Player"" Ethan Embry, collectively known as ""The Oneders"", oops! make that ""The Wonders"".   Hanks show us just how multi-talented he is by writing and directing this movie PLUS he re-created the innocence and joy of music from the 60's in minute detail. Hanks is the writer of the title song and of the offbeat instrumental ""Spartacus"" and it knocks me out that he has these incredible talents for so many artistic creations: Actor, Director, song writer, et.al. He also directs this movie as well as playing Play-Tone Manager, ""Mr White"" who leads the ""The Wonders"" to success through the ""Play-Tone"" label. Tom Everett Scott looks a lot like Tom Hanks during his ""Bosom Buddy"" days on TV, and I suspect that Hanks created this movie to showcase the talent that is Tom Everett Scott.  Scott steals the movie with his humor, his sincere caring of others and if he is really a drummer, his talent! Zahn was great as the comic relief and Schaech was not only very handsome but very believable in portraying the moody Jimmy, lead singer, who has the true artistic temperament but is lacking in certain sensitivities. The songs are ""snappy"" and ""catchy"", capturing the true zenith of rock and roll in 1960's America.  The catchy ""Play-Tone"" label, also created by Hanks, the reproductions of TV shows of the 60's, and the ambience of a time when rock and roll was growing up and showing off are all in this great movie.  The title song, ""That Thing You Do"" is actually a great tune and I find myself wanting to hear it now and then, and sing along with it.Liv Tyler as ""Faye"" was very sweet as the wronged girlfriend but I don't get how  having a really bad cold during the West coast California ""showcasing"" had any revelance to the movie except to show that ""Guy"" noticed she was sick and was always ""there"" for her and ""thinking"" of her when Jimmy wasn't. Look for performances by Charlize Theron and Giovanni Ribisi as well. This is a light-hearted movie that you can just sit back, enjoy, sing a long with, and laugh.  The biggest plus is that in watching the credits it is incredible to see that Hanks wrote many of the songs, the music, created the 60's TV shows so realistically and is not only a member of the Screen Actors Guild but also the Song Writers Guild - so many feathers in his already much-plummed hat. Does Tom Hanks' talents have no end? I hope not. Check out ""Road to Perdition"" for further proof. Rita Wilson, Hanks' wife, makes an appearance at the ""Blue Spot"" where Jazz greats meet to jam and have ""cock and bull"" sessions and where Guy meets his idol, Dale Paxton. Their own jam session results in ""Spartacus"", a great jazz instrumental, also written by Tom Hanks. Before you rewind the movie, wait for the end of the credits to see two of ""The Wonders"" music videos, including ""That Thing You Do""!In summary, I love that thing that Tom Hanks does with this well-made and entertaining comedy!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"I can't not watch this --- its a kinder, gentler ""Commitments""!!","This is a hugely entertaining movie that was overlooked during its theatrical release, but now seems to have a great following. And why not, the all-American story of a 60's garage band ""success""! As a '64 HS grad (please don't do the math!), I enjoyed the story, music and performances. And thank God they came up with a catchy title tune (you hear it in total or bits about 15 times) as it never seems to get old.Infectious performances by a budding cast of near miss and future stars, the setting, music, locations, Play-tunes tours, network TV shows and the inevitable band break-up all ring true.The amazing thing to me is that given Tom Hanks' success, his appearance in the film (as well as writer/director hats), its up and coming cast and reasonable studio push, the movie wasn't a big box office success.

One-derful!(the soundtrack rocks too!),"An excellent story about a better time with better music. A small band from Erie, PA in 1964 are about to perform their ballad ""That Thing You Do"" at a local talent show. With less than a day to come up with a name, (they decide on the One-ders) their drummer breaks his arm. The replacement: ""Erie's lone beatnik"" lovable Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott). Starting the song at the talent show, Guy gets a catchy beat in his head and starts playing it. The more upbeat, ""snappier"" version of the song becomes an instant hit and the newly-named Wonders are signed to Play-Tone Records and led to huge success by their manager, Mr. White (Tom Hanks). Jimmy (Johnathon Shaech), the band's serious lead singer and songwriter insists for quite some time that it's still ""too fast"". Also in the band are Lenny (Steve Zahn), the hilarious guitarist who takes nothing seriously and is probably just in the band to meet girls. Then there's the cute bass player (Ethan Embry) who doesn't really say much and enlisted in the Marines before the band's success (he sadly has to report to South Carolina at the end of August but ends up in Disneyland). One of the running jokes of the film is that the bass player was never given a name. Liv Tyler gives a wonderful performance as Faye, Jimmy's girlfriend and the band's hugest fan (She's allowed on the tour as their ""costume mistress""). With this sudden success and a record literally climbing the charts, not to mention a part in a major motion picture, how long will the band stay together to continue doing that thing they do?",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Classic Musical Comedy,"I've always wondered why I was glued to this movie everything I turned it on and consider it a rating of 10.

I laugh at all the group's jokes and music relations as a group. Tom Hanks wrote a great story that relates to the past musicians on what it took to try and get to the top and with this movie gives a perspective on each musician and what their motives on what they want in their life while being in the band. Now if a young musician watches this movie they have an idea of what it was like.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The acting is not the greatest with somewhat lackluster performances from Jonathan Shaech and Liv Tyler who wasn't her best here although was charming as usual. I was impressed with Tom Everett Scott in the lead role and also Ethan Embry was impressive as the bass player. I also loved Steve Zahn who was hilarious as usual in his role.

It's hard to resist.,"I'm not even a music person and it's just terrific. It's my choice for the best movie of 1996. Shockingly, it opened and closed. Not many people cared to see it. Of course, the best great movies are the most natural ones. It felt like a real biographical story, without being predictable or ordinary. Why wasn't it doing well? Tom Hanks was the biggest name with Apollo 13 and Toy Story in 1995 and Forrest Gump in 1994. His name alone should be big enough. It just baffles me. I give the theatrical cut 9/10 and the director's either a 6 or 7. I almost never enjoy director's cuts. They add scenes that aren't necessary and then the scenes that were necessary are boring because it took longer to get to them. The bass player had nothing to do. I don't know why he was in the movie. It just should've been a trio band. I'm surprised most of the actors went nowhere movie wise after the picture except Charlize Theron and Liv Tyler.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
an oddball picture that hooks me  every time,"Tom Hanks put a lot into this smart and funny off-beat picture (it's almost the cinematic equivalent of his persona when you see him interviewed on Letterman -- maybe it's that personally felt) which depicts the-rise-and-that's-all history of a one hit wonder band in the just post- British invasion '60s. It's hip and square at the same time and that damn song, played again and again in pleasing variations, is exactly right. The casting of the band mates, notably Jonathan Schaech (a wannabe Lennon or Dylan), Steve Zahn (a Ringo kind of goof) and Tom Everret Scott, a young Hanks lookalike, who has artistic jazz-minded desires, make for an ensemble that is heartfelt, real and friendly-- oh, and Ethan Embry plays the bass player. Hanks himself gives one of his best, and most understated, performances as the band's big-time producer/Svengali and Liv Tyler is the lead singer's perfect girlfriend, Faye -- ""Well, Faye's special"", says Hanks himself at one point and we know, any one who's been around a rock'n'roll band knows, he's right. Light, airy, kind of weird -- all the terrific (as well as the terrifically awful music -- ""Lovin' You Lots and Lots"" by the Norm Wooster Singers) is original to the film -- ""That Thing..."", even as it falters a little in its final third, makes you happy to watch a movie that its players and its makers are more than giddy to present.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great time with first time director Tom Hanks!!!great for families!!~~,"This movie is about a group of young men and their song""That Thing You Do!"". The movie takes place in the midwest. The band plays the song at band contest. They win that contest.Eventually after doing other gigs for other people they are discovered by a Mr.White(Tom Hanks). From here on in, the movie shows them on promotional tours of the song. The band decides to the call the band""the Wonders"". Of course they encounter many problems from both within the band, and the fans.

Though some of the events which occur once the band reaches the pinnacle of success (two members leaving so quickly, one for the army, one at a casino) seem highly unlikely and unbelievable, the development of the band, from talent competition winners to top of the chart hit makers, is one which anyone who loves music (and especially the effect the 60's had on rock and roll) can really appreciate. The title track is catchy and infectious, and Tom Everett Scott's reluctant acceptance of the leader's role is engaging and genuine. Even the subplots are interesting and not too intricate to follow. I highly recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great tunes, great movie, one flaw...","""That Thing You Do"" is one of those feel-good movies I can watch again and again.  The music carries the film.  I must confess to being a big Fountains of Wayne fan from their beginnings, and they do not disappoint here with jaunty tunes that sound period without being smarmy.A balanced cast headed by Tom Everett Scott makes most scenes enjoyable. Steve Zahn is well used here as the off the wall, Lenny.  Hanks is understated as Mr. White, but I think this enhances his dark-ish, calculating character.  A fair representation of the recording industry.The movie is nearly ruined by Liv Tyler, over acting as usual.  She's a drain to watch as always, killing the pace of the movie, and not in sync with the rest of the cast.Bill Cobb as Del Paxton, is a delight, as is Tom Hanks' wife, Rita Wilson as waitress in Marguerite.  The bar scene is outstanding.Watch this one to brighten up a rainy day.  Get ready to tap your toes and enjoy!  8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An absolute must for any fans of American nostalgia cinema,"An absolute must for any fans of American nostalgia cinema. Tom Hanks evokes a fantastic impression of the sixties with his Beatlesque band. Their catchy title tune (the highlight of a delightfully cheesy yet cheery soundtrack) launches them to super stardom for 15 minutes of fame. A clever and insightful look at the music industry, cynical even in the sixties!A wonderful film, light and humorous yet with enough depth to give the film feeling. Some great casting livens up the film, Tom Everett Scott really was a young Tom Hanks, and Johnathan Shaech is capable as the prima donna 'artiste.' Steve Zahn provides his usual comedic relief and Liv Tyler is pretty good as the girl behind the new found stars. Tom Hanks himself is good as the wise old man of the music industry.Barely anything to dislike, there are the odd scenes where Liv is given some overly sentimental lines and the dialogue is a bit loose in places but overall it is a superb piece of light cinema with a great sense of nostalgia.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Good Vibes with a Surprising Depth,"The 1960s are portrayed through visuals and music that make you feel nostalgic for a time you never lived in, but the catch is-Hanks never plays that card.Instead, that's just the icing on the cake, and the core of it all is young people on a fun but also demanding road to becoming stars, and possibly fading away before they actually become real stars.What made me upgrade my rating from an 8 to a 9 is the fact that, without trying to be larger than life or relying on drugs, sex, or a wild protagonist, Hanks manages to take you behind the curtains of show business. It makes you wonder if the emotions the media tries to provoke are one big hoax, all without being judgmental.Is there any authenticity left?He suggests there is, but there's a price to pay for it as well.There's a particularly nice scene between one of the band members and his jazz role model, whom he gets to meet for a jam session in the studio.As the role model explains, ""Bands come and go,"" you get a sense you're watching a film about much more than just being fun and entertaining (though it's definitely that too).That Thing You Do delivers a warm story with great storytelling, characters, and music, offering more depth than you'd expect from a movie about four guys and a girl who made a pop hit.What more could you wish for?Just that Tom Hanks would direct more often.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
keep s you coming back for more and more,i have seen this movie several time (seriously about 50-60) no I'm not a nut but if it works i just keep going back for more till that feeling runs out . it hasn't yet . I'm not surprised of its ability to make me coming back for more and more as it exhibits the lighter side of tom hanks and his personality and his creativity in this project . yes the drummer is similar to young hangs in bossum buddies or the movie splash or big . but its his ability to feel for others and make them feel special or important that makes the character scitch work . it shows real innocence and the power of the money hungry record companies during a time where artists were exploited and taken advantage of . but more important it gave a great basis for a love story and plenty of catchy tunes besides the title song. i only wish to see tom hanks talents in a movie like this again,9.0,Anonymous,Music

There was no evil record company, no diabolical agent.

It even touches on big-box retailers squeezing out smaller stores (the appliance store).My favorite part is the song. Just like with ""Please Please Me"" it was originally a ballad, but gets speeded up to its best tempo.What's even more impressive is that the movie shows how the song improves over time. Too many movies leap into the final version right away. Here you can see/hear the slightly-clumsy first live version. From there it gets better and better.The song itself is clever, it's not a three-chord wonder. I've played it on my guitar. This is important because we hear it many times.

It really was exciting watching a little group from Erie, Pa climb the billboard charts with their hit song.  The song also entitled ""That Thing You Do"" was a great song, i would actually like to hear it get some radio play in real life. Liv Tyler was at her finest as the lead singer's girlfriend Faye.

Having been a teenager in the 60s and being in a ""garage"" band, played the school dances, county fairs, won the talent contests, recorded a single,(which went nowhere)and finally have the group disentigrate,(VietNam got a lot of us, myself included)I was moved to tears of both sadness and joy as I hitched a ride with those 4 young guys, Guy, Lenny, Jimmy, and T.B., in pursuit of a dream that a lot of us had in those days.I especially love the scene when they hear their song on the radio for the first time. That scene captured the raw, unadulterated exuberance of the youth of that day experiencing a dream come true. I have purchased this movie and the soundtrack and have watched and listened to them numerous times. Because of my experience of being in a ""one-hitless wonder"" band and the experience of VietNam, I have found joy and healing in this unpretentious movie of the days of my youth.

"""You're talking gibberish!""","This movie just worked.  I remember seeing this in the theater a few years ago and falling in love with Guy Patterson from Eerie, PA, as well as all the classic Wonder Songs.This movie is about four boys from a little town in PA trying to make the big time.  You have the handsome and talented lead singer Jimmy, the easy-going, yet totally charming Percussion player Guy (Shades!) the funny-in-a-dumbass way guitarist Lenny, and let us not forget the airheaded Bass Player.  They start out in Jimmy's garage singing a slow ballad called That Thing You Do and decide its good enough to play in a contest.  They are up on stage and all of a sudden Guy gets an idea and starts playing That Thing You Do a few notches too fast.  The next thing you know you have a up-tempo 50's classic which makes these boys rich and famous, even if its only for a little while.This movie is all about living in the moment.  It also gives the audience a little taste of what its like in the Music World, and how some people would do anything to get their fifteen minutes of fame.  In the end, The Wonders are no more, but they are remembered, and the result is a beautiful love story.  10/10",,Anonymous,Music
The movie was great!,"I really enjoyed this movie because it was one of the few cleaner films that my wife and I have not had to walk out of because it was just too vulgar. I applaud Tom Hanks in his writing, directing, and acting.  I really thoroughly enjoyed the film!  The music was also pretty",,Anonymous,Music
I liked it.,"This movie is a lot of fun.  It doesn't try too hard to do anything, like win any Oscars, (a credit to Tom Hanks who already had two under his belt at the time.)  It just makes you feel pretty good.  One thing I do have a problem with is that the father is disapproving of his son playing drums; but then twenty minutes later, he's caught up in the whole hysteria over the Wonders. He's even wearing sunglasses in his living room pretending to drum.  After seeing this movie, I'm expecting some great things from Ethan Embry.  He's great in this part even though his character's kind of a dope.",,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly Good,"I didn't expect too much when I first saw this, but I was really taken with the story and the atmosphere. This won't win any awards, but it's a lot of fun to watch, and it looked like the actors had a great time making it. I have to admit, the final time they play ""That thing you do"" on the television show is just outstanding. I like the song the more I hear it. Very enjoyable movie.",,Anonymous,Music
Coincidence?,"This is a watchable and enjoyable film, but could it be coincidence that after portraying astronaut Jim Lovell in the movie Apollo 13 (with characters Fred Haise and Ken Mattingly) Tom Hanks wrote a screenplay with main characters named Haise and Mattingly? Interesting.",,Anonymous,Music
That Thing It Does to YOU!,"If a movie has a pulse and entertains, it has done its office.  This one not only kept me entertained for the full length of the film, it got me doing horrible '60s dances more than once.  The characters, story, and not least of all the soundtrack were put together nicely.  Who never dreamt of superconcentrating their fifteen minutes of fame into one brilliant flash in the pan?  And who can really resist the work of Tom Hanks?  Well, I mean...who and how many of his friends?",,Anonymous,Music
A Paint By Numbers Movie that Works,"While some people may castigate this film for being derivative and not breaking any new ground, sometimes its good to tell a story that plays out according to a formula. Some of the best films have borrowed heavily, bordering on blatant rip-offs, of similar films. The bottom line is to do it well and please the audience. That's where this film succeeds.Director Tom Hanks calls in a bunch of favors from his Hollywood cronies to tell a story about a one-hit-wonder band in early 60s America. At a time when the Beatles were taking the country by storm, the Wonders stumble into everything, including fame. With cameos by Hanks' buddies such as his former Boosom Buddies co-star Peter Scolari, Chris Isaak, Kevin Pollak, Clint Howard (Ron's brother)and Johnathan Demme, to name only a few, Hanks spins a wonderful tale that is utterly predictable and totally fulfilling.Liv Tyler comes close to stealing the show as the lead singer's girlfriend who goes on the road with them. Her bouts of Beatlemania-esque screaming are sure to bring a smile to your face. It's easy to see how she would later go on to bigger and better things.With a superb cast and a nice story, you really have to be a curmudgeon not to like this film.",,Anonymous,Music
Nice movie about breaking into the biz,"I was kinda surprised I liked this movie.  I thought it was going to be cheesy, seen it before crap but it was actually a nice little flick.  It shows how fame can be enjoyable, yet fleeting and it also shows the kind of evolution a band makes from one stage to another.  All and all a decent flick.  The best part was the soundtrack.  Like a previous review mentioned, it sounds like it came straight from the 60's.  The one thing that would have made this more interesting (perhaps) was if it was in quasi-documentary style, with the drama scenes acting as ""dramatizations"".",,Anonymous,Music
60`s nostalgia at its best,"One of the hardest things for writer/director Hanks whilst making this movie, must have been creating a nostalgic, brilliant, original song to base around the movie. He did just that. The title song could easily have fitted in place in the 60`s charts. Featuring a starring cast of relative unknowns, it charts the rise and fall of ""one hit wonder"" pop band, ""The Wonders"", on their quest for global domination in 1964. The bands music takes a new direction when drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott) joins the band, to fill in for the previous ""guy"" who managed to break his arm. Guy`s upbeat attitude provides the spark they need, giving them a #7 hit single, television and radio recognition, adoring girls, and a trustworthy manager in the form of Tom Hanks. Relationships in the a band deteriorate, and so the story goes.Backed up by some great music, and featuring all those 60`s cliches, its a sensitive and enjoyable look at life through the eyes of an up and coming pop band in the 60`s.",,Anonymous,Music
That Thing You Do (over and over),"I've heard some comments about how many times the title song is played in this movie.  Most people think it's over-played.  I think this was really done for a reason.How many times has a song been played so much that you just started hating it after awhile. They had only one song, and I thinks that's the point being made here.  Bleed a style dry and move on.",,Anonymous,Music
"Held my hand, holds my heart","That Thing You Do! is the ultimate feelgood film, with myriad happy moments, great humour and not too much nasty philosophy!  Tom Everett Scott is immensely likeable, Liv Tyler does well in a role that's not too difficult for her to manage, and the others, whose names I forget, were good as well. The songs are great -I've got the soundtrack, and 'Hold my hand, hold my heart' is one of my favourite songs as well as providing a gorgeous moment on screen.  After watching this I was more pleased with Tom Hanks than I have been before or since, and although his more recent dictatorial series 'Band of Brothers' wasn't my favourite (what I saw of it), That Thing You Do! is a joyous milkshake of a film which he can be proud of.  It's pretty clean, which is nice for a change, and did anyone else recognise Guy's father as someone you've met before?  Actually his part and all the other small parts, like Del Paxton and Diane Dane, were what carried the film. The way Hanks created a whole time-capsule of famous songs that didn't really exist was great.Watch it sometime to cheer yourself up, and if you don't like the title song the first time it plays, you will by the end!",,Anonymous,Music
Liv Tyler is fantastic!,"Just watched this movie for the third time on tv.  I think Liv Tyler is stunning, sweet, and fantastic in this film.  She has such a unique quality...any criticism of her is absolutely unfounded.  Probably just jealous.  I'm a straight chic, by the way, so my judgement is not clouded. I just think she lights up the screen.  The movie would be boring without her, though, so I can see why you'd not like it if you didn't like her. Although I can't see why you wouldn't;  for me, she makes any movie watchable.  I love the scenes with her in the coffeeshop of the Ambassador Hotel (now, of course, the Beverly Hills Hotel).  I think she fits the aesthetic perfectly.",,Anonymous,Music
I didn't have a lot of feeling for 60's music until I saw this movie!,"It was 5.30 Pm ,Wednesday I was wondering if anything was on the movie channels, so I began watching whatever was on Sky Premier. I have always been into pop music ,but as I was born in the 80's I am grateful to this movie for giving me an insight into the scene of the 60's. The movie, which was wonderfully entertaining and had a few good comic moments at times rolled like a documentary into the scene of the record business, and the lifestyle it provided for its brief stars. The mass hysteria was not so much from the screaming girls but the executives who thought they could send a band down the road of the Beatles ,on just one very catchy tune. Tom Hanks was excellent as the cynical Mr White, into whom he seemed to have put a lot of sincerity. The movie was instantly feelgood and it emanated a lot of energy, with the concert footage and the mass-hysteria of the fans , and the mass-hysteria of the band when they realised they were gonna hit stardom. If you're a fan of 60's music or if you hate it, you should see this movie!",,Anonymous,Music
An underrated 'Wonder'ful movie!,"This movie is a great feel-good one, even thou its about a journey with ups and downs.First of all, I think the entire cast were perfect, from Guy's father right down to Lemarr, everyone had character that you could immediately feel. Every scene from when the story begins is easy flowing and just about detailed. This movie may be a 'back-of-the-shop' job, but is worth it.Moving on with main characters, I actually loved how Guy confidently changed their lives for the first time at the school-show, the nerves of the other band members trying to deal with the sudden of it. From that night, their lives change completely¬Ö.and through the journey we have Jimmy's stubbornness, Lenny's cringe-worthy humour, TB Player's quirkiness, Guy's young innocent fun charm, and of course, Faye, who is like a '5th' member of the band, and her story unfolds itself from the beginning. Every character's individuality makes for clashing and bonding.Of course its great that Tom Hanks played a role in this, some parts he lends his fast humour and it works.I liked how this story goes, I really do, and I applaud Hanks for making a small-time movie so well. I would recommend you rent this, if you like sweet movies with good simple-telling storyline. It should leave you smiling! :) I rate this 9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Music
Tom Hanks Does It Again...,"Once again Tom Hanks writes and directs a stimulating movie. Its the story of a  50/60's rock band and their quick climb to the top of the billboards. Brilliant character portrayals by Tom Everett Scott, Johnathon Schaech, Liv Tyler, and Ethan Embry (whose character lacks a name. I always believed this was a joke at the expense of bass players all over. The lack of name is a joke at the thankless job that is being a bassplayer... can you name the bass player of your favorite band?). Although, there are many talented actors one stands out among the others as far as humor goes, and that is Steve Zahn. You may have seen him in the under appreciated film ""Saving Silverman"" with Jack Black. The blend of good music and dry humor makes this movie one that I had to own (Which means its pretty damn good). but I won't promise you'll make it through the movie without seeing Tom Hank's wife, Rita Wilson in a small unnecesary role.~Tim ....Great movie....",,Anonymous,Music
Old Music loved by New Generation!,"I can't believe I am giving a review for a movie like this, when I am 14. No one I know likes old stuff and I am not saying I do.  Anyways the other day, one of my teachers played this movie and everyone thought it would be boring.  But all 26 of us were up and dancing to it.  I love the song ""That Thing You Do""!!!!!  I just downloaded it last night and I can't stop dancing to it.  The movie is really good and along with some comedy is also a very real situation.  It was a really good movie and I look forward to actually buying it sometime in the near future!",,Anonymous,Music
That thing you do is a incredible tribute to a long bygone age,Tom Hanks Outdid himself in 1996 with that thing you do. The story is simple the acting is..Magic. singled out is Liv Taylor for her role as Kay the girlfriend of the leader of the Wonders and as their fame grows She alone Grows up. It's not to the end when Guy Patterson (Nicely played by Tom Everett Scott) Grows up as well. This movie shows us a age that most of us had forgotten or never knew existed to most people the sixties music scene was The Beatles or the British invasion or..Woodstock. Tom Hanks quietly reminds us that this was not so. This is a America where JFK was president Working on Sunday was simply unthinkable and Rock and Roll was starting to come into it's own as The soundtrack for a generation. The story could be clich√©d but in Hanks's Able hands it becomes Magic. The local Band needs a drummer after their drummer breaks his hand and so they recruit Guy Patterson the son of a local furniture store owner and Guy a lifelong Jazz fan joins them. The leader is a moody young man named Jimmy and in the Wonders first show his slow Ballad That thing you do is Turned into a Rocking number by Guy and it becomes a Major Fan fave. Soon that Thing you do becomes a hit record and the Wonders MUST adjust to the temptations of fickle fate. Tom Hanks role of the record company talent scout/manager/mentor is wonderfully underplayed This is not his movie and he knows it having written and produced and Directed that thing you do. Hanks knows this movie belongs to the Wonders and he gives them enough room to grow. The music is totally original but sounds as if it came from a Rock-Ola time machine jukebox. Hanks makes no missteps in this one. This is a wonderfully thought out story. This movie was to me a love letter to a bygone age that we will never see again. Thank you Tom Hanks for a Wonderful movie going experience.,,Anonymous,Music
You've seen this thing many times,"The best thing about this film is the peppy title tune. It's played throughout the film. Beyond that, there is little to recommend this film. The story has been told a million times -- young band struggles with the pressure of success. There isn't a single scene in this film that doesn't seem awfully familiar. Pasrt of the problem is that everyone in this film is so darn nice that there is little contract. I could have used at least one character with some edge, but everyone in this film is bland.",,Anonymous,Music
The O-Needers!,"That Thing You Do! Is written and directed by Tom Hanks who also co-stars with Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn, Johnathon Schaech and Ethan Embry. Film is set in the summer of 1964 and tells of the story of American one hit wonder band, The Wonders. Who after scoring big with their catchy debut single That Thing That You Do, hope to blaze the hits trail like the British Beatles. But with success comes lifestyle changes, and inevitably cracks start to appear in the group dynamic.Utterly charming in places, and propelled by an irritatingly catchy theme tune, Tom Hanks' directing debut is enjoyable while it's on, if ultimately it's very predictable fare. It lacks bite for the dramatic threads, but the characterisations are strong, the period detail is spot on (Hanks clearly utilising his memory banks) and there's nothing to complain about in the acting. However, the trajectory of the story stays on such a safe formulaic road, with not a snippet of villainy or hardship to be found, that it's hard to genuinely root for this band to succeed. We like them, we like their song, but it's all made so easy for them, while there's also a distinct lack of humour to be found along the way. When the band starts to implode, ask yourself if you really care or not? Safe is the key word, Hanks has played it safe, it's inoffensive stuff and impossible to dislike, and there should be the odd tingle of warmth coursing through your body. But you have to be in a safe sort of mood to forgive it its lack of guts, or at the very least, adventure. 6/10",,Anonymous,Music
"""Looks like the O-neders""","This is my most favorite movie of all time! Not only is the writing and acting phenomenal, but it's got wonderful (excuse the pun) music too. Tom Hanks did an amazing job with this screenplay. The characters are well developed (except for the bass player, he didn't even have a name!)and aptly portrayed on screen. Tom Everette Scott gives amazing life to the Jazz lovin' character of Guy ""shades"" Patterson. A role many critics saw as a role Hanks himself would have played 15 or 20 years ago.Liv Tyler is beautiful in her portrayal as Faye, the girlfriend of James Mattingly (Johnathan Schaech) the talented, but somewhat self-indulged, narcissistic lead singer. Steve Zahn is just hilarious as Lenny, the goofball, womanizer who can't get a date, guitar player. In my opinion he has the funniest lines in the movie. And pretty much steals whatever scene he is in. Tom Hanks of course is fantastic as the bands manager (c'mon when isn't he fantastic?) Then There's Ehtan Embery who gives startling empathy to T.B. Player (The bass player). A some what ""dim bulb"" who joins the marines right before the wonders hit it big, and disappears right before the bands appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. This is the one part of the movie I didn't understand. Why was the bass player given no name. as one point in the movie Tom Hanks says ""Where's your bass player"" he doesn't even no his name, no one does for that matter, interesting. I wonder if that was a conscious choice, or something that just ""evolved"" Nonetheless, this movie is a superb slice of Americana from the early 60's. Great writing, superb acting, wonderful music; if it doesn't make you want to run out and join a band, I don't know what will.",,Anonymous,Music
"A decent movie, that's it.","While I agree with the opinion that this movie is a giddy, fun movie with little conflict, I have to say that I find the ending of this movie rather forced.Throughout the movie, we are told that Faye is ""special"" and she is the inspiration for the title song.  However, as the character is written, we get very little about her character other than she is two dimensionally sweet and perky.  The fact that she travels with the band leads me to question her sweet morality; 1960's parents allowed her to travel unescorted with four rock-and-roll musicians?  Hmmm.....Although I do enjoy this movie, especially the energetic performance of Steve Zahn as Lenny, I am irritated by the end of the movie.  There had been no chemistry between the two characters who end up together at the end of the movie (don't want to spoil it for anyone), no longing looks, no dialogue that hinted at affection.  It seemed like the writer of the movie just contrived this romance in order to have a tidy ""happy ending.""  The ending is the major flaw in an otherwise good movie.",,Anonymous,Music
Classic Period Piece,"A wonderful job of convincing everyone that THE WONDERS were an actual band from the 60's. Tom Hanks truly hit the jackpot on a sleeper film. The fact that the actors actually played their own instruments made the film all the more believable. Also, using little known actors, excluding Liv Tyler, helped in transporting the audience back to the 60s and follow their trevails of being a band.Great humor and great music made for a movie the whole family could enjoy.

Bravo Mr. Hanks!,"The first time I saw this was when I was about 9 years old. Of course I got bored when I first saw it (being an average 9 year old) but when I saw it for the second time a month ago I was truely amazed and touched!The movie is about four regular guys from Erie, PA that become a success over night in their band. The movie stars five amazing and brilliant people. The people who play each member act as if they really have the personality of their charactor.There is Guy Patterson (Tom Everet Scott). He plays the drummer of the band. He did a great job on acting as if he was really a drummer. There's one problem with his charactor, the whole Spartacus thing. It's hard to comprehend.There's also Lenny (Steve Zahn) the goofy of the wall lead guitarist. He is so hilarious in this movie. I couldn't keep from laughing.Jimmy (Johnathan Schaech) is the reluctant one. I really think Johnathan did a good job at portraying a lead singer. I did not like the charactor of Jimmy though. He ended up being a real pain in the butt at the end.Let's not forget Liv Tyler. She did an excellent job at being a girl-next-door. I enjoyed her character greatly.Last but not least (definately not in my book) is the bassplayer (Ethan Embry). This had to be my favorite charactor in the whole movie. I like the fact he played a shy guy. He seemed so innocent.I think Tom Hanks did a wonderful job at writing, directing, and co staring in this magical movie. Bravo Mr. Hanks, and bravo to Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn, Jonathan Scaech, and Ethan Embry.

Follow a one hit wonder group in 1964 as their song climbs the charts,"This is one of my favorite movies.

The acting is commendable as well. That Thing You Do! is no doubt a ""feel good movie,"" but it is not boring or pointless.

Entertain-ably Fun!!!,"Tom Hanks is more than a great actor.  As Writer, Director, & Actor in ""That Thing You Do"" he displays his wide range of talents.

The story follows 4, very talented, guys in a garage band, who get their big break with theirOne-Hit-Wonder, ""That Thing You Do""   This very catchy song propells them into fame faster then you could sign a contract, and then reveals the sad and realistic misfortunes of that fame, and the fall that sometimes follows. This was a great film that gave it's audience a peek behind the music business and into the lives of these 4 ambitious boys. You can't help but cheer for them as you watch their song rise to the top of the charts. Tom Everett Scott and Liv Tyler are the ones to watch in this film, with great supporting roles by Johnathon Schaech and Steve Zahn.

"Bang the Drum Slowly, Bang the Drum Quickly, Just Bang the Drum.","Nostalgic view of 1960s Americana and its early love affair with rock'n'roll as four youngsters (Tom Everett Scott, Ethan Embry, Steve Zahn and Jonathan Schaech) from Pennsylvania become national sensations with their music. Writer/director Tom Hanks steals the show as the group's wise-cracking manager who is not around near enough to sustain interest as the movie grows tiring in its latter stages. Hanks' screenplay is a fluffy feel good time capsule of an era that many not of the age know little about. The band though is hit and miss throughout and the real highlights come from the young ladies (Liv Tyler and Charlize Theron) who follow the group on their meteoric rise to super-stardom.
