"Naturally expands on the first film, even if it never reaches its quality.","'28 Weeks Later (2007)' expands on the first film in a surprisingly natural way, even if it answers a nicely ambiguous question which that superior picture purposely left hanging. It's a relatively consistent-feeling affair, even if it never captures the isolation or relentless fury of its predecessor. It does get a bit 'been there, done that' when the plot kicks in simply because of where it starts and where it ends up, though it does take a number of risks and isn't afraid to be pretty grisly, either. It's also a fairly distinct experience in its own right, one that's enjoyable throughout. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Still Waiting for 28 Months Later,"Not as strong as 28 Days Later, that's for sure but a rating of 1,2, or 3 for certain is undeserved and no serious rating. Some logic issues, yes, but still better than 90% of the movies published under the banner of the zombie/walker genre. I watched tons, and I know what I am talking about - 28 Weeks Later, good, but could have been much better with a more plausible story and with less ueber-life dramatic action scenes (like that car chase and poisoning gas in the streets).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
True Sequel,"A sequel to 28 days later and you don't need to watch it to understand this one. The infection has died off and the UK population has been reduced to a few, being backed by US forces living on the Isle of dogs in London. We follow one family haunted by what they saw in the outbreak, some of these demons return. You rarely see the aftermath of an apocalypse with this interesting premise and conflicted characters it really starts well. But once the inevitable returns so does the usual clichés in this genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well-done: Gripping and scary,"Having seen 28 Days Later I thought I was prepared for this, but I was not. Somewhere near the beginning of the film is a scene that goes from zero to psycho in about 2 seconds flat. The beginning of 2004's Dawn of the Dead also had a wildly chaotic kick-off scene, but unlike that film, which was a great film to laugh through while chomping your popcorn, this film is no laughing matter.When there's no violence, there's fear and tension.When there is on-screen violence, there is absolute shock and horror. Scene after scene shows ordinary people placed in impossible situations from which they cannot escape. This time, of course, there now two implacable predators out there hunting them down: the rage virus from the first film, and the military which is attempting to maintain control of any outbreak, but is willing to visit unspeakable horrors upon innocent people if they cannot keep that control. The horror and scale of the virus is so severe, that the plans the military implements are completely plausible.The actions scenes are masterfully done, effectively placing the viewer in the points of view of both the victims and the crazed, but still scarily human, zombies. The portrayal of the violence pulls no punches; people of all age groups and walks of life are destroyed without remorse. No attempt is made to soft-pedal it. The fragility of human life on Earth and its vulnerability to just the right nasty virus are thoughts that stay with you after you've left the theater, and add a nice ""after taste"" of fear. The soundtrack, as with the first film, is amazing in conveying the tension and dread and sadness of the scenes. The story is fairly tight, as well. My only complaints might be with the acting of some of the soldiers, which just didn't feel authentic to me for some reason.Overall I'd say this is one of the best zombie films I've ever seen, in fact, one of the most effective thrillers I've seen, as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Surprisingly Entertaining sequel,"When I first heard there was to be a sequel to Danny Boyle's excellent 28 Days Later and that Boyle himself would not be directing it, I was less than excited.Then the reviews began flooding in and I was surprised, shocked even, that the majority of them were positive.It was then after the well respected film critic Mark Kermode said it was ""very good"" and ""better than we had any right to expect"" that I began to raise my expectations.Im happy to report that they were exceeded by a sequel that surpasses the original in terms of tension and spectacle.Boyle remained on board with the project, albeit as a producer, but also directed some second unit footage and never allows it to veer away from the look or feel of his original.Not that he had cause to worry as the new director,Juan Carlos Fresnadillo obviously understood Boyle's vision and expands on it without getting too carried away.The result is a faster paced, less reflective film, containing a very intelligent political subtext and some fantastic action set pieces that (and this is the most important part) delivers a large number of quality scares.It also dwarfs 28 days later in terms of gore, meaning true horror fans have much more in the way of visceral glee to sink their teeth into (pun intended).Bring on 28 months later...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing (read NOTHING) is held back...,"...Not this time.I believe 28 Weeks Later did appreciate as a sequel (with only a couple very minor depreciative concepts), and that was a surprise.I'm admittedly a zombie film fan (especially the serious, non A-Team variety). And although the Rage virus in these two films does not produce an 'undead' zombie, the 'infected' nevertheless present a similarly formidable and threatening antagonist. If you haven't seen either film, Boyle's 'infected' are far less like the traditional lumbering Romero zombies, and closer to the Zack Snyder zombies of 2004's Dawn of the Dead. Note that if you were able to get away with seeing 28 Days Later as a date movie, you may not pull it off with 28 Weeks. There is very little breathing room, and some of it is more disturbing and far less bridled than you might be expecting, especially if you are used to the character-based 'safety' of most films.Unlike 28 Days, a flashpan start to 28 Weeks Later sets the tone for the entire film... Which although short in running time (at just over 1:30) with quite a fast pace, still seemed very much long enough to be perfectly enjoyable, especially for any fan of the genre. Other than a brief, but informative back-story conversation near the beginning, there is almost no down time spent (wasted?) on emerging relationships or overly granular side-stories. Overall the most powerful element of the film isn't really character based, but rather the theme of a terrible pandemic that, besides a small twist, isn't much changed from the first movie.There is one facet of the film that I did not really appreciate, but can't really detail without a spoiler warning. Let's just say that London is a fairly large playground for certain (coincidental?) events to happen (and not just once). However, there's a possibility I may be missing some concept that made these events intentional--I hope it's some twist of the virus and isn't just star power.I'll be purchasing the DVD, but probably won't offer to watch it with any of my family and couldn't recommend it as a party movie :)Post Script: If you had ever wondered why the rest of the world was not affected by this virus, consider the geographically isolating nature of the British Isles and the extremely short incubation period of this virus. A truly viable pandemic must have a longer incubation period and optimally be airborne or at least infect multiple disparate species. So the Rage virus, while perfectly suited in close quarters would likely not travel much farther than a pair of human legs could travel.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The first movie was brilliant, but this installment...","Was average at best.I'm really tired of the stupid things people do in most horror films. This film is no different. The horror films that I consider as really good don't need to have idiot characters doing stupid things to keep the story moving. Death shouldn't need a dumb mistake or a poor decision as a catalyst.The effects were really realistic, the story even plausible; not that it needs to be. The speed of the virus' transformation however, was inconsistent with the victims and a little faster that what one would expect to be believable.Average at best.Six and a Half out of Ten",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Inferior to the first,"A downgraded sequel to 28 Days Later, it manages to look and play the same, but it just doesn't live up to the first, not to mention its nowhere near as scary.Instead of 28 days, its now been 28 weeks since the virus broke out. People are returning to London, for its been secured from the virus, and is ready to return to its original life, although still under surveillance of the U.S. Army.There's a deeper plot where a woman turns out to be a carrier of the Rage virus, and comes in contact with one other person, which spreads more and more until mostly everyone is infected. This leads the U.S. Army to have no choice but to kill off anybody they see, even civilians that aren't infected, for a precaution to make sure the virus doesn't spread again.Thats one thing I thought was incredibly stupid. The army becomes the main enemy, not the virus, which makes it nowhere near as creepy or thrilling. Its a lot more gory, and has a lot more shaky camera, but it doesn't make it that scary, no matter what.I did like the characters though, but when it comes to surviving from the virus and army, not much character development is available, though I did like Jeremy Renner's character. This won't be the last character Renner plays thats in the army.This film is mostly for the horror film gore lovers. But if your looking for a good psychological thriller, than this isn't for you. Its not terrible, but its inferiorness to the first just makes it wanna not exist.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The end is once again extremely ****ing nigh,"I've never been a huge fan of the zombie horror genre, but I was very impressed by Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later Somehow it managed to create characters worth caring about as well as throwing mindless zombies at them. So when I heard that a sequel was in the making, I was excited but understandably cautious since the Disappointing Sequel Syndrome is all too common nowadays. I also disapproved of the director switch, fearing that yet another low-budget gem will be Americanised by Hollywood, made far too slick for its own good.So to say 28 Weeks Later was a pleasant surprise would be an understatement. Fresnadillo managed to maintain everything that was good in the original and add his own flair. The rage virus, the zombies and the gore are all still here. But most importantly, what keeps the series shockingly vivid is the willingness to flaunt the naked truth: we humans are the real monsters. Under such extreme circumstances, mankind's self-preservation instincts kicks in and it is an ugly sight to see. It might be the necessary thing to do, but that still doesn't make it feel right.The film starts off at an odd pace but soon settles into a familiar terror-stricken rush. The cast was well selected, nothing out of the ordinary but no obvious weak links either. The Americanisation was not as severe as I had previously dreaded, and I actually quite welcomed Rose Byrne and Jeremy Renner leading the plot. The shots of post-apocalyptic London may have been done already but they're still as effective as ever, and John Murphy's score is brilliant as always.All in all, a worthy sequel to Days and very few fans will be disappointed, I hope.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
a good sequel of a decent horror movie,"European horror movies used to be theatrical, low-budget and suffering from it, and badly edited. Like its predecessor, 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later is nothing like that. I must say this is one of the best horror movies I have seen (and I have seen hundreds), for a number of reasons. Although the movie does juggle many clichés, it does so kind of skillfully, so that you can really expect to be surprised. Most importantly, however, the sequel is as good as the original, which is the greatest surprise of all in the horror genre.The main gimmick here, like in the original, is a mix of the zombie theme and the killer virus theme. The zombies here are extremely hyped-up, not doped, and instead of being bent on eating the flesh of the living, they behave like rage-driven human beings stripped completely of their superego and ego, and left with the instinct to fight (and yes, as it's the result of a scientific experiment gone bad, the movie can be considered sci-fi). Perhaps due to the fact that this is an European movie, we get something markedly different from the Resident Evil franchise - here, in placed of Resident Evil's focus on showcasing pretty actresses and made-up high-tech, we are treated to a foreboding feeling of isolation and powerlessness in face of helplessness and doom. We get to see normal, everyday people and faces struggling to survive, when practically everyone around them can quickly become the embodiment of evil and destruction. 28 Weeks Later focuses a little more on some action elements than, say, on the question of how long people can uphold their morality and respect for their fellow woman in such peril, but still, this movie stands proudly as a horror flick. And, like I said, it is different - with its crisp visuals (unlike the music-video lushness of a lot of Hollywood film scare), haunting and memorable music and unaffected performances. There are some loopholes in the plot, of course (e.g. really not enough few safety precautions on the part of the military for such a dangerous epidemic potential), but the movie runs smoothly throughout, and even the child actors deliver.There are better movies with a similar feel (such as Children of Men), but as a sequel to a decent horror movie, 28 Weeks Later certainly stands out. By the way, I think that watching 28 Weeks Later will be an especially scary experience for Londoners, as most of it is set in London. Londoners, beware.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A well paced, multi jump in your seat movie","Given that this time of year normally gives way to three-quels, kid friendly fayre or brainless blockbusters it's nice to have a proper 18 certificate horror film we can all go and see - without the worry of horror-lite 12A Hollywood horror, or 'lets try to gross out as much as possible' Hostel-a-like films.Taking over directing duties from Danny Boyle is Juan Carlos Fresnadillo - and at just a shade over an hour and a half long - he has given us a great piece of well paced, atmospheric cinema, with more than enough moments in there to please fans of the original, as well as plenty in there for anyone new to movies' concept.It's (funnily enough) 28 Weeks Later - and the infected have all died out, so it is now time to repopulate London. Cue more deserted streets, and a great opening which introduces us to the latest batch of protagonists to the rage virus - as well as lots of bored American soldiers - who whilst they don't actually add anything to the plot certainly keep the action moving.Kudos to the producers for adding Robert Carlyle to the cast - who adds a certain vulnerability and air of menace to the role - think Begbie having a really really bad day - as well as a nicely rounded cast of supporting actors - including an impressive Imogen Poots, and Boyle alumni Rose Byrne.Sure there are the usual horror staples to adhere to - stupid characters you just know are going to come to a sticky end, caricature soldiers to name but two - but ultimately you've got a well made film which is great to look at and, given a Spanish director surprisingly British horror movie that not only adds to the original but with the excellent ending certainly leaves the door open for Part 3.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best damn horror movie I've seen in a long time.,"This I can honestly say is not an overstatement. The movie contained everything it needed to be become a classic horror movie. It had gore, emotion,a few jumps,and action all the way through. The movie starts off well with the jumps and the pulse pounding action. Then all calms for a second, only to pick up again and faster.First off the gore was not as bad as some movies, which are overly gory for no reason. Don't get me wrong there was gore and lots of it, but for some reason it seemed to fit within the movie so well that your not really bothered by it. I'm no gore hound but I honestly couldn't turn away from the screen.The emotion is excellent for a horror film. Normally you get one dimensional characters, that do things that would never make sense whether panic stricken or not. In this film the emotions were well placed and not cheesy at all. There may have been one scene that went a little overboard but it didn't ruin a thing.The jumps were slight, and if your not a jumpy person you may not jump at all. But with all the action you'll still be on the edge of your seat, and the jumps to tell you truth are an added incentive.Finally the action was full on pulse pounding. It was incredible for a horror film. Think of the beginning scene of the Dawn of the Dead remake, but put it in the whole film, with a few chill spots with well placed acting. Honestly this movie deserves a 10 and has restored my faith in horror movies. I will be getting it on DVD and any directors cuts that may come out as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
a fairly solid sequel,"28 weeks after the original outbreak of the Rage virus the military is still busy cleaning up and providing 'safe zones' for the survivors of the post-apocalyptic London. However two kids who want to see their old house could just be everyone's undoing in this sequel to the film ""28 Days Later"" Director Juan Fresnadilo might not be quite up at the level as Danny Boyle, but he still does an admirable job in his own right and the film crawls with tension (espiecally the opening sequence which is superb). It's also well-acted apart from a few bit parts. But make no bones about it, it's the great Robert Carlyle (Full Monty) who steals the show as the children's' dad who makes some extremely tough choices, he really sinks his teeth into the role and the film is all the more better for it.If the franchise can keep up the same breakneck pace, tension, and scares as the first two films have then i'd have no qualms about seeing a ""28 Months Later"" or even a ""28 Years Later""My Grade: B+Eye Candy: Catherine McCormack shows T&A (but due to the scenario it isn't arousing)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Rip roaring, Genre explosion, takes the series to a whole new level","28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the Danny Boyle art-house horror cult smash, was at the bottom of the list of movies one would look forward to. The first film was, in my opinion, an overlooked classic, it was raw, realistic and the performances from Cillian Murphy and troop where tour-DE-force. The thought of American's invading a British horror film made many worried, and it was quite distracting throughout the film, but it doesn't suffer much from it, and the film-makers wisely don't take it too far. Very much like Aliens (the action packed sequel to Alien) 28 Weeks Later is much more action orientated, and elevates the mythology of the first film to a whole new level. There are some truly thrilling moments in the film, some of the highlights being the napalm detonations, and night vision sequence in the subway, the night vision sequence is easily one of the most terrifying moments in cinema this year. The script is of high caliber, but is does have some frustrating moments, particularly the fact that most of the problems the characters face, are due to lack of communication between the characters. But these quibs are minor. Other impressive mensionables is the two young leads, who have the almighty task of carrying the film, they do a fantastic job. The film also smartly re-uses God Speed You Black Emperor and John Murphy's superb rock score, and the all round style of the first film is maintained, the only difference being the first film was shot on DV, this one on film. If your a fan of the first film, you'll go ga ga over 28 Week's, it's the quintessential blood soaked adrenaline rush, and one of the best sequels i've seen in a long time.Verdict: Bring a seat to hide under.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mehhh...,"There is a lot of questionable editing in this movie. Whenever there's action, screen is littered with a lot of random shots which job is to portray the carnage which is going on, but it looks out of place and is not necessary. Romero's zombie movies are a perfect example of that, though zombies in this movie are much more fast, so it can be explained that way, but it still feels hard to watch. Movie redeems itself with a few cool dreadful scenes and with a lot of tension throughout the movie, which replaces the scares of the first one. All in all, it's a decent movie, just don't expect something on an art level. It's just a movie to watch for fun ( because characters don't really succeed in making you care for them that much ) .",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A solid, complete zombie film.","I must immediately stress that critics who made the interpretation that this was a statement on the Iraq War seem to know as little about it as they do allegory. I'll write more on this later.To put it succinctly, this movie has all that modern zombie movies are supposed to have. Incredible gore? Check. Virus zombies? Check. Biting zombies? Check. Soldiers shooting zombies? Check. A horror plot that has people falling to their own weaknesses? Check.The shocks are there, the plot is excellent, and the acting is very, very good. My only issue with the movie, actually, was its use of some recognizable actors- casting semi-unknowns makes the movie more visceral, instead of having fans think, 'Oh, I saw that guy in...'.Thankfully, fans of the first movie will notice that it doesn't try to ret-con anything, and the same action-focused, grainy camera work makes a welcome return. The movie moves along at a nice pace, never leaving you room to get bored.Carina Chocano in the Los Angeles Times commented, ""The director's message is less overtly political than it is allegorical -- that chaos breeds chaos and that force only serves to amplify it."" Given that from the very first moment, without getting too specific, people abandoning their duties defines the movie (as it does virtually all zombie films), I would have to completely disagree. I even set upon another viewing of this movie simply for the purpose of finding an Iraq metaphor- and it's not really there; at this point, they would find a war metaphor in Disney's 'Dumbo'. Unfortunately, I'd have to say that this time, the critics are pretentiously political; so don't worry about getting preached to, as I did. If you're looking for military/force/war metaphors, look to the first film, 28 Days Later. If you're looking for an excellent, fun, gore-infested romp, watch this right afterwards.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I am torn,"28 days was surprisingly good.This one wasn't bad....BUT...In the shadow of fine films such as Blues Brothers 2000 and Terminator 2, this sequel was needlessly oriented on kids. I can handle a story about a MAN who has to transport a kid (Children of Men), but this went a little too far paying attention to the kids. Unless it is oriented at kids, the children should be nothing more than a wiggling package to be dealt with in an action movie. Child/Teen mischief should not be a plot device (and it is in this one).I didn't expect a great storyline and I didn't really get it, the movie is about constant frenetic escapes from the flesh-eating zombies as well as some escapes from an overzealous military thrown in to boot.Somehow though, I still did enjoy it. They aren't afraid to kill off important characters and they do play with your expectations as a moviegoer. There are a couple of scenes where you are expecting shocks and they just laugh in your face. Also note the presence of a ""Dead Meat"" character. You halfway expect a particular monster to have a hesitation due to emotion while he is attacking certain victims. The movie makers almost use the typical tricks of a horror movie as red herrings to mislead you about where the plot is going to go.Other things to look out for: multiple shots surreptitiously highlighting the chests of the leading ladies. humor is present, but at a different level than the obvious. you have to laugh at yourself and at the way they made the movie. I actually liked the slightly-sped-up effect, I felt it belonged here because it enhanced the way that an attack from a zombie would feel: quick, dirty, and to the point. a theme is that anyone with emotion tends to regret it, while the ""by the book"" military or the one-track-minded zombies survive and thrive. As soon as anyone stops having a rational reason for doing something and is working strictly from an emotion, then things go horribly wrong. The CG wasn't great, it was okay. Fire and smoke were a little unbelievable. I did enjoy seeing parts of London decimated. The movie does stand on its own, with or without the first one. A very ""safe"" sepia (filtered lens) scene at the beginning showing an attempt to return to normalcy followed by a gory bloody color as the attacks start. Tight hallways, scary medical facilities, tube tunnels. The swarmlike convergence of the infected zombies in multiple scenes.All in all, I did really enjoy it and will be thinking about it long after the curtain has fallen, but found the ""children"" distracting. the thematic rising pitch detuned guitar motif.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 Weeks Later,"I remember watching ""28 Weeks Later"" as a kid and being blown away by its intensity and suspense. Back then, I would have rated it a solid 10 out of 10, with its thrilling pace and terrifying depiction of a zombie outbreak. However, after rewatching it recently, my perception has changed quite a bit.The film starts strong with a gripping opening scene that sets the tone for chaos and desperation. But as the movie progresses, it starts to feel a bit like a low-budget production. The special effects and some of the action sequences, which once seemed cutting-edge, now come off as slightly unpolished and less convincing.The storyline, particularly the subplot involving the zombie dad, feels awkward and forced. What initially seemed like a dramatic plot twist now feels more cringe-worthy and detracts from the overall tension of the movie. The idea of the dad turning into a zombie and becoming a recurring threat was meant to add a personal dimension to the horror but instead comes across as repetitive and not particularly compelling.Overall, ""28 Weeks Later"" has its moments of suspense and still carries a sense of dread, but it doesn't hold up as well as I remembered. The film's shortcomings become more apparent upon rewatching I'd rate it closer to a 6 or 7 out of 10 now-still entertaining in parts, but not the masterpiece I once thought it was.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not a bad thing.,"28 Weeks Later, the sequel to 28 Days Later, gamely carries on the tradition of intelligent zombie movies. The rage virus is back, and two kids may carry the antibody in their blood. Get them the hell out of a London that in its griminess rivals the stunning cinematography and dark set design of Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men.Tough for me to advise anyone to leave the greatest town on earth, but the heroes need to go across the sea, getting there bloodier than ever. Although the new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is more interested in special effects and quick cutting than the original's Danny Boyle, he does spare the outright revulsion should we ever see what cannibalism looks like up close, personal, and slow.The dark passages and twisting camera, coupled with machine-gun rapid shots, make the movie frequently inscrutable, not a big deal to horror fans but a frustration to us commoners who think the premise has promise of showing human nature at its Darwinian worst if we can only figure out what's happening. That mysterious mise en scene keeps us from connecting with the principals as we did with Cillian Murphy's and Naomie Harris's characters in 28 Days Later.But gore is to the fore, and that's just fine with those who first screamed at zombies in George Romero's Night of the Living Dead and laughed at them in Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead. What I said about 28 Days Later shows what's missing in its sequel: ""The eerie set design is appropriate without being overdone (Rod Serling would have approved its restraint), the characters are real without being overwrought (especially the women, who are usually sacrificed to too much emoting), and the subtexts about contemporary crises are clear without distracting from the science fiction genre itself."" Correlations with HIV and Iraq are not as easy as they were with the original.It's a nail biter and organ orgy, with just enough scary false starts and stupid people. I was engaged the whole time, except when an attractive film critic gave me her zombie embrace out of sheer fright. That's not a bad thing.",,Anonymous,Horror
Mixed feelings,I found the British one more raw and disturbing than this. I guess sequels often can't beat the originals. This film definitely has its moments.

Great sequel!,"OK, I admit it. I'm a zombie-buff. I like zombie flicks but I'm also quite picky in what flicks pass through my bullshit filter.

This said, no pun intended for 28 days later - it was an alright movie - but ""weeks"" is far more claustrophobic, intense, scary and gritty than its predecessor.It all starts of with a bang, cools down for a while, everything goes down the sh***er, then ends with a bang.

"Seriously, the best horror movie this year!","So far, it seemed like we didn't have many promising candidates for a great horror movie, despite the fact that I did enjoy 28 Days Later, it was very brilliant, it still wasn't exactly on my top favs of the horror genre. But 28 Weeks Later looked interesting, I was curious how they could do a sequel when it seemed to be a promising ending to the first, but the story here really worked! It was so disturbing and had a frightening apocalypse feeling that sent chills down my spin. The movie starts strong and ends strong and doesn't let you get a breath of fresh air.It starts off where in England there is a group of people who are all survivors from the Rage Virus, but they are attacked, including a married couple, it looks like all hope is lost for the wife, but the husband makes a clear escape. 28 weeks later, the US troops are sent to Britain to help destroy the virus and restore the country back. They gather all the survivors that are clean and have put them in a small part of England that is clear of the virus, but still there is so much to be done since a huge part of the country still has corpses and possible killers with the virus. The husband is reunited with his children and tells them that their mother is dead, but they want their old stuff from their old house in the unclean part of England, but they go and end up finding their surviving mom, but it seems like she may have the virus and ends up spreading it, causing total chaos!This movie does not stop with the horror and never lets go, this wasn't even a matter of the jump scares in my case, I think what was so scary was the fact that this movie captured human emotions so well. What people act like in chaos, wither it's bad or good, pulling one to safety, pushing one in the way of danger to save themselves, or the simple love a family and the ultimate feeling of betrayal, fear, and helplessness. 28 Weeks Later is a terrific movie that I highly recommend, it's scary as heck and will keep you thinking for days.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good filming bad writing,"I really enjoyed this film, very similar to the first one but with one important difference: The writing. The screenplay should been rewritten because contains lot of mistakes. I'm talking about the way the virus returns, i'ts a good idea to find somebody genetically immune to the virus, same happens with AIDS, but that woman should be under vigilance (1st mistake). The army tries to keep safe civilians with nobody at the doors of the room (2nd mistake).

Good actors in a very aggravatingly bad film,"I think I'm supposed to be the core demographic of this film. I like Zombie films and I don't even require them to be anything more than popcorny entertainment. Also I don't expect them to necessarily fall squarely into the Horror genre, Action is fine with me.Despite all this, 28 weeks was not an enjoyable offering at all. Theoretically, there is plenty of action, but the camerawork is so shaky and the editing so jumpy that you hardly see what's going on.
The writing isn't just nothing special, it is glaringly lacking in every respect: the dialogue (and especially the military lingo) is often cringeworthy, and, as others have pointed out, the story makes absolutely no sense in very crucial aspects. The fact that the director doesn't realize the movie never had potential for anything more than mindless action makes everything worse. I'd like to tell you that you'll enjoy yourself if you don't take the movie seriously, but unfortunately the movie takes itself completely seriously and that's painful to watch.Four stars for the four actors that I like and that somehow agreed to do this...",,Anonymous,Horror
Something of a let-down,"I had high hopes considering the quality of ""28 Days"" and what some of the reviews said, but too much in the movie was contrived. It seemed like the second half was an illogical or unnecessary series of events that were just used to see how much can be thrown into the mix without regard to plot holes and silly decision making by the characters. Glad I hedged my bets by seeing it at the dollar theater.The gore and violence were first rate (they should make movies like this as NC-17 and just go ""full tilt""), but the above issues became too much of a distraction.

Best movie of the Summer?,"This is not just another bland sequel to a great movie! This film actually holds its own until the final frame, never letting up. 28 weeks later single-handedly restored my faith in horror, taking its audience to new levels of violence, mayhem, gore, and dread. The music was perfect,no whiny pop crap, just throbbing instrumentals carrying the scenes of chaos. Gore-hounds will not be disappointed, the blood runs in the streets of a deserted London and beyond. True horror buffs will recognize a possible nod to Lucio Fulci in one scene, see if you can spot it. This is not a film for the faint of heart or of stomach. It's rated R for a reason, so leave the kids at home! At the showing I went to, some twit had brought their 4 year-old to this movie!

"We can expect ""28 Months Later""","""28 Days Later"" were excellent horror movie to me mostly because it was differently made from all other horror movies of that type. OK, I admit. It was also because of brilliance of Danny Boyle, who had a vision to make a very good horror movie; and sadly good horrors today are rare.""28 Weeks Later"" is a sequel and this movie wasn't disappointing in my eyes. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo replaced Danny Boyle and he brought something new in the movie. This sequel isn't better then the original but still represent good fun. What I liked about his way of directing is when zombies (couldn't think of another word) are attacking, his camera is all over the place. That is very interesting because everything happens so fast and the camera is shaking just like we're in the middle of action. Like we're running with them. I liked that and also I liked that helicopter-chopping scene. Very cool but nothing new. What is also special about this movie are characters. Did you notice that main characters doesn't save the day? They are far from doing that and this is something that is good and out of ordinary horror movie. There are no heroes, just victims. The entire story isn't realistic all the way long but the whole plot managed to hold my attention until the end.The ending was solid and it is obvious that third part is going to be made. Maybe ""28 Months Later"" (or some other name) will come closer to the original then ""Weeks"" did.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good sequel,"As an exercise in pure, unadulterated terror, 28 Weeks Later is a worthy follow-up to its acclaimed predecessor, 28 Days Later. In this ultra violent sequel from Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (hired on the strength of his 2001 thriller Intacto), over six months have passed since the first film's apocalyptic vision of London overrun by infectious, plague-ridden zombies. Just when it seems the ""rage virus"" has been fully contained, and London is in the process of slowly recovering, an extremely unfortunate couple (Robert Carlyle, Catherine McCormack) is attacked by a small band of rampaging ""ragers,"" and the cowardly husband escapes while his wife is attacked and presumably infected. Their surviving children (Imogen Poots, Mackintosh Muggleton) fall under the protection of a U.S. Army sharpshooter (Jeremy Renner), but nobody's safe for long as 28 Weeks Later goes into action-packed overdrive, with scene after blood-gushing scene of carnage and decimation. The film's visuals follow the look established in 28 Days Later, this time with bigger and better scenes of a nearly abandoned London on the brink of utter destruction. The military subplot gets a bold assist from Harold Perrineau (as a daring helicopter pilot) and Idris Elba (in a too-brief role as the military commander), and their firepower--not to mention the efficient lethality of helicopter blades--turns 28 Weeks Later into a nonstop bloodbath that's way too intense for younger viewers and guaranteed to leave hardcore horror fans gruesomely satisfied. That's all there is to it--this film is almost plot less and dialog is minimal throughout--but as a truly terrifying vision of survival amidst chaos, 28 Weeks Later honors its origins and qualifies as a solid double-feature with Children of Men. Could there be another sequel? Thanks to the ""chunnel,"" the answer in this case is definitely our.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stupid but watchable,"Basically 2 brats and a stupid father reintroduced the deadly virus to a safe quarantined zone.

Unsettling yet satisfying....,"7.1/10 (Definitely Recommend)It's been a hot minute since I've seen any of the ""28 Later"" movies, but I was sad to find out you can't get ""28 Days Later"" anywhere because of copyright issues. So I had to settle for ""28 Weeks Later"", but I'm not complaining.From the moment the movie starts my heart is racing and my stomach is churning because these are some of my least favourite zombies ever. The fact that they can break down doors and run as fast, if not faster than you, is super disturbing.The big thing that makes everything work is the cinematography. It's shaky, it's grainy, it's up close, and it gets you feeling claustrophobic. It makes you feel like you can't escape the nightmare. The snarls, the bites, and the blood make it all equally disturbing and distasteful, but I wouldn't have it any other way.I would say 95% of the film is actually good. It's only when it starts to near the end where it just becomes a mess. At the same time, this isn't a chaos that anyone is used to, so it's reasonable the logic goes out the window and people begin to screw up. Still, it doesn't make me feel completely content about the outcome.Overall, I would definitely watch this one again and I'm looking forward to ""28 Years Later"" coming out next year. It's unfortunate that, unless you buy a physical copy of the movie, you won't be able to watch ""28 Days Later"". As for this film it's viral. It'll make you wish it would all stop.

This is the way a sequel must be filmed...,"The first ''28 days later'', was a surprise for the horror-genre fans, (especially the zombie-fans) in the 2002, directed by Danny Boyle (Transpoitting) and introducing Cillian Murphy to the commercial cinema. The movie presented the Rage Virus, an experiment capable of infect a human being in few secs, turning the host into an aggressive and blood vomiting individual that went out of the hands of the British Government and cause the extermination of all its population.The contagion risks where highest than in other Zombie/films, especially in the George A. Romero ones:1.- Even the minimum drop of blood, or even a scratch could cause an infection; and:2.- As a plus to all this films, this creatures had the capability of run as fast as you can. And it is also worth of writing that the score: ''In the House, in a heartbeat'' by John Murphy, give the movie an special pace at the ending.Considered by many a cult classic, now, 4 years later, it comes a sequel to the original, directed by the Prodigious Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, and staring Robert Carlyle (who declined a role for the first one) this movie knows how to keep the same rules of the infection, and does it with unexpected drama and lots of tension.Early in the movie, just with the opening sequence you know that Fresnadillo it's everything but a dumb director, unlike P.W. Anderson, or Alexander Witt, he knows how to make a simple action sequence into a suffocating, nerves of steel one.Also, John Murphy's ''In the House, in a Heartbeat'' is back, and is better than ever, with 3 inclusions through the feature.With the help of the fast editing and the handy cam,(elements that fuel this sequel with images of cruelty and realism) it's delivered to us a movie that, if it fails in deliver something, is in a optimistic point of view of the humanity, where our relations decay and our children are the ones who inherit the violence and fear of our age.The plot, if you don't know it yet, is the re-population of London after 28 weeks later the first movie, and it focus in the life of Don (Carlyle) and his children, the Harris, whose mother disappeared in the holocaust. But like any horror movies, everything goes bad, as we found out there is still traces of the virus in London. Soon the infection spreads through its new population and now the Harris must find a way out of this mess.It doesn't surpass the original, but it's nearly as great as the first one, specially in the suspense, it's a high tension horror movie, and i widely recommend it to you.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent horror flick,"28 weeks later is the sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 days and continues the story of a virus infecting most of the human race. Don and Alice and four other survivors are hiding out in a wooded area outside of London.All of the infected die of starvation and those still alive are taken to district one, a place kept safe by American army soldiers.A woman named Alice tests positive for the virus but has no symptoms. Her husband, Don kisses her and becomes infected and as a result becomes violent. He kills his wife and several soldier and contaminates even more men.Chaos ensues with shootings, fires and further unrest,; pretty much a typical night of the living dead type movie, nothing new here, but o.k. if you're in the mood for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm usually not much of a zombie fan However,"This film rocks! Amazing Mercutio style slayings. The whole thing was a wash with oodles of the staple zombie gore, but shot in a very slick and I thought quite original style which I felt made this film a sequel worthy if it's predecessor.There was clearly more budget for this one and they knew just how to use it, turning London into a war zone with an almost too tangible realism. Enough to send shivers down one's spine. Which is what for me helps make this film really sing out as a great example of the genre, a film one can identify with it so much more. It's not impossible to imagine London decimated by a fast moving virus (look at aids in Africa), though it is for me harder to imagine that the Americans could actually get anything 'controlled' with in six months. So I did find the first half of the film to be a bit too pro-American, muscle flexing propaganda. However it was interesting to watch events unfold.Though I felt I was always a step ahead of the narrative this did not distract from the power of the characterisation and the empathy one feels for the characters as you watch the world fall apart around them.The one powerful lesson I think chaps everywhere can take from this is that they must be very careful when and where they abandon their wives.

Entertaining,"started off with an interesting plot, then continued to twist an surprise with a good method of suggesting what will happen an then the complete opposite happening.28 weeks later was not a character focused film unlike the original 28 days later which focused greatly on your feelings towards characters, who you want to live, an who you would like to die...about half way in the film seemed to thin out with believability an slightly drew me away from the film rather than draw me in.various actions made no sense an were unlikely decisions made by the writers, then suddenly (sadly) it became a captain commando Hollywood super hero movie which is a great leap from the original. the gore factor was strong an belly turning which is great for horror fans.the ending was good with suggestion of a another follow on at a far greater spread of infection an a more global task rather than just London/england.BUT the writers will need to try an keep the story more original an away from other movies. (the next 28 whatever later may as well be joined with the next resident evil movie as they have drifted too close together.)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"NO ESCAPE? Try the door marked ""EXIT""","The opening scene plays like the climax, as if they muddled the reels. It is so terrifying that you know they cannot possibly follow it. Unfortunately, it is also confusingly shot, which did not bode well for the rest. Like SUNSHINE, I had no clue what was happening most of the time. Why do filmmakers do this?Another miscalculation is the characterization. The original saw the world through the eyes of one individual. The sequel begins with one individual who is not sympathetic then shifts to Jurassic park kids who are less relatable. These children are forced to witness such brutal scenes, not least an unnecessarily explicit torching, that it is a turn off. The original actually had only two really violent scenes. Danny Boyle wisely pulled his punches for the rest of the picture so as to let the human drama breathe. His film had a heart. The sequel parades its heart in a token way before plonking it on a blooded sideboard so as to get on with gratuitousness. Apparently, a sequel has to have more, more, more. I think less is always more. The producers think we want another eye-gouging, but that worked in the original because it was delivered to someone unsympathetic to the audience. The sequel is about nastiness for the sake of it.The script has not an idea in its head, even resorting to a redundant lift from ""The Silence of the Lambs"". I presume the inclusion of so many Americans is due to the original's success in the States. I like the idea of America colonizing Britain but nothing is really done with the idea. Only the opening scene lingers uncomfortably in the memory. This really is a poor film.If you see Dick Wittington outside the cinema, tell him: ""Turn back, Turn back!""",,Anonymous,Horror
This is a fun addition to the horror genre that's worth watching but a huge step down from the original,"28 Weeks Later (2007) is a movie that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline picks up 6 months after the previous picture where pockets of civilization have formed within the quarantined zones of the outbreak. It's been months since any of the infected have been seen and most believe the infection is gone. When a mother of one of the survivors is found outside the quarantine zone she appears infected but normal. They bring her inside the quarantine zone to study her. What could go wrong?This movie is directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intruders) and stars Jeremy Renner (The Town), Rose Byrne (Insidious), Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting), Harold Perrineau (The Matrix), Idris Elba (Thor) and Imogen Poots (Green Room).This sequel is a huge step down from the Boyle classic. I did love the opening scene with the husband and wife and boat escape. The field scene with the helicopter 🚁 mowing down the infected was awesome. The ending was solid too. They did keep the infected interesting and the shootout scenes are worthwhile. They did a good job brining the music back from the original. The cast is fantastic and the setup and plot had a lot of potential. However, this entire film felt like it was missing something, like you wanted a bit more.Overall, this is a fun addition to the horror genre that's worth watching but a huge drop from the original. I would score this a 6.5-7/10 and recommend seeing it once.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I also repeat that this is a different movie. They didn't make the mistake of remaking the first movie or retelling it or getting lazy are re-re- redoing something.

One of the best sci-fi movies in a long long time.,"I went to watch this movie with no preconceived notions regarding the quality of the movie. In fact, I never heard of the movie, but what I watched was impressive. It's not a horror movie. Rather it's a science fiction movie that's based on a highly plausible premise. The action is fast-paced, accompanied by a musical score that intensifies the growing sense of doom as attempts to contain and eradicate a lethal disease unravel with catastrophic results. The scope of this movie is reminiscent of The Body Snatchers and The Day of the Triffids, the latter an excellent, and now all-but-forgotten, sci-fi story. This is one of the best science-fiction movies in a long long time and proof that when it wants Hollywood can present a credible sci-fi movie that tells a story and does not insult the audience's intelligence.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Proofs that George A. Romero has lost his monopoly on good zombie-movie making.,"Zombie movies always have been around, from as early on as the 30's. In 1968 George A. Romero changed the genre for ever with ""Night of the Living Dead"" and he perfected the genre with his movie ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 1978. From that moment on, lots and lots of film-makers tried to have a go at the genre, with often some bad formulaic B-horror movies as an end result. ""28 Weeks Later"" and the previous movie ""28 Days Later..."" are basically the first, non George A. Romero involved zombie-flicks, made in the same horror style as those earlier mentioned Romero movies.""28 Weeks Later"" chooses a realistic approach, so don't expect a movie with heroic character, blowing zombie's heads off. The movie is possibly even better as a study of human behavior instead.It's realism is being strengthened by its visual look. The camera-work puts you right into the middle of things and the movie never exaggerated with its action of gore.This doesn't mean that ""28 Weeks Later"" isn't a gory movie to watch though. As far as zombie movies go, this is actually one very gory movie to watch, with lots of blood and guts and body pieces flying around, so you have been warned.It's a direct sequel to ""28 Days Later..."" but its also a sequel that is using different characters and story lines. Therefor this movie remains perfectly good to watch even for those that have never seen ""28 Days Later..."". Not only the actors are different but there also is a different director at the helm this time. Danny Boyle passed on the honers to Spanish film-maker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. Danny Boyle still remained closely involved though and his hand is still clearly visible throughout the movie. He even directed some of the second unit work for the movie.Danny Boyle's influence is also notable in the movie its cast. Robert Carlyle already almost got a role in ""28 Days Later..."" and Rose Byrne had already appeared in the Boyle movie ""Sunshine"". The rest of the cast mostly exists out of unknown actors, which again, adds to the total realism of the movie.A zombie movie that has it all; gore, realism, action and horror.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 Weeks Later,"28 Weeks Later, a worthy and great sequel to follow a very special type of zombie movie. Consistent in it's directing and even more violent. 28 weeks later does not disappoint.I can't really describe how this movie just absolutely pulls you in in that first opening scene. Just like 28 days, it sets a very special precedence to make sure you know what kind of movie you're in. Whilst 28 days had a great slow and creepy start. The sequel does the sequel thing it makes it work again, and a bit more. With just enough there to really make it all work and come together.Directing, just like 28 days, the style of filmmaking is unique to this series and it's back here. It somehow just works for this type of movie, the way they pace it. The absolute mess of visuals. It just gets your heart racing. And this, like 28 days, is still very much a horror. A adrenaline rushing one at that. With great build up and following scenes.Whilst maybe not being stronger or better on a character front versus the first movie. It still had a solid lead cast. And a dynamic that worked enough, but there was a lack of it compared to 28 days that made scenes there work a lot better. Instead of extending some action scenes, like the sniper scenes felt a bit on the long end, I could've done with a bit more character building.It's a freaky horror movie no doubt. And if my memory serves me well, 28 days was not as gruesome as this. All good. The bloodfx are plentiful, the gunshots are so extreme too.It's a very serious film too, it doesn't have much levity or relief. You get a moment here and there to breath but it's still filled with a underlying tension.The story. Whilst overal I like it. The way some things happen... is a plot-hole disaster. In this 28 days was a lot better whilst also having faults but 28 weeks takes it a step further. If anything, what happend could've happend, but just have a couple of scenes to set it up, it needs a why. Especially when the whole city is setup as a surveillance state almost with camera's everywhere and guards. You can't just make that all disappear without reason. A power outage would've been an easy fix of sorts. But yeah, the major moment in the movie will need a bit of plot-hole tolerance.Overal though, exhilarating..",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent gripping zombie movie,"The movie is a worthwhile sequel to the original 28 Days Later. Never mind the logic of why the military or anybody would want to come back to infected London or UK. There can be logical explanations, but the fact that the director does not take the time to show that, does not make this less of a masterpiece. A good explanation might be the sense of lost of many of those who left families behind. They would be eager to return as soon as they were allowed (having lost all of their loved ones plus all earthy possessions). The movie explicitly mentions that the military has proof that all the infected died of starvation, 5 weeks after the outbreak.Zombies in this movie are ruthless and sick human meat scavengers. The movie portraits like no other zombie movie the fear of the victims and their desperation. The action in this movie is more believable than in its predecessor, since there is not a single all-mighty hero that comes to save them all. Both, military and ""good guys"" decisions are not infallible and because of that the film short range shots gain immensely in credibility. When things can go wrong they go wrong, Murphy's Law style. This is not a violent and gory movie, like many other zombie movies. I would say is nothing suitable for your children. Unlike other zombie movies the violence is not laughable, but gruesome and unpleasant like a news report from Iraq.. Also non-violent scenes are loaded with a tension that will make you remember this movie for a while after you are done with it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is not Anti-Anything. This is Nature,"28 Weeks Later, perhaps more than 28 Days Later is a reflection on nature. As an audience we are horrified yet entertained by violence, but more than anything - we are in fear - as at the heart of it, the reason and origin for our violent tendencies is unknown.Perhaps I may be alone in seeing it from this perspective but as I see it this movie is not 'Anti-War' or 'Anti-American'.One could see the 'rage virus' as a metaphor for violence, hatred, misunderstanding, war, etc.But perhaps it is just that - a virus. a part of nature. something we have no control over, something we don't understand, something we fear.28 Weeks Later proves there are still a few scares left.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not as bad as you may have heard, but *not* the first","When you start this up, it doesn't take long before you realize that it's different than the original. That doesn't have to be a negative, and there are good qualities to this. The Infected are still shot in a manner unlike that of the regular humans, and the visual style is nice. It becomes evident from early on that this discounts two rules for them as established before, both increasing how aggressive they come off at the cost of some of the pathos. With that said, there are interesting emotional situations in this, and I found the opening ten, fifteen minutes or so to be terrifying and chilling. This goes for intensity over atmosphere, and depth is lost. The action leans towards the chaotic, we can't keep track of what's going on, and we're not meant to. Think the initial half hour of Saving Private Ryan. I'd say this one is louder than the last one, and less both about the loss of loved ones(without abandoning it entirely). It is claustrophobic and unpleasant when it means to be. The characters are credible and psychologically accurate, the dialog natural. Acting tends to be good, including that of the kids. The concept is great, and part of the way, the idea of the quarantine with the military being in control(I can't be the only one sick of the presence of ""the big, evil, heartless corporation"" in recent films and shows) is dealt with well, in spite of the dumb soldier types. Then the annoying and obvious plot holes began cropping up. I realized how much of the trouble in this was on account of children. And how Americanized this is probably also got to me, because by the third act, I no longer particularly cared. 90 minutes of mostly adrenaline... I don't know, I think we require more substance along with it, especially when the previous entry set a standard for such. FX are well-done. There are a lot of jump-scares in this. This is the only thing I've seen by Fresnadillo, and it won't necessarily remain so. The creepiness and post-apocalyptic mood are effective, when this goes for them. Maybe ""Months"" will put this series back on track. There is a lot of bloody, brutal, gory violence and disturbing content, a little sexuality/near-nudity and occasional strong language in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track(by director and writer, who also offer their thoughts on the 2 deleted scenes), three short featurettes and two animated chapters of the graphic novel(I will review all five of them on their individual pages here on the site) and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to those looking for fast-paced horror. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What if....,"What was scary as Hell about 28 Days Later and it's excellent sequel 28 Weeks Later is that it shows us a virus-created from apparently(I read in some back-story literature) a splicing of the very real Ebola and Borna viruses. Ebola explains the violent hemorrhaging, Borna-a little know but real and scary disease-explains the rage. Souped up with some very fast incubation time. Borna was named after a town in the early 20th century in France, which was an unknown-origin virus that struck a horse farm with no warning. Apparently contagious, all the horses went into ""rage"" trying to kill each other until they all had to be put down and burned. No one knew where it came from-or where it went.All their brains were infected with this bug. But it has never thankfully appeared again. Borna was used in the 1985 virus film Warning Sign. What better way to spread a virus than by vomiting blood and bodily fluids all over people as you run into them? To sum up without spoilers, this film is a lot less disturbing on the human level as the previous film was which was truly disturbing at the last third. The characters here, this time, are warmer and this balances off the terror of the virus. A couple of people make some very stupid mistakes which re-activate the virus otherwise it may have been totally wiped out. The gore is there but the way it's filmed,staccato-like... your mind fills in more than is really seen. I like that, where violence is not lingered over but only flirted with. Also, in this film, it's apparent the virus is ready to mutate.Also, to answer the Dawn of The Dead vs 28 Days/Weeks...""are they or aren't they zombies?"" No, they're very much alive and in the throes of an uncontrollable virus. So, this film is less in the category of ""Zombie"" film and more in the category of ""Virus"" film such as The Omega Man(1971) Virus(1980) Warning Sign(1985) and Outbreak(1995) A worthy sequel to 28 Days Later....",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Solid but wobbly,"Not a bad sequel in many respects. At least it opens out the story more, where the original sadly abandoned the global consequences for a chase around a small stately home. It's fast moving and generally well done film but I have a message for the director - I own a camera tripod. It cost about £20 and it stops my photos being blurred and jerky. If he would like to buy it from me to use in his next film, I can be contacted 24/7 ( I may increase the price a tad - sorry mate ). In future, audiences can then avoid having to sit through endless minutes of fast-cut jerky mayhem where you have no clue what is happening and to whom. It may add to the atmosphere and action in short bursts, as in the first film, but flogging it for too long just makes the viewer nauseous and you lose track of the story. That aside, a pretty good effort all round. Remember mate, tripod £45, no offers. OK?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An instant Horror Classic!,"28 Weeks Later is the very promising and very terrific sequel to 28 Days Later. It starts off strong, and the film never lets go. It has great production values. The direction by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is really amazing. He directs with a fast-paced tone. The cinematography is spectacular, and the film has a sort of futuristic look to it. It has the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The writing is very strong. The characters are very well developed, so we care about them. The performances by everyone in the cast are top notch. The action is riveting, since this film is more of an action film than 28 Days Later. I also thought this was a very thought-provoking film. The way people have to kill each other because there is no other way is a truly deadly thought. It reminded me of the theme of The Mist, another great 2007 horror film. Overall, everything that made 28 Days Later work is present here as well. 28 Weeks Later might even be better than the original. I very much appreciate horror films like this, and am very glad they can still be made. Terrific film-making!",,Anonymous,Horror
"As good as the original, if not better","Although this film isn't too similar to ""28 Days Later...,"" it is a quality piece of movie-making. The editing is insanely fast, the gore is in-your-face, and the action is phenomenal, albeit over-the-top. If you are a fan of zombie flicks or relentless action, check this out now. Be prepared for plenty of gross out moments and blood letting.Also, if you pay close attention and get a little creative, you can find a political subtext to the film, much like the first installment.Yes, the acting is mediocre. Yes, there are plenty of scenes that are illogical or just downright impossible, but that doesn't really matter when zombies are attacking from all directions and people are being devoured and torn limb from limb. This is a must-see for fans of the genre.The lack of character development is a valid criticism, but, frankly, any more of that would have bored me. I appreciated the ""cutting to the chase,"" over and over again...One complaint I had was a couple shoddy CGI shots that were blatantly unrealistic. Other than that, I was thoroughly entertained.

"""28 Weeks Later""  Not Late At All","An intelligent horror film goes a long way in my book and ""28 Weeks Later"" did exactly that. I enjoyed the first one but thought it was only slightly above average. Although the extreme low budget utilized did add to the credibility of the impressive box office underdog that resulted. Usually when money is added to a sequel, havoc is wreaked and the franchise tends to get washed down the tubes. This was not the case here as the second installment proved to be just as intelligent, if not more so. While it was a zombie-type film, it contained everyday concerns that our world faces.Technically those infected aren't zombies, so while it isn't a zombie movie per sethey do possess very similar characteristics to them. The way the virus can be transmitted has properties of HIV, but I don't think there was a social statement there as it was probably more coincidental. On the other hand, references to the war in Iraq were a little more poignant and while I don't think it was a direct blowthe director definitely wanted to point out how us Americans love our guns. Which is true. Chances are the U.S. soldiers here behaved exactly the same as they would in an actual confrontation such as this could it occur. They'd operate under the same short fuse and eagerness to bring out the big guns rather than sincerely try to rebuild a lost civilization.As good as the story was, it wasn't without a fair share of errors. For starters there were huge gaps in the continuity between both movies. Rules that were set in ""28 Days Later"" went ignored in the sequel, and even some new ones were put into effect. Also the editing was so jumpy that any viewer who succumbs to motion sickness should steer clear, as the camera tends to bounce around mercilessly. I thought some of the action sequences were put together too messily as it was very hard to make out what was going on in some of them as well.The acting itself was very appropriate for its genre and there were no extreme over-the-top theatrics that usually make me want to strangle some of the characters myself. My absolute favorite had to be Jeremy Renner though. I've been following him ever since his first underground film and while stardom has managed to elude him for quite some time, I think he is an excellent artist. Idris Elba I also adore ever since I've seen him on ""The Wire"", and he was great here, however his part seemed much too small for a gentleman of his caliber. Imogen Poots was visually stunning and I must say I was rather impressed with Rose Byrne who often tickles me as an annoying character. Robert Carlyle was good as usual in a creepy kind of role that he seems no stranger to. A lot of the audience seemed to pan him early on for a life changing decision he makes that is easy to find fault in. However in a survival viewpoint, he really did the right thing given the sure doom layout that was set before him and due to the fact that he only had a split second to determine what to do.Now that the year is almost at the halfway mark, I must admit that I've been very impressed with what has been laid out so far. The cinema was getting so bad that I agreed with all the people that stopped going because of how outrageous the prices were getting. The costs have grown even worse in the meantime but they are almost worth it again and I wouldn't doubt it if the cycle reverses soon. ""28 Weeks Later"" is the best horror film I've seen in 2007 and I can't imagine what it'd take to beat it. This was an intellectual gore fest that combined great writing, excellent acting, and a break from formulaic slashers. I highly recommend this to just about anyone that can handle the jumps it dishes out and am willing to bet a third chapter will be on the way. Hopefully they can think of a better title than ""28 Months Later"" by then!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent sequel.,"Continuing the events first portrayed in ""28 Days Later"", this sequel details what happens when the infected have been dealt with, and London is starting to return to normal. The US Army comes in to supervise the operation, but is unprepared for a development that starts the whole bloody mess right up again. One of the refugees, Don (Robert Carlyle), wasn't honest with his children Tammy and Andy (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton) about what happened to their mother, and that is going to come back to haunt him.Juan Carlos Fresnadillo takes over the directing chores from Danny Boyle, doing a serviceable job of administering action, atmosphere, and suspense. The screenplay isn't always very believable, but the actors are superb and the pacing speedier than that of the preceding film. Still, Fresnadillo won't avoid some of the more annoying clichés of the modern horror film, such as the frenetic and choppy editing. There may also be way too much digital gore for some horror fans.The top notch international cast is fun to watch: Rose Byrne as concerned medic Scarlet, Jeremy Renner as sympathetic sniper Doyle, Harold Perrineau as the helicopter pilot Flynn, Catherine McCormack as Dons' wife Alice, and Idris Elba as efficient Army officer Stone. In the films' second half, when Scarlet and Doyle become determined to see Tammy and Andy to safety, Byrne and Renner do particularly good work.One of the most impressive elements about this film is the stunning aerial photography, giving us a Gods'-eye view of a devastated London. Special effects are generally good, especially in the horrific scenes of the city being firebombed.""28 Weeks Later"" looks to be a divisive film, with people usually either liking it or loathing it. At least it does manage to maintain an appropriate level of intensity.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Welcome to London...,"Compared to the 2002 movie ""28 Days Later"", then the 2007 sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" is actually a notch better. Which in itself is a good achievement for a sequel.And in my opinion it is the storyline told in ""28 Weeks Later"" which just nudges the sequel ahead of the first movie. It is every bit as fast paced and action packed, but the difference is that ""28 Weeks Later"" have a more detailed character gallery in it, which adds a whole deeper level to the movie.Similar to the storyline as in ""28 Days Later"", the story told in ""28 Weeks Later"" is set in Britain after having suffered through a debilitating outbreak of a deadly rage. With the American army coming to the rescue (medling as always, eh?) things seem to might be brightening up. However, things have a nasty way of not turning out as intended and all Hell breaks loose.The characters in ""28 Weeks Later"" are more detailed and given much more personalities and background compared to the character gallery in the predecessor movie. And the talents cast for the various roles and characters in ""28 Weeks Later"" also really added to the end result of the movie. They had some pretty good talents on the cast list, and I was especially impressed with Robert Carlyle.The storyline is helped along quite nicely at the hand of director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who skillfully carried on the torch from the 2002 predecessor movie. And the effects in ""28 Weeks Later"" were as good as they were in the first movie, a thing that is essential in zombie / outbreak movies.If you enjoyed ""28 Days Later"", then you definitely have to, without a doubt, sit down and watch the sequel ""28 Weeks Later"", because it is every bit as thrilling, captivating and manages to actually be a notch better. This is, by all means, a worthy addition to the collection of any zombie aficionado.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great film but disturbing,"In my opinion a lot more disturbing than the fist film.

28 Weeks Later - One Hell of a Ride!,"28 Weeks Later is one hell of a ride. This film not only manages to top the first movie but propels it into one of the best horror/drama sequels yet to come out. The sets are amazing and alive, the characters kept me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen to them next, and the plot is excellent. Much more depth then the first. You think its going to be another over the top action/horror flick when the military shows up but all that changes. You may ask why I gave it a ten? I like to dissect movies and try to get a sense of some real life to them and 28 weeks later has just that.. It makes you feel sympathetic to the characters and you feel as if your a survivor following them through London's desolate streets.When you go to see this keep it mind its in a league of its own. If your expecting a zombie flick and review it off other zombies movies you've seen, then this isn't for you. As for the cast each actor/actress does an excellent job and Robert Carlyle's character is just plain engrossing to watch. I see why now he was cast in 28 weeks later since in the movie Ravenous he played a crazy cannibal..perfect fit for this role. The end also sets it up for a sequel for an already great series. Definitely looking forward to this trilogy conclusion.If your a fan of drama, horror, post-disaster movies or just a fan of the first, I highly recommend seeing 28 Weeks Later. Worth the admission price.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something that Resident Evil failed to do.,"As I walked to the theater, the impression of such films were extremely underestimated from my side. But, without a doubt, I can guarantee you, it is a film worth watching. From my various disappointments of the RE series (which I will always have great nostalgia for what the video games offered), this film was able to capture the theme of survival, sacrifice and a sense of loneliness within a city in crisis. Yes, the plot could be considered highly hypothetical, but, under its context, it is represented and approached as a realistic possibility. The cinematography was quite good, giving the audience the impression of a REAL city, gone through a vast sacrifice that ultimately lead to a place filled with emptiness and silence. Overall, it is a film that many will enjoy. I don't want to spoil anything, so just take this as a recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"28 Weeks Later takes everything that made the first work and expands the scale, intensity, and scares, making a sequel that honors and improves the first.","Much more action-packed than its predecessor, 28 Weeks Later showcases the terror and speed of the Rage Virus overtaking an entire city. The panic and horror seize your heart as experienced and capable characters struggle to survive this unstoppable and overwhelming contagion. The scene where snipers try to pick zombies out of a frenzied crowd is gripping, fully displaying the hopelessness of surviving the raging hordes and their spread. 28 Weeks Later takes the anxiety and intensity of 28 Days Later and expands it from a small isolated story into a global pandemic taking over an entire city.

A Jaw dropping and Applaudable Sequel!,"Usually they Ruin the sequel for every movie, and especially when it comes to zombie flicks, directors and producers have tried a millions of times to re-make a classic but all have failed miserably except for Dawn of the Dead (2004). When I saw the first part ""28 days Later"" I was really impressed, but when I heard that a sequel is coming up I got really disappointed as I had lost hope on sequels, but just 10 minutes into watching it I got hooked even more then the first one. Concept was brilliant, cast was great, direction was applaudable. The first part didn't focus much on the spread of the virus, it was more about the survivors instead of the zombies and kind of lost it's charisma towards the end, but this part both were balanced which is why we got to see so much more of the ""rage"" and the ending was much better.

A good (not great) sequel,"There are distressingly few zombie movies with moderate to large budgets that aim to provide spectacle as well as horror. 28 Weeks Later might be the best attempt at an action/zombie film we've had yet, though I still think the budget could only be described as moderate at best (and maybe it looks like that only in comparison to the gritty and low-budget 28 Days Later).We've had World War Z, which had some entertainment value but was kind of disappointing. I think Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead was a decent effort at a zombie action (plus heist) movie, but it was uneven and had some big flaws.Look, if this was written a bit better, I think 28 Weeks Later would be up there with 28 Days Later. It has some great set pieces and contains a good deal of entertaining action sequences. They're just not strung together seamlessly, there are a few too many coincidences and things overlooked, and just one or two too many baffling things ignored by people who should've known better (that ""containment stage"" of the lockdown plan? Please!)Still, I'm a sucker for a zombie character who either appears a little more kind or a little more evil than your average member of the walking dead, and this movie's got a great example of the latter (Romero's Day of the Dead probably has the best example of the former)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wow!  This Is A Good Sequel,"Wow! That was my reaction after I saw this film. You know, there aren't too many good horror sequels out there. In fact, most of them are just absolutely worthless. But this movie is really something. This is hands-down one of the best horror sequels I have ever seen.I was skeptical at first when I found out Danny Boyle was not directing this, but new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo adds a lot of the same atmosphere from ""28 Days Later"" and blends it into his own chilling style which was very effective. The story focuses around the aftermath of the deadly virus known as ""The Rage"" virus as most of the infected human beings begin to die off from starvation. Weeks later, the American army takes control of England to help rebuild the city and bring back the populace to start a new life for everyone. But there is only one problem; something is still out there and the horror is unleashed once again.The movie itself is full of pulse-pounding terror lurking around every corner. There are plenty to scenes that will make you jump and just simply horrify you. I was also glad that Robert Carlyle (Don) was in this film. I have considered him a talented actor and I'm a fan of some of his previous films like ""The Beach"", ""The World is Not Enough"", and ""Ravenous"". Also Jeremy Renner was another character I enjoyed very much, remembering him from films like ""North Country"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James."" The overall acting was good and everyone was very convincing. However, the ending, the very ending, was perfect. You would never expect it then all of a sudden BAM! It was the perfect ending to a horror movie such as this one. So attention all horror fans, check out this awesome sequel that will have you begging for more.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 Nervous Breakdowns Later,"This is the Sequel to the successful thriller 28 Days Later. As can quite easily be discerned from the title, 28 Weeks Later is set for the most part 28 weeks after the Breakout. For those such as myself who didn't see the first movie, a clear, blindingly obvious outline of the situation is not made. However, based on information picked up as the movie progresses one can work out what is going on.The basic plot outline seems very similar to that of Outbreak (Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman & Kevin Spacey) where a variation of the Ebola Virus created by the US government gets loose and infects the population at large. NATO moves in and quarantines the area. One member of the army uses their wit and influence in an attempt to A) Prevent the Militaries heavy handed actions. B) Preserve the only hope of vaccination. Of course it is not just Outbreak that this movie is reminiscent of; consider the situation in Iraq as you watch this and you will agree there is an obvious parallel.The Virus, known as RAGE, causes adrenaline induced frenzy. The Infected become blood spewing maniacs whose mission is to kill or infect those who have managed to avoid death or infection. The Infected in this movie are formidable due to having vastly increased amounts of adrenaline. This means that they are Faster and stronger than a traditional Zombie and resemble those from the 2004 Dawn of the dead rather than from the 1978 original film. They may be significantly stronger but they are also easier to kill (being of the living and not the 'undead') and can require as little as a crowbar to the face.The action is fairly exciting and if jump eight feet in the air out of fright is your thing then this is for you. There is of course the small issue of the ""Acting"" which consists almost entirely of Robert Carlyle crying (during which scenes he also seems to be smiling) and hordes of mad running, screaming loonies. The point I'm getting at is that Carlyle is the only decent actor, everyone else is either wooden or have a very easy acting part (mad infected loonies).Don't see this movie if you a squeamish or scare easily. I used to be fairly afraid of Zombie, but now I am not because that feeling is dwarfed by feeling towards The Infected (which is best described as blind terror). The results of the movie are as follows 1) I have vowed off sleep for the rest of my natural (or unnatural) life. 2) I predict the sale of tinned food, emergency bunkers and firearms will increase noticeably. Basically a good horror/thriller and will probably be best enjoyed by those encapsulated by the first film. All in all I give 28 Weeks Later 6 Infected Loonies out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first one,"I liked this movie better than the first one (which I rated with 6 stars = regular) because this is a much mature and intelligent film, on the other hand ""28 days later (2002)"" look like more the kind of film focused mainly for teenagers.I liked mostly the two adults leading characters, the beautiful medical officer Major Scarlet Ross and the cool sergeant Doyle. The teenagers actors are good too and actor Robert Carlyle is really good as their father Don. The plot is interesting and entertaining, the action and suspense scenes are great. What I liked most about it is that it doesn't end as one would think it could end once one has already met all the main characters.People are coming back to London for re-population after 28 weeks, once all the people infected of the Rage virus have starved to death in Britain. London is under control and protection of the US army, but one day the epidemic will appear again and the USA army will declare ""code red"" ......I recommend this movie to everyone who likes terror or zombies movies .7 stars = good",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Excellent Zombie Film,"Although a sequel to ""28 Days Later"", this film is as good as the original and can stand on its own merits. And that says a lot. Now I fully understand that technically this isn't a zombie movie. The dead aren't brought back to life and they don't feast on the organs of their victims. At least not that I am aware of. Likewise there are some controversial aspects which some zombie films depict while others do not. For example, the speed of the ""zombies"" are incredibly fast. And it definitely adds some good action to this film. Now, while some people might argue over technicalities of this nature, to me the zombie genre shouldn't be exclusive to new ideas or formats. After all, one of the chief complaints about zombie films is that everything has already been done and that there is no variety. So in that regard I consider this to be not only an excellent film but an excellent zombie film as well. It has good acting, well-developed characters, tremendous action and a very good plot. About the only flaw I saw was during the poison gas episode in which everyone in the car should have been killed. Everyone. That's just the nature of poison gas. But it made for a good action sequence so I won't complain too much. Also, the ending could have been drawn out a bit more. Even so, I thought this was a good zombie movie and I believe most zombie fans will probably agree.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the few sequels that steps up...,"First off, I've read by critics that the shaky camera makes the movie suck and I have to say that sometimes it doesn't work but other times it's excellently made. The theme ran through most of the movie which gave it a fulfilling feel boldly stating that ""I am a sequel worth seeing because the studio didn't butcher me for a buck."" The direction overall was stylish and the acting was impressive from first time performers as well as a couple unknowns. The plot may seem silly at times as well as the dialogue, but it's surely better and more serious than most of the ""zombie genre."" I found it amazing that when the screen had no sound, not a person in the audience could be heard laughing, talking, or even grabbing popcorn. Only one thing could have been better: the character development. By the time the movie is over I wanted to know more about them. Other than that... thank you Fox, Fresnadillo, Danny Boyle, and all those that made this movie my favorite movie so far this year.P.S. I hope the rage virus comes to New York and peels Spiderman off the wall because of his laughably bad 3rd movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the better Horror Sequels out there!,"28 Weeks Later is a solid follow up to the both critically acclaimed and popular, 28 Days Later. I have to admit that I'm not very fond of the zombie genre, having felt I've seen just about everything they have to offer to the point where it's all quite similar in a sense, but 28 Weeks Later thankfully had a few surprises. The sad part is the movie gets progressively worse as the minutes roll by, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie.The opening scene is great, a nice, calm setting is turned upside down on a moments notice by the most ferocious and aggressive zombies ever shown on film. Of course this can't be stated enough, the zombies in this series are by far the worst kind you could go up against; insanely fast, smart, and driven not by hunger, but by pure rage. This is probably the most appealing aspect of the series, even in small numbers they are a force to be reckoned with! But once you get past the great opening and set up, you are left with another run of the mill zombie survival movie where the characters are just traveling the apocalyptic roads with no real end in sight. It then concludes in a near pitch black tunnel, which makes no sense to me why they would choose to have the climax shot like that, nothing but disappointment there.But when comparing the two movies in the series, it's obvious the original film is the better of the two, it's well written and dark, aided by its political and social commentary. 28 Weeks Later on the other hand is more of your average, action heavy, gruesome killing sequel with a higher kill count and larger budget.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Matches the original's intensity, scale and high concept execution","When a zombie film gets a sequel, the assumption is that the producers are looking for ways to make more guts, gore and money. But ""28 Weeks Later"" is just as sharp as its predecessor in nearly every way, primarily in continuing the sci-fi post-apocalyptic elements that have clearly been thought out and made believable as they were with ""28 Days Later.""""Days"" director Danny Boyle stays on in co-executive producer capacity for ""Weeks"" and it shows. He finds Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct, who demonstrates a thorough understanding of Boyle's vision for the abandoned, infected England all the way down to camera technique.Although Boyle has no credits for the story, it's hard to imagine he wasn't the primary consultant. ""28 Weeks"" brings us back to London the titular amount of time later, when one area of the city has been quarantined to start the re-population of the country (under the command of the U.S military -- what a scary thought for Brits that must be ... ). Smartly, the story focuses on one family reunited as the children were abroad during the breakout and the father (Robert Carlyle) managed to survive.But despite the rebuilding process, little is sunny about ""28 Weeks Later."" It's still more zombie flick than anything else. When the kids' mother is found, she turns out to be a carrier of the infection without it taking over her body. However, it manages to spread and all descends into utter chaos when the military calls Code Red. The film's snowball effect of suspense and violence simultaneously acts as both its best and worst attribute. It's highly entertaining yet absolutely crazy.Using the microcosm of the reunited family (which doesn't stay reunited for long) helps ground the film. All post-apocalyptic action films that do well stay focused on the characters and ""28 Weeks"" gets off to an excellent start in terms of both character development and intensity. Even when the focus goes away from the parents and to Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne's characters who try and help the kids to escape the area, you grow to like their character easily because they keep things sane in the midst of panic and a restless script.Fresnadillo carries an entire arsenal of techniques with him and deploys them all in the hour and a half runtime. Some of the scenes jump around too much and are too dark to make any sense of what's going on, but some are scarily effective. One scene in the subway is entirely done in nightshot and borrows on ""found footage""-style horror techniques while a key infection sequence is a wrenching game-changer.Zombie fans will be pleased with the follow up to the film that re-launched the zombie genre for the 21st Century and won't find any brains (as in intelligence), scale or character sacrificed as a result. ""Weeks"" carries the promise of a franchise that could rival George A. Romero's zombie empire.~Steven CVisit my site http://movimeusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good,"So let me get this straight: Six months after the rage virus was inflicted on the population of Great Britain, the US Army helps to secure a small area of London for the survivors to repopulate and start again. But not everything goes to plan. Okay, got it. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the two main characters. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. A true gem. A gritty, hard movie about gritty, hard people, but it's also intelligent. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant.

It could have been a great film!!!  Pity it wasn't,"In this sequel, new director Juan Carlos Frescadillo focuses on the reconstruction of London after the infection of Virus Rage is apparently gone. To ensure this purpose, the US Army takes full control of the situation. Hence, the repopulating London's Isle of Dogs appears to be an easy task.The place seems perfectly safe and secured. All the infected are presumed dead, so the US Army reasoned, because of prolonged starvation, which they estimate at 5 weeks tops. However, this turns out not to be the case. The mighty, overly confident US Army has overlooked gene mutation. Alice, survivor and mother of two, has heterochromia, a rare genetic trait in the retina that gives her immunity to the Rage Virus. Thus, when she is rescued and brought to Isle of Dogs, it is only a matter of time before all hell breaks loose. Again.Medical officer Scarlet, apparently the only one with brains in the US Army, quickly realizes that Alice may be the key to finding a desperately needed antidote. Her moronic Commader-in-Chief thinks otherwise. ""If you want to perform experiments"", the top military responds to Scarlet, ""do it with her dead body.""After recklessly kissing his recently rescued wife Alice, Don (who had escaped the first infection and has access to most places in Isle of Dogs) gets infected and begins spreading the deadly disease. Soon the ubiquitous zombies start the carnage within the narrow confines of the jealously guarded island.There is more. Don's twelve-year old son Andy is also immune to the disease. Bitten by his own zombie father, Andy remains normal. Too bad, no one except for Dr. Scarlet is paying attention. And since the restricted area is out of control, Red Code is put into effect from above. That means to ""kill/destroy/obliterate"" all the settlers. So the gore reaches its climax too early in the film.The best part is when the military, who can't distinguish normal from infected, start the massacre. I only wish this part had more built-up tension. Also, it would have been great to have this psychologically powerful scene closer to the end.Please, don't get me wrong ----overall, the movie is beautifully shot. It also has great, mesmerizing special effects. Unfortunately for the film, its many characters are one-dimensional, to the point of being cartoon-like. Had more attention been paid to the characters'personalities, their growth as they cope with imminent death, 28 Weeks Later would have been a kick-ass film.Sadly as it is, we only have a B-movie, only worth watching for its extraordinary special effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Easily tops the original.,"The plot of ""28 Weeks Later"" goes like that:survivors start arriving home in 'District One',a safe zone established on the Isle of Dogs in London.Engineer Don,who survived the Rage plague in ways that haunt his sleep meets his kids as they return from Spain,where they'd been fortunate enough to be vacationing when infection broke out;the family reunion is uneasy.Army doctor Scarlet is deeply troubled about what she's seeing in the blood samples in her microscope.American sniper Doyle is uncomfortable with this strange duty babysitting returnees in this desolate city.Soon all the hell breaks loose,when the freshly arrived carrier starts spreading infection in 'District One'...Very bleak,action packed and bloody sequel to apocalyptic hit ""28 Days Later"".The escape through the pitch black tunnels,shot partially through the night vision lens of a sniper rifle compounds the feelings of fear and dread.The use of helicopter blades as a weapon,shot from the pilot's vantage point adds to the desperation.And without a doubt,the sweeping shots of London deserted and desolate are unnerving and eerie.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It started well, but afterwards, I just stopped caring.","Aliens was a good sequel. It had marines. Bad alien screws stuff up, send in the Marines. They're all tough as nails with lots of cool kit, then it all goes to hell. This flick is something like that. London is supposedly Rage virus free and so a US-led NATO force is now on the ground helping with the reconstruction. The first thing I noticed was that there was an armed soldier about every three feet inside the Green Zone. The second thing I noticed was that the NATO force had no representation at all from like, you know, NATO. But whatever, this is a zombie movie right? I mean, they wouldn't make the flick if the zombies didn't come back, right? So right around the time they come back, I suddenly am told how the movie ends, but I won't ruin it for you, if you see it, it'll be pretty obvious. The rest of the movie is then spent trying to overlook the obvious ridiculousness of the American response and obvious lack of preparations. For instance, the zombies are fast and like to jump on people and bite them. So if I was planning a mission involving running zombies that bit, I think I'd want to put my soldiers in a big metal box with wheels. You know, like a tank. Or a personnel carrier that is armoured. I think they're called Armoured Personnel Carriers. Oh yeah, and the plan for containing the safe population from the infected, I think I'd want to avoid putting them all in one dark room with a fire exit that is completely unguarded. Might make for a problem. Oh yeah, and if I was flying around in a helicopter, I might want a guy in the back. You know, like a doorgunner. Oh, and if you're told to bring a kid along with you, that he's like, the saviour of man-kind, but he's also retarded and keeps wandering off without telling anyone and not responding when his own sister screams his name at the top of her lungs even though he's about three feet away? I'd leave the little turd behind. So is the movie worth seeing? Sure, why not, it's production value is good and there are some good shots, but when you're being shocked more from the steady stream of incidents of poor judgement rather than the zombies ripping people apart, you might want to think about renting it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 Weeks Later,"28 Weeks Later is a sequel to the film 28 Days Later and follows the previous film several weeks later (as the title suggests). The film takes place in Britain where the army has helped keep an area of town safe where the survivors can stay and everything seems fine until the virus that infected everyone from the first film is back infecting people and a young brother and sister along with a woman from the army are on the run from the infected and trying to make it to a place where they will be safe, but unfortunately for them the virus is spreading quickly and they don't have long to run and hide from the carriers of the disease. Back in 2003 before I saw 28 Days Later, I found the screenplay at my local bookstore, so I sat down and read it. This also lead to a fellow book enthusiast sitting beside me telling me for some reason that he believes that zombies actually exist, but that is another story. Anyways, I was quite impressed with the screenplay of 28 Days Later, so I saw it in theatres shortly after and was impressed by the film as well. When, I heard that a sequel was being made and the original writer and director were only involved as producers, I wasn't so sure if it would turn out well or not, but after having just seen the film I must conclude that this new director and writer pulled it off, and quite well I may add. The film took a little different approach then the first installment whereas this version has a lot more action and things happening where the first film had a more slow approach and built up the action and suspense as it went along, but this film started with non stop action right within the first ten minutes. This isn't to say that the first film's approach was bad in anyway because it wasn't, it was just kind of nice to see it done in a different kind of style and pace. The non stop action and the very fast editing worked for me and kept me quite entertained and the movie held it's own while remaining stylish and delivering thrills and gore as well. There were also more dramatic scenes in the film and times where there was no action and things were being explained and it got to show what was going on with the city and the characters a little bit, but those scenes were well done and worked as well. The manic energy and pace of this film captured my attention and interest right from the start and with it's stylish direction, good editing and just fast action and happenings I really had a good time with this film. The horror scenes worked well as did the action scenes and from a technical point the film was well made and as a rule any horror fan can tell you that most sequels do not work (and this does not just apply to the horror category either), but this film worked on every level from story to direction to just having a good time and like I mentioned earlier I liked how it had some of the same qualities I liked about the first film, but I also liked how it took some new approaches as well. This is one of the better horror films and sequels of recent years and if done properly I could see how a third installment in the series could work as well, but for now this one is better than okay and for a film of this kind it really is very good.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Annoying,"Lovely scenery, wickedly good soundtrack - but obvious story line that leaks like a sieve. The plot is basically spun on a series of mistakes that are only mildly believable. Mistakes of the institution - bloated, clumsy and unable to adapt coupled with mistakes of the individual - emotionally crippled and rationally impaired. Half the time your thinking ""stupid, stupid, stupid."" ""Can't wait for this one to get it."" Leaving one without even a tingly of remorse for thinking such evil thoughts. This seems more gory and trite than ""28 days later."" At least in ""28 days"" the mistakes are understandable from the characters perspective, and there are some folks you want to survive. This had some suspenseful moments, but relied far too heavily on the crafty camera work and music. One must lull the audience with story, suspension of disbelief is critical to really scaring people versus just annoying people. So - go because we know your going to since ""28 days"" was so bloody awesome, and you best see it on the full large screen. But, don't expect anyone who doesn't love a gore fest or bureaucracy bashing to enjoy it or walk away thinking that was a good experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Raging good fun,"No one does post-apocalyptic films like Britain, and 28 Weeks Later is no exception. The film begins with a group of refugees hidden away in a shack somewhere in the English countryside. The plague outbreak is still running rampant, so they take every precaution possible. Among those shacked up are Robert Carlyle and his wife. Unfortunately, the rage-infected killers find their way to the shack and begin proceeding to bang their way in. Rather than staying to fight, Carlyle leaves his wife and companions and runs away. 28 weeks later, London is declared a ""safe zone"" by a NATO-lead American force, who are now occupying the city. The area of the Isle of Dogs is now a large refuge camp, with heavy military occupation. The outer limits of London are still not ""safe"", although Britain itself has been declared under a system of ""containment"". You don't have to be a genius to work out the parallels between the film and the US-lead occupation of Iraq. The US army have set up a reconstruction policy of ""containment"" where a set of land is considered a ""safe zone"" when it clearly isn't. When all hell breaks lose, it is not just the hoards of rage-infected beasts that are terrorising the refugees.28 Weeks Later is splattertastic stuff. The action is frenetic, the gore is unrelenting and the horror is full on. The real treat of all this is seeing it take place in around the east London docklands. Watching hundreds of bloodthirsty killers raging through canary wharf, the millennium dome and the grain and dirt of those factory-outlet areas, we are treated to a vision of London that is all to often glossed over. It has meat, both subtextually and masochistically. It even has a cameo by the docklands light railway. For some gorrific entertainment, you can't go wrong with 28 Weeks Later.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Home Is Where The HELL Is...,"When approaching sequels, especially in these dark, writers' strike-filled times, I always feel a sense of nausea, fear and intense loathing. And I'm sure I'm not alone in this...especially after some horrendous cinematic turds like the AVP sequel, (the last one, not the most recent) which looked awesome and played like it had been rewritten by that mentally crippled kid on THE SIMPSONS.Well, I got the same feeling with 28 WEEKS LATER, only more so, because Danny Boyle in his wonderfully insidious way, had taken the ""zombie"" genre and stood it on its head, literally, giving us a harrowing, horrifying and downright traumatizing experience not soon to be forgotten. How in the hell is some director you've never heard of with a virtually no-name cast going to hope to equal THAT?Well, as it turned out, director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (ENTACTO) did one hell of a job, putting his own stamp on an ever-deepening, nightmarish glimpse into a man-made Hell that has no foreseeable exits - no happy endings around the corner here! And in his own, sneaky way, working with co-writers Rowan Joffe, Jesus Olmo and Enrique Lopez Lavigne, Fresnadillo trumps Boyle's insidious gambit by adding just a little something extra...presenting this next chapter in the series in the context of a domestic family/survival drama.It is exactly 28 weeks after the mind-numbing events of 28 DAYS. London is a ghost town. The last of the infected victims of the rage virus have finally died, most probably from starvation. And working in tandem with the Brits, here we come, the big, bad Yanks to save the day and help clean up and repopulate the eerily quiet streets with Londoners who are anxious to get back to lives that are as normal as possible, under the circumstances.One of those people is Don (the always-dependable Robert ""RAVENOUS"" Carlyle), who can't wait to be reunited with his kids, daughter Tammy (Imogen Poots) and young son Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), both of whom were going to school abroad in the U.S. when everything across the pond went 'tits up', and who have been living as refugees since before the ""repopulation"" effort began. Their reunion is a happy one, but not without a few dark spots. One of them being that their mother, Alice (Catherine McCormack) is not there with Don, having fallen victim to ""the infected"" during a horrifying attack that opens up the movie.Alas, but there's much more to the tragic story than that, and what it is, I'm not at liberty to say. Just know that the movie's main plot hangs on what this family has been through, and their story is a real knee-slapper...especially since it serves as the catalyst to reopen ""Pandora's box,"" in a manner of speaking. So I'll just shut the hell up now, except to add that the only thing more shocking than the twists this movie takes is the ultra-bleak ending, somewhat hinted at in the first movie.Fresnadillo cannily doesn't try to reinvent the remarkably rancid recipe that Boyle established in DAYS, which is a good thing. Mixing virtually unknown actors with vaguely recognizable faces (like Cillian Murphy and Brendan Gleeson in DAYS, and Carlyle, Harold Perrineau and Idris Elba here) lends the sequel that same spooky air of ""you-are-there"" realism, and he relies more heavily than Boyle did on a very documentary-like look and feel, relying cleverly on several types of visual media that are natural to the story, as well as aiding in driving it forward, (a terrifying sequence in a subway station will stay with you for days.)The acting, as always, is top-notch, and Carlyle shows again why he seems so much more at home in genre movies than in ""veddy, veddy serious"" British dramas or indie comedies, (although he's most well known for THE FULL MONTY.)Technically, what's always made the '28' series a little more disturbing than your average zombie munch-fest is that the monsters in this series are people infected by a virus and not 'really' zombies, which removes that layer of 'fantasy detachment' that comes ready-made with other horror movies. What happens here is a little more feasible and therefore much more unsettling, so you may want to skip this one if you are easily nightmare-prone.It's unfortunate that Fox Atomic has put plans for 28 YEARS LATER on the back burner, based on the recent non-performance of some other major horror releases, (most of which SUCKED armadillo ass to begin with, but I guess the suits in the front office missed THAT memo.)In any case, cuddle up on the couch with your loved one for 28 WEEKS LATER in the meantime, and make sure you keep your carbine loaded and at the ready. You know - just in case...",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not too bad,"Unfortunately for me there was nothing exceptional that really stood out for me, but there were some good moments in this sequel to 28 days later. Most of the action in this film is so hyper and it is just like the director stood right next to it and shook the camera around to make it seem insane. Im very tired of this type of filming. It really ruins movies for me nowadays. The setup dragged on a bit long and truthfully you don't see much of the infected except for a lot of running around. That being said however, there are some very killer moments in the last half that make up for all this.POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe bombing and chemical weapon scenes were very cool. Their was a true intensity not seen in most horror movies today in these parts, and you really were not sure who would live and die. The nightvision gunscope scene was awesome. Very reminiscent of Blair Witch and The Descent, with a very serious tension I haven't felt in a while. And last but not least, the helicopter mutilation. The best death scene in any movie ever, period.END POSSIBLE SPOILERS All in all it is worth the time and money to check this one out in the theater, but if there is a third, I truly hope they get rid of this shaky camera nonsense. I am aware it gives viewers the illusion if being straight in the mess, but i'd rather just be able to tell what was going on. Good flick, check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Ultimate Pre-D-Day film!!!!!,"Seeing this makes me want to watch the first one again or buy them both! What I love about a movie like this is that nothing is saved and nobody is sacred.Also, for a sequel to an originally conceived story, this is excellent.In my opinion, Romero's mistake was (for whatever reason) he waited too long to release 'Land of the Dead' because the slow moving zombie movies are now outdated when compared to the more updated maniacal, running zombie fueled with homicidal rage. This is what made the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake successful to film watchers.The story itself shows me that out of pure desperation for survival, there's no such thing as Sentimentality and within the scope of this story, it makes everything realistic.I say rent this movie (both movies) and then buy them!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Better than the original? No, but it's closer than most people in these reviews are saying.","The acting is phenomenal, ""overacting"" mostly does not exist in movies like this. This is a well budgeted horror film, acting is a part of the deal. Overacting only exists in indie movies and in voice acting. I think everyone does a great job, the kids are much more convincing than the kid from the first one. Even though it has a different feel than the first one, It's still linked together.The beginning scene is fantastic and had a lot of potential. I wish they would've gotten a more developed story arc between Ron and Alice instead of what happened, but what we got is still pretty good. I was clenched up the entire time without even noticing.I will agree that it doesn't have the authenticity, uniqueness and creativity that the first one held, but it still doesn't feel like a cliche zombie movie. I wouldn't even say it was predictable, but certainly not outrageously original.The first movie had such a unique cinematography that really set the movie in stone. This movie does not contain this but I don't think it needed it.Also the music is pretty much the same from the first one but at least it is good.Overall a good watch that certainly gives you chills.Non-Spoiler review done***Spoilers Ahead***-I will admit that I was also skeptical of the idea that London was bringing back citizens, but the more I thought about it the more realistic it seems. 28 weeks is around 7 months. 7 months is easily enough time for the infected to die of starvation. They still took precautions and in the beginning they said that they started rebuilding (I think) after 8 weeks.-I've heard people say that it's weird that the US military let 2 kids roam around the streets. At the time I watched it I thought it was a bit silly, but Doyle literally sees them leaving and calls it in. They do take a bit of time to find them but at least it's reasonable.-I find it really surprising that people in the reviews did not pick up that the boy had the infection and that's how it spread to Paris. I thought it was very obvious. It's not a plot hole, it's called showing and not telling. Movies are supposed to make you infer, they shouldn't be spoon-feeding you information.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Like having your favourite food again and again and .....,"Another day another sequel, in this case a sequel to a brilliant film made by a brilliant director, i seriously questioned why a person like Danny Boyle would fall for the sequel bandwagon, but obviously everything has a price, or better still he really believed in this movie.1 minute into this movie i was both disappointed and relieved, NO DANNY BOYLE Didn't DIRECT THIS FILM, so i knew i would get a lesser product and at the same time i was relieved that at least some person was willing to hold out from the exploitation sequels.The premise of the movie is as old as the mountains, obviously no infection ever stays controlled and there's always more guns, more running, and multiple enemies, not the mention the elusive miracle cure.OBVIOUSLY ORIGINALITY POINTS ARE ZERO.The shots of an abandoned London which blew me away in ""28 days"", didn't quite have the impact here even though there were done on larger scale, THIS MOVIE HAS ALMOST NO NEW IDEAS TO OFFER.But you still cannot take away the cinematic and entertainment value of this movie..The movie starts of tense and never ever lets up, even in moments of supposed calm you know something is going to wrong and you never ever feel in the comfort zone, THIS MOVIE Doesn't HAVE THOSE JUMP AND LAUGH AFTERWARDS SCENE BUT IS PUMPED WITH TENSION AND DESPAIR.A lot of the credit for the feel of this movie should go to the background score, its ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, simple tunes and instruments, are used to create a haunting effect, the music moves with the mood, and enhances every feeling that you feel.ONCE AGAIN A PROJECT INVOLVING DANNY BOYLE HAS FLAWLESS BACKGROUND SCORE.The cinematography is superb, although there have been nothing new to offer but every scene is handled with panache you can feel the fear in the dark, or the expanse of abandoned London, or the haphazard scuffle between inexperienced fighters who are often fighting desperately for their life.HERE TOO EVEN THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE BUT YET OOZED OF QUALITY.The acting too was superb no extra melodrama, IN A MOVIE THAT HAD A LOT OF DRAMA, i normally hate drama and even though i didn't go as far as enjoying the drama in this movie, i was really OK with it, IF ANYTHING THE SLIGHTLY WEAK SCRIPT CAN BE BLAMED FOR THE WEAK SCENES.The 2 girls weren't bad looking either even though there is no semblance of sexuality its nice to see pretty girls instead of ugly ones.Think of your favourite food, have you ever had a time when you've had it again and again and again and even though your FAR FROM FED UP WITH IT YOU FEEL IT TASTES A LITTLE LESS BETTER Every time???...Well i love zombie flicks, i love the blood,the guns, the explosions, the tensions, AND YOU CAN NEVER NOT LIKE A FLAWLESS BACKGROUND SCORE LIKE THIS, but somehow after seeing so many zombie movies with variations of the same old stuff, the pleasure is decreasing.Yet hats off to the director and his team for doing such a fine job despite the lack of originality in the script and plot.Fans and first time watchers of the genre will definitely enjoy it, but be warned its much more of a tense thriller than it is a action flick unlike most zombie flicks.-s NOTHING NEW OR ORIGINAL,slightly weak script,PLOT HOLES.+/-s too much of the same good thing????..+s FLAWLESS BACKGROUND SCORE, very good acting, lots of tension, some decent special effects, SUPERB CINEMATOGRAPHY.total 7/10 (just too original to merit anything more, will not make tedious comparisons to the original but my favourite food syndrome was definitely at play here,do watch with correct expectations.)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 Weeks later,"This is a realistic and scary movie. It seems real, that the zombies will affect other areas other than UK. That is scary! The point the director used, nobody can stop those nuts flesh-eating zombies, no matter, they use fire or whatever they can think of. Those zombies will still run after them. By any case, it is not one of the zombies' movies, it is slightly touching, and it is not those bloody zombies eating people, there is a meaning to what the director had directed. It is short but it shows a lot blood squirting, explaining things and big action, thrilling chase scenes. It is slightly a bit too dark to see, I know the director's intention- to make the place dark and makes zombies suddenly attack people, the shock factor. I hate it when he(the director) used tactics like keeping up with flashy scenes, that makes me go dizzy and I thought they blind my eyes.You want great bloody zombies movies. You will not be disappointed with the gore, often zombies come attacking people, munching on them, you get to see a lot of blood squirting. You want realistic zombie movies, here is one.

Just don't expect another masterpiece",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Effective and disturbing horror sequel,"Five years ago 28 Days Later revitalised the zombie genre. The gap between that film and this should be enough to convince that this is no cheap rushed cash-in sequel. However, with writer Alex Garland, director Danny Boyle and star Cillian Murphy all off making the superb Sunshine, 28 Weeks Later comes from an entirely different team. Fortunately, Garland and Boyle as executive producers have seen fit to hire a director who can bring his own interesting vision to the project, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose debut film Intacto was a stylish and unusual thriller.While it has always been made very clear to us that the Infected are not zombies in the conventional sense, it is hard to view this film and its predecessor outside the zombie genre, especially as, wittingly or otherwise, 28 Weeks Later features aspects of some earlier zombie classics. The clashing ideologies of a medical (find a cure for it) or military (wipe them all out) solution is not only a development of the final third of the first film, but also of Romero's excellent Day of the Dead. Meanwhile the end of the film seems to be a Euro version of the final moments of Lucio Fulci's Zombie Flesh Eaters, after all you can only do zombies and London landmarks for so long.Indeed, the opening prologue, set during the time of the first infection, is like a Night of the Living Dead influenced zombie picture in miniature, a disparate group of survivors holed up in a remote, rural house with the Infected outside. It also happens to be the finest opening sequence in any horror film you're likely to see any time soon. It starts admirably restrained, starting with just the central couple, Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack, looking for food in the dark house, before revealing that there are others with them, and beginning to show the tensions in the group, tantalisingly setting up relationships that the movie doesn't have time to explore as their peace is quickly shattered by a banging on the door and soon the peace is completely shattered by a chaotic moment in which Carlyle makes the selfish choice to preserve his own life at all costs.Unfortunately, although for the most part the film retains this breakneck pace, it doesn't always maintain this quality. That is not to say that there isn't plenty of interesting things going on here, just that for all Fresnadillo's efforts, the characters are not well enough drawn to be those we care about. In the first film, we viewed the world through the eyes of Murphy's Jim and shared his confusion and fear at the deserted London and the sudden arrival of the Infected, here there is no such audience substitute. For the most part, however, the film is packed with enough great moments to save it from these poorly developed characters.Although it takes a little while to get going after the skip forward 28 weeks, when Britain, or rather the Isle of Dogs, is being repopulated, Fresnadillo and his co-writers' idea for how the infection returns and begins to spread again is an interesting one that raises some new ideas. Some of his ideas and techniques work very well were others do not so much. The fast running infected shot with shaky hand held cameras become a little annoying as it proves hard to keep track of what is happening and they do not have the unsettling quality of the old slow moving zombies, meanwhile his decision to view scenes through the eyes of an Infected character and to give one of the Infected this extra depth and ability seems ill suited to the genre where the menace comes from the facelessly identical evil of the whole group.Never the less, other moments are brilliantly effective. As an outsider and a foreigner, Fresnadillo brings a new eye to the first film's disturbing moments of deserted London streets and landmarks and, in setting the whole film in the capital this time, is able to cover more sides to the city, all of them chilling, abandoned and damaged environments. The presence of the US military provides a further interesting threat as well as a very effective if unsubtle critique of the current global situation reminiscent of Romero at his best. One superb sequence features the American snipers unable to deal with the panic caused as the Infected maraud among the civilians desperate to escape. They are given the order to simply shoot down everybody down there. It is a brilliantly realised moment of convincing confusion, panic and desperation.Fresnadillo also provides two absolute standout horror movie sequences that will be well remembered for a long time by those who see this movie. The first is the already infamous helicopter sequence, a brilliantly gory moment in which a slightly out of control helicopter decapitates and slices limbs off a whole crowd of Infected resulting in a massive pool of blood and severed body parts. The second is more atmospheric, set in a dark tube station, Rose Byrne's Scarlet guides the two children down the dark staircase, helping them to avoid the corpses on the ground with the night vision on her rifle's sight.The end is rather abrupt and involves a brand new London landmark that surely does not fit with the chronology of the series. Despite this fact, and the lack of characters you care for, 28 Weeks Later is an effective little horror of many fine moments and a worthy sequel to the earlier film. ****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

28 Weeks Later is one of the best sequels ever!,"I loved 28 Days Later, and I still watch it now at times. Its one of my favourite movies of all time. So when I heard about a sequel, I couldn't wait. You are hooked in the first 5 - 10 minutes, as it features an amazingly tense chase. Although its a bit different to the first, I still had a blast in the cinema. I saw this last night and I was amazed at what I saw. The special effects are great, the acting is really good (especially Robert Carlyle), emotional at times, has lots and LOTS of blood and infected and explosions (the streets of London get napalmed!)and there are more deserted shots of London.I cant really say about the story because it would give away some little scares and plot twists. But the opening scene is one of the best openings to a movie I think (the chase). The ending is really nicely done as well, and without spoiling anything it involves France, Paris.Overall it has a different feel to the first film, but maybe thats what makes it great as a sequel.

Frenetic and Entertaining Horror Sequel.,"This film is insane! Ditching the desolation, characterisation and sustained bleakness of the original, this worthy sequel is an adrenaline soaked thrill-ride that is dizzyingly shot and graphically nasty. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's visuals are stunning and the frenetic digital camera-work adds to the sense of paranoia and panic. The camera is always moving, using everything from extreme close-up to POV as sudden bursts of rage-induced violence burst onto the frame enhancing the need to escape. Like the original, the fear stems from a viral pandemic that takes over and this primordial fear is shown in all its glory, shunning any signs of characterisation and plot reasoning to instead deliver edge-of-your seat shocks, brutal action and unsubtle scenes of gore to great effect while seemingly taking a socially-conscious dig at the incompetence of the American military and contemporary security meltdown.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

When she infects Don with the virus, turning him into a zombie, his kids are left to make their own way to safety, aided by a humanistic American soldier named Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and Sally (Amanda Walker) a doctor who wants to protect Tammy above all else, believing she may hold the cure to the virus.I must admit this sequel to the very enjoyable 2002 Brit chiller 28 Days Later caught me somewhat by surprise, as I had no idea of it being in production or even having been made until a few weeks before it came out. Nevertheless, making a sequel to that great homegrown film has been a surprisingly inspired idea, a film that manages to be just as tense and atmospheric as the original, getting right on a par with it in fact. The over-view of a deserted London is as eerie and unsettling as last time round, with a neat sense of claustrophobia creepily taking over the hustle and bustle usually associated with that city. Only this time round, there's more as an emphasis on the action element as well, a la Aliens, with the gung ho Americans being drafted in to restore order to the decaying city with their tough talk and big guns. Nevertheless, we have a likable character in Doyle, a man of reason and compassion when all his colleagues are pushing their military might around. There's a nice, believable edge to all the characters in fact, from the selfish and cowardly father, to the two kids who become orphans realizing they're all they have together now and so sticking together through thick and thin.With Danny Boyle and a lot of the original production team tied up with the year's earlier Brit mega flick Sunshine, Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has taken over here. Although he retains a lot of Boyle's original vision, his camera use during the zombie attacks is a little too shaky and close-up, which is a bit of a hindrance. But what a minor complaint with a film that does what I was convinced it would not do, live right up to the standards of the original and, while not improving on it in any way, matching it's quality right up to a tee. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The guts and the ingloriousness,"Danny Boyle directed 28 Days Later, and he exec-produced this sequel as part of his burgeoning partnership with Alex Garland. Directing duties fell to Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, creator of 2001's ingenious Intacto. He stamps his authority on the picture with a startling opening sequence: a dizzying attack on a country farmhouse, which not only violently reminds us that these are far from George Romero's shambling knuckle-draggers, but also that anyone – man or woman, young or old – is fair game. It sets the tone. It sets the rules.Next we're thrown into a grimy, semi-deserted London (reminiscent of another Spanish-speaking director's apocalyptic vision, Children of Men). It's here that Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) arrive to meet their father, Don (Robert Carlyle). But something is rotten as a corpse within the family unit, and the kids take it upon themselves to sneak out of the militarised zone to put a full-stop on their unfinished childhood. What they discover unleashes hell, and it's up to the US occupying forces, led by a stolid Idris Elba, to quash the infected insurgency.The film's early sequences contain some creepy, classical horror imagery, usually concerning Catherine McCormack's stricken Alice, before the film gives way to a series of expansive, logic-be-damned action set-pieces. As a marriage of styles it's not quite as broken as Alice and Don's, but it makes the film feel lopsided.While The Walking Dead proves that the zombie holocaust genre hasn't really the flesh to fill a whole series, an extra 20 minutes wouldn't have gone amiss from 28 Weeks, just to add a little meat to the bony characters – particularly Jeremy Renner's pragmatic Doyle, who seems to be riding on a kind of Hurt Locker zephyr, but with hints of a heart. Rose Byrne, likewise, as Scarlet, can only show a glimmer of the utilitarian behind the perma-frown.There's no profundity on offer here, just basic moral dilemmas as fleeting as a moving target in a gun sight. At a push there's a veiled allegory about post-war Britain's reliance on the US; and moreover, particularly in one barmy sniper sequence, a crack at repeated ""friendly fire"" debacles in the theatres of madness mired in the Middle East. But it's really about the visceral thrills. Like its predecessor, budget restraints are a blessing not a curse, forcing imaginative film-craft and rabid performances into the space that, one fears, CGI excess will occupy when the infection extends to 28 Months.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good stuff...,"I'm a huge fan of zombie flicks and from the very beginning this movie delivers. There is tension through the entire film and the story line was put together smoothly. In the downtime the movie was still suspenseful. I actually thought this was better than the first film '28 Days Later'. Unlike it predecessor, this film starts out with pure zombie action and finishes with pure zombie action. The last film, although providing a fine storyline, was very boring at times, this film will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good zombie-blood-gore film. For those with a weak stomach, you'll know this isn't for you in the first 5 minutes of the film. For those who dig the idea of zombies taking over the planet and the human race fighting against it, this is that movie to see.",,Anonymous,Horror
Much better than the original,"Some really bogus reviews on this film. It's not great by any means, but it isn't boring and is thought provoking. Sure there are some leaps of faith needed to accept the plot, but not too outrageous. It certainly is better than the original in every way.

Could have been a contender,"I watched the two ""28s"", original and sequel, back to back in one go. I enjoyed them both, but I realized something I hadn't quite figured out when I first watched this movie in cinema theaters: this second one doesn't scare me half as much as the original. There was something unique in the first movie that made it so incredibly compelling even when nothing was happening and zombies were at rest. Here, except for the incredibly well shot beginning sequence, there's an overload of violence that is predominantly graphic but not quite able to hit you viscerally as the first one did. Even Robert Carlyle, usually an excellent actor, is unconvincing where Cillian Murphy was so effective in his portrait of the survivor. Too many special effects, too many unresolved characters on the side we are never quite sure whether we should get attached to or not, like the soldier. In the original, even characters who got terminated halfway like Brendan Gleeson's Frank became full functional to the story and its emotional angles. Overall, it would have been more interesting to follow up on Jim's predicament in the first one than tell the tale of a rather unbelievable repopulating program at such short distance from the outbreak. could have been a contender...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The meanings,"The main interesting aspects of the film are social, sociological and psychological. It creates (with a good degree of realism) situation where the whole of British society is divided and how it might behave in such a situation. A set of moral and ethical issues is being raised where the army is dealing with contaminated groups of people. The way in which the film raises those issues is very interesting and differs from other movie. (althoutgth some similarity in that respect can be drawn with the film ""Independance Day"").Psychologically the film also manages to expose dilemmas and ethical survival choices and decisions. It shows that as other animals, humans act on self preservation instincts, but unlike animals humans are also capable of self-sacrifice; heroism for a greater good.Visually the film is valuable as it acted out and staged directly in the environment that we live in and use every day, In fact - London is the main hero of the film. (especially in 28 Days Later) There are many shots of London as we do not normally see it - Panoramic shots, but also details that we all recognise such as tube signs and buses, that majorly helps to recreate the atmosphere of a mysterious catastrophe. As each londoner inevitably ""tries on"" the outlook of the film characters and their impression on seeing our habitat like that.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun though flawed sequel schlock,"28 Days Later was, passé final block aside a near ace slice of post apocalypse horror and something of a sleeper hit, leading inevitably to a sequel. Fortunately for those of us who value some level of artistic integrity, 28 Weeks Later is pretty solid stuff and nicely ballsy, albeit to flawed to really rock out or make much more than a superficial impression. It differentiates itself from the original tale by being one of destruction rather than aftermath, in this one we have a state of order and its spectacular disruption, the horror unfolding in front of us. Regrettably it also differentiates itself with absurd contrivance, the two events unleashing horror both utterly unbelievable in the realistic context in which the film sets itself. It's all the more galling because the opening sequence gives us a bleakly realistic depiction of human frailty, total contrast to the painfully irksome generic screw ups to come. The final moments fall prey to the same problem, though I kinda give them a pass on amusement value. The biggest problem aside from this is comes in the camera work which is in a few key moments of the shaky variety. This kind of fast camera, fast cutting work only tends to be effective when used by directors with a smart feeling for the kinetic and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, though undoubtedly talented (watch Intacto kids), doesn't really have this. He is much better at more traditional means of depicting carnage though, giving us lots of nicely shot shootings and a simply magical scene of helicopter violence that had me near cheering. A decent amount of bloodshed here and it gives the film most of its kick. The rest is provided by its mirror of mass carnage to personal trauma, it is a film given to kicking happy go lucky cliché in the teeth and all the better for it, moreover it does so in a fashion that feels organic and not just a cheesy means of the writers showing off some edge. Acting is reasonable throughout, Robert Carlyle is the standout as a devoted dad, but the lovely Rose Byrne does a decent tough but tender job and Jeremy Renner gives a likable show as a good hearted soldier. There are a couple of kids key to the affair though and neither are up to much, they aren't terrible but I can comfortably say that I wanted both to die in gruesome fashion for their role in the whole debacle, but mostly to give the adults more screen mileage. Lets face it, most child actors are horrendously unsympathetic compared to their adult counterparts and almost always less talented and this is the case here. Everything bowls along pretty nicely though, nothing made me want to eat my laptop in irritation so this one gets a OK score for the good stuff, high 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Frenetic, tragic and terrifying: a near-perfect horror sequel","Horror sequels are almost by definition a cheap excuse to cash in on the originals. There are exceptions, like Wes Craven's meta-horror New Nightmare or George Romero's zombie saga, but they're a rarity. Thankfully, 28 Weeks Later, the follow-up few people expected to be made, retains its predecessor's sense of fear and desperation while adding its own dramatic elements, resulting in a film that fares a lot better next to other horror continuations of 2007 such as Hostel: Part II or Saw IV.Stepping back as a director (he was busy doing Sunshine) but remaining on board as an executive producer with original writer Alex Garland, Danny Boyle found it wise to hand over 28 Weeks Later to Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose feature debut Intacto was deemed good enough to trust him to do his own thing and not just another sequel. And that's exactly what he does: whereas 28 Days Later was merely about survival (with a hint of Romero-like satire of the military's excessive power), the new installment has a stronger central theme - family. In fact, the scarily intense prologue (the film's best scene, and one of the most effective opening sequences of all time), set within the time frame of the first movie, shows how the Infected, still as merciless as ever, rip apart entire families, leaving Don (Robert Carlyle), one of the few survivors, desperate over the loss of his wife Alice.28 weeks (seven moths) pass, and with the help of the US Army the Rgae virus has been completely wiped out. Britain is no longer quarantined, so Don can be reunited with his children. While they explore their new home, an American scientist (Rose Byrne) tries to determine whether there's any chance the virus might return, a possibility her military superior (Idris Elba) writes off as unlikely. Then all of a sudden Alice, seemingly immune to the disease, returns to everyone's surprise. An even worse surprise, though, is the fact that her not being infected doesn't mean she can't infect someone else. And so, before anyone can fully realize what's happened, London is once again under attack by the Infected, leaving it to Scarlet (Byrne) and a soldier named Doyle (Jeremy Renner) to save Alice and Don's children, who may have inherited their mother's resistance to the Rage virus.The film is shot almost entirely with hand-held cameras, a stylistic choice that adds to the gritty realism Fresnadillo is seeking (this emerges most clearly in the aforementioned prologue). It's not really that different from what Boyle achieved in 28 Days Later, with the notable exception of the sequel being much more fast-paced, taking full advantage of the fact that the Infected, unlike your average zombie, are quite skilled runners. That, paired with a murky cinematography and most of the movie taking place in dark, closed spaces, instills a relentless sense of dread, meaning 28 Weeks Later manages to do what few others have done before: it's every bit as scary as the original.Cast-wise, Fresnadillo has made choices as smart as those of his predecessor: Carlyle, a familiar face in Boyle's body of work, may not be as good-looking as Cillian Murphy, but what he lacks in physical appearance he makes up for in dramatic talent, giving a heartfelt portrayal that is miles away for his more famous roles (Begbie in Trainspotting above all). Byrne (who, coincidentally, also appears in Sunshine), after a few less fortunate career choices (minor roles in average stuff like Troy or Attack of the Clones), does a c ompetent job, as does Renner, with additional gravitas coming from US TV veterans Elba (The Wire) and Harold Perrineau (Oz and Lost).Overall, in a genre that is usually doomed by crappy follow-ups, 28 Weeks Later stands out as one of the better exceptions to that rule. It's artful, it's moving, and most of all, it never lets go of the fear factor.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good horror film,"The 2003 State-side release of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" was advertised as being a shockful scare-fest of a movie. I didn't get around to seeing it until a few days ago and I gotta feel like that was somewhat of an embellishment on the promoters' part.When environmental terrorists attack a lab that contains diseased chimps who are infected with a ""Rage"" virus, they unwittingly let loose a plague that lays waste to England and(perhaps)the rest of society. The 28 Days later of the title cuts to a mostly abandoned London where a coma-tized bicycle courier named Jim(Cillian Murphy,effective) wakes from his stasis to find himself alone in a hospital. As he searches London for signs of life,he is rescued from raging zombies by a couple of survivalists(one of them,the lovely Naomie Harris)who he follows from place to place to keep alive. From there,he also meets a man and his daughter(Brendan Gleeson,terrific,and Megan Burns,good)and they try to find a refuge out of London-town. A recorded message of a ""paradise"" where ""salvation"" can be found is tracked by Frank(the man) on his shortwave radio.This sequel feels more like a meditation on what happens to people when they are reduced to their lowest elements. A friend of mine told me that this movie's running zombies was what inspired the zombies in the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"",but where ""Dawn of..."" was pretty much a full-throttle action/horror hybrid from about start to finish,this film plays more like a ""What if..."" movie,with less emphasis on the creatures themselves and more on the (lucky?) survivors. There are also disturbing lessons on the nature OF survival,too.An very interesting and disturbing flick that probably sold itself wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the original,"As a big fan of zombie movies i could not wait to see this film,and after the opening sequence i was really impressed.The sad thing is that is the best part of the movie.The way in which the outbreak reacures is rather silly and most of the infected are killed after about 10 minuets which really annoyed me.The way that Don follows the group around remaining in the background goes against the actual effects of the virus and seems a bit confusing,and the rushed ending leaves you a little disappointed.This is by no means the worst 'zombie' film in the world but i believe the original was better.Hopefully they might make a prequel to explain what happened in the first 28 days rather than watch the Americans mess everything up for 2 hours.Overall it could have been a lot better!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 Weeks Later.....,I thought this sequel was much better than the first and the reason for that was because of the way they Hollywooded it up. I much prefer a Hollywood action film and the way they turned this into one was brill. I think the all action approach was much better than the indie approach in the first one. Some of the scenes in this sequel were better too. For example the underground scene with the night vision was very scary and was acted very well. Actually made you worry someone was lurking in the background. Yeah a lot of plot holes but is an enjoyable film and great for action/horror fans3 1/2 out of 5 ***,7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Check other reviews for all the major plot holes.There's some good acting, some great action, some interesting scenes... but the substance in storytelling is far far inferior than Days.

Really great horror from a fan that isn't into horror,"I've never been a big fan of the zombie and horror movies, but this one really takes the cake. Danny Boyle did an incredible job with his depiction of an abandoned London, fear stricken and virus plagued.This picture goes miles further than Danny Boyle's original 28 Days Later, a rare feat for a sequel. The director, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did a wonderful job with the tone and consistency of the piece.The sense of empty space is palpable and pervades the film. It was incredible to behold what Fresnadillo did with London, how he shaped and changed it. I know that he isn't a native Londoner, but living here myself I got the feeling that he knew the city well enough to understand how it might decay, and what the dynamics of its abandonment would look like.The father played by Robert Carlyle starts as an incredibly flawed character and something about his mix of heart and error makes you understand and invest in him from the beginning.The zombies are perhaps even more frightening here because unlike the original film, the atmosphere isn't a zombie plagued one but instead a city in renewal, which makes the outbursts of violence and gore that much more shocking and contrary to the general rebuilding that many of the characters are focused on.It's amazing to watch a great genre heavy film that has the tension and depth of an art-house piece.",,Anonymous,Horror
"If you like blood and guts, this horror film is for you","(My Synopsis) 28 Weeks after the rage virus infected everyone in Great Britain, the U.S. Army inspects the city of London and announces that the city is now safe, because the virus has burnt itself out. The army begins to clean up London and brings in British refugees who were not infected. They are all quarantined on an island near the wharf in London. Don (Robert Carlyle) was able to escape the infected zombies, but his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) became a victim of the rage. Don is reunited with his two children who were abroad on a camping trip during the outbreak. Unfortunately for the new population of London, the virus is not totally dead; it only takes one person to start the process all over again.(My Comment) If you like blood and guts, this horror film is for you. The storyline is foolish, brainless, and a little gross, but what do you expect from a B-grade horror movie. This is one horror film that will make you tired by the end of the movie. What I mean by this is that if you really get involved in the movie, you will run your heart out trying to get away from the infected zombies who sprint everywhere to their next victim. I know that I didn't want to be caught, because I jumped around in my seat, especially, at the beginning. The scene that I liked the best was the helicopter taking out the zombies; if you see the movie, you will know what I mean. The writers have set it up for a third movie, maybe 28 Months Later.

"from days to weeks, this series doesn't age well..","this movie was not terrible but it was not great either. there was not as much character development or plot compared to the first one. it was also a little less hopeful than the first one. it was a little more Hollywood and strayed away from the independent/artsy feel (that the first one had). there were also flaws in the story line (even though there was not much of one). i will not give away the flaws, i will let you figure those out yourself. my theory is that watching movies that are bad are better than watching a movie that is just okay... because with movies that are just okay... the viewer can pick out what could be better and what could have changed. i am also a zombie movie fan (even though some consider this series not a zombie series) so i am kind of picky about how the cinematography, cheesy factors, music, plot, char. dev., etc... that are carried out.i guess i was just spoiled with the first of this series.but if you are in the mood for little story line and some blood and gore... and a not-so- practical story ... this would be the movie for you.i believe i could have waited to rent this movie vs seeing in theaters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A rare sequel that works,"Whether you like the follow-up to cult horror hit, '28 Days Later' will depend on whether you prefer 'Alien' to 'Aliens.' Producer, Danny Boyle, said that '28 Weeks Later' is to '28 Days Later' what 'Aliens' is to 'Alien.' And, I can't think of any way to sum it up better.28 Days Later, as it told the story of a plague sweeping Britain turning the population into zombies (okay, 'infected' if you want the technical term), it was dark, tense and moody. However, 28 Weeks Later goes in the other direction, being loud, brash and exciting.The action picks off when Britain is starting to be repatriated by a UN team. Of course things don't go smoothly and the human population soon finds itself at the mercy of a horde of flesh-eating, rage-infected zombies (infected). If you like your horror explosive and non-stop then you should like this. It has a good cast, good special effects and, thanks to the soundtrack, makes sure it feels like it's set in the same universe as its predecessor at all times.In fact, the only downside I can think of is that it's probably a little too short. The characters - although good - never quite get the chance to be fleshed out as they might have been. Whereas most films go on too long, this one could have done with some extra character-development to go with the excellent action.It may not be Aliens, but it is a worthy sequel in a world of endless, terrible additions to horror franchises.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Tarzan Syndrome,"Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is a hack. He's another one of those mediocre, jerky camera directors who hasn't a clue how to tell a story or create tension. Worst of all he is an over-user of what I call the Tarzan Syndrome (Based on Tarzan, the Ape Man, 198) which means you don't actually see any action, just lots of fast-paced shots adding up to nothing. This boring film was really like a hour-plus Windex commercial. Every other scene had somebody putting their fingers, bloody or not, on glass. I am sure Juan has some kind of explanation for this silly device, but it got boring really fast. So did all the gore scenes, which were, in essence, identical in pace.Films like this are only fun as a game. How many scenes can you predict before they even happen? Despite the praise of some misguided critics, 28 Days was a terrible film and this is an unwatchable sequel. I won't reveal the ending, because I can't.

There is some character development, but not enough. It's worse that the movie tries to be that kind of film, the kind that focuses on characters, and then just becomes an action-horror movie full of scares, though those scares are pretty great.Nevertheless, the movie, like I said, had great scares, and there's a good, haunting atmosphere to it.

Could have been great,"OK, I just watched this. This is not a review, just one guys opinion.Its a decent popcorn movie, but it fails to rise to the level of the original. Its a fun night at the movies, but once you watched it once there is really no reason to watch it again. It fails where the original succeeded for three reasons.Actors - the original had some of the best acting ever seen in a horror movie. There was great chemistry between Celina (sp?) and Jim and between the cab driver and his daughter. This movie has four generic bland actors in lead roles as the kids, pilot, and the medical officer. None of them are really developed beyond what I just wrote. We don't care if they die. The parents (cant spell actor names) are actually played by good actors and have chemistry between them, but are killed off early and needlessly. The guy who played the sniper is the only one who shows some character, but he cant carry the film by himself. All the deaths are pointless, seeing one good character die creates a bigger emotional impact than seeing a thousand extras mowed down by snipers/machine guns, helicopter blades, and fire bombings. This movie is like Aliens without Ripley or Newt.Director - More is really less. Hence books are always better than the movies based on them (unless the book was awful to begin with). The first movie left a lot to the imagination, we didn't see how the infection spread through London but everywhere we saw the aftermath. This movie shows everything, leaves nothing to the imagination, and the result is underwhelming despite a lot of creativity on the part of the filmmakers. Same with the shots of empty London. In 28DL we got small glimpses of deserted London that haunted us, here we see a travelogue of every single landmark in the city shot from a helicopter, it stops being cool really quickly and gets annoying.Cinematography - is also out of place, the movie apes its predecessor without understanding the purpose behind the technique, as a result action sequences are hard to discern, and you are always aware that you watching a movie cause every second the camera does some art school shot. The technique was effective in a small horror movie, it is not effective in a big budget action movie which is what this is.Its last sin is actually a result of the other three, its not scary. Between the generic actors, expensive but soulless crowd scenes, and drunken monkey camera work, we stop being concerned for the characters and are taken out of the movie, as a result we are just not scared.There are five good minutes in the movie, and its the intro. The movie would do better just to follow Don.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Bad at All,"For some time, I feared this movie would be a gun-ho, balls for brains horror sequel. The realm of horror sequels is populated by the great and terrible alike. Take 1978's ""Dawn of the Dead"" as opposed to ""Poltergeist II"". Both of these are sequels to great classics, but they couldn't be farther apart in terms of quality. I'm glad to say that this movie is no ""Poltergeist II"". First big help, a really strong cast starring the likes of Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne. Other cast members, including Robert Carlyle, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Imogen Poots (I have a thing for her, can't help it) and Mackintosh Muggleton, do quite well at creating some interesting characters.The pacing in this film is different than the last film's, with less focus on the growth of the characters and more so on a race against time. To that end I'll say it's disappointedly not as nihilistic feeling as the first film, but it still maintains an atmosphere of dreaded realism. And I have to say this; this film sports one of the best horror opening s ever. Heart-pumping, well-choreographed, and a bad-ass way to start a movie. The score isn't as marvelous, but it has some marvelous usage of John Murphy's themes created for the first film. All in all, I highly recommend this sequel. Only thing that troubles me is the ending; did they make it or did they not? Guess that's part of the charm.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
True UK Zombie Film Mixed With Hollywood,"Somehow both a continuation yet entirely different to 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later is a fast-paced, engrossing, true zombie film. Whilst it's predecessor was great in it's own way; slow builds and tension interrupted by explosions of action, focusing more on the development of characters and their groups, 28 Weeks loses little time in getting to the heart-in-mouth moments.Shot in the same fashion, the guerilla-style framing of scenes again creates the chaotic atmosphere for the film, however as these scenes are more prolonged and frequent here, the horror and gore can be appreciated. The plot is smart and engaging, and whilst it lacks a lot of the individual character arcs of 28 Days, the foundations have already been laid in order to let the excitement of the story unfold.Risking some of it's identity by including a split UK/US cast, none of the actors can be faulted, particularly Carlyle who's range is impressive. This feels more like the zombie film you expect from 28 Days, and hopefully one day there will be a 28 Months.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lazy writing.,"This movie is fictional not because it is a movie about zombies but because the characters were doing things that don't make sense, even in a fictional world.

Just to get it over with quickly, I clicked on the fast forward button so many times I finished the movie in 30 minutes.Just another movie with a stupid plot filled with stupid characters doing stupid and illogical things.Clearly an example of lazy writing.

An injection of Hollywood isn't all that bad,"Upon hearing that a sequel to the brilliant 28 Days Later was being made, I was unsure. When I read the plot, I felt like totally dismissing the film. ""Oh great, Americans save the day again!"" was my initially response, as I felt irritated at the idea of Amercians muscling in on an effective and quality British horror.I finally saw the product last night, and breathed a sigh of relief as my earlier doubts turned out to be a little off target. Okay, the sequel is much bigger budget with extensive special effects and a much wider focus. The low budget, grainy Indy feel of the first one is not so strong here, as the small scale setting of the first one has blown into a city wide, high octane military deal with skyscrapers, helicopters and all matter of weaponry. This film has many more people involved on a much bigger scale. You could call the whole thing an 'injection of Hollywood', but trust me, it could've gone a lot worse than people here are whining about. The energy of the 28 Days is still here, the shaky camera-work during combat scenes, the frenzied feel when the infected attack, the tension and the moments of emotion between survivors.In 28 Weeks Later, a section of London near the millennium dome has been wardened off by the military, in which society tries to rebuild itself after the infected have slowly died off. It is a complex of tall sophisticated blocks, high tech systems, and plenty of well armed troops around the campus. Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting) takes one of the lead roles as a family man who is reunited with his kids early on in the film. It is soon discovered that his wife is not quite like everyone else, a medical phenomenon, but at the same time very dangerous to be around. Without giving too much away, an internal outbreak is triggered, and lets just say the film gets VERY messy from here on in. If you thought the first one was gory, then strap yourselves in, as this goes off the scale with blood'n'guts. This could compete with ""Land of the Dead"" for gore, albeit this is gore you can take seriously.Brilliant but never OTT special effects make the combat scenes gruesomely entertaining, camera-work is worthy, as is the tension as various survivors struggle to stay alive in what becomes a free for all area of carnage and mayhem. I thinks fans of the first one disappointed with this should be grateful it wasn't turned into something like Resident Evil:Apocalypse, which would've been just a little insulting.I think it would've angered people a lot less if the military force sent in to control and monitor the situation were simply UN, instead of having to be solely American. Apart from that the film kept up and gets 7 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but could have been much better,"Watched the original again the other day, watched 28 Weeks later last night.28 Weeks later is in my opinion no where near as good as the original though I did enjoy it, well bits of it.I'm one of those people that loves Zombie films, I have to see them and enjoy even bad Zombie films.28 Weeks later. I loved the beginning, but the rest of the film felt rather drab and didn't really have any direction, it felt like it was going nowhere and this was more apparent after the outbreak. Then the film ended just when it started to do something. The ending was very quick and felt like a chunk of the movie had been cut out so that the film could be wrapped up to fit into your typical 99 Minute movie.The film didn't create as much tension as the original did, I never felt like I was on the edge of my seat. I felt it was more of a bloodbath movie where there was plenty of unnecessary gore, some scenes were just had to look at.But there were plenty of good bits in the film and I did end up enjoying it, I'm a bit of a sucker for Zombie film.

28 weeks later and why i like it.,"i think this movie is a bloody, very gory,dark, scary movie of all time since 28 days later. in my opinion my most fantastic scene would be the part where that Irish man (forgot his name), went to see her wife and and then turned in to one of those zombies and started killing her, after mauling her half to death i like the bit where he... just... takes her eyes out and that was brilliantly gory. the second best scene was where they were underground, in the dark and those peaple get infected and start killing each other in the dark. i rate this movie for exellence a brilliant 10/10.review written by: mike.David.shawfield from London.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stage 3: Extermination,"A wild zombie style movie, with blood and gore galore, boasting some uniquely grotesquely ways the ""Infected"" and the non-infected find to exterminate each other. Keep an eye out for the pilot, who gets the award for the most creative way. The movie borrows the theme from such classics as The Thing, Body Snatchers and many others: the victims transform into killers, too.This movie is set some six months after ""28 Days,"" and subtly works in to the story a little background for those who did not see the original. The virus is believed dead (ok, allow poetic license on that one), and although this is an obvious set up for its return, the story works in some character development and subplots to spark the disaster. I liked the contamination/riot sequence, spiced by manic camera movement that increases the level of chaos. These camera movements sometimes make the fates of individuals difficult to see, however. Pivotal characters to the plot, such as Rose Byrne's (the finest actor in the cast), could have been on screen more. The children were fairly good actors, but some of their scripted actions (like deliberately visiting a quarantined area) were contrived. The ""Blair Witch"" style sequence, although obviously just for fun, was clever.This movie guarantees more ""28"" sequels, since several story arcs are left wide open for further use. Overall, if you can overlook the movie's plot holes, it's a good horror story, where the action never lets up.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A good sequel,"28 Weeks Later does everything a sequel should do. It continues the story of 28 Days Later while not depending on it, introduces new characters and new conflicts, and, most importantly, it ups the antee. Fresnadillo revisits the skeletal aspects of 28 Days Later (the photography and the music most notably) while telling his own story, giving the skeleton new meat, so to speak.I like the diversity of the actors this movie offers. The story allows room for American influence while keeping the focus of the conflict on the United Kingdom. After watching a completely British cast in 28 Days Later, I felt a bit of the strangeness the characters in 28 Weeks Later felt at the presence of the Americans.28 Weeks Later is a story. Whether or not the filmmakers intended it to be a socio-political statement is irrelevant to me. Applying reality to it subtracts from its entertainment value. So, drink a soda and eat some popcorn.

Disappointing.,"I was looking forward to seeing 28 weeks later as the first one 28 days later was such a class film. Overall 28 weeks has a lot going for it, the acting, special effects and directing is good and it has it's fair share of scary moments, but it was let down in so many places. In the interest of adding more gore and trying to make it appeal more too an American market, they didn't leave enough time for character development and made certain parts of the film either boarding on, or completely unbelievable. It just made what could have been a good sequel, into just another gore flick.Really I think you have to look at 28 weeks and 28 days as two completely different films, rather than the first and the sequel as they are so far apart in many ways.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A bigger, badder, British!, zombie? thriller.","28 Weeks Later (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 2007, UK) is the sequel to Danny Boyle's British zombie thriller 28 Days Later (2002, UK). Fresnadillo mixes dark fast-paced chaotic close-ups with huge special effects and tension building periods of eerie quiet in a film that is big on gore and scares.The film is set twenty-eight weeks after the rage virus swept across Britain and now, still in the midst of a US led clean-up operation, Britons' are being brought back to London for repatriation. Needless to say the virus breaks out again and the film follows two US soldiers trying to save brother and sister Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots) as they try to escape from the infected.It is disappointing that after the original distinctively British film the sequel sees the American's wading in to sort out a mess that the British seem to make worse in thirty-minute increments. I suppose that this is down to the American money that was poured into the film and the need to tailor it for a US market.This hardly detracts though from the blistering camera work that is at its best during the terrifyingly disorientating and frenzied zombie attacks. A dark and desolate London landscape is conveyed through a mixture of voyeuristic high angle long shots and uncomfortably close close-ups that convey both the isolation and vulnerability of the protagonists as they make their way past a series of noticeable landmarks.The soundtrack uses the same motif from the first film and benefits because of it, heightening the desperate battles for survival that the children have to endure.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Nice Complement To The Original,"Twenty Eight Days Later became the cult smash of 2003 because of its radical departure from what made up the quintessential ""Zombie"" film. Instead of using a wide 2.85 ratio with long shots, it resorted to a more intimate scope with quick and jerky movement. Instead of comedic clichés and over-the top violence, there was intense fear and realistic gore. The film succeeds on many levels in its theatricality and style, but on others such as plot, it fails to enthrall the audience and feel like a shell, for what we all truly want to see on the screen.After Danny Boyle left the film to do Sunshine, Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo stepped in. Fresnadillo incorporated much more flair into the film than its predecessor. The camera transforms London into a labyrinth of modern buildings and steel with sweeping crane shots, pans, and fast cuts. It lulls the audience into a sense of peace and security with allusions to the chaos that is soon to follow.Unlike most of the previous film, Twenty Eight Week Later benefits due to the clash between the modern and the devastation. In Days it is the desolation of the countryside that contributes to the edginess of the film; here it is the exact opposite. Also, in Days the destruction has already happened, and the audience is catapulted immediately into the action and chaos of the Rage Virus. In Weeks, we are obviously aware that these events will happen (we wouldn't have a movie if they didn't, right?) but it's the how, when, where, and why that captivate us.The place where the film stumbles is the plot. Clearly Fresnadillo's intentions were not to hit it out of the ball-park in complexity or inventiveness, but there are holesnot necessarily plot holes, but weak spots in the script where one has to question the logic behind decisions made. Obviously it creates frustration within the audience which was most likely Fresnadillo's intention, but there is a line that needs to be drawn between intentional creation of frustration and poor script writing.The political themes in the film are very broad and much more unnoticeable than mentioned elsewhere. There is that very present ""Destroy everything to eliminate the few"" theme that perhaps can be construed by some as American foreign policy but this implication is very broad, and I sincerely doubt the filmmakers of a zombie film had that on the brain. Needless to say, it is slightly visible and is food for thought.The film also takes some cheap shots in the horror department. This is not to say that this is the only film that has succumbed to that temptationmost modern horror films build upon the notion that their audience likes some throw away scares. However, there are too many of these and it becomes tiring for the audience as well as detrimental to the pacing of the film. It has its gore as well, but nothing incredibly shocking or grotesque is seen (i.e. torture shockers like Saw and Hostel.) Not all is lost because of the film's plot or shock tactics. Throughout the film there are many creative scenes, (The scene in the subway is wonderfully done and the scene with the helicopter is absolutely shocking.) The blaring rock music juxtaposed with escape scenes (such as with Robert Carlyle in the beginning) assaults the audience's ears creating a great tension that the audience desperately seeks to relieve.All in all, Twenty Eight Weeks Later is a worthy addition to its extremely successful predecessor. What makes it successful is the 'give and take' this film experiences in relation to the original. What one film does, the other seeks to balance by doing the opposite. They complement each other perfectly similar to the success shared by the 'Alien and Aliens' films twenty years ago. In this summer of sequels and more, this is one film that definitely holds its weight against the slough of other films that will undoubtedly not turn out to be as successful.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A solid zombie sequel,"I really liked the theme song to the first one and actually enjoyed it constantly being played throughout this whole movie. Anyways this is a solid sequel to the first one. If you thought the first one lacked zombie action well you will get plenty of that in this one. The feeling of being alone and helpless isn't shown all that much in this one since there is more survivors and the people with guns are the good guys. But it sure is a entertaining zombie movie throughout. Although the intro to this movie is memorable and well done, what got a bit irritating is how the zombie chaos happens again. And this is after the start of the reconstruction of Britain after the first movie. When I first saw this movie in theater I just wanted to scream ""so are you happy now!"". Not just that the way the virus spreads is irritating and absurd. But your just going to have to go with it or it will irritate you throughout the whole movie. Especially since almost the first hour of this movie shows how the virus starts up again. I saw Jeremy Renner for the first time and liked the guy as an actor right of the bat when I saw this in theater. He plays a likable, courageous and charismatic soldier in this. Robert Carlyle and Idris Elba is good in this as well...Well the amount they are in it. The grainy and grimy camera-work returns and this time more shaky than ever. Which I would complain sometimes but it really works in this movie. Although I got noxious a few times and dizzy while watching this in theater. There is humanity in this but it also has believable emotions going for it as well. Sure there are some plot holes and stuff just obviously doesn't make any sense compared to the first movie. Sure the script could have been polished up a bit but overall as a whole it's forgivable and it's a very watchable and entertaining zombie flick that shouldn't be missed.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

shocking and scary,"""28 weeks"" later is a succession of disturbing images, some of them so strong to stick in the mind like a nightmare; different from other zombie movies has also a sense of reality (actually almost reality) . Of course the vision of everything is apocalyptic and the resorting to flesh eating zombies and to violence scenes gets the movie to be too implausible, but the sense is that, given some circumstances, human nature could change. This 100% British movie (starring the very British Robert Carlyle) is not only a monster flick, got also a considerable character development and many greatly staged sequences.

Much below its predecessor,"Follows the cult hit ""28 Days Later..."" from 2002.After the first contamination dies dwindles down and much of the Infected have starved the UK is being repopulated. There is strict control and military law that screens all incoming people and protects inner London from possible contamination. However, things do go quite as planned and there is another outbreak of the Rage virus.The story is a good continuation and there is a solid tie in back with the first film. There is more intense gore and horror, but the film is brought down by several crippling weak points. The way the outbreak starts here is due to some incredible coincidences that don't make for strong storytelling. Then there are the dramatic elements, which made the first film powerhouse horror along with the gore, but here they are much weaker. Several things that demand some sort of explanation remain virtually untouched and then by the end the script starts to take turns that very obviously favor action/suspense over following logic that was established during the build-up. Then the ending sets up the film for a sequel in a very uninspired way.Audiences that enjoyed the tension of the 'Days' will have more of that here to look forward too, but as a good really horror film, this just doesn't work. Overall the film barely makes it out of the ""overblown, effects packed sequel that lacks story substance"" category.--- 6/10Rated R for strong violence/gore and horror",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good,"I had no intention in watching a sequel of the Danny Boyle classic. I thought, as so many sequels, 28 Weeks Later would be cursed from the start. The viewing of the stinker 'The Hills Have Eyes 2' made my preconceptions only stronger. Boy, was I wrong...28 Weeks Later is an exciting mix of horror(gore) and action that will please fans of the genre. It's at no time as good as 28 Days Later although the action scenes are more spectacular at times. I was surprised to see the excellent Rose Byrne turn up in this and some other solid actors. Of course the story is improbable, of course the action is over-the-top, of course the acting is ridiculous at times, of course there's no character development...nevertheless it's a movie that will have you jumping out of your seat and that's exactly what it's intended for. The gore is excessive ( much more than in 28 Days Later) and I couldn't help but look away in one scene.28 Weeks Later biggest flaw is the lack of dramatic intensity, no philosophical content and of course many, many plot holes. Do not try to compare it to it's predecessor, as that one manages to score a lot better on the above mentioned points. At what points is 28 Weeks Later better then 28DL? The action-scenes are downright spectacular, also the originality of the action-scenes deserves to be praised. The camera-work is excellent, contributing to the choking atmosphere throughout the movie.To sum up: 28 Weeks later is a great summer action/horror movie, that will definitely satisfy fans of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Movie,"I never expected much from this movie because it always looked to me like an unnecessary sequel to a great movie. However, I held out with a little hope and saw it today. And, I was disappointed, yet not surprised.While the movie is enjoyable on a very primitive level, it doesn't strike as many intellectual or emotional chords as the first one. Weeks focuses almost entirely on chase sequences. The movie begins fairly well, with a group of people together. Then, the infected attack and we are introduced to the annoying shaky camera technique used throughout the movie. While a ""shaky"" camera can work well with chaos on screen, it becomes a bit much in this movie. It just seems to unnecessarily confuse things sometimes. Either way, when these infected show up, the movie becomes about running, and running... and running. It rarely takes a brake to breath so we are never allowed a chance to know any of the characters. That is where this film becomes a typical horror movies. The characters are not here to be understood, they are only here to be chased by the bad guys. There are a few moments when the movie rises above this, which places the film a small step above mindless entertainment but not enough for me to recommend it to many people besides horror buffs.Overall, this is a decent movie. I wouldn't call it a waist of time, especially if you are a fan of the zombie genre and are looking for your latest fix (if you are offended by my reference to this film as being in the zombie genre, replace zombie genre with ""post apocalyptic world overrun by mindless carnivorous beings genre"")",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you're a fan of 28DL, you'll be a fan of 28WL","Saw a media screening last night. 28WL has a lean script and the movie flies by. The suspense lingers throughout the film, and it doesn't slow down too much like the first one did (when everyone got to the military outpost). There are small variations in the storyline pertaining to the how/who the infection affects, and there is one really well done scene where a number of rampaging infected have to be well..dealt with..in a swift fashion. Robert Carlyle is excellent, and overall I think you might even like this one better than the first. Stylistically it's similar to the first, and the tone and mood are still quite eerie, since a large part of London has been quarantined and non infected humans are being brought back into re populate the city. Scenes involving characters going into the prohibited areas where infected may linger are quite eerie and well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A dark disturbing film that remains with you long after the end credits,"When I first saw the trailer for 28 weeks later, the overhead shots of apache gun ships and jets firing money shots disguised as missiles and bombs into London like a UK version of Independence Day didn't give me much hope for this film. My first reaction was oh no the studio and film makers have been infected by the greed virus and this is going to be a lowest common dominator film, made by a focus group who had just read how to make zombie films for dummies. However I couldn't be more wrong on just how good this film was and how little it sold out.If you expecting a no brains blood splattering zombie film with Arnie look a-likes firing rocket launchers from their sides in an endless spiral of blood, then avoid this film. Instead it paints a bleak and hopeless landscape, a far darker and broody brother to 28 days later, It is grim and desolate and it doesn't let up from the first scene to the last. It is more kinetic than the first film with less time for character development and more action. While 28 days later shows what it would be like to wake up in a world after the apocalypse. 28 weeks later puts you right into the middle of that hell and as a result the action and intensity is relentless. Saying this even with limited screen time the main characters remain solid with only the peripheral ones being slightly weak, but in no way does this spoil the films.All Zombie films fall into the realm of fantasy or quasi-believable; they take a sense of truth and reality and twist it. Zombie films in many ways are cousins to fantasy films and you'll get the most out of this film if you watch it with this frame of mind. 28 Weeks later was not designed to stand-up to scientific scrutiny, there are some plot developments that wouldn't stand-up in a court of law. But like all fantasy films this is not the point. The films makers were never trying to make a super realistic docu-style film. Even the rage virus itself was skipped over in the first film and the director and writer admitted that they themselves didn't know a whole lot about the origin of the virus. They were out to make a zombie film and a statement about modern life and where we maybe heading, which is what all the best zombie films do. 28 Weeks later has some truly terrifying and disturbing scenes. The action is brutal and packed with emotions; there is only one over the top scene, which seems like homage to other zombie films. But that is the only time this film looks into the past; it is not a rehash of 28 days later. It has a very different pace, but certainty comes from the same family with a high quality of production and direction.This is well directed quality film with more than a few shocks in it, definitely not a date movie, but a disturbing statement about modern times and is harder to watch that 28 days later. Like all films that ask uncomfortable question about the present, not everyone is ready to hear the answer and it will be a love or hate film as you can see from the reviews. But as time goes by this film will grow in stature and become a snap shot of the times, just like all great zombie films.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most complete films of the 2000's.  A great sequel.,"28 Days Later was one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen, and 28 Weeks Later was no different. It is scary, thrilling, and more political than what you'd expect from a horror film. The acting is also very good, but what makes these 2 movies so good is how well directed and written they are...because that makes them realistic, which is disturbing.It's been 28 weeks since the end of the first film, and long since the last infected person died out from starvation. Now, the US Army has landed in Britain, with the hopes of rebuilding the country (sound familiar?). After many weeks of success and progress, a person comes in contact with a carrier of the rage virus...passing the virus on, and the outbreak of insane blood thirsty zombies begins again. Meanwhile, 2 children (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton) may be far more important and valuable than anyone knows.First off, I was impressed with the acting. Jeremy Renner (S.W.A.T.) was very likable, much like Cillian Murphy in the original. His US Military Sniper character was very well done. He's a truly good and moral character who makes a big decision during the heat of battle, thus setting off the movie's central storyline. Like the first film, the central storyline doesn't establish itself until a while in. Poots and Muggleton both do good jobs as the main characters. You'll feel for them. Robert Carlyle gives a magnificent performance, but telling how so would be spoiling. Harold Perrineau also does a good job in a supporting role, and contributes to one of the most fantastic action scenes with his helicopter.Like I said, the acting is great, but the writing, direction, and the action is even better. There's a lot more action in this one, for sure. The gore is very plentiful to satisfy the most die hard zombie film fans, and the action sequences are very clever and well done, especially the helicopter scenes. I was left jaw-dropped many times. The zombies are scarier than before, because this time, you see their creation and how quickly they multiply. Sometimes, you can't help but think, ""what if this really happened?"". It's as psychologically scary as it is visually scary, and I thank Juan Carlos Fresnadillo for that. The film is expertly directed and written, and gives Danny Boyle a run for his money. Fresnadillo captures the mood and feel of the first film perfectly, and you'll get chills just from the atmosphere. Also, Fresnadillo did a great job creating a destroyed London. It's very realistic. The script allows for a fast paced movie that balances the action with the drama very well, while scaring the crap out of you. Even though this is a movie, the political undertones are very obvious, as well as Fresnadillo's attitude towards social behavior. The movie eerily resembles the Iraq War, and what would happen if the world was thrust into total chaos with nothing to guide the people. 28 Weeks Later is definitely one of the most complete films I've watched recently. It's as political as it is scary and action packed, and it's one hell of a ride. Great job, Mr. Fresnadillo. I also have no doubt that there's going to be a third part. I can't wait.9/10 --spy",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Inferior Sequel Yet Very Much Capable Of Standing On Its Own.,"The follow-up chapter to Danny Boyle's post-apocalyptic horror that infused a new life into the subgenre of zombie films by replacing its reanimated corpses with people infected with rage-inducing virus, 28 Weeks Later stays true to many elements of the original but makes way too many absurd choices over the course of its runtime to finish as an inferior sequel.Set nearly 6 months after the events that transpired in 28 Days Later, the story of 28 Weeks Later paints an empty portrait of London that seems to be on the road to recovery after US military intervenes to restore order. The survivors are brought into a quarantined facility but things once go out of control when a surviving member turns out to the carrier of the virus that decimated the entire city.Co-written & directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 28 Weeks Later begins with an absolutely thrilling prologue that sets the tone for the upcoming events. The plot then takes us through what all has happened in the time gap between the two films and from that point onwards, it's a downhill ride. There are plenty of poor decisions made here, whether its reintroducing the virus or a resurfacing zombie or the drama surrounding one dull family.The set design manages to capture the tone of the original but fails to take advantage of it. Cinematography goes completely mental after the brilliantly filmed prologue for the camera is swung without any sense of direction and the chaotic aura it was aiming for isn't entirely realised. Editing is fine for the most part. John Murphy returns with a welcome score. And the performances are all over the place, with Jeremy Renner leading from the front.On an overall scale, 28 Weeks Later follows into the footsteps of its predecessor with much bigger aspirations & higher budget but fails to provide us with characters that are worthy of emotional investment, something 28 Days Later pulled off quite effortlessly. However, much of its unfolding story retains the thrills & terror of the previous chapter, and apart from a few dumb decisions, it's an enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying ride capable of standing on its own. Worth a shot.",,Anonymous,Horror
The Artisty Cannot be DeniedA Well Received and Deserved Sequel,"Actually coming 5 Years Later, this Sequel to the Danny Boyle Indie Hit ""28 Days Later"", is a Crisp, Bloody, Gore-Fest with a certain Eye for Location Shots and Impeccably Mounted Mayhem, much like the Original.There still is a goodly Amount of Shaky-Cam that surely Reached its Zenith about this time and any Subsequent Usage of this now Overused Post-Modern Trope is Tired to say the least.But in 2007 it was still New Enough to be given its due as a ""New Toy"" in the Low-Budget Filmmaking Toolbox.

I have a freakin' headache!,"This was the most incredibly pulse pounding adrenaline rush that I have ever experienced. The sound pumped through my ears as the tension pumped my heart and i literally jumped out of my seat with the excitement.Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo kept true to Danny Boyle's (Shallow Grave, 28 days Later) story and gave us a film that rocked all the way through.Catherine McCormack was incredible, and played convincingly, especially at the end.

"The Most Unfiltered, Uncompromising Fright Flick in Years!","After an endless barrage of pointless, careless remakes, 28 Weeks Later shows us that there is still hope for us hardcore horror fans! If this film doesn't get your heart pumping I don't know what will! There are no boundaries that the director of this film is afraid to cross, which is what makes this film such a rarity. There is one particular scene that by itself should have gotten the film an NC-17 Rating. Very vicious and brutal. The story and its characters are straightforward and all the better for it. This is a film that doesn't need to be weighed down by complexity. Why? Because it's so damn scary and exciting! I have to give a lot of credit to the music composer as well. The music for 28 Weeks Later will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Incredibly creepy! I guarantee if you do not see this film in theaters you will be kicking yourself afterwards. This is coming from a long time horror fan. If 28 Weeks Later does well, hopefully we will see more films just like it in the future that actually qualify as horror.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I saw this movie last night, and I have one thing to say.......","OMG!!! It was so amazing! Such an improvement from the first one. The first one kind of dragged and slowed up and sped down and did that the rest of the movie. But 28 Weeks Later never dragged or slowed down. I was mesmerized the whole film. There were so many twists and turns and changes in the story line. I thought that the movie would be a little tarnished b/c they put kids in it. But man was it good. I have to say that the beginning was the best part of the whole film, but the whole movie was excellent. I loved every minute of it. The acting was good, the story line was even better, and the action was even better than that. This movie is officially on my favorites. 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Digression From The Original,"28 Weeks Later has a wonderful beginning. Before anything happens, there is already a quiet tension, a talent being displayed masterfully by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the director in place of Danny Boyle for this sequel. There is great intensity and great moral conflict presented with Robert Carlyle's character. But then, as the film progresses, there is not much more that can be said about it.Yes, when the inevitable gorefest begins again, there are some truly intense and disturbing sequences of rage-infected people and their attacks. Without spoiling anything, one of them involves a single bound person and an infected person's singular, fixated brutalization, and another involves a mass of people locked in a pitch black corridor with a growing number of infected people, the attack being in the dark with occasional flickers of light presenting only two or three frames of horrifying images. However, Fresnadillo becomes too reliant on strobing slow motion and grandiose computerized explosion effects, all of which are a bit dull, with the exception of a later sequence involving a helicopter's blades against a field of rage-infecteds.The violence continues without relief and with a completely morbid atmosphere, and if it were not kicking to the side so many themes and strands, wrapping them up so quickly once the expository portion of the film ended, it would seem handled better. Unfortunately, however, it all grows old and stale after awhile. There isn't much thought given to much of it after awhile. We hear the same dialogue, see the same sort of undeveloped characters, and see the same buckets of blood and gore that we've seen in countless other group-survival-oriented horror and disaster films.Where is the allegory and paranoid awareness of the underbelly of humanity that the original film had that made it so far above the average sort of film, the genre of which I mentioned at the end of the last paragraph? This one even seems to abandon a part of the plot that is presented early on that seems very important.The movie is entertaining enough as a gorefest, a very gloomy, depressing one, but if you're expecting a sequel that lives up to the substance of the original, then don't bother. This is probably just going to turn into just another sloppy slasher franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent zombie film - spoilers abound below,"FINAL WARNING: SPOILERS GALORE! I am actually giving this a wicked high rating because I think it is one of the best zombie movies I have ever seen. The rage virus is so potent and spreads so quickly that coupled with the outright violence we're subject to at the beginning of the movie we have the creepiest premise since the original Night of the Living Dead, I think.28 Days Later was very good, but after a fashion I think that ""Weeks"" did more with the basic premise. One of my chief complaints with ""Days"" was that the Infected are hardly in the movie, and didn't seem as much of a threat. Jim gets chased by some who we only see from a distance, Tom kills two, one pops its head up to the cab window in the tunnel, the ones shot down outside the house are at a distance, and the scene where Jones gets loose was scary, but not the same as hordes of the Infected running at you.I wish that fewer hand-held cameras were used during the attack scenes in ""Weeks,"" but you got the idea.I didn't care for the ending too much, as it felt a little obvious, but I also think that the idea of the Infected making it to the mainland is also so quintessential a question that I like the idea of forcing the next film, if there is one, to pick it up. Would humanity be able to get their collective act together to deal with the threat, a la World War Z, or would it be all over with, a la Romero? I like the idea of setting up Robert Carlysle's anger at leaving his wife as a pretense to why he is so particularly angry and wanting to kill his kids. I can almost accept that he follows them throughout the film. The suggestion that the rage virus doesn't make you 100% of an automaton is interesting.The political undertones of the film are heavy. The Americans got the clean-up job - and they screwed it up royal. Certain questions come to mind that other reviewers have pointed out as criticisms and plot holes, but which I find myself considering have been placed there very specifically. Why are the Americans repatriating anyone before the clean-up is finished? Wouldn't a thorough search have prevented another outbreak? The line ""We are responsible for your safety..."" is so potent a reminder later on when all heck breaks loose.All in all, I will go to sleep kind of scared tonight, as the Infected and the infection are completely terrifying when you are actually watching an outbreak. The final frames of the film therefore set up a truly incomprehensibly-terrifying premise, and it makes me want to see more.I hope it happens. 28 Months Later could be an interesting film, if they turn it around quickly enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Code Red,"I'm not too sure, but i might have preferred this one to the first one 28 days later. Point is I liked them both at the end of the day. This did something for me, struck a new chord. I would not call this a zombie movie though. Zombies are the living dead, you shoot then and they get back up again, these are infected humans, infected with rage. This one is bizarre. Love it from beginning to end, it does have that Hitchcock touch to it, like in psycho the hero, the trail you been following gets smacked out of the picture and you find yourself in new case scenarios. Here at one point, just when we think that things might be turning for the better, all hell suddenly breaks loose and you not just trying to survive against the infected, but the snipers too. What brings the infection back is someone somewhat immune to it, but a carrier, just a kiss will do the job. There is a part of this film reminiscent of the Jews in the extermination camps. I would not be in the least bit surprised to see yet another continuation, say 28 months later and what not, most worth it, great project, very courageous.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Big thrills, huge plot-holes","The first thing to note about this movie is that it is one of a very small group of films: a sequel that is as good as it's predecessor. However it excels in different ways, ""28 Days Later"" was primarily a psychological horror flick that examined how well-drawn characters who care for each other react to terrifying circumstances. ""28 Weeks"" is first and foremost an action movie loaded with large-scale effects-laden depictions of carnage.The plot is fairly straightforward- seven months after the outbreak of the Rage virus, an American military force has started the task of reconstructing Britain. In order to repopulate the country, the surviving Britons are housed in a military base established on the Isle of Dogs in London. These survivors include 12 year-old Andy and his teenage sister Tam, together with their father (the fantastic Robert Carlyle) who knows more than he is telling about the fate of their mother. All of the original ""infected"" have starved to death, but it turns out that some people bitten during the epidemic never exhibited symptoms themselves but can still contaminate others. Needless to say, it's not long before all hell breaks loose and Andy and Tam- together with a U.S military doctor and an Army sniper- have to fight for their lives.Though ""28 Weeks"" has a different director, the film has a very similar look to it's predecessor with lots of jump-cuts and jittery photography during the action scenes. Locations and music are both used very effectively also. Like in all the best zombie movies, there really is a sense that nowhere is safe and nobody can be trusted. The whole film exudes a deep sense of dread and menace, danger seems to lurk everywhere even when it appears there ought to be nothing to fear. The pace of the film grows increasingly relentless and it is genuinely exhilarating to watch the characters struggle against ever-increasing odds in order to stay alive and escape to safety. The action set pieces are stunningly executed- particularly one involving a field full of infected and a swooping helicopter.However, all of this comes at price. The plot has some absolutely massive holes that most viewers will have no difficulty identifying. In ""28 Weeks"" things happen just because they do and necessary explanations are simply not provided. Having said that, this is a worthy sequel that provides lavish helpings of tension, exhilaration, and gore. Definitely worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Horror
Best horror film of 2007,"The first 12 minutes gave me the feeling that this movie was going to be another low-brow horror/zombie movie, but then a very different story started and it was great. The plot, action, suspense and thrills worked really well. Don't let the word ""horror"" give you the wrong idea though; this is simply a great movie that also happens to be a horror movie.Basically, the story starts 28 weeks after the contagious ""rage virus"" has run its course in Britain. All the infected people have apparently died off and an American led NATO force is now dealing with survivors. At the same time that an amazing discovery is made, a disastrous sequence of events changes the situation for the worst ... and the story progresses from there.The things that impressed me the most were the interesting storyline and suspense. As the movie went on, I become increasingly engaged in the movie and found it hard to stop watching.While the actors were reasonably good, it took some time to get interested in their characters. A big reason for this is that you don't really get a lot of time with the lead characters in the beginning. As time goes on, they start to grow on you.This is not a movie for kids, nor is it a movie for those who don't like horror movies. However, for everyone else, it's definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
90 Minutes Later,"28 Weeks Later is a very dynamic, fast, ferocious and wild movie. And, yes this is true, this one belongs to the kind of films that do not make you think, but, instead, grip and hold you by their tempo and speedy change of events. The sequel to 28 Days Later is also taking place in infected London. The view of the great city, taken by the plague, is breathtaking. All those empty streets, all those neglected parks, all those ruined houses are spellbinding, as well as excellent helicopter shots. Then, there are very, very fast zombies, running all around and looking very frightening. Well, the film is only about 90 minutes long, and this is a rare treat nowadays. What is good, it does not get boring or dull. The fast pace remains throughout and that is a great side. What is bad, somehow, is that method of shooting the scene, when the camera is shaken and stirred all the time, and in some 3 minutes it becomes very inconvenient to watch that blurred sequence of actions. The heroes? Well, the movie is so intense, that they have no time to develop or express themselves at any rate. They either run or chase. The only person you feel sympathy to is that military marksman who gets killed by mistake as he is thought to be one of the infected zombies. His death is so tragic, but his life is so full of heroic deeds that he really evokes sympathy. Watch this film if you want some really intense and condensed action. For some deep and serious pondering, this work is not a good choice.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good sequel, not as good as the first.","28 Weeks Later was a sequel I didn't want to see.The first film was so good in my books, that the idea of a sequel would undermine the whole thing. Fortunately, this film is hugely enjoyable.The set pieces are thumping; the first ten minutes is a relentless siege upon a survivors den. The editing is extremely fast, which hardly gives the viewer any time to see what's going on. You're either going to love this or hate this.The story is pretty good, considering it's a sequel. It revolves around a family - the father (Robert Carlyle), a cowardly figure, who you can actually sympathise with; the daughter, who looks after her brother, who apparently have special blood. I won't spoil any of the film for you, but suffice to say, when the family enter the quarantined district, things get a little out of control.The involvement of American troops is not exactly inspired, meaning that we get some very clichéd military speak, which undermines the whole urban grittiness of the first film. Still, the actors are good and some of the best action sequences come from the military side of things.Overall this is a very good film. It sometimes meanders - the film wanders into gung-ho action flick mode sometimes. But that's not exactly a big quibble - if you want a really entertaining film to see this week, see this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great film, not as good as original, but what is...","Well, I was worried about this, as I gave the original film 10/10, as I think it's going to become a cult classic like the Crow etc...I had nothing to fear... with one of the all time best intro 10 minutes I've ever seen... really stunning filmed and the music taken from the original... believe me, it's breath taking filming.Carlyle is exceptional and was perfect for the role.. with all the other actors in top notch form especially the marine. However, found the boy to be annoying and woeful in his acting ability, which is one of the reasons I've only given a 9/10.The use of the army but not giving it the ""lets kick ass"" typical yank style is refreshing, making them as vulnerable as ourselves in the UK...One of the best soundtracks of 2007, with a great way of making the virus spread again... I was trying to work out how they were going to do it again, from a dog? Cat or something... very very nicely done in a fantastic scene (even if it does steal from the original)...

Brave horror in this era of lightweight movie-making,"Credit to this movie is the fact I'm moved to comment at all. As a hardened horror fan I am seldom moved to do so by todays' safe, formulaic, cookie-cut offerings.I began watching 28 Weeks with modest expectations. The first of this soon-to-be-trilogy excited me primarily as it marked a shift in British output; it didn't have Hugh Grant (aaargh) in it; it was a horror; it was made on a budget. As a movie though, it left me feeling a little under-fed.28 Weeks however is a rawer, meatier dish.Not since the first 11 minutes of Dawn (2004) has an opening segment grabbed my attention and stirred my senses. Sadly, Dawn 2004 quickly put me back to sleep for the remainder, but 28 Weeks faired much better.The first half of this movie is extremely bold and genuinely jarring in parts (how rare is that!). The second half markedly is less so. No spoilers here, but suffice it to say this is almost certainly part 2 of 3. In that context, the less breakneck mid and concluding sections are forgivable, even right and understandable.Not wishing to steal from others observations, but I read a review on here discussing this movie being less character-driven. I wondered how that could be, but having now seen it, I'd say that is not only true, but the core strength of 28 Weeks. It is the virus, the horror of reality, the infected, the breakdown of systems, the American response and ultimately hope for the future that drives this story.Much more than a question of 'how will this character survive?'. The question begs more of 'can this virus ever be stopped?'.From an aesthetic perspective, I was certainly no fan of the high shutter speed, shaky-cam approach to action scenes so prevalent in 28 Days; and unfortunately it's back in force.Used sparingly, this effect does work - giving the viewer a more frantic, discombobulating, brutal sense of the infected, but once again, I found it overused. Perhaps this is now a 'signature effect' for the franchise; but I'd like to see less of it, and at times be given a half a chance to compute what I'm seeing.Many say that the best gore is that made-up by the viewers own imagination, implied gore if you will (as in the infamous 'Reservoir Dogs ear'). For me, part of my enjoyment of horror has always been real FX, real gore, Savini style.It's fair to say 28 Weeks has both. The high-speed shaky-cam quick-cut stuff I'm sure left me thinking I'd seen things I hadn't, but also there was a good portion of honest-to-goodness shock FX. More of the latter and less of the former would be nice for 28/3.Fine acting throughout, especially memorable was young Imogen Poots.Odd name, truly memorable face. Not for a long time have I seen an actress/actor say so much with just expression. From Casualty to (the excellent) V for Vendetta and then this; she's rightly doing rather well for herself.To conclude, I'm now quite a fan of this franchise where before I was a little indifferent. There _will_ be another instalment, and I look forward to it! I hope it retains and builds on the punch of this movie, and with luck, punch hard consistently throughout. Nothing short of a truly shocking climax to this series would do.Watch this movie. Lights out, late at night, volume up. It's a rare beast - - - horror with frights.P.S. Great soundtrack too! 7 / 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 weeks later....the zombified Britain,"I went to the cinema to watch this film last Wednesday. I enjoyed 28 days later and as soon as i knew this was released I had to see it. Wow i was not disappointed. I was on the edge of my seat right from the beginning and genuinely terrified too. The zombies (or infected as they are known in both movies) scared the daylights out of me as they could run, and I mean they could run fast. I'm surprised that most of the characters were able to out run them. I mean unless you are Linford Christie, you would be so wasted of energy if you kept running from these things, but eventually they would get you and kill you. I was mostly breathless throughout this movie as it is very intense and i was nearly screaming at the screen ""run for your lives and don't look back"" because i was so involved with this picture. The director did a great job creating an atmosphere that you never felt safe at all and you easily thought that most of the characters were going to run into these things any minute when they thought they were safe. This film didn't drag at all, the action came thick and fast and it was genuinely terrifying. I mean being from London seeing it a complete ghost town made my hairs stand on end. I do love this movie for it's atmosphere and yes there is a good amount of gore to please blood thirsty horror fans, but it also carries a message and that stands out a mile. If you don't see it then there must be something wrong with you. 28 Weeks Later is basically a British version of Dawn of the Dead (remake) and my opinion is it's much better.

That wasn't what we expected....,"Heavens above, that was intense.This isn't a 'zombie film'. This isn't even a 'horror film'. This is one of the single most disturbing films we've ever seen - and that's saying something.I can't remember the last time either of us, both seasoned horror fans, sat in the car on the way home blatantly trying not to burst into tears. There wasn't a single point where this 'let up' - the original has a great opening and then lost its way, but this never, ever loses it. There are a couple of moments of perhaps unnecessary gore, but the overall effect is so powerful that you will be unbelievably glad to be walking out of that cinema into broad daylight. Within the first ten minutes I was struggling not to weep, and that's really scared me. This was really scare you. See it at the cinema, on a big screen, before it's too late.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good at one thing that matters in horror films: intensity,"Well, I guess I can tolerate the use of ""28 Weeks"" in the title of this film to keep it in line with its predecessor. And overall, it follows its predecessor pretty well, even adding on heaps more suspense throughout the film. In fact, I would have to say this is perhaps the most suspenseful and anxiety-inducing film I've seen in a while. And that's a good thing.In fact, the opening sequence to this film is so packed with nervous intensity, even though nothing out-of-the-ordinary is happening, that I had to grip the seat in front of me out release some of the anticipation. Because you know of the first film, 28 Days Later, you know that you can't have a peaceful cottage anywhere. Rage-zombies will attack. And it will not be pretty. But the players and the direction handle that anxiety so well, that I was still quick shocked by the ferocity of the following events.On the plus side, Weeks manages to avoid the pitfall of Days, that is trying to hold two separate overarching stories at the seams. On the minus side, major plot/story contrivances had me smacking my head in shock and ridicule. That and the overall point of the film is quite, uh, disagreeable. Days managed to tell a zombie apocalypse story very well, but then went into a story about how humanity can be real monsters as well. The switch wasn't very good, but each story holds together well. Weeks tells basically one story of running away from rage-zombies. It could've been that simple and effective, but some things just didn't sit well with me.Without going into detail, certain characters survive when it wouldn't make any sense for them to, and appear in places where by their very appearance, they create a contrivance in the story. Furthermore, the plans of the U.S. Military in crisis situation only partially made sense. Some of the situations created were highly unbelievable and the story had to permit these unbelievable events in order to move forward. But it unfortunately took me out of the film long enough, wondering why things were done that way, that the intensity of the following efforts (that is, the last 2/3 of the film) lost their magic.That's not to say that there weren't moments of genius in the film. I loved the use of darkness and light and a more integrated theme of how humanity can be a big monster. There was at least one set piece in the film that I'd already seen in Grindhouse's Planet Terror piece, which contrasted a little strongly with the otherwise tense zombie escape.The ending further lost me because of how it contradicted many of the events and dialogue in the film. And it's clearly a setup for 28 Months Later, but I suppose being a horror movie, you just had to do something like that. Unfortunately, the ending also cements a series of messages embedded in the film that I found highly disconcerting. These include: authority is always right, never give too much power to the people, life is expendable, life can and should be extinguished to protect the greater public even if innocent, never trust your human instinct to protect others, children are only trouble, among other messages. Weeks is a very nihilistic film and I found that as I watched it and processed the underlying messages behind the events of the film, I disliked it more and more.Still, the film has many merits, including managing to keep the intensity up through the course of the film. It has a powerful sense of menace--you never feel safe during the film, even when the characters appear to be safe. And, in the end, it is very good at doing what horror films do best: instill fear, doubt, dread, shock and terror. It just has to resort to a little contrivance along the way to keep it going. And say some things that I didn't like, but were woven into the situations that were set up. I honestly think that with some smallish changes in the story, entirely more agreeable messages could've come from the story.But as it is, it's a very competent shockfest that doesn't suffer from the slowdown of its predecessor. An aggressive story about running away from rage-zombies. And if you're looking for intensity and the gore, this is a good place to go. Just try to ignore the occasional bits of stupidity. 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dumbed down for American audience,"I was very excited when I heard that the sequel to 28 days was out. My excitement turned to reservation when I heard that Danny Boyle wasn't directing and Cillian Murphy wasn't the lead. But Robert Carlyle did a fine job and Fresnadillo directed in a similar fashion to Boyle anyway.It seemed to me that the story is Americanised not because (Surprise surprise) it was the yanks who come to the UKs rescue, but because to enjoy it or even ""get it"" the US audience needs macho phrases (using their own terms and accent)and US trigger-happy troops shooting the place up. There was plenty joking from us, about the UK being better off with ""RAGE"" than having Dubyas troops over here.This film was dumbed-down for bigger box office earnings in the states and in doing so it lost the story line.It was like watching a London tourist board promo DVD!! IE. come to London and see Canary wharf,the Dome,Greenwich,Millennium bridge,the London eye,Wembley stadium etc etc These landmarks are so randomly located that even with enraged zombies chasing me I'd be unlikely to find my way round them all in a couple of hours. Nevermind a tourist finding their way from a West-End tube station to a North London stadium, in-the-dark, underground and without a gps or map. And while were at it..... how did Carlyle find his son and daughter on a random platform on the other side of London (from the isle of dogs)???? In short, they lost the plot by Americanising but I still enjoyed the ""jumpy"" frights, gore and the ""in a heartbeat"" soundtrack. ""28 days"" was much more believable though.",,Anonymous,Horror
Anarchy in the UK (from Spain).,"It's really nice to see that Britain could offer the world some good horror movies again, and not only social dramas (for festivals) or comedies (for the popular audience) like they passively do since the end of the Hammer company. I don't know why or even exactly when they stopped doing this kind of movie but I was really happy to watch ""Creep"", ""Severance"", ""Dog Soldiers"" or ""Shawn of the dead"" (a comedy, really ?). I have the feeling that those movies tried to rebuild a link to popular horror movie that England lost years ago. It's useless to recall to everyone that the master of suspense himself was born in London and that the best thriller of all time : ""Peeping Tom"" was done by Michael Powell in 1960 in England.Since its very beginning, Danny Boyle seems really attached to this kind of popular culture, trying to expose it in a completely British environment. It's what he accomplishes with the Zombie/Survival movie with ""28 days later"", putting together two American movies : ""The World, the flesh and the devil"" (a late 50 horror classic, witch begins exactly like Boyle's movie, only in New-York City) and Romero's Zombie trilogy (with much more faster Zombies indeed) in a pure British environment. I was a little suspicious when I learn that a sequel will be done without him directing, but as soon as the movie started, my doubts were gone : after a most impressive first scene (that reminds us the talent of Robert Carlyle with a very strong emotional impact), the movie overcomes the first one from an horrific point of view and also manage to deal with Britain most contemporary problems, even if the new director : Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is Spanish.It's useless to search for any plot link with the previous movie : the only common point between the two movies is that they both happened in a dead Britain, infested by the Rage virus. 28 weeks after the contamination, London seems safe again, and some people are allowed to come back in their city, fully protected by the US army. The first part brilliantly use the security system as a part of the editing, showing us a life were intimacy is banned for security reasons. When CCTV (security cameras you'll find in London buses, shops, streets) now almost covers the all town, this metaphor seems to me a acid comments on contemporary Britain. And I'm not even talking about the fact that it's the US army who controls the all city. Horror movies has always been a good field for political point of view, and I think that Fresnadillo uses this field to express a comment about Britain through his survival movie.But don't worry, the movie is also fine when it comes to blood and gore (a little confused in its editing maybe, but the chaotic style adds fear to the horror of the situation), and it's no surprise that the town doesn't stay calm for long, and that the Rage isn't very far in this pessimistic movie. I was at the end very pleased to see an intelligent and entertaining gore movie, particularly an English one, made by a Spanish director (Spain also produced some excellent horror movies this past few years).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is not comparable to 28 Days Later. First off, there is one major difference between the two. They have different directors.

A decent sequel,"I liked 28 Days Later because I have not seen any ""Zombie"" flickes before (I know they aren't technically zombies but whatever), but the scale of the movie was cool.The opening scenes with the main character waking up and walking through an empty city were just brilliant. And it followed up with several strong characters and some good action.For the most part, 28 Weeks Later is successful. It has rightfully been compared to the Alien and Aliens style of sequel.If you have watched any trailers, you will know that the movie is taking place 28 weeks later, and the U.S. military is trying to repopulate England. Of course, this is not successful, and the ""Rage"" virus comes back with a vengeance.This film has been criticized for the ""shaky-camera"" syndome, and in my opinion the ""shaky"" thing takes away from the movie. I want to see what is going on, what that zombie is doing to that person, etc., instead of seeing blurs of body parts and people moving around.There are several really awesome cinematic shots, and the acting is decent for most of the movie.In case you were hoping to see the cast from 28 Days Later reappear you will be disappointed, because no one returns. One thing I did like in 28 Weeks Later was that the military wasn't portrayed as bad as in the first movie.Bottom Line: If you saw the first one see it, but if you didn't and don't want to pony up for a rental for 28 Days Later, it might be worth your time if you like Zombie or Survival type movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 Times Weaker!,"I loved the first film (yes, both halves) but this sequel is just terrible! I tried to like it, but just couldn't succeed. It started out good but soon went down faster than a wire dancer on crack.This film just can't decide whether it wants to be a realistic shocker about a pandemic or a classic horror flick with a deadly villain.Wait, I just used the word realistic in connection with this flick! Shame on me. I'm not one of those people who are always bugging about the tiniest unrealistic things, but this film tries to be taken seriously without taking its audience seriously and the characters stupidity exceeds the one of a fly with a brain tumor.Don't waste your time on this one, there are so many great movies!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent sequel,"A film should always be judged by what it wanted to be in the first place... This film wanted to be a sequel to a very simple horror film. The first film posed the question: ""What happens if and entire country was infected with a zombie inducing virus?"", the sequel looks at the obvious follow on question: ""What happens when the zombies die out?"".28 weeks after the first film concludes, the US army (under the NATO banner) has moved into London to start rebuilding. Exactly as you would suspect, the Virus has been long dormant (presumed dead), and the population is slowly starting to rebuild.Throw in a nicely thought out revival of the virus, some nice if stereotyped characters, and let the fun begin.The movie moves along well (at barely over and hour and a half), characters make all the classic ""oh no"" decisions, it's good gory fun.If you enjoyed the first, then you'll love the sequel.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Bigger, Bloodier, but Messier","Carrying the weight of being the sequel to a cult classic, ""28 Weeks Later"" tries to reinvent itself rather than just repeat the original formula. The directing baton passes from Danny Boyle to Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who brings a more brutal and hopeless approach, keeping the frantic visual style but ramping up the scale of the catastrophe. The idea of exploring what happens after the worst part of the outbreak is a smart move, since few zombie or infected films tackle this post-apocalyptic recovery phase. However, some questionable choices in execution weaken the overall impact, keeping the movie from reaching the intensity of the first one.The setup is intriguing: 28 weeks after the rage virus wiped out the UK, the country is in the process of being rebuilt with the help of the U. S. military, which has established a safe zone in London. People are starting to return, including siblings Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots), who reunite with their father, Don (Robert Carlyle), a man burdened by unbearable guilt for abandoning his wife to save himself. This emotional layer is a great touch, adding a human and tragic perspective to the story-but unfortunately, it gets pushed aside as soon as the chaos kicks off again.Fresnadillo does a solid job building atmosphere. The opening sequence, with Don and a group of survivors hiding out in a countryside house, is electrifying and proves that even after all this time, the infected are still a terrifying threat. The moment where Don faces an impossible decision-stay and die with his wife or run and save himself-carries genuine emotional weight. But when the script tries to turn this personal tragedy into the driving force behind a new outbreak, things start to fall apart. The virus returning through the kids' mother, who carries a rare immunity and is a walking reservoir for the infection, sounds like a good idea on paper, but the execution forces too many coincidences, stretching believability.The action sequences are intense and, at times, brilliant. The stadium attack scene, where the safe zone collapses in a matter of minutes, perfectly captures the sheer helplessness of an uncontrollable outbreak. The chaos of the evacuation-military forces unable to distinguish between civilians and infected, resorting to extreme measures-creates a brutal, all-too-real tension. The moment when London is firebombed to contain the new wave of infection is a striking image, reinforcing that the only viable response is total annihilation. And that's where ""28 Weeks Later"" sets itself apart from its predecessor: while the first film followed characters struggling to survive the end of the world, this one shows that the real horror isn't just the virus-it's how humanity deals with it.The problem is that, to get to this point, the script leans on lazy solutions and characters making absurd decisions. Turning Don into some kind of ""super-infected"" who obsessively hunts his kids across the city, as if he has selective memory, is a prime example. In the first movie, the infected were pure, mindless rage, with no strategy or goal beyond attacking. Here, the script forces an emotional connection between Don and his children even after he's turned into a mindless monster, which doesn't make sense based on the rules previously established.Another questionable choice is how much the movie leans on Andy and Tammy as the driving forces of the plot. They're not only the only kids in post-apocalyptic England, but also the ones responsible for triggering the new outbreak, surviving every impossible scenario, and-on top of all that-potentially holding the key to a cure. This kind of ""special child"" trope rarely works in disaster narratives, and this is no exception. It weakens the impact of events because everything revolves around convenient coincidences, undermining the brutal realism the film tries so hard to establish.That said, ""28 Weeks Later"" still has its strengths. The soundtrack, once again using the iconic theme from the first movie, amplifies the sense of urgency and despair. The cinematography keeps that gritty, documentary-style feel, with a frantic camera that throws the audience right into the chaos. And the decision to take the infection beyond the UK, hinting at a global catastrophe, gives the ending an even darker tone, leaving the door open for a sequel that, to this day, has never materialized.Overall, ""28 Weeks Later"" is a movie that tries to expand on the first one's universe but gets lost in easy shortcuts and over-the-top storytelling. It delivers impressive set pieces and a suffocating atmosphere, but weakens its own concept by breaking rules that had been so well established. It's not a total disappointment-there's tension, impact, and blood spraying everywhere-but there's a lingering sense that, with a little more refinement in the script, it could have been something truly unforgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Infected are back!,"With a slow opening that lulls you in to a false sense of security its not long before we are reintroduced to the infected, the super fast zombies we first met in 28 days later, and all chaos breaks loose. With a pumping soundtrack hordes of the infected attack a cottage where survivors were hiding. Later we are introduced to the only person not to be killed during that opening frenzy, Don (played by Robert Carlyle) who is now a caretaker in an American controlled area of London. It's at this point in the story that we are told that the virus is under control, wiped out and gone for good. As with any horror film worth its weight that is not the case and the infected are back and in the quarantine zone and it's down to the army to try and regain control. One part of that army is their doctor convinced that Don's children may hold a cure to the virus and along with a rogue soldier and some general public they have the task of getting the kids to safety in the face of not only the infected but also an army who believe they have lost control and declare code red, destroy everything. With a keener sense of where it is going compared to the first film the pacing is brilliant, the zombie action is upped and the effects are pretty top notch. There is a great scene in the underground done with night vision which is part 'Blair Witch' and part 'Most Haunted'. There are some not so obvious metaphors for the war on terror and even a thinly veiled 9/11 reference hidden amongst the violence and mayhem. Just like in the first film there are all the familiar sights of London all empty and abandoned adding to the bleakness of the overall feel. The only thing wrong with the film as a whole is the kids who can't act for toffee, I'm not sure why the boy was chosen but I'm guessing his on screen sister was chosen because if you squinted she looked a bit like a young Denise Richards. With a ending in a traditional style leaving it open if anyone wants to pick up the mantle and make another, its over and what you have seen is a good horror film. Not the best but much better than its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
As good as the original,This takes place 7 months after London had been ravaged by a virus that turned people into flesh-eating monsters. Now they're all believed to be dead and some new communities are being set up in certain sections of London. But things slowly go wrong and a new outbreak threatens to occur...The plot may sound kind of vague but I don't want to give it away. If you liked the first one you'll like this. Like the first it's grim and (after a slow start) VERY graphic with extreme blood and gore. The acting is good all across the board and this film has no letup--there's no jokes to lessen the tension. No exactly a fun night at the movies but great for horror fans.My only complaints--I got tired of the nonstop jumpy camera during the attacks (you don't know WHAT'S going on a few times) and the ending was sort of puzzling.Still it's grim and graphic--powerful stuff. I give it an 8.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Think The Zombie Genre Is Dead, Think Again!","Let me tell you i was the worlds biggest skeptic of this movie. From the looks of the trailer I wanted to throw up. The sirens,lighting,fire all looked cheaply done. Boy was I wrong. I went into the theater thinking the zombie horror genre was dead, I left thinking it just evolved. From start to finish the carnage did not stop, unlike other movies it spared no one. It showed humans as they would react in this type of situation. People leaving loved ones to be killed and the army purposely killing innocents just because of a chance of a outbreak. This is a zombie film at its best, bravo 28 weeks later, bravo! This movie surpassed 28 days later and took the ideas and made them better.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rage strikes back,"OK, so yeah, do you want to talk about a scary-a** fright flick? As an American, I'm beginning to pay more attention to British horror. We've seen it plenty of times within the last seven years. Anything fresh off the boat from our closest European allies, people here eat it up. We saw it with ""The Descent"" (2005), ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), ""28 Days Later..."" (2002), and its sequel ""28 Weeks Later"" (2007).British director Danny Boyle (of 1996's ""Trainspotting"") and screenwriter Alex Garland were behind ""28 Days Later..."" where radical animal-rights activists broke into a laboratory and freed monkeys that were infected with the experimental ""rage virus."" If you remember from that film, you remember that the rage virus only takes 30 seconds to infect (critic Roger Ebert noted that a virus that only takes seconds to infect will not make an efficient survivor in the long run because the host population will soon be dead - as will too, the virus, at least according to Darwinian evolution) and once infected, the ""infected"" person becomes a wild, salivating homicidal maniac. The virus completely decimated the British Isles, leaving them to be shut down, quarantined, and we were left to ponder the fates of that film's only survivors.""28 Weeks Later"" only leaves that up to our imaginations...Anyway, 28 Weeks Later after the initial infection, the initial infected have begun to slowly die of starvation. American NATO forces move in to remove the deceased infected, eliminate any surviving infected, look for human survivors, and begin reconstruction. In the film's opening moments we're introduced to a handful survivors who are eventually wiped out, leaving only one to escape the carnage, Don (Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" alumni Robert Carlyle).Don makes it to a military checkpoint, where he is reunited with his two children Andy (Macintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots) and they attempt to start over along with a thousand others in the ""Green Zone"" (sound familiar? Plenty of other terms abound, such as ""Code Red,"" ""Extreme prejudice,"" among others), a U.S. military-controlled section of London with scanning cameras and rooftop snipers. Well, as you know, the calm before the storm passes and the rage virus strikes back with a wicked vengeance, and mass chaos begins once again.I was surprised to find ""28 Weeks Later"" working from the very first opening scene. The film opens with a bloody bang, with the maddening infected banging down doors, chewing on flesh, and massacring any living thing they come into contact with. ""28 Weeks Later"" builds on the militaristic paranoia of modern times to present us with a chaotic scenario that is all too familiar. Down comes society in one fell swoop and everything they worked so hard to achieve is gone. Also, purists will note that the infected ARE NOT zombies. The infected are technically still alive and can be killed as such; they're just... infected, clawing, gouging out eyes, and vomiting bloody innards all over the place.""28 Weeks Later"" does something even more incredible. While one can easily find fault with ""28 Weeks Later"" repeating some of the same plot devices of the first film, it quickly becomes a moot point. In the tradition of some movie sequels, this one surpasses its predecessor in many ways, the least of which is sheer terror and chaos. Make no mistake: this is one intense experience that you're not likely to forget anytime soon. And even as events in ""28 Weeks Later"" prove, surviving the madness is not a sure thing any more than most of us are promised tomorrow.There's a fine cast of brave performers here, the best of which is Robert Carlyle, who doesn't run through the motions of the typical action-horror hero. There are also some fine American performers as well (while American talents were a no-show in the first film). There's Doyle (Jeremy Renner), an American sniper who is forced to abandon his post once the s**t hits the fan, his buddy Flynn (Harold Perrineau) who's a helicopter pilot and then there's also Scarlet (Rose Byrne), a military scientist who makes a startling discovery about the rage virus.The man behind this production is the Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who obviously watched the first film carefully and saw all the areas needing improvement. He skillfully crafts his picture so that everything goes downhill (in a good way) from the start. His hand-held camera really gets into the terror and gives it a slight documentary feel, thus putting the audience right in the middle of the action. It also gets up close & personal into the furious, crimson-dyed eyes of the infected from time to time. The special effects Fresnadillo chose to employ here are as gruesome as they could possibly get, with many disturbing images, violence, and gore that are surely miles ahead of ""28 Days Later..."" There is one moment where fighters fire-bomb a mass section of the Green Zone after the infected have taken over that is particularly affecting. On a lighter note, the best of these special effects sequences has to be when a helicopter goes blades-first into a wall of oncoming infected and... I don't want to spoil the effect.In summation, ""28 Weeks Later"" is one horror flick that takes a look at our modern times and ups the fear and paranoia to almost unbearable levels. Anyone who watches the film will surely be startled by the comparisons but as this film's ending also proves, 28 Days Later... you might as well be prepared.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Decent, if unspectacular, zombie flick","""28 Weeks Later"" picks up where ""28 Days Later"" left off. The virus that's been turning ordinary human beings into flesh-eating zombies has apparently run its course, the infected humans have all died of starvation, and Britain is slowly being repopulated with many of the citizens who fled the scene at the start of the epidemic. One of those returnees is Don (played by Robert Carlyle), who is suffering from survivor's guilt after leaving his wife in a moment of panic to be devoured by the creatures. Or was she? Suffice it to say, it's hard to keep a good virus down and soon London is in the grip of a major new outbreak of the illness. Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots and MacKintosh Muggleton (what a great name!) play various characters who spend the bulk of the movie running for their lives from the menace.Zombie pictures have become such a staple of the horror movie genre that it is hard for anyone to do anything particularly novel or original with them anymore. Zombie bites human, human turns into zombie, new zombie bites another human, and on it goes ad infinitum. That scenario may have been fresh and exciting when George Romero first introduced it to the world in ""Night of the Living Dead"" back in 1968, but it has been diluted through repetition and overuse ever since (partly by Romero himself with his endless, ever diminishing variations on the theme). The one innovation the original ""28 Days Later"" came up with was to speed up the zombies' movements so that they were no longer the lumbering creatures that anyone's 85-year-old granny could easily outrun.""28 Weeks Later"" has some genuinely suspenseful moments and a nice post-apocalyptic feel in its early stretches, but, like its predecessor, it tends to devolve into a tedious shooting-gallery sideshow the longer it goes on. Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's hurdy-gurdy film-making style, which is intended to replicate the chaos and pandemonium of the situation, often leads more to confusion than to clarification for the audience. Still, the movie contains a few cool plot twists and raises some thorny ethical issues, such as whether or not innocent people are to be sacrificed if that means ensuring the safety of the population as a whole. And there is certainly more than enough bloodshed and general mayhem to keep the zombiephiles among us rooted to our seats. Even the undead should have fun with that.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Poor!,"Such a disappointing movie!

Doesn't live up to the expectations,"All in all I found the sequel a let down. First of all, there really are some flaws in the logic: the general states the the virus would not cross species which is exactly how it broke out in the first place. And if it really doesn't where are all the animals? We are told that they are there but we never see them. Would London after about half a year and a couple of million dead people really look like it had been left yesterday? How did the mother survive? Even if she was immune to the virus why wasn't she torn to pieces? And how did the zombie janitor from hell mention to turn up wherever his family was? That's a bit too much of a coincidence. The other thing that I found a bit off putting was that -as opposed to the first part- violence erupted and there was basically no escalation. And at times there was gore for gore's sake. So all in all, the film was well timed, visually a bit too much cutting edge and a thinking man's gore fest. And of course it was a delight to finally see Garfield Morgan back on the silver screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Nice, but...","I just came out of cinema watching this movie with a couple of friends. My feelings about that movie are some kind of divided.One the one hand I expected some kind of stunning zombie-movie, but the zombie-factor isn't that huge. Like ""28 days later"" there are a lot of passages where no zombie appears at all. 28 days later is some kind of road movie in the middle.28 weeks later is more thriller than splatter movie. Of course there is zombie-action, but - and there the movie lost some of it's stars in my rating - the shaking camera is so bumpy that you can hardly see anything. With might work for some movies - like Blair Witch - and might be an interesting thrilling element it did not work for this movie. It is uses too often to work like it is meant to.The set is made well and looks quite realistic (don't know how much CGI is used - and that's a good sign that it is working well *g*).I give a good 6 and I am sure that I will re-rate when DVD-Release is out and I can watch it again on a ""good"" screen *heh*",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as good as the first, but still enjoyable.","28 Days Later, which is the prequel to this film, completely revitalized the zombie genre, in my opinion. The followup, 28 WEEKS Later, is still a very entertaining and scary film, but I find it unanimously inferior to the first film.28 Weeks Later revolves around a man named Don and his two children- Andy and Tammy. The film reveals to us that the Infected have all died of starvation, but in this film, the virus makes an unfortunate return and begins to spread once more in a way that I won't reveal to you, for it would spoil the film.This film takes some unexpected turns and keeps you guessing for the most part, and is a great deal more brutal than the original film.So it's up to you.

"Nice visually and thematically, not as good with acting or storytelling","28 Weeks Later is a good follow-up to the first installment. It keeps the overall theme while still adding something new.While it doesn't look like it was shot on a digital camera (like the 28 days intentionally was), it still manages to look realistic and gritty. The overabundance of shaky-cam though is quite annoying though the more you watch.It has some interesting visuals, some very basic symbolism (I'd even call it ""film school"" symbolism) for most audiences to understand. The music is nice and they have succeded with building up the ""dead city' atmosphere (hence the intercut shots of the city and the graveyard while they are driving through).And while there lots of really good and stylish visuals that many will enjoy, story-wise it doesn't make a lot of sense. The scenes I'm talking about are cool to watch but when you stop and think about one - it crumbles. Also, the acting wasn't that good, Elba had nothing to do in this film, Renner was boring. Carlyle was the only exception cause of how feral he looks while infected. I'm sure that good performances would've made this much better, but it seems like the script wouldn't allow it.Anyway, 28 Weeks Later is a good film (especially if you loved the first one). Give it a deeper look and you might find more than just a zombie film, the director has put lots of stuff in there for you to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best horror movie I have ever seen...,"I am usually not the biggest horror fan. I enjoy seeing a movie that will either make me want to cry, make me want to become a special agent in the military or make me laugh... thats it.A few years ago, when 28 Days Later was released on DVD my friend forced me to watch it and I was so glad he did. The movie was not just a bunch of unrealistic zombies killing everybody in sight, it had human vs. human drama. Once I saw that film, it automatically became tops for me and was my favorite horror movie.Yesterday, I went to go see this movie. I was scared out of my mind before I went to see it mainly because it was a different director and a different writer. If that is the reason you do not want to see this movie, DON'T LET IT BE!

So is this movie a worthy sequel?,"I was a huge fan of the first movie, it was perfect. When I heard about this sequel I felt a hugely disappointedly, when I found out it was about yanks coming over to ""save the day"" I was horrified. I knew in my bones that this would be some cheesy Hollywood action movie with no plot and no grasp of what made the original amazing.When I got hold of a DVD screener I was very, very tempted to not watch it. But against everything I believe in I watched it.The beginning was great, I was very impressed but feared it wouldn't last, and it would be just an intro to tie in the old movie with this American version.After a while, when I realised the intro I was enjoying - that had totally stolen my attention - was in fact the movie, I didn't know how to feel, I had been thinking how bad it would be for years and now sitting here enjoying it, and not just enjoying a cheesy Hollywood version of the original, but an amazing sequel that felt extremely like the first movie.What is great about this movie, is it's almost as though they knew I was going into this movie with certain preconceived ideas of how this movie would be, so they basically give you nothing like you expect, totally immersing you and causing you to feel that the original movie was part 1 of this movie. Then they give you a slice of American cheesiness, causing you to suddenly remember and worry that it might go downhill. But then they turn everything upside down and dazzle you until the end.I totally recommend this movie, without a doubt, and I even encourage you to watch it with fear and expectation of it being another lame Hollywood wannabe, because that's how I felt, and it worked for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

From Skeptic to Fan,"When I first heard about a sequel to 28 Days Later, my first thought was ""Oh boy. Here comes a mess"".

If you get the chance to see 28 Weeks Later, see it. As far as sequels go, it's surprisingly good. Carlisle is quite good as always, but I was surprised at the quality of acting from those around him. The kids in this movie are great, especially Imogen Poots who eats up the camera. While the attack sequences felt a little choppy, the script, the cinematography, and the story more than made up for it.

There are also a few more horror scares. This film does feel more violent where we see more gore.

Average Film,"Please understand that I am a fan of horror films, and am often annoyed at how they often appear to be flamed, purely as they are part of the horror genre. However, I think it is highly debatable if 28 weeks later is a horror film at all, or actually an action film. There is much less suspense in 28 days as opposed to 28 weeks, which appears to have been dropped in favour of sporadic moments which make you jump (only one of which actually succeeded with me). Additionally, the characters appear less fulfilled in 28 weeks than in its predecessor, although the concept of following a family, with all of the issues this creates, was a good one. The infected themselves also do the film well, with very good acting and actions, vastly superior to those in other zombie films. The film is however let down by the main cast, which feel under developed, and often not well acted. Additionally, the plot was weak, and although some ideas (around the start of the film) were very good, they were rapidly brushed over in favour of lots of running from the latter half of the film onwards. It is however, a zombie film at heart, and for fans of the genre, is well worth a watch, despite not meeting the bar set by 28 days, it holds its own within the zombie genre, and is as such, worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The first one had some original elements in the Direction but poor choices in the scenario which I feel like it is the opposite here.

A Tense Sequel With a Few Bumps Along the Way,"""28 Weeks Later"" brings the intensity of its predecessor back in full force-but with a few twists and turns that, for me, weren't entirely smooth. The film kicks off strong with the chaos of the initial outbreak, which immediately sucks you into its nerve-wracking world. The whole setting of post-apocalypse London is still chillingly effective, and I was hooked by the uncertainty and the sheer brutality of the infected.One character I really liked was Tammy-her tough yet vulnerable nature made her stand out as someone who was trying to hold onto her humanity, despite the madness around her. The relationship between her and her brother Andy had a decent emotional layer that helped ground the chaos. But Andy? Ugh, he irritated me a bit with his decisions-though I get the whole ""desperate situations make people act out of character"" thing, I couldn't help but wonder if he made some pretty dumb choices that just pushed the plot into unnecessarily frustrating directions.The action sequences are top-notch, no complaints there. The sense of dread is maintained beautifully through pacing, and the infected are still terrifying. But where it stumbles a bit is in some of the plot contrivances-there are moments where things feel a little too convenient, or where characters' decisions don't quite make sense in the grand scheme. It's one of those movies where you start questioning characters' motivations a bit too much, which kind of breaks the immersion.What really worked for me, though, was the ending. It had just the right amount of punch to it-definitely left me thinking long after the credits rolled. I think that's what keeps the film from being just another ""zombie flick""-it offers something with a bit more depth when you look at the broader implications. It's not perfect, but it gets points for atmosphere and for keeping things tense enough to make you want to look away but somehow keep watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grabbed me by my nostrils and never let go...,"Well, as a mild fan of the first movie, I was quite sure what to expect with this one. I was surprised to find that the movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire duration. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this movie which is surprising because I always have something bad to say about a movie. The acting was absolutely stellar, the overall intensity of the movie never let up, it was just one gigantic adrenaline rush from start to finish. A few good moral points are brought into question without the stench of cheese being detectable. Whoever wrote this film new what they were doing. A nice change actually. Go and see this movie.

"a sequel we didn't need, but wasn't terrible.","As far as Horror movies go I usually stay away from sequels etc as they rarely live up to their expectations and this was no exception.

If you liked the first movie then I do not see the point in spoiling your love by watching this movie.

fast paced thrill ride with a heart,"I loved this movie, it was fast paced and filled with action, but not only that, you really feel for all of the characters. I wasn't a huge fan of the first film but the second film really validated it for me. There's some awesome action that includes not only guns and poisonous gas followed by flame throwers but also an air attack and a helicopter tearing a crowd of infected to shreds.And the best part are those sudden flashes of horror when you aren't expecting it,(I jumped a few times). It may be the fact that I'm an American whose served in the US Air Force, but I really loved how they brought the US troops into Britian to help maintaine order. You are so unaware of any distinction between the two cultures because you're so focused on the human factors, no one wants to die no matter where you're from.I see a lot of movies and I'm usually a skeptic, but I found myself really loving this film. I saw it twice today!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Built well upon the first!,"It's quite impressive how the sequel managed to amp up the action with an abundance of guns and explosions, all while staying true to the tone set by the first movie. It was just as gripping and effective as a zombie horror piece.The sound design is absolutely phenomenal, and even though the editing can be a bit chaotic at times, it alleviates the suspense.However, the character development is where I feel it fell short to some extent. Having talented actors like Elba, Renner, and Byrne, only to not capitalise on their potential and deliver well-rounded characters, feels like nothing but a missed opportunity to me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good sequel with some minor flaws.,"28 Weeks Later follows up on Danny Boyle's classic superbly. More action, Check. More thrills, Check. Eerie atmosphere, Check. Gripping plot, Check. Terror and suspense, Check. Gore a-plenty with blood, Check. Everything you loved about the first film is cranked up a notch, but not too much that it becomes overbearing. The many parallels between this movie and current events are vaguely sprinkled throughout: giving more realism throughout. However, there's not enough character development as the first one had and the dialog is a little flat and forced but still rockin' nonetheless. 28 Weeks Later serves up another delicious dish of post-apocalyptic survivalist mutant mayhem. Check it out!!! I smell a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good film,"28 days later is at war with Shaun of the dead for my favourite zombie movie (yes I know they aren't zombies, but they may aswell be) and although I don't think that 28 weeks later is as good, it still holds up in its own way
The film is good in different ways from its predecessor, there is a lot more spectacle in this one if that's what you are looking for. But I find the more personal and human approach of 28 days personally, it makes the surroundings and threats a lot more disturbing honestly
That's probably why the opening is the best part of 28 weeks because it is absolutely terrifying. In fact I would consider it one of the best moving openings (at least in a horror) along with others like Jaws. It's also better than the already great opening of 28 daysI can't say which to watch. In my opinion the first is better, but just like alien and aliens, it's apples and oranges. It is a unique franchise that I would still like to see a third entry to.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Fine Follow Up!,"Adrenalized charged follow up to ""28 Days Later, ""28 Weeks Later"" may not have the formers stark eeriness of waking up to a empty London, or at least what is thought as a empty London, but it more than makes up for it in action. It more than makes up for it in terror. It may not have the character development of the former, but it's storyline of a family tore apart from the ""Rage"" virus is definitely heartening & angering at the same time. It's story of the bond of a brother & sister is very moving, well acted & executed.Yes, the two movies are different, but in many ways equal. Danny Boyle is not at the directors helm for this one, but new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo infuses the film with his own brand of maniacal mayhem. The editing is fasted paced, more so than the first. The storyline of the US Military overseeing the survivors of the virus is a interesting & logical one. The sense of fear & terror are well done, especially the subway scene.All in all this film stands on it's own very well as a major contribution to it's genre. When all it's parts are summed up, it's a great sequel, though not quite as profound as ""28 Days Later,"" nor anywhere as complex in character development, hence just a tad inferior, but in a over-saturated genre of Zombies & Zombie like humans, ""28 Weeks Later"" is a highly recommended terror fest!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Weeks and Weeks,"Set six months after the events of '28 Days Later...', the rage virus is thought to be under control until another unexpected outbreak occurs in this sequel to the Danny Boyle horror film. With a plot description like that, '28 Weeks Later' might sound like a shameless copy of its predecessor, but it is actually refreshingly different during its first half with helicopter shots of a deserted London in ruins and lots of bureaucratic issues as various soldiers try to control the re-population of the city. Robert Carlyle is also saddled with a curiously morally ambiguous main character who we see abandon his wife early on in a desperate attempt to survive a zombie attack. The second half of the film is nowhere near as solid its the build-up though as the movie descends into mindless zombie attacks that never really resonate that much since Carlyle's kids here are never quite as interesting or well developed as the main characters of the original movie. The ending certainly leaves a bit to think about in terms of how our humanity may end up only making things worse were a zombie plague ever to come our way, though the way it paves way for a potential third movie to come is very unsubtle.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable MOVIE,"The first part is in reaction to low rated reviews, after that i'll discus the movie, so if you've never seen it, skip that part.Before I begin I want to say a few things in reaction to some of the very low rates this movie got (like ones and two's). Please remember that it is a MOVIE, so stop comparing a movie to how things would happen in real life ! I mean come on, of course it is not realistic that they are repopulating after 2 months. But ehm, the whole virus is unrealistic as hell, so why bothering giving this movie a 1 for not being realistic?Now the movie.The movie has a constant sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-and-jump-up-every-now-and-then rush. Especially in the first half of the movie you will see much creepy things. The empty streets are again very effective to make it even more creepy. At some point in the movie 2 kids do plenty of odd things even a grown up would not accomplish in a life time , but that does not make the film annoying or anything. There is very much gore but it affects the movie perfectly well. It's certainly not overdone even though I'm not a huge fan of gore.The second half of the movie kind of repeats what was happening before, again with pretty odd moves on humans side, and a few clichés (Car won't start... do they have to put that in almost every movie??), but it doesn't ruin the movie.The ending is clearly made for an sequel but I thing everybody expected that even before seeing the movie (at least, I did. 28 months and then of course 28 years, I would bet on that). Anyway, the ending although made for a sequel did satisfy me.I recommend this movie for all thrill movie seekers. It's a pretty good sequel of a pretty good first movie. Oh and before I forget, good acting (for most of it). Most horror movies are all about screaming and running and although that is also added in this movie (doh), other emotions are well placed and not stretched for to long.I'm curious how everything is going to develop in the next sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very scary and visionary follow up,"28 Days Later was a jumpy, clever thrill ride which found a patient who woke up in an abandoned hospital and proceeded to discover a barren wasteland that was once London. It was all abandoned... that is, except for hundreds of infected people with ""Rage"", a virus which spreads through the blood in seconds and turns a person into a savage zombie. It was totally f***ing scary and completely believable.Fast forward ""28 Weeks"" after that incident, and the viewer finds themselves once again in London, only this time American soldiers have moved in and done some reconstruction, sealing off the city except one small part where survivors of the outbreak can repopulate. After a narrow and terrifying attack, a young man is reunited with his children, and with the promise of no more infection from the military, everything seems to be getting back to normal. Wrong.In a clever plot twist which I won't give away, the virus manages to sneak its way back into the hopeful community, and within a matter of minutes the horror is plaguing innocent people in the most brutal way. Gore is splashed on thick and director Juan Carlos Fresnidilla keeps the pace fast and the cinematography slick. Although the editing is choppy and incoherent in some parts, overall ""Weeks"" is captured quite brilliantly, taking on a whole new style from the masterful first. As equally scary as its predecessor and with a very effective ending, ""Weeks"" scores where the first one did on a truly scary level.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"WOW , welcome 2008","28 Days Later is probably my bleak out look on the future. After watching the first movie which was great I thought why not check out this one (after I did not get round to watching American Gangster). I was however pleasantly surprised with the sequel which from the trailer really looked like a badly made version of Resident Evil 2. The story picks up ...28 weeks after the first infection of the Rage virus and with the aid of the US (who for once seemed to do the right thing) but as it happens just when you thought it was safe to enter London again ! the Rage Virus returns with a vengeance! 28 Weeks Later is what a apocalyptic genre should be about , it waste no time to deal with silly little sub-plots . The action was clear and precise , with gore probably this time more than the first film . Robert Carlyle was in pure top form for his role along with all the other cast and crew members especially the 2 youngsters who impressed greatly . My only complaint is that the camera work was a little shoddy from time to time and I felt that things moved a little too quickly in some places as I would love to have seen an expansion on a few things but giving the severity of the situation I was willing to let that go. Nobody can say they are fan of Zombie/apocalyptic movies unless they have seen this movie , It easily overtakes the Resident Evil Genre and in one or two ways I liked it more than Land Of The Dead but remember this is by no means a feel good typical Hollywood movie , but having said it is thrilling and entertaining. I have also just heard that Danny Boyle has announced he wants to do a third one so I am truly looking forward to what happens next , HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!28 WEEKS LATER : 8.7 OUT OF 10IT ALL BEGINS AGAIN !",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
We're going to Wembley. Que Sera Sera.,"Sitting at the top of my alphabetical list of the films on Disney Plus, I watched ""28 Weeks Later"" having watched ""28 Days Later"" for the first time in a while, a few months earlier. That film I felt was more interesting and important now, than especially entertaining. This sequel improves visually on the original but is perhaps a more traditional zombie story.With The UK lost to the virus, the infected have control. As they begin to die of starvation, a US led NATO force establishes a strong hold in the Canary Wharf area of London. 28 Weeks later, with a proper safe zone established, UK residents begin to return home. Don (Robert Carlyle) managed to survive the attack, though had to abandon his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) to do so. His children are among those returned to London, and quickly decide to sneak out of the safe zone and return to their family home.As I say, it's a fairly standard zombie storyline here. It's not ""humans are the worst"" so it must be ""Containment failure"" and it's not unsurprising when, for all their military confidence, the system doesn't have enough flexibility for them to actually save themselves. It's fine, but perhaps a little uninspired.The cast of this is really strong though, aside from Carlyle and McCormack, Imogen Poots is their daughter, Idris Elba, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner and Harold Perrineau are the key members of the US Military working in Canary Wharf. Visually the film is stronger than the original, I don't mean in terms of cinematography (nothing beats those scenes of Murphy alone in central London). But that first film was filmed on a standard definition digital camera and this uses high definition ones.Probably superior to the first film in a couple of areas, but ultimately not as important or revolutionary. I'm still waiting on ""28 Months Later"".",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great Sequel, as good as original","This movie was not really a direct sequel of the first in any aspect except it takes place after the evens of the first movie. However, there are no characters from 28 Days Later in this movie, and there seems to be no mention of them either. This movie also has a different plot. In 28 Days Later, the plot was basically survival; run from the infected and find a safe place to hide. Here, it's been 28 weeks since the events of the first movie occurred, and people are now being allowed to move back to London under military supervision in order to start over again. ALso after the epidemic begins, we see a new style of survival techniques that were not in 28 Days Later. The main characters here are 2 kids whose parents were left behind during the evacuation of the country in the first film; Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) come back and find their dad, Don (Robert Carlyle) alive after he abandoned his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack). We also get to meet a few soldiers here, Sgt. Doyle (Jeremy Renner), Major Scarlet (Rose Byrne), and Doyle's friend, a helicopter pilot named Flynn (Harold Perrineau). The cast is very good here, the effects are excellent and the story was very unique. This movie ties with the first on my list, fans of 28 Days Later should see this movie; 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good stuff, just what was it?","The first 28 Days Later was great. It was a unique alteration of the standard zombie movie. This one is more of the same, although perhaps not quite as good.This movie is scary and entertaining. My main complaint is that you can't tell what the heck is going on during the action sequences. I know, I know, that's the style, but still! The camera is so jerky and the editing so rapid that you can't even tell who is getting killed or how they are getting killed. I think an infected person just vomited blood on somebody, but I'm not sure.

"Not as good as the first, but still worth watching","Nobody can run forever.Surviving the first wave of the undead is anything but easy, but what I like to wonder about when I watch these sorts of films has to do with how the living might rebuild after things have calmed down again. About seven months is enough time to clear out buildings, beef up security, and start thinking about moving survivors back into town.The military hasn't always been shown in the best light in the zombie genre, so I was intrigued to see how it would handle the reclamation of London and the return to something that vaguely resembles normal life. People need more than food and water to survive. Having something else to live for is also important, although I'll leave it up to other viewers to see how needs other than the most basic ones may have been approached in this universe.One of the unexpectedly funny moments happened in one of the earliest scenes when a few NATO military forces realized that two children had been given clearance to move back into London. Existing in what until quite recently zombie territory wasn't a problem, apparently, but a preteen and a teenager standing quietly in line were enough to send these hardened soldiers into a panic. I loved the way this scene played around with the audience's and the soldiers' expectations of what should and shouldn't be frightening in a post-zombiepocalypse setting.I did find myself wishing that some of the gory scenes could have been replaced or rewritten to include more character and plot development. While there were a few exciting twists in those areas later on, exploring those moments in greater detail would have made this a five star film for me. Yes, zombie tales in general are almost certainly going to be bloody and graphic as that comes with the territory, but I need something more substantial mixed in with all of the chomping and chasing in order to keep me hyped up for the next instalment.With that being said, these developments did make me look at previous scenes in a different light and helped to explain what I originally thought was a massive plot hole involving a character who had some terrible luck in one of the earliest scenes. There's nothing like being pleasantly surprised as a viewer just when you think you probably have everything figured out, and that's a big part of the reason why I keep coming back for more.28 Weeks Later made me wonder what could possibly happen in 28 Years Later!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining but annoying at the same time,"Not the highest quality film, but entertaining nevertheless.Worth watching but have your remote control handy - if you turn the sound up to hear the conversations of the people in the non-frantic scenes, your ears will be blown off when a zombie attacks.This is an effective way of startling the audience, but I think they've overdone the volume ranges. If normal conversations are at volume 5 out of 10, rage attacks are at volume 15 out of 10...The ending is also very poor - setting you up for a third movie - 28 Months Later anyone?This was one of those movies I started watching, was tempted to turn off, but then got interested enough to see it to the end.Not a movie suitable for small children or those with heart complaints...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

#77,"This film, the sequel to 28 Days Later, takes place six months after the initial outbreak. With the rage virus seemingly eradicated-its infected victims having starved to death-US soldiers establish a safe zone in the British Isles and begin repopulating the area with returning British refugees. However, the temporary peace is quickly destroyed when one refugee ventures outside the zone and comes into contact with a carrier of the virus, threatening to reignite the outbreak and undo all that has been rebuilt. Overall, due to the evocative returning score, unique and innovative scenes (unlike anything seen before in a zombie feature), intense, gory, and violent sequences, and the gripping, masterful opening 12-minute segment (which could stand alone as a short film and serves as a perfect reintroduction to the franchise), this movie is quite good, and although there are some very dark sequences with excessive shaky camera work and flashing images, and the film tends to prioritize large-scale action over developing or deepening our attachment to its characters (unlike the previous installment), leaving it at times feeling incomplete, and like the original, it concludes on an unsatisfying cliffhanger (one that, as of now, has been retroactively erased), I still enjoyed my time with it and while it's a step down from its predecessor, it still offers enough intriguing moments and moral depth to be a fun and successful sequel, and I'm looking forward to the new trilogy, starting with the upcoming 28 Years Later.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nice surprise: as good if not better than 28 days,"Gripping and intense, your mileage might vary but I think I preferred this one to the original which was already pretty great.

The camera work is nervous and bold yet keeps similar aesthetics to 28 days even though it's made by a different director. The storyline was very suspenseful filled with powerful moments and difficult moral decisions.It's also quite thought-provoking regarding the American military.

The Virus Reborn,"28 Weeks Later, directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, is the intense and action-packed sequel to 28 Days Later. Set six months after the outbreak of the Rage virus, the film follows the military-led efforts to repopulate London and contain the virus. However, when an infected survivor (Robert Carlyle) unknowingly reintroduces the virus to the area, chaos ensues once again. While 28 Weeks Later delivers on the thrills and gore, it doesn't quite capture the same emotional depth or atmosphere that made its predecessor so impactful, but it still stands as a solid and enjoyable zombie horror film.The performances in 28 Weeks Later are strong, particularly Robert Carlyle, whose portrayal of Don, a man wracked with guilt after abandoning his wife during the initial outbreak, adds a layer of emotional conflict to the film. The young leads, including Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton as the children of Don and his wife, bring a sense of innocence and vulnerability to the story, which further heightens the stakes as they are thrust into the chaos. While the characters are better developed than in many horror sequels, the emotional resonance of the first film is missing, and the characters often feel secondary to the relentless action.Fresnadillo's direction is fast-paced and brutal, bringing a more action-oriented approach compared to the slow-burn horror of 28 Days Later. The film's opening sequence is one of the standout moments, offering a harrowing depiction of the virus's impact on a group of survivors. The tension and terror are palpable, and the infected-who are faster and more relentless than ever-create a terrifying sense of danger. The cinematography and special effects are top-notch, with the desolate streets of London providing a haunting backdrop for the chaos and carnage that ensue. The film's use of tight shots and shaky camera work amplifies the urgency and confusion of the situation, putting the audience right in the middle of the action.However, while 28 Weeks Later excels in action and intensity, it lacks the same emotional depth and character-driven storytelling that made the first film so effective. The focus on survival and the fight against the infected takes precedence, which results in a more superficial exploration of the themes of human nature and societal collapse. The film's tone is also somewhat uneven, as it shifts between moments of intense horror and action to quieter, more reflective scenes that don't quite land with the same emotional weight. The ending, while thrilling, feels abrupt and leaves some narrative threads unresolved.In conclusion, 28 Weeks Later is a highly engaging and action-packed sequel that provides plenty of horror and suspense, but it doesn't quite live up to the emotional depth and atmospheric dread of its predecessor. For fans of the genre and those who enjoyed the first film, 28 Weeks Later is a satisfying, though not groundbreaking, follow-up with enough tension and terror to keep you hooked.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Spectacular direction in exceptional horror thriller,"In the sequel to 28 days later, the rage virus has passed, the infected have all died and Americans come to England to restore the country.28 days later showed the true ideology of horror, and British cinema at its best, and 28 weeks later outshines its predecessor with faster direction, closer looks at characters and a more action thriller typed genre to its plot.Following on from the dramatic ideology of 28 days with the infected was brilliant, and we start by looking at another family who are hiding, in the complete darkness. The narrative never lacks, with the whole concept of danger keeping you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Not necessarily scary, but it will definitely play on your mind. The ending with the new stadium felt like a marketing promotion, but was still good to watch. The plot has action, suspense and drama, to make an ultimate thriller, with plenty of gory blood encoded for dramatic effect, which is helped along by stunning direction.Danny Boyle's direction in 28 days was superb, unusual and different, particularly the opening sequences as the central character is alone in England, with the character a little man in a huge city.Fresnadillo's direction in this sequel is equally impressive, using similar shots to create the lonely and deserted effect. In contrast Fresnadillo's direction is faster and less focused, especially when the infected are involved, conforming brilliantly to the horror thriller genres. These films wouldn't have had the same impact if this style of direction hadn't been encoded, and is a film where you can really appreciate the atmospheric view of the situation.Having Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting) star gave the film the extra credit it needed, with a fine performance as Don. He did exceptionally well, and gave a different and intriguing portrayal as a struggling family man. Carlyle is helped along by stunning performances by all cast, but in particular Muggleton and Poots, who play Don's kids, two of the best young performances you will ever see in a British film, only behind Tom Turgoose in This is England.28 weeks later is a fine sequel, fast and flowing, and though not necessarily scary, is a thoroughly entertaining British film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I like it more than Days Later.,"I really like this movie a lot and is a great sequel. The opening does a great job of setting up the movie with its tone and suspense with showing the infected people. It really shows how dangerous these infected people are, even though Don doesn't make a good first impression. I really like the setting on how the military made a safe zone for the survivor and how their prepared for dangers. The actual plot is pretty great, with Don kids coming to visit him and deciding to sneak out of the safe zone to return to their former home. That's when things become trouble when they encounter their alive mother, who turns out to be a carrier of the virus. After one dumb decision by their father, that's when the infected raised inside the safe zone, and the military decided to kill everyone. It's pretty typical for the military to do these types of things from other zombie media, but that is when the movie becomes suspenseful. The movie shows there's a lot of dangerous stuff in it like the infected, the military, big explosion, and nerve gas. It becomes suspenseful with the characters trying to survive against these things and doing their best. And the ending is pretty chilling.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A different but still good sequel,"This action packed sequel is set about 6-7 months after the virus broke out when all the infected people have died of starvation and it is completely safe to re-populate London right? Well at least that's what Don (Robert Carlyle) hopes after he narrowly escapes from a house full of infected people.Whilst the military are trying to re-populate London Don is re-united with his children, Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Macintosh Muggleton.)
After the tense chase scene where Don narrowly escapes the film slows down a bit until Tammy and Andy decide to sneak out of the militarized zone to their parent's old house so they can get a picture of their mum. But they find out that their Mum (Alice - Catherine McCormack) has somehow survived and is still living in their old house.After running some tests the military find out that Alice is a carrier of the Rage virus and doesn't show any symptoms but has the ability to infect others. This is proven when Don kisses her and gets infected. The virus then breaks out and shortly afterwards the military decide that everyone is a threat whether they are infected or not and they start gunning them down . Luckily for Tammy and Andy a doctor who works with the military decides that their blood could hold a cure to the virus because their mum is a carrier. And now it's up to this doctor, a soldier called Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and a few survivors to get Tammy and Andy to safety and avoid the military and the infected at all costs.Like it's prequel this film is filled with plenty of action but as well as scenes where people narrowly escape getting infected there are also scenes where people come very close to getting hunted down by the military.One scene that stands out is when the survivors see a sniper on a roof and one of them has to run in a zig zag so the sniper will expose himself and then Doyle can shoot him.It's scenes like this that make this film more of an action/horror than just a horror which is what the prequel was and I think this is why some people don't like it, because they try to compare to the first film, but I don't think you can compare it because they are different types of films.But there are some things that I don't like for example Andy and Tammy make it seem far too easy to get out of the ""safe"" part of London. Also when Don gets infected there are a few times when he sees his kids and pauses before chasing after them and I think this makes him seem too human and less like the murderous zombies that the other infected seem like.But overall I enjoyed this sequel and can't wait for the next instalment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Applauses!,"28 Weeks Later, together with 28 Days Later, is another current masterpiece. Even being two movies setting different stories and time, the continuity idea of this movie fits perfect with the first one because all the elements of 28 Days Later are there... but improved. Knowing that Danny Boyle was there all the time working together with the director, writers and all of the cast and rest of crew members is fantastic, it's a plus to admire more and more his work and professionalism and to believe that this movie could not be described better than one of the best sequels to be placed together with other classic ones as Aliens (1986), T-2 (1991) among very few others. As the first one, it's also not original, but it has all the qualities that a movie like this should always have.While 28 Days Later has a classic horror feeling because it follows the steps of classical horror movies like those ones from the George A. Romero's first ""dead"" trilogy, 28 Weeks Later elevates it to a truly survivor horror, something that Resident Evil games did quite well, and also was a precursor of this style, but never achieved that objective with its shameful movie trilogy made for the masses. Alike the previous one, 28 Weeks Later is not all about action and deadly virus, it's also critical and realistic with the governments, civilians and military, and all of this criticism is the heart of entire movie.Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did an AMAZING job researching and adding some of the strong elements of the first movie to the plot, creating a sequel straight faithful to the original but also giving personal touches to it. The actors and the characters are awesome because when you're finally connecting and sympathizing to any one of them, the character suddenly dies, which makes the audience capt the feeling of loss that all the characters have during entire story, and that's simply amazing.Applauses!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nicely done,"I wasn't a big fan of the first film, 28 days later, I thought it had some wonderful visuals in it, but ultimately I just didn't find it gripping enough in the drama. Although I did enjoy the early action sequences with the zombies which were well filmed and frightening. Maybe I've just seen to many zombie movies to have felt that it was so surprising, I remember the Italian ones from the seventies and then later films like Demons (although not strictly zombies it may as well have been) So I didn't hold out much hope when I saw this and I have to say I loved it. I thought it had a great dramatic centre to the film and I was totally fascinated by Robert Carlyle's character and situation. I became involved in finding out what would happen to him and his children in this post apocalyptic world. If you didn't like the first, I would still give this one a go.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A stellar sequel to a great movie.,"I thought 28 Days Later... was great. A breath of fresh air and a thoughtfully entertaining horror flick. So it's not lightly that I say that I think 28 Weeks Later is even better.The only thing that's missing from the original is the parallel between the rage virus inflicted attackers and the brutality and rage of the main male character and his enemies, at the end of the movie. Everything else is just as good, or improved.Well, everything except the one specific zombie who seems unnaturally intelligent and obsessed with two characters in the movie. Super Zombie didn't fit at all into the ""rules"" of the movie, and seemed like an unnecessary plot device. That minor complaint is virtually my only one, though.28 Weeks is brutal, intense, and more frightening than its predecessor, with the scenes in the crowded parking garage and the pitch black subway tunnel REALLY standing out. The simple story moves along briskly, with no superfluous moments to distract from the tension. The tone is understandably different (there is a new director, after all), but I don't think that the slight change hurt the movie at all. I loved the cast, and the ending is one of the best I've ever seen in a movie of this kind.Any time that I feel like a movie went by too quickly, I know it's a fantastic one. And that's exactly the impression that 28 Weeks Later left me with, even the second time around. It's less deliberate and more action-focused than 28 Days, but only the most stringent fan of the first movie will have an issue with that.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best zombie movie ever? No. Gory over-the-top zombie movie? Yep.,"Here is '28 Weeks Later': an over-the-top and graphic zombie movie that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination.As a horror movie, expect countless people spitting blood and gore shattering at the screen.As a zombie movie, expect red eyed, rage infected people gouging out their victim's eyes and leaving nothing behind but gore, gore, and more gore.This movie takes the somewhat goriness of the first movie and multiplies it by 10.Yeah, it's a pretty violent movie, but it's also a well-made movie that both horrifies and entertains.It's not quite as good as '28 Days later', but it does enough brutal violence and never-ending gore that makes this movie a real reason why people go see these movies in the first place.Waiting for '28 Months Later'.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"28 Days Later, But With A Bigger Budget","This film is essentially a retread of the lower budget first film, but with a different tone. While the first one had a theme of love inspiring hope to starve out rage, this one aims to appeal more towards entertainment, leaving the lofty ambitions of its predecessor alone and instead seeking to treat you to a chaotic thrill-ride through London. Its imagery is more lingering than the first one, which felt more visceral and raw, while the sequel feels more subdued in its grit but expanded in its scope.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The virus is back...,"This shocking sequel to Danny Boyle's 2002 box-office smash is a devastating assault on the senses from start to finish. The downbeat tone of the original is retained as we see Don (Robert Carlyle) escape from the infected ""rage-virus"" victims by going to London's Isle Of Dogs, where all survivors are kept safe in quarantine. Upon arrival, he meets his two children and later his wife - who he had previously presumed dead. She, however, is infected and soon infects her husband as well - leading to a frenzied outbreak at the Isle. The fast-paced gritty action has a discomforting realism - echoing Romero's ""The Crazies"" - which places the film amongst the best of it's kind.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Suspenseful sequel.,"The first thing I noticed was the good acting. After a great opening scene, the film is a roller coaster ride of fun and excitement, with wonderful action sequences and awesome visuals. I actually enjoyed this sequel more than the original. The plot has more depth, and is more suspenseful, as well. The scene where a helicopter dives into a swarm of zombies was awesome!! Jeremy Renner is a likable hero, as usual, and the rest of the cast was equally good and likable. The zombie make-up was quite frightening, actually. The film has a fantastic score, as well. This was an incredible thrill-ride. Bloody fantastic, I say!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bit sloppy,"28 Weeks Later packs almost the same rage-infected punch of the original. While the camera work is a bit sloppy and the storyline is fairly predictable at times, there are some genuine moments of shock and terror in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Surprisingly Good Sequel.,"28 Days Later was a suspenseful, atmospheric and thrilling addition to the 'zombie' genre. At least until the third act, when the film loses it's direction and ultimately failed to reinvest interest. I put zombie in quotes because any fan of the film will tell you they are not zombies, just infected people with a virus. When I heard that a sequel was coming out, I figured it would be even worse because a sequel being better than the original is rare, specifically in this generation of film-making.28 Weeks Later furthers the story, this time with new characters. The virus is gone and re-population has begun. The American army is in charge and have everything under control. That would seem like a boring movie, so of course they have to have the virus come back and wreck havoc. Which it does. In a very lame way I might add.The film opens with an attack on a house, this is the highlight of the film. The film never reaches the same height of excitement as this, but it does keep the viewer interested. I was never bored and found that it did work well as a sequel. It doesn't have the same feel as the first. All the atmosphere that made the original good is gone here. I felt more threatened by the infected in the first because it was them against ordinary people. Here, we have guns, helicopters and apparently tons of napalm.In one scene the soldiers bomb half the city, it looks cool, but seems ineffective, they later use gas that seems to kill everyone in sight. My question is why not use this gas first, it sure as hell beats out blowing up half the city. Small things like this are all over this film. Lead a bunch of civilians into one room for 'protection'. Of course this is one room in which the infected gain access, other people are left unguarded and creatures run around unnoticed in this government building. These things aside, the film is really well done and very enjoyable. It serves the genre well and is ultimately more enjoyable then the first.Boyle acts as producer this time around, so the feel of the film is not all that different and the film does offer some intense moments. There is one sequence in which our characters go underground to the subway system. It's totally dark and one uses night vision from a rifle to see. They filmmakers use this to show us exactly what she sees, in a first person type of way. Very effective and scary.The gore has been turned up a notch, with more blood splatter and a severe beating of one person that may turn some stomachs. There is another scene in which they use the blades from the helicopter to make quite a mess.This is an entertaining sequel that manages to actually be better, albeit not by much, to the original. It adds new elements, but doesn't necessarily take the story into new directions. It is better than one would expect.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
2007's Best Film Hands Down!,"I saw this film in a free preview, but this was the movie I wanted to see the most this year!

More than Spiderman 3 and Pirates of The Caribbean 3.

The end of the film is quite a shock, and it alone is worth the £7.50 entry fee.Robert Carlye shines on screen, even with the US Army being in a pivotal role, they also shine. 28 Weeks later I would recommend to any film goer, even fans of Spiderman or Pirates of The Caribbean, you'll understand why it was one of the biggest films of this year and why so many have waited for it's release!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
more of the same good stuff,"I enjoyed ""28 Weeks Later,"" even though it felt exactly like ""28 Days Later,"" only with more splattering blood.This is, indeed, an action sequel to a thoughtful little horror movie. For me, the original version was better. ""28 Days Later"" had stronger characters and a certain freshness to it (even though it was obviously based on older zombie movies). This sequel feels like a retread with extra action tossed in. It's still good - the apocalyptic imagery is wonderful - but it's like good leftovers. You already had the same thing last night.I shouldn't be too critical, though. The filmmakers saw they had a good formula with the first movie, and didn't change it. Better that than changing the formula into something dumb, right?It helps that this movie has a strong cast. Robert Carlyle is good, as usual, and his role takes a rather interesting twist mid-movie. Jeremy Renner makes for a likable and quite unexpected hero. And, as a bonus for genre fans, Idris ""Ultraviolet"" Elba has a decent role as a military commander. Perhaps the only casting stretch is Rose Byrne; she's beautiful, and a good actress, but she looks too young to be the chief medical officer for a program to rehabilitate zombie England!Another minor downside is that the film strains credibility on occasion; for example, the manner in which the infection breaks out again is vaguely outrageous. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just moan in general that the army does a really lousy job of security in this film. Implausibly lousy, in fact.Yet this is still reasonably intelligent, good horror. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission - it's the stuff that nightmares are made on.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
As far as sequels go; it's impressive. Just don't expect anything too groundbreaking given the state of horror films these days.,"Five years after one of the most original horror films, arguably ever, was made; 28 Weeks Later does things most sequels don't do and that's manage to hold its own when compared to the first film. It does this through a series of conventions that hit and miss the mark.Some things I was happy with, others I was not so impressed with. I was pleased that the basics were kept intact. Often a new director means new ideas or taking existing ones and messing around with them. Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, from Spain, hadn't had much work before he did this film but he'll get the jobs he probably deserves now. Fresnadillo has kept everything that made 'the infected' as creepy as they were in 28 Days Later as well as giving us a refreshing, 'return to the scene of the crime' feel as London gets an attempt at re-population now that Britain has become one massive ghost town. The empty shots of London have been recycled and have once again, worked very effectively; only this time with CGI being put to good use for a change.28 Days Later is one of my favourite films and reasons for this include its atmosphere and its look. Although the idea of shooting on DV right up until the final scenes have been banished; 28 Weeks Later still manages to retain that eerie, dark and noticeably un-easy look its predecessor also had. This is put across using a string of close ups in numerous scenes, lingering camera work, delaying the inevitable to the point of minor frustration and actually having a scene in total pitch black to the characters that we can only witness through a night vision lens in the point-of-view format.What also works is the way the film builds up the character of Don (Robert Carlyle) and his family, giving off a feeling of family ties/familiarity before completely changing suit and going with the kids and the survivors once the initial incident happens. This is quite similar to Hitchcock's tactic he used in Psycho (1960) when the character of Marion Crane was built up to the point the film centred around her; before changing its drive and going down a different route.What I didn't like too much was the way the film has that oddly familiar feeling that most other modern day horrors have. Yes, it's a sequel to 28 Days Later which immediately gives it 'cred'. but the use of over the top (and extremely unnecessary) gore as well as the fast paced, all action second third the film threatened to succumb to was disappointing as most modern day horror films often give in to the temptation of having style over content. Some of the scenes I'm referring to are: when a sniper is pinning them down in the streets (when he should have been air evacuated minutes earlier) and when a certain character becomes infected and acts in an ultra-violent manner towards someone else yet when another character sees him at the end of a street later on; he doesn't run to attack them (like someone infected should do) but merely disappears. These things aren't ghosts; they're as close to zombies as you can get and can't vanish out of thin air.What's also disappointing is it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously at times. Some scenes have flaws behind them and merely act as excuses for action (the sniper scene like I said and the fact the boy near the beginning states he was being chased yet nobody thought the infected would eventually arrive, thus attacking the place they were holed up in) which is a shame as in 28 Days Later; each action and event the characters did on their seemingly endless journey nearly always had a problem that had to be dealt with.Also, the new Wembley stadium pops up in a painfully obvious attempt to identify some modern day iconography. In ten years no one will probably care or even notice but the clue is in the title, Mr. Screenwriter: '28 Weeks Later'; the film is still taking place in 2002 or 2003. The scene in Wembley was unnecessary as it could've happened in any open space or park; I mean, come on; even the goal posts were set up and ready! On the whole, 28 Weeks Later is a good film that provides scares, thrills and some excellent cinematography. Just don't be too put off by the flaws and frustrations.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing,"I can't believe how good this movie was. I'm a big fan of 28 Days Later, the way it was made, everything. When this first movie opens up, you won't even think it's the sequel to 28 Days Later. But then the action happens, everything is fast paced and the camera doesn't look like the budget was $100.00 At first I was disappointed that it wasn't filmed like 28 Days Later, but as the movie went on I grew to accept that fact because the movie just got incredible. Need I say it? I liked it better than 28 Days Later.It's very gruesome, and just like the first one, it's people fighting zombies and people fighting the army a little bit. But this movie had everything and some scenes were jaw-dropping. I'm not going to give any away for spoiler purposes.But go see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something Special,"28 Days Later was a fantastic zombie film, and a fantastic horror film in general. The previews make 28 Weeks Later seem like an unfortunate action film based on its predecessor, but in truth it is something far better, profound and, simply, something beyond what one expects.It may seem strange to say that a zombie movie is ""honest"" or ""affecting,"" but this film can easily be described as both. The dread and unease it pervades transcends even the horror genre, approaching something much more primal. The brutal treatment of human life is artistic in an almost Passolinian way (as hard to imagine as this is) and, in fact, I think it carries the series into the realm of artistic statement.Every character is believable in a way that is uncommon to horror, making the movie almost seem to spring from the school of realism that Flaubert, Zola and Balzac are famous for, simply put in the context of horror (as potentially asinine as that sounds). Robert Carlyle's character strikes me as profoundly interesting and thoroughly complex, due to very subtle and quick techniques used when portraying him.To say that this film exceeded my expectations going in is a gross understatement and, in fact this is truly something special in the horror genre, and for contemporary film as a whole.I only hesitate to give it 10 stars because it is so fresh in my mind and I want it to steep a little more, despite my strong desire to simply say: ""10 stars! 10 stars!""",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredible is an understatement.,"28 Weeks Later more than surpassed my expectations. From the very beginning to the end I was glued to this movie, and was left wanting more. Intense cinematography, heart pounding action, and a thrilling musical score (recognizable by most from 28 Days Later) combine to make an emotional and relentless horror movie. Rather than being over saturated with gore, brainless characters, and worthless dialogue, the aspects in this movie coexist perfectly. Yes there is a lot of violence and gore, but it is in no way excessive. I actually feel that it was necessary to properly provoke the emotions of the viewers. Nothing cheesy or meaningless about it. This film never lets up, and will stir emotions in you that will come back to haunt you after you leave the theater.28 Weeks Later more than lives up to the name of 28 Days Later, and in some ways it even surpasses it. This movie is pure genius, and there is NO other movie like it, which is why it is such an amazing, innovative and unique film. I cannot properly express how great this movie is, for words are simply text on a page-- you MUST see this movie. (although keep in mind that it is fairly violent so don't take little Jimmy along)I only wish it was longer.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A 90 minute non-stop thrill ride!,"First off, I have seen and enjoyed the first film in this series ""28 Days Later..."", but when I heard about this sequel, i thought ""stupid cash-in sequel"". However, I was extremely surprised by this film. Keeping all of the suspense and gore of its predecessor, while boasting characters which you actually care about, which is very rare for a horror.This film takes place 7 months (28 weeks) after the first film, with a US-led NATO force repopulating a now infection-free Britain, and of course, the infection breaks out again. The story revolves around one family, reunited after the initial outbreak, and their quest to survive, with more to do with this new outbreak than they think. Not to give too much away, this, like ""28 Days Later"" is not for the faint-hearted, with more gore than the original, while keeping the same tension-filled atmosphere.

Sense of realism creates genuine horror,"There are legions of zombie movies out there as there are legions of gory movies. We've seen 'em all and we've seen it all. What sets 28 Weeks Later apart, what makes it unique is that its story is in the realm of reality. Viruses mutate in nature, viruses are tampered with in military labs. It's not so much of a far fetched scenario that a genetically designed virus somehow slips its confines and gets out of control, effecting a major break-out. And 28 Weeks Later takes this proposition the viewer easily accepts as being plausible even further with its quasi realistic visual style. You'll see a lot of hand camera work here, and virtually no over-the-top, larger-than-live visuals your usual Hollywood action-horror movie indulges in. On top of it you've got characters not much different from the guy next door. There are no heroes nor villains. No fancy or pathetic wise-cracking, gung-ho dialogues or one-liners. There are simply ordinary characters in extraordinary situations. There are those who have to kill and those who are targeted to be killed. And in your ordinary thrill ride movie the first are the bad guys and the latter are the good guys. But 28 Weeks Later not only blurs the line between good and bad, it actually states that there isn't a thing called good or bad. There are only choices to be made, and each character is trying to make the right choice. And as it is in real life, what is the right choice for you might be a bad choice for the guy next to you. There are those who want to contain the virus no matter what, and you don't blame them given the body count the virus has caused. And there are those who want to flee the potential infection no matter what, and you don't blame them either. What motivates and also justifies the actions of both parties is their legitimate will to survive - the strongest force of human nature. Each character started out to act with the best of intentions causing the worst of outcomes in the effect. As they say: the road to hell is paved with good intentions.And this unique quality of this movie is maybe its only downside. You go to the movies you want to get entertained, thrilled, excited, aroused. And even a movie like for instance Dawn of the Dead will deliver these demands - because you figure it is fiction. But 28 Weeks Later's realistic approach puts fiction out of the equation. It is this sense of realism that creates genuine horror and dismisses you crestfallen: You know you just saw a great movie, but it totally ruined your day.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Better than the Romero Films, By far a superior sequel","I was not one to find 28 Days Later to be a zombie masterpiece that redefined the apocalyptic genre as the previews say personally i thought it was far too slow moving and boring so obviously i expected a rushed sequel like The Hills Have Eyes 2.28 Weeks Later is one of if not the best zombie films ever made i think it is better than George A Romero's series of Night Of The Living Dead, Day Of The Dead, and Dawn Of The Dead which have for the most part been deemed the best zombie movies to ever be made.28 Weeks Later has an extremely intense and realistic start as these zombie don't wonder aimlessly, decaying, and grunting ""BRAINS!"" these zombies run at you like an angry bear clawing and biting at you, they don't stop or slow down for a moment even when that means trying to abandon them in water.The entire movie is a rush of action and adrenaline with a great story and great themes of togetherness and conspiracy.The acting is phenomenal especially for a film that is being lead by a 12 year old and his teenage sister it's surprisingly realistic, and not over the top or campy.The visual effects are that of the first film nothing too glamorous or stunning but it keeps you remembering the events in the first film.The score from the first film is kept and is absolutely riveting and just gets you pumped up for terror.The film is innovative in terms of it's methods to scare the audience with a good balanced mix of psychological horror and well place jump scares that catch you off guard.The directors film techniques are also unique as one entire scene is filmed as if the audience is looking through night vision with that eerie green glow you see on shows like Most Haunted and The Blair Witch.The gore isn't fake or corny and the stunts and events that would've been corny are done so well that it just fits into the whole rush of action and adventure.The script and dialogue is very good no over exaggerated humour crying for a laugh track and no stereotypes something Dawn Of The Dead lacked.The only complaints i have is there is a big plot hole in which one of the scientists says that the virus is not trans species when in fact the original outbreak was caused by chimpanzees, and the boring visuals.Other than those few minor flaws the film is action packed with unexpected twists, shocking violence, and heart-stopping terror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifying,"This was possibly the most terrifying experience I have ever had in a movie theater before. It was excellent, and I'm sure with a nice big TV and surround sound, or at the very least just with the lights off late at night, all of the horribly wonderful terror of this movie will translate. Watch it if you want to be scared shitless without allot of gimmicks or (aside from one scene) gut wrenching gore, just simple excellent direction and terrifying score and visuals. The first five minutes are so extreme I had the hair on the back of my neck standing up and felt like I wanted to turn away from it, I felt like a kid sneaking a horror movie I knew I shouldn't watch, and horror, or scary movies just don't do that to me, but this one did. Zombies don't scare me, but I really like zombie movies none the less. However, the infected DO scare me, just the way they are so fast and relentless and even if completely far fetched the idea of a mind affecting virus that causes people to become ""zombielike"" seems as if it could almost be plausible. After all the Mad cow disease affects the central nervous system and in its later stages induces psychosis. Really its the just the vision of 30 screaming unreasonable people with nothing on their minds other than tearing you apart in the most efficient way possible, filled with screaming rage, chills me to the bone, and there's not really any way to adequtely describe it in words, you just have to see the movie.I give it a ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Infected Strike Back,"""28 Weeks Later"" is gory, wicked and fun, that rare and impressive sequel that can stand alongside the film that inspired it.In 2003's vicious and frighteningly real ""28 Days Later,"" a horrifying strain of athletic, bloodthirsty, virus-fueled zombies overran Great Britain, and ""Weeks"" is a vision of civilization trying to get a handle on that terrifying nightmare and rebuild in its wake.The creators of the first film, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland, serve as producers here, putting their gory baby in the hands of Spanish writer-director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (""Intacto""), and it turns out to be a trust well warranted.For starters, Fresnadillo and his co-writers know that we still vividly recall the horrors of ""Days,"" so they begin in mid-plague, as it were, with a ragtag group waiting out the invasion in a rural cottage. Among them are Don (Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack), a couple whose children are on a school trip to Spain and thus safe from the virus. Alas, Mom and Dad are not. After a stunning assault on their hiding place, Don escapes alone.Presently we learn what has happened in the wake of the awful outbreak: the quarantining of Great Britain; the death of the infected from starvation; the introduction of NATO troops to secure London for repopulation. Don's children (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton -- I swear those are their names) are among the returnees, and, determined to reclaim a remembrance of their mother, they sneak out of the secure area to their old house for mementos. What they find is much worse, and before the chief science officer (Rose Byrne) can get a handle on the situation, the infection has blossomed again and the military does what militaries are meant to do.Just as ""Days"" contained echoes of 9/11, so does ""Weeks"" allude freely to the Iraq war: the use of tools of warfare against an invisible force that turns civilians into enemies; a ""green zone,"" surrounded by snipers, within which a new country is being planned; the decision to destroy a place in order to save it.But that's subtext. On the surface is a thrilling and chilling and sometimes grisly zombie movie that occasionally loses its way in genre conventions but generally keeps you locked into a heightened tension. I give the slight edge to the first movie because I prefer Boyle's craft to Fresnadillo's, but the action is more intense here, and I greeted the thought of a third film -- virtually assured in the closing shots -- with a little yip of ""Yes!"" Likely you will, too.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"very good movie in general, not just horror","I don't remember the first movie as much as i should (will check it out again in a bit), i just remember not liking it as much as everyone else seemed to. I really wanted to love it though, because it was the first ""zombie"" movie in a long time (yes, i know its not traditional lumbering zombies, but it did blaze a path for more zombie movies over the past few years). One thing i do remember is the atmosphere and the frenetic, shaky cam style of action. Those are definitely back in the sequel, but with that being said, I won't compare these two very much.I don't know where to start... maybe I'll start with the bad. There is a particular scene that is really cool to see, but seems a tad too goofy for the serious tone of the rest of the film. There are also some big coincidences, and stupid actions (mostly by the kids) that crop up here and there. The shaky cam style is getting pretty old also, but it is effective in showing how crazy and intense things get. A tacked on last scene that is totally unneeded caps off the worst of the movie in my opinion.Bring on the positives: Although just briefly mentioned, the way the city is being rebuilt and controlled shows more intelligence than your average horror movie. There are parallels that can easily be drawn to current events (as with almost every zombie movie... kinda funny that to the non-fan, ""zombie movie"" makes something sound stupid, when in truth they are usually very intelligent). The characters are deep enough to care about. There is a decent amount of emotional tension, and some decisions and actions that are taken are given room to show both points of view and how not everything is ""good guy, bad guy"". The action is intense and the pace is great. The is some very striking visual imagery in the movie also... some of the shots they show really are remarkable.I don't have much bad to say about this movie, and i don't want to say too much of the good stuff either because i don't want to ruin anything. As stated earlier, there are problems, but they do not weigh the movie down that much. I would like to see people that don't like horror movies or zombie movies, to give this one a chance",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Rage is Back,"28 Weeks Later is gripping, intense, entertaining, scary, gory and action-packed. The way the zombies screams really creeps me out. This is the best 28 film yet in the 28 franchise. The story is great. I thought it was even better than the first one. The performance by the new cast is brilliant. I haven't seen horror film like this with so much action and guns. The opening scene of the film is scary and creepy. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did an amazing job directing this film. There is no question that the next installment will be call 28 Months later.

excellent movie!,"I saw this movie last night. I had heard that it got both good and bad reviews, so I was prepared for anything.I really enjoyed 28 Days Later, and this sequel clearly lives up to the first movie. It may even be slightly better. It's fast-paced from beginning to end. The scenario is pretty believable -- the kind of thing you could picture happening with a bird flu outbreak or a dirty bomb.If you liked the 2004 remake of the old George Romero movie Dawn of the Dead then you'll like this one.See it in the theater and then add it to your collection when it comes out on DVD!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was scared out of my damn mind!,"""28 Days Later"" really freaked me out-the camera work and fast- edits was so profound.I thought it couldn't get any better-then I seen ""28 Weeks Later"" and was stunned at how scary that world had become.I was glued to the edge of my seat, from the beginning of the movie-the heart-palpitating horror didn't cease until the closing credits.The zombies have clearly taken over...from what I seen in this hellish world there was plenty of fertile ground left for ""28 Months Later"" and ""28 Years Later"".

Unexpected Rage,"Watched this last night, as with any sequel the immediate thought of 'Will it compare' being the predominant thought.From the outset the character base is established and certainly the opening 35 minutes lends enough hints as to form a large part of the later of the film.There wasn't quite the same atmosphere to 28 Weeks Later to 28 Days Later, some scenes which were obvious 'jump in the seat' moments were a little too telegraphed, or maybe thats just me being literally desensitised to film violence !, I also found in couple of scenes what appeared to be more than cutaway shots to the next scene to be badly edited joins, although these didn't detract the pace of the film, they were noticeable.There were points in the film where the script obviously is meant to be portraying a particularly horrific moment, yet like several in the screening, found the situation had a certain comedic effect, again this might have more to do with desensitisation than a weak point in the script.The cast was superb, with Imogen Poots and Rose Byrne putting in commendable performances.I can recommend this film, if only on the basis that it is a sequel that has not ruined the original and still contains enough fear and a great vision of a future ""What could happened""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The best ""zombie  men hunt"" I've ever seen","I should admit it is a great movie. I'm not really keen on watching ""zombie  men hunt"" movies, but this one is really different and good. Firstly, due to the plot, - it starts on the point where other movies end and is developed very unexpectedly, so you are kept thrilled up to the last moment. Secondly, there is a lot of psychology included and this makes a very realistic movie, I do believe something like that could really happen. I can easily put myself in the place of people who appeared to be trapped by their own government between danger of contagion and danger of being eliminated by the soldiers who were supposed to protect people at first. Finally, the movie is rather brutal, but is not over blooded nicely done!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent and gripping,"When you read the summary of this movie's storyline, the last thing you expect is a movie that is amazingly gripping, and makes you realize just how fragile people are.Some of the scenes displaying sacrifices and choices sticks in your mind for days. It's a movie you won't forget very soon.The movie, unlike the typical zombie-movies, contains no humor whatsoever; it is raw and violent, and the dark mood stays throughout the movie. The music of John Murphy, from ""28 days later"" intensifies the chasing scenes, much like the music in ""The Rock"" did. When you are left with the feeling that a so-called zombie-film seems real, it has to be done perfectly. They have made it as real as it can be. The streets of London looks eerily deserted. In a time of chemical warfare and viruses this should leave us thinking.This isn't a regular zombie-film. There are a lot of scenes which relates more to classic suspense movies, especially the night vision scene is creepy.The performances are excellent, especially the young boy convinces. And of course Robert Carlyle. The movie gets more personal than the first one, when we follow the two young siblings. You really want them to survive. The mistake many filmmakers do is to follow a whole group, where the survival of each one is not important to you. But not here.Creepy, tense, gripping... Just superb!

Good shock flick - compares very favourably to the original,"28 Weeks Later builds on the tension, horror and shock value of the first film and delivers a new level of frights and scares that had the people in the packed movie theatre I was in gasping, jumping in their seats and hiding their eyes behind their shaking hands.28 Weeks Later continues the story of the Rage Virus that has decimated the UK, and sees the US Military establishing quarantine Zones for survivors in an effort to repopulate London. The virus is thought to be extinct after all the infected have starved to death, but of course, it's not long before an infected survivor brings the Rage virus into the safe zone, and all hell breaks loose as the Military is forced to execute Code Red - total extermination of the population.The storyline is original, the way that the virus reappears is quite clever, and the pace never lets up in a film that is sure to please and shock most viewers. The scares come thick and fast, the soundtrack is relentless and there are many claustrophobic and highly impressive cinematographic scenes that serve to scare, unnerve and increase the tension.Spoilers FOLLOW! The scenes in the crowded underground when the lights go off and one zombie manages to decimate half the survivors is truly frightening, and the scene with the helicopter decapitating the zombies on the hill is awesome.Rose Byrne is excellent in this Ripley-esquire role, and the children aren't the typical annoying or precocious screen brats, so you actually empathise with all the main characters and pray for their survival.Be warned, there are gory scenes and it is extremely graphic and violent in places (Robert Carlisle gives his wife some tough love!) but it certainly provides entertainment.There were a few places when the crowd laughed (Robert Carlisle tells his wife he is happy she's alive after leaving her for dead months earlier) and many people left the cinema talking excitedly about the film and recapping their favourite scene.Good movie, great scare and good entertainment - recommended but not for young kids or a date movie :P",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
As good as a non-sequential sequel goes,"Now a lot of people were initially skeptical about this movie. No Jim, no Naomi and no Hannah in this movie. You got to be kidding me!! It looked like a lame attempt by some lame Americans trying to Americanize (therefore making it lame) a perfectly good Euro-thriller. What we got was something far different.28 Weeks can't top 28 Days, which is something I want to mention right away. But this film was surprisingly effective. While it did possess some plot holes, they were not enough of an issue to make the movie unwatchable. What we get with this installment is a taut and gripping movie that is both political and intriguing in its composition. From the first scene of Robert Carlisle running for his life to the last, we get a sense that the gloom and doom of this world follows the original vision of the film a little more closely. We all know Danny Boyle wanted Jim to die a the end of 28 Days Later...., but he chose to make the ending much happier. This movie is just downright bleak, a perfect reminder that not all cool movies need to be happy at the end to leave a feeling of satisfaction when you leave the theater.Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did the best he could even though he had to use the cheap mediums of CGI to get the same effect 28 Days Later did without them. But one thing he did maintain was just the downright creepiness of the Rage victims. Unrelenting and genuinely scary, their thirst is still quite a sight to see. While the ambiguous ending laid the foundation of another sequel, at least they proved a movie with a completely different cast and crew can still carryover quite well.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"'28 Weeks Later' is a refined horror in its own, let alone as a sequel.","Oh, the terror! '28 Weeks Later,' the long-awaited follow-up to 2002's British horror, '28 Days Later,' which was met with much acclamation from critics and horror-hounds the same, was scowled upon by dubious skeptics in its early days of production. The first film was delivered smartly and bluntly, with loads of gory fun; and was at the sure hands of one of Britain's finest, Danny Boyle. So what of '28 Weeks Later?''28 Weeks Later' seems to steer clear of this summer's pack of dimwitted horror sequels (led by Fox Atomic's other release, 'The Hills Have Eyes 2'), with its increased budget and the addition of semi-well-knowns, Robert Carlyle and Jeremy Renner. However, why the change of directors? It's hard enough to transition from a familiar cast to a completely new one, while at the same time maintaining the interest of potential viewers. Though, for a film to change directors, typically suggests a new style  one different from Boyle's shaky under-lit method that brought '28 Days Later' its believable atmosphere; and a dissimilar technique could potentially lose a good part of the first film's fanbase.Well, a very much deserved kudos to Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who welcomed the challenge and left not only victorious, but neck-and-neck with Boyle's insight into one of horror's best one-two punches of all time. In fact, Fresnadillo's techniques appear to have been crafted by Boyle himself, who took on the role of executive producer, alongside Alex Garland, for the franchise's second offering. Everything that was seen in Boyle's first chapter is seen here. However, in the sequel, everything's been magnified. There's more terror, more gore and more rage-infested zombies than in the first film; the excitement's been heightened, the panic's been intensified, and this year has found its most clever horror since its own predecessor!The film opens with a husband and his wife (played respectively by Robert Carlyle and the terrific Catherine McCormack), shacked up in a cottage with a four others in rural London. When the cottage is overrun by the infected, Don (Carlyle) escapes to the countryside, leaving his wife and all others for his own safety. After twenty-eight weeks of reconstruction, a secured district guarded by American army forces becomes the temporary home for Don and other estranged refugees, including Don's two children, Tammy and Andy. All's well until the two rascals escape the guarded boundaries, only to return with the virus's passage back into the film.'28 Weeks Later' is reflective of the war in Iraq, and gives wonder to how our troops are keeping containment. The adroitness of Fresnadillo's craft behind the lens is scary in its own. As the panic in the film ensues, it is captured with grave detail by Fresnadillo's mix of sporadic and monotone shots. The acting is anything but what one would expect from any horror film, and is pushed forth by the perfectly cast Jeremy Renner and Catherine McCormack as Alice, who gives a horrifying performance. If I could say one thing about this film, I'd scream to all of the fear, and the fearlessness in which it portrays. It'll bite you and bite you hard, and it won't let go until your heart's skipped twenty-eight beats!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 weeks later a frenetic nonstop horror thrill ride.,"I first have to admit I did not much care for 28 days later, however, part of my dislike for that movie may stem from the fact a review I read said it was like ""Dawn of the Dead"" which it wasn't really. Still, I may not be as harsh on it now as I was when I first saw it, I found it was a bit slow at times and you really never got to see the best horror, only have it described to you by the one person talking about how people were in a panic and that one by one people turned. Here you get to see exactly that. The movie starts with a bang as a husband flees from the rage infected hordes of people having left his wife behind seemingly to die, flash to 28 weeks later and the city is being repopulated slowly, but surely as the husband from the beginning is reunited with his kids who are extremely stupid. Yes, they do what they are not supposed to and go into a non safe area in search of their old house so they can pick up a few mementos of their mum. Well surprise, surprise their mother is alive, though not so well and is taken back to the city for examination. Well we soon find out why you should stay in the safe zone as the infection begins again and I am pretty sure most of the people who have returned home are now thinking maybe we should not have returned. The infection spreads as fast as described in the first movie, there is panic in the streets and the military is now in kill mode as our two kids are joined by a medical officer and a military man not keen on shooting everyone in sight whether infected or not. So you have cool chases with both the infected and the military and the characters in this one don't have much time to do anything, but catch their breath. Very good and fast paced horror movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best Horror Films in a Long Time,"I went into the theater not having a clue as what to expect with this movie. I had seen a very short trailer that didn't give anything away and I'm glad for this.I was so afraid that this was going to be yet another zombie movie that is set in some post apocalyptic time frame where the movie feels more like Mad Max with Zombies than it feels like a horror movie. Don't get me wrong, I will still watch these and love them but not like 28 Weeks Later. I loved how this had a very realistic progression from the first story. If something like this did happen in real life then I can see things being realistically similar to 28 Weeks Later. A NATO force, particularly US forces moving in to help contain the problem was spot on. This wasn't only realistic but also made a great back drop for zombie killing fun and 28 Weeks does it with style. One of the other things I liked a lot was the retaining of the look of the first film as well as the sound. I've seen plenty of people mention the love of the grainy film type used to keep the feel of the first film but few mention the music that was the same or at least very close to the same as the first. Both of these things really helped me like this film along with its predecessor. The rabid, ultra furious zombies on crack are back as 28 Weeks continues to show the advantage of not using slow dumb zombies as the enemy. To say that it is more intense to see a very quick rabid looking zombie actually running after people is more intense than traditional zombies would be an understatement. To the credit of traditional zombie films I guess I should point out of course that what we call zombies in 28 Days and 28 Weeks aren't zombies at all as one would define them in past zombie films since they aren't even dead. We are really talking about a virus that infects humans and makes them crave flesh. I guess it would be more funny than scary to see a half rotten corpse running full speed like those infected in 28 Days/Weeks. Nevertheless, my point is that the infected zombie like creatures in the 28 Days/Weeks movies really build tension to the max with their ferocity. About the only thing I wish I had seen in 28WL would have been the original actors from 28 Days. I had really grown fond of the characters in the first film and would have liked to have seen them involved in the second. Then again, I suppose they wouldn't have transitioned into the updated storyline very easily. So, this is merely a minor complaint and is really rather picky considering how great 28WL was. I hope to see a 28 Months later before too long. :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A superb second installment,"There is one shot very early on in 28 Weeks Later where Robert Carlyle's character is seen fleeing a house that has been breached by the ""infected"" (I'll be referring to them as zombies from here on out, for simplicity's sake), leaving his fellow healthy survivalists -- including his wife -- to fend for themselves. Carlyle runs like hell, and we see in his face a sudden twinge of guilt and helpless desperation. It's nothing over-the-top; just a fleeting and seemingly natural reaction to what he has just done.This is the moment where director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo shows us how he is going to turn a sequel to a moderately successful 2003 zombie flick into a great and wholly original film of his own. 28 Weeks Later is so triumphant that, as a sequel, I would say it falls just short of Aliens' greatness. This is a highly original entry into the zombie subgenre, whose realism and strong establishment of its unique tone and universe set it apart from other zombie movies (including 28 Days Later).I won't go into the plot because, like any effective horror film, 28 Weeks Later's brilliance is in its simple and visceral structure. There are no huge derivations or twists that cause the material it adapts from the previous film to jump the shark, and there are no gimmicks. There are, however, some intriguing revelations in store. Otherwise, it's refreshingly forthright and streamlined for a horror sequel, and something that you simply have to experience.The film features some solid performances, especially from the always reliable Carlyle and plucky newcomer Imogen Poots. And the proceedings are spiced up by amazing action sequences, including a fire bombing of the Isle of Dogs and a helicopter vs. zombie showdown that has to be seen to be believed.Considerably more concise and tautly constructed than its predecessor, 28 Weeks Later might just be the superior film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Less characterization, but more thrills","28 Weeks Later knows it doesn't want to just be the same as 28 Days Later in every way. While we are given a handful of solid characters and good performances, these play second-fiddle to the tension and pace.Starting with one of the best horror openings of all time, 28 Weeks Later introduces itself as a horror/action film with much less down time than the original. This bothered many people, but I was fine with it. The characters were just good enough to make me care about what was happening to them. Giving a crap about anyone in a horror film is pretty rare by itself, so I didn't feel the need to bash this one just because the script wasn't as intelligent or character-oriented.

Disorienting and horrifying,"28 weeks later.... RUN!The sequel to 28 days later. Now the Brits returned to their country while being protected by the American military.The opening scene already scared me. It started out calm, but you know that danger was looming. When it hits, I definitely wasn't ready. In the first movie, the disorienting and fast editing amplified the sense of panic and anxiety. In the movie, this technique became even more effective . There were more zombies, and they looked even more terrifying than in the first.Oh and I mentioned the military. Its role in a zombie or creature movie was where soldiers and people suffered painful deaths. It's also where pandemonium breaks out. The scene with many people packed in a place was absolute chaos, and again the editing became overwhelmingly effective and I was on the edge of my seat.The story was unrelenting. The main characters were in constant danger from the running maniac. It's also brutal with many characters dying. Since the movie took place at the start of an outbreak, there was barely any character development, but that's not necessary in this type of movies.Overall, one of the most chaotic and terrifying zombie movies. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hopeless in Loundon,"First off i want to explain my love for the first one.It's very rare that i'm emotionally involved in a film. 28 days took me by surprise. I genuinely cared whether the characters lived or died. Yes for once i wasn't hoping the zombies/infected eat the people, and make it gory. The movie also was like watching how savage humanity is and our struggle for survival. Though the ending i saw was a happy bullshit ending, i had the opportunity to see the other 2 ending which were nihilistic. All in all it did everything right. The atmosphere, the score...man the score was very emotional, the characters and the infected are some of the most savage creatures every!!! The sequel tried to recapture that and more. and does it succeed? well.... The movie is about how America has repopulated London after all the infected has died of starvation. But a survivor is found and all hell breaks loose. Some reviewers often called this aliens to days alien. i disagree. though its action packed and has ten times the infected...i don't think thats a fair comparison. I do think this movie explains a lot. The new ideas they introduced into the franchise is even more frightening then the originals.The movie can be looked at as a metaphor for the Iraq war or any war America has had in the past. We see them going into a foreign country trying to show them how to live and it back firing horribly. With a code red order sent down..which is reminiscing of the shock and awesome performance we got to witness in the early stages of the now 4 year Iraq war, we see an unspeakable but yet very understandable act deployed. This only adds to the horror which seems relentless once it gets going.The issue i had with this movie was it didn't capture the bleakness of the original. Though it seemed like there's no hope of repopulating London, the movie wasn't as atmospheric as the original. Here we see countless amounts of soldiers on buildings in a empty London..placed there for safety..think 911..when they aren't doing anything but you feel safe to know they are there. Only the insane and highly replay ably intro captures the true essence of the first film. Now i'm not saying this isn't good i'm saying that one was a better film. The first was filmed with a digital camera, gave it a grainy look. This is filmed and scored like a big budget flick. which its probably what it was but...what made the original that much better was it seemed real...it was damn depressing..and the score was haunting and emotional. It was one of those movies you'd stumble across in a video store and it scared the hell of you.I liked it...watched 3 times before rendering a verdict. I don't think a sequel is necessary.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Intelligent, thoughtful, scary horror movie...","28 Days Later, directed by Danny Boyle was a well made and intelligent movie about a virus infecting people in Britain and the chaos that results. It was also a scary, gory horror movie.28 Weeks Later picks up the story after the end of the RAGE virus in Britain. The Americans are leading a NATO force to rebuild the country and re-populate the evacuated people. Into the mix come 2 children, Tammy and Andy who had been abroad on a school trip when the original outbreak occurred. Their parents, however were caught up in events... which leads to an act by their father Don that ultimately will cause chaos and horror once more.I believe there have been comments by some critics, comparing the events in the movie to events in Iraq. I will concede that. But I'm not here to talk about a political horror movie (if you want to call it that). I'm writing to say if this is a good or bad horror movie. That's all.And I'm happy to say that it is. It's got a few scares, some bloody violence, some shocking moments, and an ending that sets up a potential 3rd movie.The acting is superb, but credit has to go to Robert Carlyle. The scene where he tell his kids what happened to their mother is very well done indeed. Rose Byrne is also good, as a major in the army worrying about the possible return of the virus. With this, and Sunshine this year, she may be on the verge of big things. Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton are good too as the kids who get caught up in the horror of the virus.Credit must also go to the director, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo for not simply following the brilliant original but making this follow-up his own movie. The scenes in an empty London, don't look like copies of the ones Boyle did in the original, but his own take on the city.Overall, a brilliant sequel (and when was the last time we had one of those?!). Who knows what horrors await if they decide to do another one (28 Months Later?).I for one would look forward to it...",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Here comes the Yankees to the rescue, but...","""28 Weeks Later"" or ""A Man's Fateful Choice"" sees the return to a safe zone in London of a bunch of refugees from the States and all seems smooth and clean until a fateful choice comes back to haunt and bite the man who did it some weeks before...So Tammy, Andy, Scarlet and Doyle will have to outrun the new apocalypse and also avoid its spreading.I love how even with the franchise taken over by Americans it still has a British soul: it reaches a huge quality mix of both elements and the cast choices are brilliant (Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots, Rose Byrne, Robert Carlyle etc.). I do prefer this sequel to the original, 'cuz it shows perfectly how one man's past choices (Don's) can shape and reshape the future of the entire human race.I'm so hopeful for the sequel, if it maintains this quality it can do amazing things.

The Second Installment Of A Possible Genuine Classic Trilogy,"'28 Days Later' is a bit of a classic, it's originality is matched by it's audacity and imagination, director Danny Boyle offering up some iconic images that stay with you. When i first heard there was going to be a sequel to it i didn't think much of it, an inferior sequel surely? No Boyle, Garland or it's original stars, how could this live up to it? But then the director of 'Intacto' jumped on board and Robert Caryle was cast and suddenly there was something to get excited about. This is quite possibly one of the best sequels to a movie i've ever seen. I'm not going to go into the story but what i am going to say is that it's harrowing, genuinely terrifying, grim, beautiful, darkly funny and extremely clever with some outstanding performances from all involved. The original score is back and if Boyle directed it he would have been proud.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A worthy vehicle for the near-invincible rage virus!,"After a second viewing on DVD, this sequel really grew on me. At the theater, I was put off by what I thought at the time were absurdities in the plot. The incompetence of the U.S. military brass seemed too absolute to be believed. But when I think about it, a little disconnect can go a long way, especially when you're dealing with a beast like this virus.This film is not a simple rehash of it's predecessor - it spins it's own yarn. While the horror elements are undeniable, Weeks is structured more like a disaster movie. The first act provides plenty of buildup and foreshadowing. I don't think I'll be giving much away if I say that at a certain point, things proceed less than perfectly. The writing is solid enough that I felt for the characters. Certain scenes delivered extra dramatic and/or tragic weight and there were many visual images that suitably conveyed the most ghastly of occasions.Following an original breakout like 28 Days Later is a thankless task. If not quite as bold and original, Weeks acquits itself well, successfully maintaining my fascination with the overall scenario established in Days. If sensational bleakness is what you crave in your entertainment, this franchise is hard to beat.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Its lonely, its tense and the emotion and fear is pervasive.The cinematography is spot on and looks like the success of the previous film got them more than 5 minutes to seal of parts of London this time as we run for our lives through the abandoned streets. 28 Weeks feels bigger budget and aimed to cross the pond successfully but the cleverness in story telling doesn't leave the viewer feeling like another great foreign films been hijacked by Hollywood.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of if not my all time favorite zombie/horror films of the 21st century.,"This movie had it all for me. Story, action, violence, tension, suspense. I was entertained from start to finish which is something very few movies due for me now a days. The first movie (28 days later) had an amazing story, and while this one lacks the story a little more than that of the first, everything is made up by just the overall action packed entertainment in this film and all the characters did a great job with their given rolls in the movie.**This movie is violent!! The eye-gouge scene in particular is hard scene to watch so I'd recommend this movie to only hardcore horror fans who are used to that kind of stuff.**I would recommend this movie to any horror fan looking for a suspenseful thrill ride.

Apocalyptic Suspense,"First, just to make clear 28 Weeks Later shouldn't be included in the zombie-movie genre. The infected aren't UNDEAD but very much alive. Geroge Romero movies are zombie movies.28 Weeks Later sustained the suspense which 28 days later had and in some points went even further. There was good balance between the gore and suspense which kept the movie interesting till the end. Juan Carlos F. really made his own movie and is great addition to the 28 movies. When scenes with people their emotions in the situations were directed truthfully which gave the movie more realistic feel. This movie is just action and gore, but it centers around people, who are trying to survive in the middle of catastrophe. This is what Fresnadillo has done perfectly he has told us a story. This movie is full of surprises, and things that happen to some character and the twists are truly amazing and there's hard to before hand what happens.Even though Juan Carlos Fresnadillo hasn't done a horror movie before this he shows that is capable of pulling that of with flying colours.8/10 Excellent choice for horror fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Blood-y Fantastic!,"Wow, I just went and saw 28 weeks later and it was fantastic! I don't know where to begin I can't even watch horror movies, I watch about 1 a year and usually regret it. I saw 28 days later at the cinema and enjoyed it, surprisingly. So was very excited to see more.I was sold within 5 minutes and it kept getting better and better. Despite a change in director the film clearly kept the same feel as the first, even the same sound track, this is all a very positive thing. The shots, colours, lighting it's weird to say but I feel in love with a horror film!The London shots were full of emotion, sad to see it in such a tragic state with shots of destruction but they were also magnificent and stunning pieces of CGI. I must say the whole film was surprisingly emotional.Robert Carlyle was brilliant, as were so many, even the whole American's coming to save the day thing didn't bother me, every character had good reason.

"An amazing sequel, even if it's not necessary","Did 28 Days Later need a sequel? Probably not, but I'm still glad we got one.The story in 28 Weeks Later is happening in significantly smaller area. In 28 Days Later the main characters travel a lot while in this one the characters mostly stay in London, and especially that small, secured area in London. The more confined milieu gives the story something more, since the virus and the infected aren't really a thread somewhere outside, but it's inside, among you. And it creates even more chaos when the US soldiers are trying to control the situation. It's brilliant and agonising.While all of the movie is very good, one of the most effective moments is at the beginning of the film, when Don (Robert Carlyle) runs when the infected attack his wife. Another friend of mine had seen the movie and described it to me when we were younger, when I was about 11 or 12. And I still remember the way she described it and how impressive, maybe even awesome that scene was. You're used to seeing people being heroes in movies, and that was the opposite. Even if we may not really experience Don's fear in that scene, his actions are incredibly powerful.Also the shaky camera, quick and fast shots at the beginning were a bit worrisome. I was afraid that's what most of the movie was going to be like, because it just kept going on and on. It's effective, but also makes everything really hard to follow. Yet you could see the most important things.The only thing I like less about this movie is how American it seems. Of course it takes place in UK, and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is a Spanish director, so it's not the movie itself. It's mostly how the US army is involved in securing London, letting people back in London. It's annoying, but also it seems really typical. It's annoying because you know that's exactly how it would go.28 Days Later doesn't necessarily need a sequel. 28 Weeks Later is different, and a certain touch is missing with Danny Boyle, but Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has made something haunting and amazing. You don't need to see it, since the story is different, but it's still absolutely worth your time.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A few cheesy scenes couldn't spoil 28WL for me,"Immediately, 28WL grabbed me with the familiar sense of abandonment and helplessness that I felt in the first film. The crude actions that lead one to survival in the midst of the infection. The motivations of the characters were more personal.The action scenes were more violent, the infected just as violent but held more intensity, and the plot drove through the film like a Japanese bullet train. Unfortunately, the chaotic scenes between the infected and non-infected were not shot as clean as the first. Danny Boyle did a better job in respects to making chaos look clean.At times, it was difficult to collect my thoughts b/c of the fast pace. Several hoaky and unrealistic scenes took away from the film, but not enough to walk out of the theater disappointed. If you liked or loved 28 Days Later, I highly recommend spending the $10 bucks to see 28WL on the big screen to form your own opinion.-SC",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Continuing the story afresh,top to bottom apparently","2002's ""28 Days Later..."" was a huge hit on both sides of the Atlantic,so of course they(as in the producers,company and some of the creators)would feel compelled to make a sequel. And why not? When ""...Days..."" left off left just enough of an opening for more to this story.So it is that some seven months after the outbreak,England has been almost thoroughly ravaged by the RAge virus,but order has been restored via the U.S.Military(feeling false swelling of patriotism here),and expatriated English citizens are brought back into the country as the messes left behind are being cleaned up.A brother and sister(IMogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton,whose names will catch at least a few eyes strange,methinks)return from abroad and are greeted by their dad(Robert Carlyle,getting what seems to be a rare chance to recreate the easy-going everyman character that once made him famous in stuff like ""The Full Monty""),who appears to be the lone survivor of an attack in the country which counted among the casualties their mother(CAtherine McCormack,a lady I wish I saw more of in movies),but when the duo escape the quarantined,military sanctioned facilities to retrieve their stuff from their downtown London home,they find her alive. She,along with her kids are brought back to the facility,and while under observation,a remarkable(And chilling)secret is discovered by the staff medical captain(Rose Byrne,often confused for other pretty,doe-eyed actresses I bet),and it poses a double-edged sword for what is an actually more delicate situation to the public safety that what appears.I'll stop with the description to avoid any spoilers(though it's possible I might've already given some). I will say that once the show's action begins rolling,it is frenetic and emotionally very effective. Even though there's plenty of activity(And hence people active in it)it is actually somewhat sparse on characters,with the brother and sister as your main focal points and heroes. Solid,emotionally draining performances by Poots,Muggleton and Carlyle are supplemented by physical(if perhaps abbreviated)impact players such as Jeremy Renner(As one of the unit team snipers who decides to aid the kids) and Harold Perrineau(as a nervous chopper pilot on patrol). Director and co-writer Juan CArlos Freinadillo is brought in to replace Danny Boyle(who produces)and probably is fortunate to start with what can be considered a new deck of cards here,since the previous movie is treated entirely as given background effect. THat way,his direction and script(co-written by Rowan Joffe)gets the fresh treatment,neither aided nor hindered by the original. I wish I could honestly say that this show either was an improvement or a step-down from the first movie,but I'm not sure how to compare. I WILL say that this film enlightens the viewer from the first film as to the full nature of the calamity(taking it away,for the most part,from the concept of the carriers as being purely ""zombies""and more toward the concept of ""infectes""),which I think couches this in more grim and powerful reality. I guess I will say to those interested in catching this film,who hasn't seen the first movie to check ""28 Days...""(not to be confused with ""28 Days"" with Sandra Bullock),because this movie,despite being populated from almost top-to-bottom with new names,the storyline is THE most important part of both films. Like the last one,it works on a deeper level than an ordinary horror film,even if it feels like it sometimes falls into the traps(i.e. underdeveloped players,shortening of logistics to speed along action,etc.)that many films of its genre does. Well worth your rental dollars.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zombies that can run.......now that's horror!,"OK OK hardcore horror fans, these are not the exact definition of ""zombies"" but with the rage virus the 'infected' in this film are showing distinct symptoms of zombie-ness. Not those stupid, bumbling ones that try and gnaw on your leg....these are fast, clever and ruthless and pretty bloody scary.I never want to give away spoilers with my comment section as I always think this jeopardises someone elses enjoyment of the film. What I will say is when you combine a helicopter and a field of zombies there is a recipe for a scene of carnage..definitely one of my favourite moments of the film! Robbie Carlyle and the chick from Braveheart put in brilliant performances and it is a gear up from 28 days later (which I feel was a film that faded somewhat near the end).A deserted London portrayed in film is a simple but effective tool to give an audience that 'chill' we expect from 'well written' horrors. There is blood and gore....lots of it but it never feels overused.I feel the Americans come off a wee bit badly here :-) as they didn't exactly pull out all the stops to contain the spread of the virus. Even I may have worked out that putting hundreds of people in a pitch black compound with flimsy walls is not ideal in avoiding panic and keeping those blood thirsty, red eyed monsters out. haha.When my GF asked if this was a sequel to 28 weeks NOTICE I said yes, so we are going this week and I shall have some zombie delight for the second time.

A Beautiful Piece of Art,"I always had the feeling this was just going to be a lame sequel using the name of the classic movie ""28 Days Later"". Mainly because ""28 Days Later"" had a good ending where infected die of starvation and everything was going to be OK. So looking at the trailer, you might feel cheated to have watched ""28 Days Later"", cause things just don't seem to turn out OK after all. But you would be wrong. ""28 Weeks Later"" isn't an ""Elm Street"" type sequel where evil just comes back for no good reason. As in most horror sequels, ""28 Weeks Later"" takes its own horror elements to the next level. I don't wanna give any spoilers, so all I can say is everything is more intense than ""28 Days Later"" The shooting of the film is just beautiful. The use of filters, lighting, fast camera movement, empty city scenes, and music make this movie a true piece of art. You will realize that it actually is a good thing the sequel has a different director, so you will get a chance to see the idea of ""28 Days Later"" from a different point of view. ""28 Days Later"" & ""28 Weeks Later"" is probably one of the best horror couple ever made, since each of them is a whole different movie in itself with only the idea of infected people in common. The only downside of the movie was it felt too short. It was probably the quickest 90 minutes of my life. This actually IS a downside, because it leaves the viewer dissatisfied. Most characters have longer backgrounds than their lives in the movie. And the overall of the movie gives you the feeling that it was cut short due to lack of budget (probably). Nevertheless, ""28 Weeks Later"" is a must see for horror addicts, and it definitely is better than some of the classic movies of modern time.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'd rather get the Rage virus than see this again.,"Let me preface this, 28 Weeks Later is just one big allegory. One Big, Dumb allegory.The first movie, ""28 days later"", featured subtle undertones of racial, sexual tension. But alas, ""Weeks"" features nothing less than the blatant, bigoted opinions of a politically charged Spanish director: The U.S. takes control of a territory with the intention of liberating, or ""purifying"" the British Isles only to have matters careen and blow vastly out of proportion. Much like the current state of Iraq, nay?The premise is reminiscent of the first, but the tact is gone, as subtlety is cast aside in favor of the Hollywood-esquire appeal of ultra-violent imagery. Which, again, may be just a metaphor for our American bloodlust, but wow is this poorly executed. There is simply no need for this much political commentary in anything short of a michael moore film. Some of the already sparse audience did leave during a particularly long, bloody scene, illustrating my alleged claim of tasteless violence.But what of the characters? What about them? They feature treacherous dads, an obnoxious kid, his particularly fine sister, an altruistic and morally just soldier, and a military physician out to reveal her higher nature. None of them can anyone develop a particular attachment towards, and the dodgy plot haphazardly follows them through an illogical sequence in London. The movie frusterates, disgusts, frusterates, disgusts, and lastly ends in disgrace. The Kids just complicate and perpetuate problems, but without them, the series would have concluded with ""28 Days Later"".Does this film do anything right? That adrenaline-fueled camera from the first movie is back. It does right in the opening scenes to convey panic and portrays the confusion well in a manner that almost inserts the audience in the movie. But that about does it. The remaining 100 minutes blow and conclude in a manner that.. well.. sucks. Tries too hard is all.This movie is not worthy of a rating of 2 out of 10, but my partiality to zombie movies musters this one more point.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
We have an outbreak of the infection in medical center. All units - safeties off.,"28 Weeks Later is directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo who also co-writes with Rowan Joffe, Jesus Olmo and E. L. Lavigne. It stars Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Mackintosh Muggleton and Imogen Poots. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Enrique Chediak.Six months have passed since the Rage Virus decimated the UK, but now people are returning to London's District 1 with the U.S. Military overseeing the project. However, the Rage Virus can be carried in people with no outward symptoms.After the monster success of ""28 Days Later"" it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. With director/writer combo Danny Boyle and Alex Garland off making ""Sunshine"" with Cillian Murphy, the big players from the first film were missing (Boyle and Garland were Executive Producers here). There was reasonable cause for some concern that this would be the latest in a long line of horror sequels that, quite frankly, suck the big one. How great to find that not only is ""Weeks"" an excellent sequel, it also doesn't sit idle and copy Boyle's winning formula.The blood and ick factor is considerably amped up, as is the action (there's running, lots of running, guns, lots of guns, panic, lots of panic), but the writers have put intelligence into the writing by expanding on the Rage Virus victims as not just being an outwardly ferocious beast, and some topical smarts are spliced into the narrative with the presence of the American military ""enforcing"" the reconstruction of London. Also, with the film's central focus being on a splintered family, brilliantly set up by the breathtaking/horrifying opening 10 minutes, there's a mighty heft of humanism flowing in between the blood vomit and body shredding.Cast are mostly terrific, with Carlyle and the impressive young actors, Poots and Muggleton, leading the way. The American lads playing military men have to make do with slender written stock roles, but Byrne provides spunk and McCormack leaves an indelible mark in a small, but key, role. Fresnadillo (Intacto) ensures Boyle isn't missed in the director's chair, with a keen eye for action construction and an awareness of pacing for such a horror movie. While Murphy again scores with that knack for doom mongering beats. There's some missteps, logic at times goes out the window and in the case of Renner's character, outcome is a bit too much of a bitter pill to swallow. While dialogue at times shops at ""Clichés ""R"" Us"". But this is still a mighty fine thrill ride, often scary and stomach turning, and even flecked with emotional worth. On this evidence a part 3 would be most welcome. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Admirable Sequel,"Very good! This is a top notch zombie film, but it didn't quite live up to its predecessor. It was a little more predictable then ""28 Days Later"", but is still a very frightening and disturbing movie. One area in which this film exceeds ""Days"" is how claustrophobic it is. I don't quite know how to explain it, but certain parts in the movie just made me feel uncomfortably close to what was going on, and the first seemed to take place more out in the open.I thought that most of the actors did an excellent job. Robert Carlyle, Jeremy Renner, and both of the children all gave great performances. Jeremy Renner in some respects reminds me of Nathan Fillion. He is a talented actor who is very underrated. He was definitely one of the better parts of the SWAT movie. It was good to see Michael from Lost in the movie also! Harold Perrineau was a great addition to the cast.The atmosphere is tense, and it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat through its entire length. I loved all the neat camera views the director used, especially the night vision scope in the tunnel, that was great. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a good job with taking over the reigns from Danny Boyle. I'll be interested to see what the success of this movie does for his career as a filmmaker.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Leaves something to be desired,"As the name suggests, months have passed since the catastrophic events of the first film. But now the infected, the Ragers, have died of starvation and the British Isles are slowly being re-inhabited. But, of course it's not that simple.I thought the first film was okay. Not great, but okay. It had some really good action and the zombies - or the Ragers, because none of these movies dare use the Z-word - were an actual, legitimate threat. It had some social commentary, some good acting and a decent ending.I also like the idea of this film franchise on paper. Examining the same zombie outbreak in its different stages. First some days later, then weeks, and then presumably months or even years. 28 Years Later could be something we've never seen before in this genre.Unfortunately it's unclear whether this sequel is strong enough to warrant a third movie. Because while it keeps some of the strengths of the original - the scary zombies and the social commentary - it just isn't that strong of a movie by itself. The action especially takes a heavy nosedive. The film seems to think that the way to shoot action is to have the whole screen pitch black and then flash the lights every couple of seconds while people grunt and moan in the dark. As you can probably imagine, this makes all the action scenes nigh impossible to follow or appreciate.The whole film also has this cold, clinical look to it. I remember the first film looking much warmer, like a real civilization in ruins. This looks like an IKEA catalog with some zombies added.Not a terrible film by any means, and if you liked the first one, then this might be worth a watch. Here's hoping we get a third one and that it picks up the slack.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Better than first, Best horror/thriller in some time.. Excellent!","it's only been a couple of hours since watching, and i'm sure i'll come up with a few plot holes over time, like why he did this? could that have really happened? etc.. but that's not important because there was only one moment i felt distracted like that during the film, and even then it was explained soon after.. but i haven't been on the edge of my seat for an entire film for a very long time.. 24 being the only thing in recent memory to get my adrenaline pumping.The sense of dread in this film is amazing, the action is perfectly timed and paced, it is just one of those films where the audience literally gasps a sigh of relief when the credits start to roll.If you thought the first film had a good premise, but felt lacking in some way, particularly thrills, then you will love this film.My friend made a good comparison, 28 Weeks Later as a sequel is similar to Aliens.. in Alien it was a small group of people, the enemy was new.. in both sequels, the enemy is known, and the guns are loaded, yet it still manages to make you feel like there is no escape. Alien was an example in tension, Aliens was an example of the emotions felt on a roller-coaster ride.

"""Realism"" is all the more scary","I know that realism is an odd point concerning Zombie films (I know they're officially not ""zombies"" but for the sake of argument I'm going to refer to them as such) but once you accept most of your fellow humans are out to eat/hurt you with no thought for themselves, its the practicality of such a real life situation that gives me the most interest. With this being set in Britain without the mandatory gun shop on every corner, it makes for a far more gritty, ""hands on"" horror film. The panic and squalor of quite literally fighting for your life amongst the normally mundane countryside/urban scenarios are far more upsetting than any cocky American, confidently shooting a corpse with a witty sound bite or overly sentimental reaction (although that does sadly occur a little in this film). I was fearful this film would fall foul of the zombies showing recognition or mercy on loved ones but instead the catastrophic change in victims is shown brutally well (in the medical room for example). The currently very popular ""night vision"" tool is used well in one scene and although the film does fall back on tried and tested structure (kids being naughty/annoying, people and zombies surviving the unsurvivable and then handily coming across each other to tie things up nicely etc) the film gripped me enough and pulled me in sufficiently to not hold them against it. I know my Utopian ideal of a zombie film where the events and horrifically realistic situations form the bulk of the film (what would I do questions raised etc) and overly emotional character plots are spared instead going for a more general overview of human response is unrealistic, my fingers are still crossed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hmm?,Not as good as the original. But good try!!! Maybe it's just cause I loved 28 days later so much! I have watched it more than once though..... So can't be that bad. Sad sad ending!!,3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Comparing 28 days later and 28 weeks later,"Comparing two zombie films.If I had to compare 28 days later and 28 weeks later, the comparison would be that the former is a good action film based on surviving a threat and while being on the road in order to find a mystical Eden, while the latter is more on an intellectual based film on relationships such as the two children and their father, lies that a father tells as not to bring to the surface his inability to have saved his wife while zombies were attacking the village.In fact, one does not need to see the first to appreciate independently the two films.For my critic of 28 days later, the idea of finding shelter in a mansion protected by soldiers who want to gang rape the women who are now in their custody in a supposedly core idea of repopulating the world, is quite scary as to see how people or survivors would react in an end of the world tragedy. It is a film genre where an obscure place is found only to detect the profound horror governing the find. It would be like Hansel and Gretel who, lost in the woods, come across a gingerbread house which is a form of haven only to discover the truth behind who lives in the house.Without mistake the film does it very well.Now, for 28 weeks later, the ingenuity of the film relies on the postulate that a safe haven has been created for survivors and that life can continue. The evil is now, not inside but outside. One can compare with Anne Frank's diary where the father amid the war raging he believes life can go on even if they are imprisoned in the house attic where they found refuge.Yet, two children are brought in and meet their father who takes them in his loft and life as a family begins. Then, the boy misses his mother and with his sister go seek the home they lived in the country to seek out mementos like pictures. They find the mother, all are brought back to the city, the father reunites with his contaminated wife in the hospital, they kiss then hell breaks out.Finally, the two children are saved and brought to Paris and they are responsible for the contamination of the last French survivors as we see the zombies rush out of the metro at the Trocadero, Paris.The end of the two cities has come from the outside.Some would argue that this film has some analogies to the Iraq war.I would disagree since I see no glimpse such as symbols to the Iraqi war. However, I see some analogy to that of not protecting the borders of countries.With the breakdown of borders by the unification of Europe, probably it sends a negative message as to limit entry to those who may be like the Trojan horse; enter a city with an unclear motive without anyone noticing it and bring havoc.We see that today, some barriers are being installed as to limit unwanted immigration. Think of the barrier being mounted between the USA and Mexico, the wall already built in Jerusalem and now the whole of Europe with the Syrian immigrants, some countries creating barriers to slow their advance.Sad! indeed. And some argue that there are terrorists are among the lot thus build barriers so they can be filtered out.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Horror Movie of 2007 (and maybe ever!),"There hasn't been a horror movie like this in a very long time! Horror movies today only rely on gore to please the audience (which doesn't work anymore) but this film has a slightly different kind of gore. The gore is only used when it needs to be and sometimes has over the top scenes but it surprising makes the film more watchable!The acting was incredible! Everything they reacted to, you felt like you would do the exact same thing! Similar to the original, the actors aren't famous Hollywood stars that are recognized by everyone. They have the realistic looks of any average person. Which adds a lot more depth to their characters, and you know you can relate to them. The kids in the film were surprisingly good and intelligent unlike Hollywood child stars today.Throughout the film you are always engaged and want to watch more. When the movie ended I didn't want it to end, I kept wanting more and more non-stop action. The opening scene is a truly amazing classic horror film moment. Just from the beginning you can tell this movie will deliver what you were expecting and more!The music is great! The movie score does play the emotions of fear, sorrow, and emptiness very well. I simply can not wait for this film to come out on DVD. I recommend this film to every horror, thriller, action movie fan out there!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Better, but not scarier.","The sequel to 28 Days Later is 28 Weeks Later, and it's very good. There's a new director, a new story and characters, and WAY more production value. It took some warming up to(I was a little mixed after the ending), but this film is a definite watch. This is an action/horror/thriller with some really intense and well executed scenes of carnage and chases, as well as some fiery explosions that had me wide-eyed for the better part of 99 minutes. The film is not perfect of course, due to some very inept decision making by certain leads(a quality that always seems to pop up in standard horror) and a noticeable lack in the scare department; despite occasional scenes, the original takes the cake for the more frightening moments, though Weeks has its fair share of discomfort. But, it is not average, and a seasoned actor like Robert Carlyle ensured that it wasn't. He has some great scenes, and his acting abilities are fun to watch, ala Ravenous. Extremely loud sound effects and some bad choices aside, 28 Weeks Later is really fast-paced, violent fun with cool make-up and a decent soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror?  Oh yes...,"First thing - this is NOT a zombie film. Sorry to be pedantic, but zombies are a totally different premise. The people in this are DISEASED, not UNDEAD.Anyway, the review. It has been a very long time since I came out of a horror film and felt horrified. Yes, I know there are plot holes and continuity errors and the like, but really, if you're watching a film like this with that agenda, you're gonna find a problem.From the opening scene, the tension built and never let up. The main protagonists were put in an uncompromising situation from the start and when it seemed that it couldn't get any worse, guess what...Now I know there will be many who disagree with this, but let me qualify my statement. In order for you to feel this way, you have to be willing to suspend your disbelief (something that any movie fan should be au fait with) and try and put yourself in the same position as any of the characters. The true horror comes from being able to appreciate what is happening WITHIN the story that has been laid out for you.I don't want to say anything about the actual story, because 1) enough people have already and 2) this is an experience. Any fans of intelligent horror should see this film. Simple. As. That.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
28 Weeks Later,"28 Weeks Later has way different feel than 28 Days, but I did feel like the sequel lived up to my expectations and served justice to the original. This version has way more action in terms of death scenes and it seemed way more gory. Right from the beginning the action and scares occur with little development of the characters. I like Jeremy Renner a lot and thought this was the kick start to his phenomenal career since he was so great in this. The story jumps ahead a lot, which is why 28 Weeks Later gets an 8/10 but it didn't fail to entertain at any point. It's only a matter of time before 28 Months Later comes out, and I can't wait for it!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Chaos and disaster and quite scary,"I saw this before (and after) seeing 28 Days Later. While Days was about some individual survivors, (and had lots of silly flaws), Weeks has two strong story lines. One is about the family. There is Don (Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) at first hiding in a cottage while their children are safely in Spain on a school trip. The opening scene shows the dilemma that Don faces when threatened with attack. He panics, abandons Alice. Scary, how would I react?28 weeks later, the US/UN army has come to try and rebuild Britain. There are plane-loads of new people coming in, including Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), who are Don and Alice's. When Andy bemoans that they don't even have a picture of their mother, they sneak out of the secure zone and get back to their old house. They get a photo and collect some personal things, then... surprise, Alice is sheltering there.The army helicopters take them back to the medical centre, where Alice is scrubbed and a blood sample taken. Alas, she has the virus, but no symptoms, and so is immune and worthy of serious investigation. The army guys are real and likable (not like in Days). There are tender and intelligent scenes where Doyle (Jeremy Renner) shines. But they have to survive, and what ensues is awful.Now the second theme of the movie takes hold. How does officialdom cope? Containment, isolation, extermination. Code Red. Ghastly.We could think about the wider implications of the threats to civilization that an outbreak of Rage (the virus that causes it all), involve. Something like this. Scary.Superb acting, great writing, but I'm not sure about the wisdom of using a lot of hand-held-camera shots - very hard to follow.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great sequel, well thought out.","I wasn't a big fan of the original film. When I watched it in the cinema the first time, other than the superb London deserted scenes, I found most of it laughable.I did change my mind a bit after a couple more viewings but still didn't think that much of it.When I saw a sequel was coming and it involved the US army, Hollywood sell-out were my first thoughts.having just come from watching it, I stand corrected.Brilliantly darkly shot, and all with good reason. Emotion and intensity are much more important to this movie than your average horror.The scene in the underground, whilst seeing almost nothing, is one of the scariest scenes I've seen in a long time.I don't want to mention to much more about the plot, as so much of it would give away important aspects of the story.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Zombie Vomit,"For many others, it seems this sequel, ""28 Weeks Later,"" to ""28 Days Later"" (2002) was a success, but I think it's a failure. The formula of the first movie is difficult to replicate. It was a low-budget affair shot with the cheap and then-new technology of digital film that rather snuck up seemingly out of nowhere on audiences like a viral infection or a jump scare from a zombie. The shaky, low-resolution digital camerawork matched the grotesqueness of the scenario--not unlike the low production values of the zombie genre harbinger ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968). Right away, ""28 Weeks Later"" loses all of this.What we're left with is the mere nausea of the affected shaky cam and choppy cutting. There's the cliché, seizure-inducing blinking lights, day-for-night shooting, and characters stammering around in complete darkness except for the one with night vision, as if enacting some poor-man's version of ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), and occasional slow-mo shots seem haphazardly placed. The shots of abandoned streets are never as effective as before. Plus, bad child acting and a knockoff score. The action picks up once the zombies start to chase, but in between that the story is tripe. We don't get the notion of rage induced by TV viewing as in its predecessor or the parallel blood drop in the eye later; the equivalent analogy in the sequel, I suppose, would be the copious amounts of zombie vomit.One odd thing about these two movies is the role of the male hero in them. This one might seem as though it were subverting the trope, but it's really just reinforcing it by branding men as unmanly who don't rescue the screaming women and children depicted as helpless. The result is to make every character unlikeable. Not even bargain-priced Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), sniping with a sniper rifle instead of the bows and arrows, and Heimdall (Idris Elba), just as all-seeing with the security cameras, can save it. Smartly, director Danny Boyle and company of the first movie made the vastly superior ""Sunshine"" (2007) instead of this.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite possibly the best most horrifying zombie movie ever.,"Highly recommended for all fans of the genre. I cannot comprehend how they managed to film on such an extensive authentic area of GB! Amazing shots, incredible use of effects, gore, and sheer terror. True, maybe some of the plot twists are a little far-fetched, but that takes absolutely nothing from your viewing pleasure-pain. I have to say though, that plot-wise - it is still better than any other zombie flicks, including classics like ""Dawn Of The Dead"", and unlike their, ""28 Weeks Later""'s creators were not afraid to tackle the explanation to the epidemic, or the bigger picture, and didn't focus just on a group of survivors. A well deserved 10! enjoy biatches.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Strong sequel to the original, which it's fresh and different.","Donald (Robert Carlyle) and his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) are hiding in a farmhouse, somewhere in the south of England. They are hiding with a group of people (Amanda Walker, Shadid Ahmed, Garfield Morgan and Emily Beecham) until a mysterious little boy (Beans El-Balawi) comes running from these strange, infected people. Which these infected people are incredible violent, strong and they could turn into one of them by vomiting blood on you or biting. But these ""people"" tracked down the little boy and they enter violently in the house to affect other normal people. When Donald leaves his wife out of fear and he escapes by using the boat from hiding these ""people"". Months has passed... Now London is controlled by the U.S. Army. Which the Army are cleaning up the city and they are bringing people back to the city, hundreds people at the time. Donald is waiting for his two children... Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) are entering back to the city life. Andy is youngest child back in London. Their father is now working security in the city.Several soldiers are snipers in the city, which they are looking out for people in rooftops. Sergent Boyle (Jeremy Renner) is one of them looking out for the city and also becoming a voyeur, watching these survivors in the building with his scope in the night. Andy is been having nightmare and he fears, he cannot remembers his mother. Andy and his sister escapes from the security zone. They are going to the unsecured zone to their old home. Tammy gives her brother a picture of their mother, they found in the house. But Andy sees her mother hiding upstairs and she's not what she seems to be. Alice is infected but she seems perfectly normal and she's talking as well. She's carrier of the virus, she could infected people by biting or kissing as well. Major Scarlet (Rose Byrne), who's also a scientist. She thinks that Alice has a cure in her as well but General Stone (Idris Elda) wants to know nothing from hiding the cure or the situation of Alice as well. But when Donald goes sees his wife without thinking that she could be danger as well. When he kisses her passionately and he realized that his kiss to her wife becomes poison. He becomes one of the infected ""people"" and then he kills his wife from becoming a monster himself and from anger as well. Now he becomes an new carrier from the disease and he's infecting many people as well. Now the Army are up to no good and they have no other choice by going Code Red by killing infected ""people"" and civilians as well. Boyle figures that it's wrong to kill innocent people, he denies the orders and he goes to help the remaining survivors. Now Boyle, Scarlet, Tammy and Andy are trying to hide from the infected. Which they try to find a way to go away from the city and Which Boyle tries to convinced his helicopter pilot buddy (Harold Perrineau) to pick up him up along with the three survivors before it's too late.Directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto) made an thrilling sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later. Fresnadillo's remains being faithful to Boyle's vision on the first film but he also makes it his own. Fresnadillo made it creepy, scary, stylish, suspenseful with some terrific action sequences as well. The characters in the film are well-written and the actors made their roles extremely likable. You do care for these characters, if they make it or not. Sadly, this well received film didn't exactly pay off at the box office. But it will certainly do much better on DVD and it will have an big cult following as the original did.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also has an running commentary track from the screenwriter/director and screenwriter Enrique Lopez Lavigne. Which it's a solid commentary track, they give many trivia of the movie and as well for how technical the filming was. DVD also has three featurettes, two deleted scenes with optional commentary by the filmmakers and more. This is one of the strongest sequels i seen in a while. Fresnadillo did a terrific job with making this sequel. There's some jolts, some strong pay-offs, good performances by the cast and an unexpected coda as well. Which it's a great set-up for a promising third picture. Good cinematography by Enrique Chediak (Down in the Valley, The Faculty, Turistas) and an strong score by John Murphy (Basic Instinct 2, Miami Vice, Snatch.) highlights this sequel as well. Which Murphy did the rich score of the original as well. Don't miss this sequel. Screenplay by Rowan Joffe, director:Fresnadillo, Jesus Olmo and Enrique Lopez Lavigne.

"Poor, with some flourishes.","After the original 28 Days..such a standard and crap attempt to cash in.
Despite some stylistic and atmospheric scenes, at the beginning and 3rd act this plays out as a lazy cash in, it could have been so much better!!
The most annoying thing for me was the American army was deployed to save us Brits- despite our army, navy and air force deployed around the globe before the infection struck..just them to save us, total BS.

A film containing that much flaws and still so much fun? Awesome...,"!!!!!!This review contains a small amount of spoilers!!!!!!!I have to admit that I might be a little prejudged. I am a huge fan of zombie movies. You name a zombie movie, I've seen it and probably enjoyed it. Furthermore this film's predecessor, ""28 days later"", is one of my favorite movies.Does that mean this movie is without its flaws? Most certainly not. It doesn't resemble its predecessor at all. They could perfectly be seen separately. Still, I recommend you watch them both and in the correct order.A short summary: 28 weeks after patient Z, Britain has been declared free of infection and the NAVO has installed a military force in London and secured a safe zone. They let in civilians to repopulate the country. But of course (otherwise it wouldn't be much of a movie), something goes wrong. The infection spreads again, the military loses control and the survivors try to stay alive.I should probably start with mentioning the opening scene, which is one of the best scenes in any movie I have ever seen. It starts out slow and quiet, but then... The pacing, the action, that feeling you get. The song that accompanies the last part of this scene is awesome. You can hear it once again, around the middle part of the movie, in what is according to me the second best scene from the movie. The opening on its own is probably better than the rest of the movie, and captures the feel of the first movie. Something which the rest of the movie doesn't do quite well, since the focus has moved from just surviving to big-budget action.No character really stands out. You have a nice looking scientist, the standard ""bad-ass"" soldier, the commander that is willing to do all to be in control, some bland people that die very quickly. None of them are too smart, but this seems to be a trait which all but a few rare people in horror movies possess. The effects are fine, the zombies are fine, the ending decent enough. The action is done quite well, great when accompanied by the sublime music, mentioned above. Nothing really stands out, there's nothing really wrong either. Except...There is just one major thing (and it's major) I don't like about this movie. It has some totally illogical plot holes and errors. All movies have some, and I can live with that. Making mistakes is human, but in this movie some things are just inexplicably stupid. For the sake of not giving too much spoilers. I'll discuss one. John (a key role in the movie), who is the father of the 2 children that can be considered the main characters, is one of the few survivors who is already on the island when the civilians arrive. And he has been granted full access to all compounds, civilian and military alike, in the entire city. Don't you think this a very unlikely? Furthermore, he becomes some sort of a super-zombie, capable of teleportation and surviving a huge fireball. This is just one of the many mistakes in the movie. Some are just so obvious it hurts the brain to think about it. On the other hand, if you're one that doesn't mind these things or can get over it easily, there is nothing really wrong with the movie.This movie is a must for every horror fan, and zombie-lovers in general. It's generally good and really great in some parts, and those moments outweigh some of the more mind-boggling moments in the movie. Just know that you should probably not try to compare it to its predecessor.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

As good as a horror sequel can possibly be,"Being a huge fan of the first installment, I eagerly anticipated 28 weeks later. The movie starts with a highly suspenseful and terrific introduction that lets the audience know they wont be disappointed. After that, it slows down dramatically for about a half an hour. This interim while slow, serves the purpose of introducing the audience to the main characters, and there are quite a lot of them...In fact, I was unable to identify the protagonist of the movie. At first I thought it was Robert Carlyle's character, then Sgt. Doyle, then the very attractive medical officer, then Perrineau's character, then the boy, then the girl... and now that I have seen the entire movie, I still have no clue who the main character was. Perhaps this is a flaw in the plot, or perhaps it served to make the movie unique. I personally feel that the director intended for this to happen.Acting wise, the movie definitely delivered. The action and gore far surpassed the original as virtually all horror sequels do. There were several plot holes that I noticed, but I was willing to overlook them as the plot overall wasn't too bad. It was a little over the top at times, but in general, the plot was fairly clever and easy to follow.The movie was quite suspenseful with several shocking 'hearattack' moments. But it seemed to lack the underlying subtle terror that the original had. There was really nothing all that groundbreaking either. This film certainly didn't have the edge that 28 days later had but it made up for it with superior special effects and a more distinguished cast. While I really liked this movie as well as the original, I hope that there will not be a 3rd or 4th installment. I feel like it will only get much worse from here and the clever story, unique filming techniques, and everything else that made these two films solid will only get more mundane with another sequel. But be that as it may, a 28 months later seems all but inevitable.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Nil pois,"First of all, I love ""zombie"" films. I love them all, all of the Romero classics (yes, even land), night of the comet, fulci's zombi, the omega man; I even managed to watch zombies vs. vampires right to the end.28 weeks was breathtaking, frightening and action packed. That described the first five minutes of this film. What followed was an hour and a half of a dire, formulaic drivel, which left the audience wondering when something that was reminiscent of a script, would begin.The character development was absolutely zero, just a series of clichéd lines; the funniest of all was ""Its OK, it's just a flesh wound"". Any screen writer who uses this line should be shot  in fact that make that shot twice, just to make sure that its not ""just a flesh wound"".The settings and background were OK, I guess, although they weren't a patch on the original. Deserted streets, the odd rat, although ominously, no signs of fires, riots or any post apocalypse mayhem that one would have been expected. In fact London appears to have gone upmarket somewhat, since 28 days.As for ending, its was so predictable, it was almost laughable. It left it open for a sequel to a sequel. Lets hope that they don't bother.Nil poi.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Zombie Movie Ever,"Whoa! What an incredible film. A great sequel and a astounding achievement in it's own right. The night I went and saw this film, I was actually intending to see Pirates 3 but that session was completely sold out. So my friends and I settled for this. None of us had seen the first film in the franchise, ""28 Days Later"", but I had been told that you didn't have to, and I reaffirmed that for all my friends.
We went in and were all captivated by the opening scene, set in that warm, little country cottage where everything goes to hell. It really set the tone and pace for the film. What followed after the opening scene was arguably the best zombie film I have seen since ""Dawn of the Dead"". The real themes here were panic and reaction, displayed by the characters in their response to what was going on around them.
There were some very disturbing and intense scenes in this film, including the interaction between the husband and wife, where one of them became an ""Infected"". Then towards the end of the picture, when the female doctor is guiding the kids through the darkened subway, using the night vision scope on her rifle to guide the way. That moment really captured the fear inherited with darkness, claustrophobia and the unknown.
So I didn't get to see Pirates 3 that night, but instead saw a film I wasn't intending to see and had one hec of an experience. For the whole running time, I forgot I was watching a film; instead feeling like I was right there in the thick of it, and I went home with an upset feeling that if something like that virus being unleased on earth really happened one day, it would be just like the events of ""28 Weeks Later"".

Abysmal,"A terrible sequel to a bad movie. 28 Days Later was a nonsensical film in which characters pretty much cause their own death most of the time and where nothing they do ever seems to make any sense. The sequel does pretty much the same, except the nonsense is ramped up even more. They allow a guy to be with an infected woman alone, and when he acts like an idiot and gets himself infected, there is no system in place to stop the spread of infection. From then on, it's one stupid thing after another. Complete lack of logic and nothing but plot convenience. The third act is boring and the ending is not one bit satisfying.

Relentless and Intense Follow-Up,"'28 Weeks Later' is an action-packed, gripping, tension and worthy sequel to the incredible apocalyptic zombie horror flick '28 Days Later' from 2002 that provides a distinct self-contained premise that effectively balances action, horror, intelligence and emotional depth to provide a gruelling yet thrilling viewing experience. While it lacks the originality or the imagination that the first one had, it's still an enjoyable follow-up and a decent entry in the zombie horror sub-genre.The Plot = Taking place six months after the initial rage virus was inflicted upon the population of Great Britain, the US army helps to secure a small area of London for the survivors to start again. However, the deadly virus soon returns, and all hell breaks loose.While this movie may be a bit lacking when compared to the first one, it's certainly not bad or redundant by any means as it does a genuinely compelling job at not only following on from the events of its predecessor, but it provides its own interesting story as it dives into some gritty realism and thought-provoking themes such as the dark side of human nature and the decisions people make when in extreme circumstances adds some real complexity to the movie. The direction this time around by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is incredibly strong as he provides some impressive visuals and striking imagery into the production and really ramps up the intensity and suspense when needed and gives the movie a number of genuinely intense moments, scary scenes and plenty of zombie gore goodness. Although it gets a little too frantic at times and the use of shaky cam was a bit overused, but for the most part it was very well handled.The cast performances here are fantastic with Robert Carlyle giving a compelling performance as the anti-hero Don and he really brings this role to life. Jeremy Renner gives a solid and likeable performance as Sgt Doyle. Rose Byrne gives a good performance as Major Scarlett. Catherine McCormack was excellent as Alice, while Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton each gives solid and well-rounded performances as the teens.Overall '28 Weeks Later' is a fantastic, relentless and intense sequel to the original and while it doesn't reach those levels, it's still a great zombie flick in it's own right.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic horror flick moments.,"Great great follow-up of a film. Not quite as good as the original but many shining moments. The first 10 mins is spectacular as far as zombie films go and there are many more moments later in the flick where this thing shines. Where Romero left off with Night of the Living & Dawn of the Dead, this new zombie genre picks up. Romero completely lost his touch on his 3rd film and in 28 Weeks Later you can see what Romero's original vision should have been on the bigscreen. I am so glad someone finally took over the reigns (even through the course of 2 different directors) from Romero 25+ years later. The music in the film is incredibly rich and intense and gives the entire picture wings. Do yourself a big favor and watch this baby on the bigscreen. Please.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is a real movie adaptation of Resident Evil 2 & 3; sequel exceeds the original,"** minor spoilers but nothing crucial **My interest in 28 Weeks Later peaked when I read Fangoria magazine on the making of 28 Weeks Later and I learned Spanish filmmakers were working on it which I thought unusual. It was a fascinating behind the scenes story, but then I forgot about it when the actual movie came out. I was too preoccupied with searching for gainful employment at the time.I assumed that because of the four credited screenwriters, the movie would end up weak that turn out disappointing, as in many cases of past movies. I did not expect better when I decided to rent the movie (actually had to ask a video clerk if it's checked in yet at the counter) just to pass the time. I thought 28 Days Later was alright, nothing to write home about, except for maybe a lousy ending.I popped the DVD in at around 3 a.m. Sunday morning because I had nothing to do. I believe watching the movie at night in the early morning was a factor in what turns out one of the most frightening and intense horror movies I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty of horror movies. I did not even see the trailer before the movie came out in theaters and I always assume horror sequels suck (Saw II the worst I've seen in years, thanks to hideously lame story and nauseating MTV rapid editing, Saw III just as bad for its excessive gore as torture porn) so these factors helped a great deal in lowered expectation.The movie completely floored me after ten minutes intro. 28 Weeks Later is an adrenaline action horror thriller with high-octane intensity and more than adequate character development usually neglected in inferior horror movies. The only frightening horror movies I saw were standard haunted house (The Changeling), stalking killer ('78 Halloween, first four Friday the 13th movies) and sci-fi horror (Alien & '82 The Thing) fares. Gory horror pictures do not provide fright but only revulsion and disgust -- Haute Tension being a particularly execrable movie for this reason alone.28 Weeks Later have massive amount of gore, but strangely it did not repulse me. Sped-up motion editing helped in this case to make it much more intense and frightening. Honestly, there are scenes with so much severed limbs and gore the movie should have gotten a NC-17 (Canada and UK gave it 18 certificate). The gore actually served the story rather than simplistic throw-away gore to appease the gorehounds like the hackneyed horror movies that emphasize excessive gory violence and geysers of blood for the sake of gore. This time it *really works* in a horror movie, which is exceedingly rare. Because 28 Weeks Later is an unbelievably violent movie with gallons of blood and pounds of severed flesh, it's definitely not for the squeamish or average moviegoer with aversion to horror genre.The story departs from the usual cliché in repetition already done in the original, and this is very uncommon. It's like the horror equivalent of Babe: Pig in the City in daringly original and refreshing storytelling when the torch is passed. Sure, there may be questionable plot holes and implausibilities (especially genetic immunity to the virus) in the sequel, but the story and action are so tense and compelling the flaw can be overlooked to bask in the wild ride.The movie is incredibly realistic in the depiction of the dystopian future of London, and I can imagine the same would happen in American and European cities where the cities brought to a complete standstill in barren post-apocalyptic wasteland feel eerie and depressing. The spectacular VFX effects and production design are excellent compliments to the story and action which made it feel like you are there in an alternative reality. However, the ending alone is very dark and depressing, so it shouldn't be a surprise. I did not expect the sequel to 28 Days Later which I thought was well-made but mediocre and I have no idea how the producers will come up with the second sequel to complete the trilogy since it's too much to think the virus might have taken over the entire planet to usher in the extinction of mankind.28 Weeks Later reminds me of Capcom's Resident Evil video game franchise (particularly 2 and 3 for PlayStation) I played several years ago. The firebombing of London is eeriely reminiscent of the nuclear attack on Raccoon City that conclude the ending of Resident Evil 3 as well as the atrocity of Dresden, Germany during WWII. I never saw any Resident Evil movie, not even Extinction, but 28 Weeks Later is true to the spirit of Resident Evil series in ""survival horror"" to put it in plain term. Resident Evil 5 for PlayStation 3 will be a great compliment to 28 Weeks Later, as the millions of views for the trailer of the game attest on YouTube.All in all, a masterpiece of horror genre -- one of the best movies of 2007 and a supremely well-made film that not only exceed the original but a total triumph in movie-going experience where the combination of horror and gore is a legitimate form of storytelling without unnecessary abuse by sheer indulgence in the pointlessness of excess gore.**** out of four starsPostscript: upon further research, I found out the Spanish filmmakers made Intacto, which was a truly exceptional thriller suitable for double billing with Nine Queens. Kudos to Danny Boyle for enjoying Intacto so much he made a deal with the Spaniards to make the first sequel that's better than the first for some viewers for its taut & claustrophobic story with emphasis on emotionally complex outlook.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunting and genuinely scary,"One of the better horror movies I've seen in quite a while. I really liked this, I think I might have even enjoyed it more than the first movie. Haunting and genuinely scary with an excellent story that gets marks for originality, has a superb soundtrack and a wow opening sequence -intense & scary- that really sets the pace for the remainder of the movie.This sequel picks up 28 weeks after the ""rage virus"" has decimated the city of London, leaving it a ghost town. The virus has been eradicated, the infected have starved and an American led NATO force has moved in to restore order and supervise the repopulation of the quarantined city. For the most part we follow the Harris family, led by Robert Carlyle who is newly reunited with his children when a carrier of the virus enters the safe zone, the military loses control and all hell breaks loose again.It has a gritty look to it with loads of weird camera angles; overhead, close up, shaky and grainy and of course all the shots of the deserted London streets, eerie. Its gory and graphic, about what I'd expect from a zombie movie unlike WWZ which I watched the other night this is a genuine horror flick not an action-thriller/disease movie.The cast surprised me here too with turn ins from Jeremy Renner, Rose Byrne and a small role from Idris Elba. I do like me some Robert Carlyle and he does a fantastic job. I even enjoyed his kids and kids story lines often annoy me. 3/14/16",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Recommended!!,"I remember watching 28 Days Later (2002) a long time ago and thinking that it was a great zombie classic. And this sequel lives up to it pretty well. It doesn't top the first movie, put it offers plenty of explosive zombie gore and buckets of blood, some intense atmosphere and the cast does a good job. Imogen Poots, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner and Mackintosh Muggleton are strong and believable in their roles. It offers the same gritty and shaky camera work that its predecessor had, and even recycles its musical theme. This sequel is also interesting because it deals with themes of mass hysteria and human nature. Overall, I was entertained by it, 28 Weeks Later is a good and gory horror follow up to a classic genre pic, and I really hope that those talks about other future sequels being in the works are really happening. Recommended!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Excellent as a horror movie, but not very realistic","As zombie movies go, this is a really good movie. John Murphy's soundtrack is really powerful, the scenes are rough and intense without being gratuitous, the acting is reasonable.I compare zombie movies with colonial army movies. You know, naked drug crazed Africans attack the organized British armies and win because no one expected them to be so ferocious and oblivious to pain. But this can only work once. Someone please tell me why no one put an automated machine gun on a pole. Or simpler still, bring a tank! As soon as a zombie appears, everybody starts acting like a scared kitten!And there is a personal disappointment here as well. I knew the movie was with Robert Carlyle and I expected a larger, maybe lead role, as I know he is a great actor. Well, if I think about it, the role was big compared to those of the other actors.Anyway if you want thrills, this is the movie for you. But you gotta bring your own suspension of disbelief and leave your woman some place else.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
WOW now thats a really good movie,"This movie is by far the best movie I have seen this year, has a decent story although there are a few places where i thought ""What The?"", but overall it is a solid, sometimes chilling and thoroughly entertaining ride. Some great camera work especially the night scope scene, scary stuff, and a few other places where i was very impressed. Some solid acting and storyline, make this definitely one of the best movies that you will this year.Just a few places that i felt disappointed were in the storyline where i couldn't help but think to myself ""What The?"". And there are some areas where you as the viewer will say to yourself ""thats just stupid"" and others where you will genuinely feel for the characters as you yourself would have acted in possibly exactly the same way if in a situation that was similar.So if your after a few scares then this is definitely the best place to start.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Worthy Follow up to a Fine Film,"Without Danny Boyle in the Director's chair, i feared that the essence that made '28 Days Later' so good would get lost; but Juan Carlos Fresnadillo clearly knows how to keep a winning recipe, and once again we are treated to a fine horror movie.'28 Weeks Later' doesn't hang around before it gets going, it's pretty much straight into the action and horror, and once its there it keeps going at a steady pace throughout. The story is well constructed, and everything falls into place nicely, leaving just enough to the viewers imagination to keep our minds stimulated.The dark and creepy tone that succeeded in the first film is retained, and the infected once again bring real terror to the screen, but the all new cast inject enough freshness to make this film every bit as good as the first, with some excellent stunts and action sequences thrown in for good measure.If you enjoyed the first outing for the infected, this is quite simply a must see movie.Credit to everyone involved, it's a sequel to be proud of! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a movie. I am shocked!,"I have been thinking about the movie forward and backward, unfortunately I tried and tried so hard and could not appreciate a single bit of the movie. 28 weeks later is a movie with a lot of big questions, so much questions that I would want to criticize. Nevertheless, after destroying 100mins of my life, I really cannot get into the detail of criticism now. From the start, nothing personal, but the kids just cannot act. Furthermore, I hardly have seen a movie that has been rated 8.0 without any actual storyline. Moreover, it was barely scary and extremely boring. To conclude the problem with the movie is without any acting, any storyline and you what I don't even want to spend time in commenting this movie further. If you don't believe what you have just read, go and watch the movie. But friends, spend your time wisely.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
That was an entertaining zombie horror movie.,"28 Weeks Later (2007) was a damn entertaining zombie horror movie and it was an excellent sequel to 28 Days Later (2002).Positives for 28 Weeks Later (2002):
This movie takes the simple premise of the original and amplifies all of the action, horror and gore up to 10. The movie has a significantly bigger budget and it shows from beginning to end. I like that the movie starts off very slow in the first half and then goes completely wild during the second act. The performances from the cast with Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Catherine McCormack, Harold Perrineau, Imogen Poots, Idris Elba, Mackintosh Muggleton and Jeremy Renner are all phenomenal. The makeup effects for the zombies looks amazing and very gruesome. And finally, I liked the ending to the movie.Negatives for 28 Weeks Later (2007):
The movie does lack the emotional human elements of the original in favor of a more bombastic gorefest and while I did appreciate that, I could feel that emotional element missing from this movie.Overall, 28 Weeks Later (2007) is an excellent zombie horror and a fantastic continuation of this franchise. I can't wait to see 28 Years Later (2025) in June.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Flick!!!,"I just watched this sequel with high hopes...and I was not disappointed. It came through with a solid punch, that occasionally left my stomach queasy- which is what I paid for.If you are a fan of 28 Days, Hostel, The Hills have Eyes, Rejects... this film will provide you with enough gore to satisfy your thirst.Yet, what really impressed me was the psychological hook that sank in my jaw. If you watch it with a ""what if that was me"" mentality, it adds a whole other dimension to the terror within the story. Without spoiling- the first scene between the Husband, Wife, and the Infected had me freakin out! Bravo!Well worth it and definitely in my top 20 Horror/Thriller/Sci-Fi Films!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I love this movie.,"I've seen this movie a bunch of times. Just watched it again the other night for spooky season. It's pretty much a perfect zombie film.We start out where London has been decimated by the rage virus which turns people into raving mad, blood thirsty zombies which immediately get turned the moment they get bit. No waiting around feeling bad like Night of the Living Dead(still a classic tho) but these zombies run fast, they turn fast and run fast. They've brought the American army in to help which consists of master chief Idris Elba and expert sniper Jeremy Renner. Also the head doctor, beautiful Rose Byrne of Insidious fame.The story basically follows a family who's been attacked and effected by this rage virus. I won't spoil it but the two kids were out of town when the virus hit so they come in to the new District One which is a place they have quarantined and made safe to hold uninfected people till they rebuild London back up. But of coarse, things go awry.This stars two of my favorite male actors in Idris Elba and Jeremy Renner so maybe I'm a little biased in loving this one so much, but nah this is a really good movie. It's gory, it's action packed, tension filled and heart warming at times. Like I said, I've watched it more than once so it's gotta be pretty good cos I have excellent taste.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great horror/thriller (NO SPOILERS),"I am appalled by how bad and by the numbers most new movies are these days. I find 9 out of 10 movies to be rated 5/10 or below and a much higher percentage of horror movies. This movie is the rare exception.I liked 28 Days Later but didn't think it was great. I also didn't expect the sequel 28 Weeks Later to live up to the hype. I was dead wrong. 28 Weeks Later easily surpassed the first movie.I am not going into specifics because I don't want to ruin this for anyone who has not seen this flick.I think it is safe to assume that everyone knows this is about a deadly virus that turns people into flesh tearing vicious killers.This movie was filmed beautifully (even being brutal). The director used great cuts, closeups, shaky cameras, loud audibles, etc but unlike many films he actually managed to create a feeling of dread and chaos.The movie also makes you feel sympathy for several of the characters and pity. It does show the best and worst of human behavior and emotions.Don't get me wrong. This is a very violent flick and probably extremely scary to many. The movies characters action do feel real whether logical or out of panic. You have to have a level of suspension of disbelief in order to believe the premise but the director pulls you into this movie.The movie starts out fast and furious and then builds the main plot before going back to the action, suspense, and gore.I gave this movie and 8/10 which is about as high of praise as I could give to not a zombie movie per se but very close.If you like good movies and/or like horror, this is a good one to catch. It actually might be too intense for some moviegoers.Dean",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
What more do you want in a zombie movie.,"It's awesome. Ignore the snob know it all film buffs talking about it can't be better than the first. It's way way better! I loved both films but this is one of those rare examples where the second movie takes it to be next level. Probably only the original budget stopped the first being like this. That said, the rawness of the first film with more engagement with the cut down actors to match the budget did lend itself to being more character immersive.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Harrowing Tale of Survival,"28 Weeks Later (2007) is a gripping and intense horror-thriller that serves as a worthy sequel to the critically acclaimed 28 Days Later. Directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the film is a harrowing tale of survival that explores the devastating consequences of a deadly virus.Set in the aftermath of the initial outbreak, 28 Weeks Later follows the efforts of the US Army to restore order to the UK. When a group of survivors is discovered in a safe zone, the soldiers allow them to return to their homes, despite the risk of infection. However, when the virus resurfaces and spreads once again, the survivors are forced to fight for their lives against hordes of infected.The movie is a masterclass in tension and suspense. The pacing is tight, with each scene ratcheting up the tension and keeping the audience on the edge of their seat. The action sequences are thrilling and visceral, with the infected portrayed as truly terrifying monsters.The performances in 28 Weeks Later are also top-notch. The cast includes talented actors such as Robert Carlyle and Rose Byrne, who deliver emotionally charged performances that lend weight and depth to the characters.One of the strengths of the film is its exploration of the human psyche in times of crisis. The movie raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of humanity and the lengths that people will go to in order to survive.The cinematography and special effects in 28 Weeks Later are also impressive. The movie is shot with a gritty and realistic style that adds to the feeling of tension and dread. The use of practical effects and make-up for the infected is also commendable, with the creatures looking truly horrifying and otherworldly.In conclusion, 28 Weeks Later is a must-see for fans of the horror genre. The movie is a thrilling and intense ride that explores the darkest aspects of human nature. With top-notch performances, stunning cinematography, and terrifying special effects, this is a sequel that lives up to the high standards set by its predecessor.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderfully Exquisite,"This sequel to ""28 Days Later"" delivers more and more than it's predecessor, but also certainly fills in several gaps in the original. The disease has been contained, but only for a short time as the disease makes it to the ""clean"" side of the country, and all Hell breaks loose once again.The main character, after being chased away by the infected, is kept safe until an unexpected visitor arrives from the infected area. The disease is back, and this time, it might just call for extermination.""28 Weeks Later"" is an incredible film, and delivers so many emotions that not many, (if any) other zombie films can even begin to compete with.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the worst sequels of all time,"If rating 28 Weeks Later with a zero was possible, I'd have done it.Now, I usually hate sequels that have neither the original cast or creative team behind them. This film is no exception. I'll try and keep it succinct.So: you take a BRILLIANT film with poignant and beautiful direction and a stellar cast and script about a story of the apocalypse and how derelict and alone the world is. And you takeaway the meaning behind it, destroy the lore of the film, nullify the impact and sense of the ending, change the director and script writer and Americanize the hell out of it.The first film had no scope for a sequel, least of all one that makes absolutely no sense and opens a plethora of gaping plot holes.The whole idea of the first one was that THE INFECTION WAS ONLY HAPPENING IN ENGLAND. The whole world was operating normally. It was just England, sitting there by itself. Left alone. And that's how it should have stayed. We can see in the end that there IS a cure to infection. Starvation. They AREN'T (although the sequel would have you think otherwise), zombies. They starve out in a matter of weeks.So, in summation. If you like: big explosions, lots of gore, Americans, ridiculous and unrealistic scenes and a plot that makes no sense. . . this is the film for you.If you are a fan of good cinematography, cohesion and general sense. . . watch 28 Days Later (and its stand-alone series THE RAGE - you can find it on YouTube), and give this pisspoor excuse for a film a miss.Happy watching,Labrat",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely worth seeing,"Not many horror sequels have what it takes to keep a franchise going without falling flat on their heads. The Nightmare on Elm Street series (with the exception of New Nightmare) were a total waste of time to film buffs. Friday the 13th was just a slice and dice gag. The Halloween sequels after part 2 were a waste (4 and 5 come in third place for trying).Yet, 28 Weeks Later is the first in many sequels where you don't want to leave your seat when the first noise is made.The film starts in the country side of London where a group of people are hiding in a cottage house before being invaded by a group of flesh eating monsters killing them off one by one as a lone survivor (Robert Caryle) manages to escape; heading off to downtown London where everything is quarantined thanks to the U.S. Special Forces keeping an eye on things where if the people are infected they must be shot immediately. After all hell breaks loose in the city of London, a group of survivors from two children, a nurse, and a gun sniper must do what they can to survive where this stylish sequel is more gruesome and meaner than ""28 Days Later"" and shows no mercy on the gore.Just remember this: It's just a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very strong acting in an excellent movie,"Just a great movie. Some extra terrific scenes! The infrared taking in the subway is just fantastic. I wonder of the makers of Cloverfield got some inspiration from this scene? I think there are some remarkable acting performances. Robert Carlyle... man isn't he one of the most genuine actors to be found? And Imogen Poots (playing the young girl Tammy) is one of the biggest possessions in the movie. She is absolutely fantastic portraying that character. Just perfect acting. And she is a very good looking girl too. if she is not going to be a superstar, then I rest my case.Lost-lovers will also amused because Harrold Perrineu is in the cast , and plays a pretty important character.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Fantastic Ferociously Frantic & Tense Horror Thriller Classic!!!,"The first 28 Days Later is a modern Horror Classic & one of the scariest ""Infected"" movie's ever made!!!Yes these are the ""Infected"" & Not Zombies, these are humans transformed by the Rage Virus & not brought back to life from dead as in Zombies.The opening infected seige sequence at the farm house is my favourite zombie/infected scene ever!!! The frantic seige of that farm house followed by the extremely suspenseful chase is some of the greatest scenes ever committed to film for pure terror. Robert Carlyle is so believable as he's helpless & full of absolute fear & he just runs & runs, it's an adrenaline fuelled nail-biting sequence that's the best of both great films. A sequel that is just as intensely terrifying & frantically ferocious as the Classic original.Now, This fantastic Sequel takes the ""Aliens"" approach as it has lots more action & monsters for an Action-packed Horror sequel. Everything here is tightened up more & bigger in scale for fear & tension but i do still prefer the quietness, full of dread fear atmosphere from the first film, that really gets under the skin & makes you on feel on edge, but the tone & atmosphere is still strong & thick here but there's much more characters around this time so the scary isolated & lonely feel is not as strong here.People are starting to repopulate England, London & life is trying to get back to normal with the help of the U. S Army keeping watch & on guard. Everything feels realistic & the opinion sequence is absolutely terrifying & nearly equels the terror of the first film. We get an excellent & powerful performance from Robert Carlyle & his opening scene is energetic & heart-pounding with terror as Carlyle runs from lots of the Infected from his hideout farmhouse to the lake & IT'S pure Horror & gripping as hell!!!A superb opening to set in stone that this sequel is gonna be just as Horrific as it's Classic first film.The cast is excellent here with, like I've said Robert Carlyle, also Jeremy Renner, Rose Byrne, Idris Elba, Harold Perrineau, Imogen Poots & more. A solid cast of both American & British talent working together.The usually great, Jeremy Renner stands out as expert Sniper-soldier Doyle, a ""Hicks"" type of Good & strong take charge type of Soldier, a great heroic performance & my favourite character out of these films.Rose Byrne is also excellent as Scarlet, a scientist who bands together with the two kids & Sargent Doyle. The performances are excellent throughout this nail-biting shocker Masterpiece.The Rage Virus obviously infects & spreads through the Country again & all hell breaks loose again & this time a group of survivors, including some kids & soldiers are on the run through London trying to survive from the Infected as well as the Soldiers that are wiping out anything that moves, Infected or not.The infected are absolutely scary as hell again like the first flick & to me are probably the scariest Creatures to ever chase Humans in the Horror genre.There's lots of super scary & intense moments scattered throughout the movie & everything is done in a gritty & raw look like the first but also in a Cinematic way & not like the low-budget look & feel of the Classic first film but as said the raw & frantic style is still here.28 Weeks Later is an excellent sequel & is just as much terrifying fun as the original & both are excellent in my opinion!!!!I loved both films in all their terrifying,gritty & gory glory!!!Truly a Terrifying Movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Go see it!,"By far the best movie I've seen. 28 Weeks Later blows the original movie, 28 Days Later out of the water, which is a first for me in regards to a sequel. I know some people think it was too high budget in comparison to the first, but ignore them. For what was required for 28 Weeks Later, it is justified. What really brought this movie to its potential is how realistic the movie seemed. Most of these types of movies use maybe a mall and a few streets, but 28 weeks later used the whole city London. Which I'm sure was quite difficult to remove all signs of life from a real, active city. There were only a very few sections of obvious CG, the rest fit in perfectly. For movies, especially of this genre, I usually notice the music right away, but in 28 Weeks Later the scene were either almost over or already over before I realized that music was playing. The actors were all perfect for their rolls, especially Mackintosh Muggleton (Andy) who is now my favorite actor. The only complaint I have from 28 Weeks Later is that it left me feeling like part of the ending was completely skipped, leaving out a portion of what the movie was building up to. This will probably be fixed either the bonus features on the DVD, or in 28 Months Later.I will be seeing it for a third time shortly.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best zombie films ever made,"I loved the first film (28 days later) but this sequel just was even better. It was packed full of intense zombie chases and fight scenes, and was an accurate (If that's possible) view into what it would be like during a zombie apocalypse. Robert Carlyle is as brilliant as always, and Rose Byrne is great as-well. It does British cinema proud and is probably one of the best zombie films ever made. It follows on well from the first film and has intense scenes such as when the night vision is used towards the end. Would 100% recommend watching. It's obviously intense and graphic, but not super extreme. It's another great example of British film making and does the horror genre proud.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Entertaining, violent and intelligent","A very good zombie film, it even surpasses its predecessor, the very worthy 28 Days Later. Directed by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the movie starts 28 weeks after the first film. With the first outbreak apparently ended, an American led military force arrives at the deserted London (in a not so subtle allusion to the occupation of Iraq), securing certain areas and allowing English citizens who have been abroad during the outbreak to return. Among them are two children (played by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton; one of the best scenes of the movie has nothing to do with zombies and have them running through the deserted streets of the English capital). As expected, though, the zombies have not exactly disappeared, and are bound to return with a vengeance. Robert Carlyle does a fine turn here as a survivor of the first outbreak who becomes infected here (and the opening scene is great). Intelligent, very bloody, entertaining, what more can you ask from a horror film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Answering the negative reviews,"Having read a number of the negative reviews here there seems to be a couple of points which are continually raised. The first is the shaky camera work. Which I do agree can be a gimmick and pointless an attempt to make the movie seem fresh and new whereas really its just ripping off what another director has done before, this is in some films. This is a roller-coaster ride of a film. When the camera is strapped to the side of someone sprinting away from the infected, you are too. Therefore in this movie I feel it is entirely appropriate and adds to the viewers experience and immersion in the instant of what is happening.The second point that negative reviews raise are plot holes. Now there are a few small ones if you wish to watch the movie time and time again going through it with a tooth comb. But the ones that are raised by the negative reviews I would say are not plot holes. First I should say that this movie has within it a discussion around combat and events happening, still happening in Iraq. Taking this into account the infected become the 'terrorist' or 'freedom fighters' who can be confused among the civilians. As with the Iraq parallel it is hard to tell them apart from 15,000 ft or through a hazy night scope at 300m. The film tries to explain why Iraq is such a mess, why the situation is so complex and untenable. The mistakes that the soldiers the characters and the powers that be make in this movie are not designed to help advance the plot, I think the plot (the journey of the children to their escape) was bent to fit these events. And these mistakes I believe mirror the colossal mistakes which have happened in Iraq. The pilot, the sniper, seeing a group of unidentified people and being ordered to kill them, they're terrorists, they're infected.Why repopulated London? Why fly coca cola reps out to the green zone in Baghdad? These are the points I feel the movie was trying to put across. And I believe the movie is far better for it. I feel that this equals the first movies quality and drive, but it does this in a more dangerous way. By massively increasing the scale to the real time fate of a city rather than the small band in the first movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Now this is the way to do a sequel.,"28 Weeks Later reviewed by Samuel OsbornNow this is the way to do a sequel. 28 Weeks Later draws a terrific blueprint for future horror sequels to follow. As usual, it wasn't possible to bring on board the original director (Danny Boyle of Trainspotters fame) and the original writer (Alex Garland) to work on the sequel to 28 Days Later. Instead, the two worked as producers and found an apt replacement: Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. Not many saw Fresnadillo's startling feature debut, Intacto, but those who did remember it well. Intacto was compelling, dark, and precisely intelligent. The same adjectives can quite fittingly be glued upon Fresnadillo's second feature film, 28 Weeks Later.The sequel fortunately doesn't require audiences to have seen the original. Days have turned to weeks and the story of Cillian Murphy's survival in posthumous England is finished; not continued maybe because of reasons similar to the non-return of Mr. Boyle and Mr. Garland. Anyway, 28 Weeks Later brings us up to speed with a concise recap of England's resuscitation by United States and NATO forces. The infected (i.e. Zombies) have been cleared of the island and citizens are slowly being allowed entry into what is called District 1. The United States Army inhabits this region, beginning what is a modest allegory running parallel to the present war in Iraq. The first children allowed into District 1 are Tammy and Andy (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton), rejoining their father after separation due to the infection. Their father, Don (Robert Carlyle), we learn through the grisly opening sequence, is a selfish twerp who abandoned his wife for the sake of his singular survival. But as a peculiarity in his wife's genetic ordering renders her semi-immune to the zombies' virus, the importance of his children's safety becomes a priority to the United States Army. Without giving too much away, this peculiarity sets off a reaction that brings the virus into District 1's core, causing another gory eruption of glorious, limb-tearing zombie violence.The plot, like in any horror sequel, requires the help of a league of peripheral characters to shore up the holes and contrivances it leaves leaking. Along with the children, there are the parents, the scientists, the Army commanders and the snipers for the screenplay to shadow as the infection pierces the confines of District 1. Luckily, Fresnadillo and his writers shrug off most of the symptoms of sequelitis, leaving only a couple glaring plot conveniences that are cause for unintentional laughter. (Explaining these plot hiccups would spoil some hearty surprises). For the most part they manage to find cleverly plausible situations for all these characters to inhabit, each setting off a reaction for the other to deal with, making for a high velocity of smart storytelling.As in the original, the scares come as frequently as the action, with both Mr. Boyle and Mr. Fresnadillo allowing the suspense to open the throttle onto full-fledged chases and action spectacles. There's no reliance on cats jumping out of dark closets and no reliance on nauseating, bucket-filling gore. His scares are clever and always compelling. The camera is continuously hand-held, finding the candid beauty in all the Zombie-fleeing and sometimes also finding honest emotion in the characters' stories.About the same time I screened 28 Weeks Later I was close to finishing Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer-winning novel The Road. The book is another riff on post apocalyptic survival, a theme apparently at the forefront of pop culture's psyche. McCarthy rendered his characters subject to their environment, characters without control over their destiny, no plot convenience to allow them redemption. The novel is devastating and soulful, exciting and terrifying. 28 Weeks Later relies on convenience no more so than any other Zombie picture, but the convenience is still contrivance. The film kneels at the feet of spectacle; required to find shortcuts to flare reactions and achieve emotional benchmarks. It is more important that we don't see two zombies killed by the same means; creative extermination is more important than any character evolution.But the comparison is maybe unfair. What is at stake artistically isn't much to 28 Weeks Later. The bottom line is still a zombie and his appetite. Except, both works employ similar devices to conjure realism: Fresnadillo's hand-held camera is the same as McCarthy's non-usage of punctuation. They're clever immersion tricks. Each auteur wants us to believe wholly in their world, zombie or not. 28 Weeks Later is near to such success as The Road, though hampered by its purpose as spectacle. The spectacle, after all is told, is still spectacular, however undeserving it may be.Samuel Osborn",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
And the award for most typical movie of the year goes to . . .,"My only major problem with 28 Weeks Later is that there is nothing to separate it from the hundreds of other zombie movies, or in this case wannabe zombie movies, because the zombies really aren't zombies. Every single scene in this movie I've seen before. The virus-that-turns-people-into-zombies plot has been done more times than a dried-up hooker. And that is it. The movie doesn't try to take the sub-genre any further than it already was back in the 60s, and it doesn't attempt to add any intelligent twist to the formula. It does nothing that hasn't been copied and then copied again.What I just mentioned is why, even with all the well-done action, I really just wanted to turn 28 Weeks Later off and go to bed. It bored me because it was predictable, unoriginal, and exactly like the other zombie movies that bored me to tears. Yes, 28 Weeks Later is far superior to bore-fests like the remake of Dawn of the Dead, which had less zombie action than god-forsaken Juno. But at the same time, 28 Weeks Later bored me just as much because it copied scenes from that remake, and copied scenes from every other zombie movieI, and most likely you as well, have seen every scene in this movie before. Every last one. Any supposed intensity is zapped out due to this fact, because you know who is going to live and who will diethe scenes are that predictable.The other problem is the atmosphere. Or, more accurately, the problem is the fact the movie doesn't even attempt at creating a solid atmosphere, which would have helped it out a lot. The reason Cloverfeild and the original Alien were both so effective was because they understood how to create the perfect doom atmosphere. But while cliché movies like 28 Weeks Later will take up an hour of screen time to set up a drama behind the flat characters in order to give them characterization (which never works and didn't work here either), it never takes time to create atmosphere, which would be much more effective. There was no suspense. There was just the predictable: open with action, take an hour for drama, have the most action, then end with a cute, trite ending. So many directors/writers think that is the only way to develop a movie, but they're wrong. Let me repeat myself: they're wrong and cliché and pretensions and know nothing about good storytelling. I wish someone in the movie business would understand this.Technical aspects are amazing. The flash-cutting isn't done as well as in Saw, but it's a lot better than I've seen. The movie has one of the best soundtracks, and best use of its soundtrack I've heard in a long time. The style is also pretty cool. And, I'm shocked to say, this movie had enough blood to actually earn its R-rating, which made me happy. There isn't a whole lot of violence/gore, but what is there is very nicely done and bloody. It's sad, however, to see all these nice aspects go into such a pointless movie.Can no one take zombies and do something original with them? I can name several video games that have, but I guess movies are really just dying out.So, I bought 28 Weeks Later for $3 in the bargain bin. Was it worth that? I guess. But I'd be lying if I didn't say I was bored enough to shoot my eyes out.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fine sequel to a fine 1st film,"28 weeks Later was a fine sequel to an equally good 28 Days Later. It is not too often that a sequel matches the first film, but I would say 28 Weeks does just that.A portion of London, with help from the American military, has been quarantined off from the rest of the world. It has been cleaned of all the infected, and is a place where normal people can adjust to somewhat normal lives again. However something happens, you will have to see the movie to find out, and a mistake leads to the once clean area being overrun again by those infected with the Rage Virus which started it all in the first movie.Where 28 Days Later moved slowly and built tension with interesting characters, 28 Weeks Later starts out fast with one of the best scenes in the entire movie, and never really lets up for its duration. The acting was well done and the pacing phenomenal. I actually cared about the characters this time around as well, and this will usually lead to good things.Some people have complained that the rapid moving camera angles were a little nauseating, but I found that these scenes added to the chaos of the film and helped the quick fire pace that, among many others things, was one of this movie's strong points. The beginning of the film used this the most effectively, but the other scenes weren't bad either.28 Days Later was not the perfect horror film, but it was one of the best of its kind. 28 Weeks Later, in my opinion, was its equal. Yeah there were some things I found hard to believe. Like how the two teenagers managed to escape the quarantine, and how the infection was finally able to spread, but I can forgive the movie these small things because the bigger and better things far outweigh them. Go see it. It's well worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really well done,"I thought it was really well done. I expect horror movies to be really cheesy, but this was really detailed. Perfect amount of gore, suspense, and a lot of emotion so you're really tied into it. I'm not a huge nightmare person so I was glad I didn't get any from watching this. I like how nothing seems to happen at complete random; it all lines up. My only complaint is that I didn't like the ending and it seemed as if there was only one soundtrack played within the whole movie. Not a bad piece, but it was repetitive. Thus it got nine stars out of ten from me. Overall a really well done movie that I really enjoyed and you should definitely watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

28 Weeks Later: A Haunting Sequel,"Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's ""28 Weeks Later"" is a chilling sequel to Danny Boyle's iconic ""28 Days Later."" While it may not quite reach the same heights as its predecessor, it offers a tense and thought-provoking exploration of the aftermath of a global pandemic.The film is set six months after the events of the first film, as the British military attempts to reclaim London from the infected. However, a new threat emerges, one that is even more terrifying than the rage virus. The film delves into themes of trust, fear, and the human condition, as characters grapple with the devastating consequences of the outbreak.The direction is masterful, with stunning visuals and a palpable sense of dread. The cinematography is both beautiful and haunting, capturing the desolate beauty of a post-apocalyptic London. The score, composed by Dario Marianelli, is equally impressive, building tension and evoking a sense of unease.The acting is solid, with Robert Carlyle delivering a particularly strong performance as a hardened soldier. The young actors, who play the film's central family, also hold their own, conveying a sense of vulnerability and resilience.While ""28 Weeks Later"" may not be as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it is a worthy sequel that offers a fresh perspective on the zombie genre. It's a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, a testament to its power and its ability to provoke thought.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifyingly Unexpected,"The 21st century has been flooded with films and TV shows about zombie apocalypses, so it's difficult for any of them to stand out and feel completely fresh. But there's something about the '28' series that really hits well for me. There's something so glorious about seeing the streets of London be a wasteland that only occupies a select few living and undead.Similar to how the Cloverfield films are related but not directly tied in, 28 Days Later is a prequel of sorts, but the characters and plot are entirely different. 28 Weeks Later picks up after London is deemed safe and virus free, as the undead have starved to death after the events of the previous film. Of course, apparently it was a good idea for the military to reoccupy London and start building up a civilization again, even though it was the center of disaster only a half a year earlier. Implausible probably, but we've never really seen an apocalyptic series that attempts to go back and restart civilization from the same area. Usually we either see everything as the apocalypse is going down, or maybe several years later. So, in that way I like what the film tried to do.I also found the cast to be quite impressive. Not only do you have some nice lead turns from Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack, but you have Idris Elba, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, and Imogen Poots before they became famous. All of which, do a wonderful job in roles that aren't necessarily flushed out. That partly because it's only 100 minutes long, but mostly because the film never takes a breath. That could lead to pacing and character issues, but with a non-stop action-horror, it actually works to the benefit of the experience. Adding to that experience are running zombies. Yeah, I'm looking at you every other horror film, it's cool to make them run.But perhaps the biggest compliment I can give to the film is its utterly unpredictable. With a horror film, you expect there to be an ample amount of deaths, but the way in which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directs the deaths is terrifyingly unexpected. And when you can't see where the terror is coming from in a horror film than you're in for something special. In all, 28 Weeks Later improves upon 'Days' scares, story, characters, and plot to make for one exciting entry in the horror/sci-fi/drama genre.+Great performances+Horrific scares+Refreshing take on apocalyptic zombie flicks+Unpredictable9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fast cut shots and a homicidal helicopter...,"Ah man, I remember when 28 Days Later came out...I wasn't old enough to see it, but I saw some clips of the opening sequence and I loved the abandoned London feel.Needless to say, when I saw it it was...and still is...an incredibly good film.So I came to check out 28 weeks later.Basically the 'rage' virus has apparently died out and so people start to live in London again, which seems to have been taken over by the Americans.Two kids are reunited with their father (Robert Carlyle) and all is happy in the rebuilt world for a day or so.The kids proceed to sneak out and go to their old house, and in the panic that ensues, the zombie plague rises again. But there's something special about these two kids...and everyone around them is very keen to keep them alive.First of all I loved the scenery in this - the landscape shots are brilliant, and it has this dark - quintessentially British - feel to it, the kind of channel 4 movie feel. Which works well and ramps up the creeping feel of dread at times.It also has a lot of frantic shots - e.g scenes in very claustrophobic areas that are cut very quickly to build tension. A lot of the time this works, but as a viewer I like to know what's going on and this style of film-making took that away from me at times.Was good to see Imogen Pootz in this, her career has since gone up and up - Carlyle is good value too, although doesn't get much screen time.The opening quarter of the film is good, but sadly it fell apart from there - I didn't feel that involved in the two main children characters, and wasn't really rooting for them and I found the ending really disappointing. As I saw the final few shots I had to roll my eyes.Call me cynical but if you liked the first one, don't bother. The zombies are the same - and yes, they are scary - violent, mindless fountains of speed and rage that you feel hopeless against - but other than that you're better off visiting the original again or going to see some classic Romero flicks.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Perfect Sequel!,"Right, firstly i will say that this film was very good and perfect for the sequel to 28 Days Later! The story surrounds the zombie virus as in the first film and is set some years later, but what is good is that you're not just getting a follow-up film which is identical to the first! This is what i like to think of as a proper sequel! 28 Days Later was the basic zombie virus idea and this takes it to the next stage where it has slightly more violence, gore and shocks (in my opinion)! There are more characters and more of a selection of characters which is good, and i think the acting is really good too! There are a few twists which is a major plus (and is part of what helps develop the story from the first film), the action is continuous as need be, and i really think they found a perfect storyline for this film! Not just another couple of people being chased by zombies- this has more! Well worth a watch especially if you did enjoy the first!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
it makes even more sense nowadays,"Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" is a horrifying look at what might happen if a virus spread and turned people into mindless killing machines. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's ""28 Weeks Later"" expands on the idea, showing how the army would have no choice but to resort to extreme measures.While these movies were understood to be pure fiction when they got released, they look more serious now. COVID-19 caused thousands of people to go crazy. They might have become like the infected in these movies, but plenty refused to take even the most basic precautions (and we saw how many died of the virus).Anyway, this is one of the most intense movies that I've ever seen.

Scary,"28 Weeks Later (2007) is a British horror film that serves as a sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later. Directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, the film takes place 28 weeks after the events of the first film, as the British government attempts to repopulate London after the rage virus outbreak.The film expands upon the themes of societal collapse and the loss of innocence explored in its predecessor. It delves into the complexities of military intervention, the erosion of trust, and the psychological impact of trauma on survivors. The film explores how the virus not only affects the physical bodies of its victims but also the social fabric of the nation.The film maintains the gritty and realistic aesthetic of the original, with a focus on practical effects and a bleak, post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The performances are strong, with Robert Carlyle delivering a particularly chilling portrayal of a disillusioned soldier haunted by his past experiences.However, the film has been criticized for its tonal shift compared to the original. While 28 Days Later was a more character-driven and atmospheric film, 28 Weeks Later leans more heavily on action and gore. Some critics argue that this shift in tone detracts from the thematic depth of the film and dilutes its impact.Despite these criticisms, 28 Weeks Later remains a compelling and thought-provoking entry in the 28 Days Later franchise. It offers a chilling exploration of the potential consequences of societal collapse and the psychological scars left by trauma. While it may not have achieved the same critical acclaim as its predecessor, it stands as a worthy addition to the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Long behind the first one,"While the first opus, directed by Danny Boyle, worked somewhat rather well, this pale sequel, riddled with lacks and flaws, is really of no interest.The script is rather mediocre, linear and unsurprising. It relies on a lot of incoherences and heavy clichés that badly discredit the plot, which besides isn't that interesting. You don't know where this group is running to, but they are running and you understand quickly, after merely 45 minutes, the mess you are getting into.Even the cinematography, which was the strongest quality of 28 Days Later, is bad, Fresnadillo using and abusing of too frenetic shots.The only positive aspect is the sceneries of a deserted London that always work.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Days have become weeks,"28 Weeks Later is the action-packed follow-up to 28 Days Later and manages to be very good by its own right, telling a story with no connections or ties to the previous film aside from obviously revisiting the rage virus premise.The action is simply terrifying, with frantic camera movements that can be either nauseating at their worst or thrilling at their best in generating the aforementioned terror. Moreover, the film is larger in scale yet retains its predecessor's cheap, grounded, and gritty look. The guitar riffs in the score create a rocking sense of foreboding gloom, and it perfectly emphasises the pure danger the virus and infected pose against the living. Furthermore, the film focuses less on a singular character and more on an entire cast, making the virus a more weighty threat and members of the cast more exposed to the possibility of death. All of the film's best aspects, traits, and attributes are summarised in its incredible opening sequence, exposing the best and worst sides of mankind's willingness to survive as well as the flaws in the specific characters introduced.However,this sequel isn't without flaws of its own; it finds itself empty in terms of substance when compared to the heavily reflective and provocative simplicity in the first film, and the actual story lose focus on its most morally complex and interesting character in favour of establishing the admittedly effective element of randomness in the danger. Moreover, Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton are both impressively capable child actors, but their characters are poorly written and too reckless to forgive certain rash decisions made throughout the runtime.Above all else, 28 Weeks Later is a valiant effort in following up one of the most interesting post-apocalypse films made in recent times and manages to be very good in its own right, even if it never exceeds the minimalistic terror conveyed within it's precursor.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

this is not a zombie movie,"I liked the movie, although like its first movie and so on ignorant people keep saying that this is a good zombie movie. Well if you are old enough to write about a movie then you should have enough intelligence to understand that Zombies are people who were once alive then were killed and then reanimated again by a virus or other means that kill humans and eat them. They are not people infected with a rage virus that run around spitting blood on people and end up in death due to starvation. For those who do not know this, you should not be writing comments when you do not know the difference.On the movie, the only thing I did not like was the ending. Did the girl survive or was the brother the new cause of the infection? It does not say for sure and that bothers me like the time I was watching the Lord of the Rings movie and it just ended...But again for those who are still confused watch a George Romero Zombie movie then watch this or the first movie and you will see that the difference between the rage virus people and Zombies is like calling a piece of Spam a Steak....",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

First Ten Minutes Worth Price of Admission - A Classic Scene!,"Contains spoiler!These days if even five minutes of a movie excite me then I feel it was worth the price of admission. The first ten minutes of ""28 weeks later"" are so emotionally wrenching and inventively exciting that I could have left the cinema a happy man there and then. The grinding darkness and the kinetic rawness reminded me a lot of Lucio Fulci's classic zombie movies. There is such a crushing bleakness about this scene that is becomes a cinematic recreation of the kind of horrible dream from which you wake with a heart wrenching sense of hopelessness - which is in many ways worse that a waking crisis because when you are conscious there is always a glimmer of hope. But not in the dark realms of sleep.And so this emotionally draining first scene plays out as if directly streaming from our worst nightmare - and that sense of claustrophobic doom is beautifully compounded by a repeated musical theme that gets louder and more insistent as distorted guitar is added and the volume becomes almost unbearable. The re-introduction of this musical theme at moments of peak horror late in the movie is also reminiscent of Fulci movies - particularly as the theme is a full of desperate melancholy which amplifies beautifully the tragic situation that Robert Carlyle finds himself trapped in - forced to abandon his wife to the flesh eating hordes. The camera then follows him across the English countryside as he runs for his life. What a poignant image - the pastoral beauty of the English fields and the dark shadows of the undead. And then we have the sublime editing during the boat sequence as Carslisle fights off the zombies, with the boat spinning round and the music pounding to a head splitting climax. I was left breathless and dizzy.It was like Zombie Flesh Eaters all over again for the first time. Nothing later in the movie came close to this. I had ten minutes of heaven - worth the price of admission - and if I can take away just ten minutes of revitalizing, vibrant, inspired cinema that's more than I expect from most multiplex movies these days.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"fun, exciting action-horror movie","I have not yet seen the first film, 28 days later, so I can't speak to that and how this sequel follows up to it. I can only speak as to how this film is and whether it was effective or not.Personally, I do think it's an effective film. It is meant to be fun, entertaining, and full of action. It is a popcorn flick for sure. With all that being said, the filmmakers did a pretty good job with it. The effects and visuals work well for the most part. The actors did a good job, Byrne and Renner in particular. The action sequences are overall well done, maybe a bit too shaky in a couple parts, but that wasn't a huge issue.After seeing this film, I'm now inspired to see 28 days later.

One of the Greatest Zombie Sequels,"I thought that this movie would be the worst sequel to one of the best zombie flicks ever. I was DEAD wrong. This movie had everything, well almost everything that the original had. Its essentially 28 weeks after the original movie and the Rage Virus had taken to the streets in a rapid epidemic and Britain is on lockdown. With help from the US troops, they pose an equal chance to defend themselves while a family is being torn apart by these events and trying to get out of the country. But British scientists and US scientists may have found a cure to the Rage Virus.It had great acting by Robert Carlyle, Mackintosh Muggleton and Jeremy Renner, which really made this movie work, the concept was dynamite and the post-apocalyptic Britain sets where amazing. At points it had me jump out of my seat with both jump-out horror and CG-horror and violence was superb. The actions scenes are masterfully done, effectively placing the viewer in the victims and the crazed, but still scarily human, zombies. It had sad, life-damaging scenes in the fact that a family is being torn apart because of this whole incident and beginning was beautifully done. The cinematic score and sound effects gave me shutters and whole thing was great. There where scenes (ie: the gas-bomb-car scene) that where brilliant but also quite frightening.However, as much as I praise and love this movie I think that it did not have the sly humor or the character development as the previous movie, but aside from that, this movie is genuinely perfect. The emotions and the powerful disturbing images and cinematography really made this movie work, and the depiction of how human nature really is. In summation, I believe that this movie was one of the best sequels to a zombie flick since Dawn of the Dead and Land of the Dead.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A lot better than average, as sequels go","A lot better than average, as sequels go. While, yes, there are some plot holes (as with most movies) this one does what horror films are supposed to do. If you let yourself, you will go with the flow and experience the building dread. I understand that there is supposed to be some political subtext involving the soullessness of the U. S. military, but really, in the face of such a demonstrated, truly existential threat, what exactly else would a military command do? Militaries are there to do things in the performance of their duties that would otherwise be immoral, such as depriving others of life and/or liberty when it is necessary to do so. Anyway the film is well-acted, well-photographed (although I think that jerky camera shooting has run its course) and well-paced. Special kudos to Rose Byrne and Imogene Poots (what a name!) for nailing grueling roles. If you liked the first movie at all, I think you'll like this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Stunning,"Absolutely stunning. This film was amazing. Right from the beginning, the audience is transported into the story until in finishes. The pace of this movie is dead on. The action sequences go fast, but there are still parts of the movie where there is silence and reflection on what is happening to help the audience process the events of the film.The entire story follows a single family and their interactions during the whole ordeal, so there is a heightened sense of relation between the characters, and in many of the scenes, the zombies are not nameless. It makes you question what you would do in their situation. It makes you question what it means to he part of a family and what it means to be alive.I've seen this movie twice now, and I don't know if I could see it again very quickly because the movie is so emotionally exhausting, and the violence, while it is the same thing happening again and again, never loses its effect. Each time you're left alarmed, scared, wondering what will happen next. I would highly recommend checking this movie out, as it is a carnal zombie movie, but there are deeper, dramatic developments and beautiful images to make this movie rise above the normal zombie flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This film is Crap (May be spoilers),"There may be spoilers here but I doubt it, nothing could spoil this film more than the film itself.OK, I did not see 28 'days' later so have judged this in isolation.When my wife brought home a Robert Carlyle DVD (who I think is ace!) I expected a good evening's thought provoking entertainment.OK, Ignore the plot holes you could drive a bump started Volvo through.OK, Ignore the timeless continuity errors.OK, Ignore science and medicine.OK, Ignore that the UK is connected to France via a tunnel that people/zombies could walk through, actually probably was ignored as made by Americans.OK, Ignore the complete incompetence of the US expeditionary force.OK, ignore the fact that the one survivor of the virus is also....Oh I can't be bothered! Or perhaps I am too stupid to get it but I have never watched a film that I had any less empathy for any of the characters in than this blood and guts indulgence.If this film was supposed to be a post apocalyptic drama, it was poorly thought out. The 1970's low budget 'Survivors' series did this 100 times better.If it was supposed to be a horror flick it missed the most essential ingredient, if you do not give a damn about the characters you can't be scared. You can be shocked, offended or disgusted, but horror only works well if the viewer has an emotional attachment to the characters as classically portrayed in silence of the lambs where everyone loves Clarice Starling.For a truly entertaining Zombie flick, check out ""I am Legend"" where Will Smith's dog has more charisma than the entire cast of 28WL put together!!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gripping and menacing,"28 weeks later is yet another Hollywood sequel released in 2007. And in this summer's long line of sequence, this one surely has the least following. With low market potential compared to this year's other sequels, the freedom given to the film maker by the studio bosses can be made out after watching the film. The movies restrained act can sometime gets over your skin but overall the movie is a satisfying experience for the fans of the horror zombie genre.The movie starts as the title literally suggests 28 weeks later after the first attack of the rage virus on the British Isles. The virus has been overcome by humans in some parts of London which have been quarantined for the settlement of the first batch of refugees. The quarantined section is being controlled by the U.S occupied forces. The trouble begins when two of the youngest refuges sneak out of the quarantined area to their old home, where they find there supposedly dead mother alive. The mother, whose blood is infected, has been successfully been immune to the virus. As she is quarantined by the occupied forces, things turn over its head when she infects her husband who is not immune to the virus. This starts another round of rage attack which grips and destroys the secured area. The director shows his class when the two young protagonists struggle to survive, not from the infected but from the human forces itself who themselves turn intensely hostile as a human nature itself. The director successfully puts down his point that at this juncture of human evolution, the humans have become incapable with there survival instincts as they turn upon themselves during times of crisis which is relevant to today's time. The movie does loose on its horror effects as audience struggle to find any sympathy for the lead characters, as the 90 minutes running time give very few moments for character building with its fast pace editing. A 10 minutes plus running time would have been satisfactory.But overall the movie satisfies with its gore and violence quotient which is at its peak in the final reels. The crisp editing and story satisfies the audience who are struggling to the find any sense in the scripts of this year's many more popular sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Different movie than the first, completely enjoyable.","I almost feel the need to review some of the ""bad"" reviews listed by users for this film. Seriously, there's a reason that you don't write professionally let alone review films professionally. Anyway... 28 Days made an excellent comment on the human condition by posing the question: Is violence a necessary aspect of humanity? Violence might be necessary to create order as personified by the English soldiers welcoming the crew into their occupied estate. I found 28 Weeks as completely enjoyable as it's original in different ways. It was a different movie with different characters set in a different time of the same story setting. I almost feel the second (28 Weeks) to be more serious in tone. 28 Days had moments of dry wit spliced between moments of sheer terror, but the feel of the film felt more playful and philosophical. I feel the funniest parts of 28 Weeks was it's moments of over the top gore. I don't mean to equate violence with humor but gore can be likened to slapstick comedy depending on it's context i.e. helicopter in the field scene. Many people seem to focus on the unbelievability of the movie. Guess what. It's an unbelievable premise. So was the first one. It's a movie. It's a zombie movie. Actually here's another thing that irks me. They aren't zombies, people. They're infected with a virus that induces extreme rage. If you don't view them as zombies but as people who are enraged beyond anything that you or I could possibly imagine, it makes sense that the father figure retains some if not only a small bit of his rational thought prior to being infected much like the infected soldier in 28 Days they were keeping chained and alive for purposes of study. There's a moment where Jim sets him free and he is completely conscious while being a ""zombie"" and recognizes what Jim intends for him to do. Also why is it so unbelievable for some people to accept that the children wanted to escape the occupied zone to go back to their home to gather personal effects? OK, maybe they're kids and it's impossible for them to escape a border of soldiers, but the tone was set. It's 6 months after any sign of existing infected person. The American soldiers that are there are bored. No one sees the threat as imminent anymore. It is a relaxed occupation where refugees are made to be comfortable in high-rise apartments as rebuilding of society is quickly underway. The kids escape and are scooped up rather quickly, considering. It's a movie. It's not the best movie but far from the worst. Definitely is deserving of more than 1 star. I would expect maybe 5 on the low end and 8 on the higher end. Oh, one more thing that bugs me. This is not an Americanized remake or sequel. It's not a typical Hollywood movie. The same makers of the original had their hands in the production of the sequel. I feel if you enjoyed the first one, it's entirely possible to enjoy this sequel especially given that most sequels and/or remakes or re-imaginings are crap. I read somewhere someone likening it to Aliens vs. Alien. I find that a completely accurate comparison. Guess what. Aliens was fantastic as a sequel as well and I can and will defend that movie if need be but not here.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Horrible? No doubt!,"This is my first IMDb review. I've never bother to write a review but this movie really bothers me after watching it. I don't think I can sleep tonight if I don't write one.

This is the worst movie I have ever seen in recent years.If anyone could write a comment about the movie that contains spoiler, I do really admire him. It is because it basically has no plot.The whole movie is basically like this: A group of normal guys runs away from the other group of sort of zombie guys.Those zombies trend to run faster than normal people and usually keep shouting and roaring for no reason. Their mouthes seem cannot be shut for some reason.The storyline is the worst ever. Too many non-sense scenes. The acting is world class worst, especially the main character ""Andy"". He has basically no acting at all.When we got out of cinema, I just asked, can I get my four pounds back? My friend said, I don't mind paying four pound but want to get my memory removed.If you have a brain, try to avoid this non-sense.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A total contrivance...,"I finally got around to watching this and I think it was built up too much in my head before I went to see it because I couldn't help but be disappointed. The movie is a contrivance and relies on fairly intelligent, career minded people doing really dumb and career ending things. In the real world, people are mostly cogs in the machine and keep their personal welfare and career in mind before taking an action that could end the first and certainly end the second. The kids I can understand as kids are ultimately selfish, adventurous and often don't recognize danger to themselves.I won't even go into all the military goofs as they are well documented on IMDb. But don't for one second expect me to believe the US military is repopulating Great Britain without a civilian administrative overwatch, most likely composed of members of the British government (they have emergency contingencies for government officials just like the US does) and US bureaucrats. It's also certain that British troops would be in command and only augmented by NATO troops. Even if every soldier on the island was killed (unlikely), Britain doesn't keep all of it's military at home. There would still be the Royal Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines abroad that would be recalled and put in charge of the homeland. The military aren't really made out to be the bad guys but it's certainly an easy conclusion and many people have made it. The military executes political decisions, they wouldn't have decided to repopulate the island, wouldn't have decided to allow children, wouldn't have been the ones to create a Code Red solution and wouldn't be the ones to make the decision to execute Code Red unless no civilian authorization was possible. All in all, while the movie didn't make the military the villains, it didn't exactly paint a nice picture of them.Speaking of Code Red... all contagious diseases spread quickest when people are in confined spaces. Emergency plans for small pox outbreaks, and whatnot, do not crowd everyone into a single building, they rely on keeping people at home. The civilians all lived in condos, the best, best possible thing you could do would be to send them to their apartments and have them lock the door. Those buildings could essentially be fortresses. Then the entrance could be defended and the military would have time to hunt down and exterminate the infected which would only number a few because people wouldn't be out roaming in masses. If an infected got inside the building, the number of victims would be very small and again the military could patrol the hallways and shoot down any infected.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mindless Gorefest,"One star goes to the 4-note song that is repeated throughout this film during each of the many scenes of intense violence. Other than the score, this film is a pure waste of time. It lacks all the finesse and style of ""28 Days Later."" At two hours of almost non-stop slaughter, it has no character development and no plot. Granted, ""28 Days Later"" was slim on both, but this sequel has dispensed with *every* element of a good movie. And, because it's a sequel, it also lacks the novelty of the original film. The director subscribes to the ""scare the audience with sudden loud noises"" school of horror film-making.

"Wretchedly, wretchedly bad!","This is just a BAD movie on almost all levels, and does for ""28 Days Later"" (which I loved) what ""Aliens"" did for ""Alien"". In other words, it demystifies it, cheapens it, exploits it, and wastes it. While the first film had characters that you cared about (played by damned good actors), this film is immediately and obviously peopled by actors that have ""cannon-fodder"" (or in this case ""infected-fodder"") written all over them. The characters are so poorly developed that to call them two-dimensional is to give them the benefit of the doubt. Most of them are simply around to give the plot a half-hearted push and then die.One of the hallmarks of a bad movie is that supposedly smart people do incredibly stupid things. That tradition is alive and well in this awful film. A high-security area along the lines of the Pentagon or the White House proves as porous as a sponge, and the holes in the film's logic are so big that a helicopter could fly through them. Which brings us to The Helicopter, the only one in the entire military that is flown by one guy, without a copilot or door gunners or anything. This proves important at the end, but I can say no more.The violence is gratuitous and ineffective. As allegory to Iraq, the movie fails. This film should, and probably will, be studied in film schools as a bad example of a poor script poorly directed. It will also probably make a ton of money.My last word - YUCK!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a travesty...,"Whereas 28 Days had subtlety, plausibility, real character development, and was only really circumstantially a horror film and actually a drama, 28 Weeks falls right into the tired, old horror movie clichés of ridiculously unbelievable events, inconsistent behavior based on established rules set up in 28 Days (referring here to behavior of certain infected), and exploitive 'gotcha' moments characteristic of every horror movie ever made.I really REALLY wanted to enjoy this film, but it wasn't steeped in reality the way 28 Days was, and since I don't really care for the horror movie genre, I hated this film for being one of the biggest cinematic let downs since the Star Wars prequels.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The first one was better,"If I had to describe this film in one word it would be disappointing. Where as the original had grounded characters who made understandable choices, this one has dumb characters that make dumb decisions. There were a couple of nice shots, but they were completely outnumbered by many scenes that are too dark, so I couldn't see half the action. There's also a lot of scenes that use flashing lights which further distort what's going on, that combined with the obnoxious editing makes the experience of watching the film really mundane. It's also a shame they decided to Anericanise everything, Making the story predictable and there's an abundance of guns and of course stroking the US military'a ego. There were some nice song choices but as those songs came from the original it's hardly a compliment for this film. I hated all the characters. If you have any knowledge of London, or have Google Maps, you will find the journey these characters take really confusing. If you like zombie movies, watch 28 days later, or Train to Busan or Shaun of the Dead, but 28 weeks later isn't any good, not the worst, but certainly not a good time.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Typical horror sequel - less sense, more gore and explosions","28 Days Later stood out of its genre as a genuinely good film. 28 Weeks Later is one of those sequels (common in this genre) that trade on the buzz of the original to churn out a standard genre flick that doesn't have much inspiration of its own to work with. It's OK for what it is, but don't expect it to have the style or subtlety of the first 28. I think they tried to make up for it by making everything a lot louder. If you grind your teeth during horror films that are driven by a chain of people doing obviously stupid things that could have no other result than a horrific bloodbath, skip this one.

Too bad,"I was eagerly awaiting this sequel. In a summer drowning in them, I thought a follow up to the Boyle classic original could stand out as a second edition to a storyline worthy of more story.I don't think I can say how disappointing '28 Weeks Later' was in only 1,000 words! The story was thin, even though the tag lines and trailer gave hope for much more. Having three credited screenwriters is always a bad sign for an action film.I don't mind the use of hand-held cameras, but I have to say that it was completely distracting in this case. The action is choppy and nearly impossible to follow. Any scene that wasn't of a crowd was filmed in intense close-up, for no reason I could see other than maybe the operator didn't know how to adjust the depth. He couldn't hold the camera still, certainly. Most scenes were poorly lit, and I don't think it was all about setting a mood, either.I won't give away any plot points, but there were a few story elements, meant to be poignant and touching, (I think), but so impossible, so horribly conceived and executed, that the audience I saw it with laughed at them. So bad they were funny, and not on purpose.I saw and really liked 'Intacto', so I know that Fresnadillo can make good movies. If you liked '28 Days Later', just wait for the next sequel.

"Where are the zombies?! Oh, and the character development?","Major disappointment. I think it is a testament to the popularity of the zombie film that so many users have given this film good marks, desperate as they are for anything new in the genre. However, this film suffers from a terrible script and absolutely no character development.The zombie genre is comprised of basically three franchises, the Romero epics, Zak Snyder's remake, and Danny Boyle's new take on the zombie apocalypse. While the first film was a terrific example, the sequel falls short. VERY short.Without giving out any spoilers, you will learn nothing about any of the characters, and therefore not really care when they die. The most menacing figures in the film are the military personnel, zombies seem to take a backseat. The plot, while exhibiting a few clever moments, makes no sense and leads up to a lame ending that is, frankly, a major cop-out.As far as the direction, the shaky Blair Witch-like camera work is effective in the first harrowing scene. However, it gets old quick, and clearly becomes a method of skimping on effects when it comes to showing the zombies themselves. It seems as though the entire budget was spent on the CG sequences, which, while good looking, do not add anything to the film.This movie could have been a terrific sequel with some serious script rewrites, some decent dialogue and character development, and, dare I say it....MORE ZOMBIES! Overall, it seemed rushed to capitalize on Hollywood's zombie craze, and as a result, proves a poor example of the genre.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silly and almost bad,"I understand now how filmmakers write their script, first they think to some ""cool scene"" , it is that they write first, then they build a story to link theses ""cool scene"" at the result than stupid people do stupid things making silly events to advance a pointless story.The movie however starts good , with some trill and action, but here again we have the ""stupid shacked hand-held camera motion"" who make the action confuse and add NOTHING to the movie, no extra tension, no extra drama, no fancy effect ... ho yeah it give sea-sickness.The story who follow is 2 kids who mess around and don't fell sorry of it and situations that defy the base of the human logic and intellect. 28 Weeks Later without theses completely silly events and the stupid shacked camera could have be a much better movie.I'm glad some other people feel the same way and do not over-rate this movie, I give a 4 starts to punish for taking me for a dumb and for messing around with the camera.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The first 5 minutes I thought we would get to see the same great and realistic kind of movie and 28 days. After those 5 minutes, things start to go down-hill... fast.To begin with, the biggest disappointment for me was the fact that the story is so flat and predictable, it becomes annoying. Compared to 28 Days, which featured a realistic look on a dytopian state of panic, with people making real decisions, this film features illogical decisions and infected who somehow get a personality. The latter only works in zomcom's and not in this type of reality-horror film.But even if you somehow manage to look past these points, the plot comes and kicks you when you're down. It is a chain-reaction of illogical and implausible actions, random stunts and the film has absolutely no direction where it wants to go.Its really hard to review this film without giving away spoilers, because I really, REALLY, want to describe some of the ridiculous events that happen.Summary: No plot, illogical and stupid actions by the main characters, its basically 1,5 hour of very weird Parkinson's-like shots of blood and limbs, held together by people doing random things that don't make sense.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Interesting setup, poor plot","The movie derives an interesting and somewhat fresh approach to zombie movies from the first one -- 28 Days Later. But that time, it fails to deliver the story. Characters are inconsistent, just created to cover a lot of plot holes. They somewhat serve their role, but you could never relate to them. Yet you can't believe in 28 Weeks story overall. There are just too many assumptions screenwriters don't bother to explain.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun on 2 different levels,"You can watch this in two different states of mind: 1. Scared to death, and, 2. Laughing yourself silly. The horror and bloodshed is amazing in both its quantity and its continuity. The shock surprises (like a horror face suddenly popping up in the screen with a loud noise) are quite satisfying. The situations for the characters are hopelessly desperate and they get you involved in the emotion. And so on.The other state of mind is that you can laugh yourself silly watching this thing. The exaggerations of bloodshed can be hilarious. The impossible options for the characters can be so bad that all you can do is laugh. I am not knocking this film in saying this, because the effects are superb and it is honestly well crafted but sometimes you see some movie that is so wild that you can easily take it on two levels.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than the first one but still not my cup of tea,"""28 Days Later"" was very bad in my opinion. I didn't like the chaotic camerawork, actors were annoying, and somehow it didn't even feel like a horror film - more like a psychological survival thriller.The sequel feels a bit more like a genuine horror film. It has more gore, more action, bigger budget, and the cast is solid. Well...the camerawork is pretty much still that freehand style which was some kind of trend in the early 2000s. I never liked it and still don't. But in this movie it's not as offensive as in the first one. Not every single scene is full of overtly-shaky-shaky-cam, so I didn't suffer all the way through.For some reason movies about viruses and quarantines don't feel like my favorite thing in this current moment of time...but then again they never did. That topic is too...scary. I mean, I don't need horror to be -actually- scary - I want to be entertained. And I don't really care about these fast running zombies either. They are...scary too. They are not fun. (I know, I know, I'm cheesy.)Yes, it's quite scary and intense movie but I didn't get much...kicks out of it. I mean, there must be a reason why you like some movie. I can't see why would I want to watch this thing again. But let's say it again: it's better than the first part.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bland copy of the original,"In 2002, the zombie genre was forever altered by the arrival of Danny Boyle's gritty and realistic ""28 Days Later"", which first and foremost introduced a new brand of zombies, the supercharged, red-eyed sprinters which made for a delightful change to the classic Romeroesque undead. Shot mostly on hand-held low-tech camera (which contributed greatly to the general feeling of the story), the movie followed a small group of survivors after a virus outbreak in London. The viewer was instantly dropped into the center of the steamrolling action and followed through to the end in a dramatic, very human story that most of all felt as if it could be happening right now outside your very window. And it was scary, as hell.Now, 5 years later later, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directs the sequel piece, ""28 Weeks Later"", with a similar attitude and look as the original. The storyline, without divulging any crucial spoilers, centers around a small group of survivors living in a military-guarded security area during a rebuilding time of London, after what is believed to be the extermination of the virus infection. Not long into the film, we do however get to see a lot of people running around, chased by ""infected ones"", and like the original, some touching moments.Unfortunately, as good a copy as this new edition might be in it's feel, it does lack the spontaneity of the original. While Danny Boyle's movie kept far away from classic movie clichés and always kept the viewer on the edge, this one feels a bit to calculated. Almost as if it tried to much to be the original, but with failing result. Not to mention some really bad turns towards plain goofiness and absurdity (relating to the last 30 minutes). Also, I feel obliged to comment on some rather heavy usage of shaking cameras, which although may do well to convey a feeling of panic, feels a bit overdone after a while.So, as a conclusion; as with most sequels, ""28 Weeks Later..."" does not live up to it's predecessor, which remains as the ultimate piece in new-genre zombie flicks. And we shall do well to hope that they don't decide to produce a ""28 Month/Years/Decades Later"". Not even if it's starring Clive Owen or Pierce Brosnan.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
