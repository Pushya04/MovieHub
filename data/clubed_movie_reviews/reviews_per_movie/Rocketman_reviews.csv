Dazzling rocket,"Although classical music and opera is more my cup of tea/forte, that has never stopped me from having always admired Elton John and loving most of his songs. ""Your Song"", ""Something About the Way You Look Tonight"", ""I'm Still Standing"" and pretty much all the songs in 'The Lion King' are especially great, one of the few exceptions being ""Crocodile Rock"". He is/was also a quite interesting man, both stage persona and personal life, and the period that is primarily focused on is a very compelling one and worthy of being told on film.'Rocketman' was not a perfect film, but on the most part it was thoroughly enjoyable and at its best dazzlingly executed when seeing it in the cinema earlier this year. As far as films released in 2019 goes, 'Rocketman' is to me in the better half. Even if accuracy and the chronology can be called into question, it still makes John and his personal life, detailing his childhood, early career and how it came to be and the troubled period of his career, quite fascinating. As well as being worthy of a lot of admiration in its own right.Not everything works. For my liking, the last twenty minutes or so are executed too tidily.While John and Bernie Taupin are well rounded and fully realised characters, the other characters, despite being well acted by particularly Bryce Dallas Howard, felt like underdeveloped caricatures (i.e. the parents' cold behaviour towards Reggie not being explained).However, 'Rocketman' has so many things working in its favour and more so than the bad. First and foremost, Taron Egerton. A totally committed and quite brilliant performance full of confidence, swagger, flair, subtlety and nuance, not to mention a great singing voice, treating John with respect without impersonating him. The scene where he opens up to his mother and his reaction to her cold response was heart-breaking in particular. Jamie Bell is the other performance worthy of note and the relationship between John and Taupin is handled beautifully, with the right amount of intensity but also taste. One can tell how well they clicked and feel their mutual affection and it really drives the film and at times the heart of it.It looks great too, beautifully photographed and John's flamboyant costumes are a sight to behold, one of the bigger examples being that unlike-anything-you've-seen-before one in the therapy. The songs are as magnificent as one expects and staged with a lot of brio and confidence without being overblown. The very moving ""Your Song"", performance and the understated staging, being a big standout in this regard, another powerful part being with what is done with the opening of ""Yellow Brick Road"", done so truthfully and mirroring what is going on at that present moment without spelling it out too much and showing how much Taupin cares for John. Heck, the film even manages to make ""Crocodile Rock"" tolerable in one of the film's more exuberant moments.The script manages to be both entertaining and sincere, underneath all the flashiness there is depth too. There may be conventional moments in the story (a lot of biopics though are like that), but the scenes showing off John's unique showmanship are difficult to look away from and the story detailing John's troubled personal life at the time is powerful. A great job is done showing who John is, what he is and how his mind worked when dealing with troubles and when he was writing and performing. Dexter Fletcher's direction is adept.Summing up, a very, very good and often great film that just misses out on being brilliant. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Should have expected this.,"It's going to get very mixed reviews. I predict many will love it, and many will revile it. I was caught somewhere in the middle. Without giving any actual spoilers away, consider this:1. If you absolutely HATE musicals, save your money. This is the John/Taupin equivalent of a Rodgers & Hammerstein. It is not presented as a straightforward biopic in the same manner as BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY.
2. Much as I love Elton John, this ""rock & roll fantasy"" of his life treads a little too far into campy territory for me, with 2, maybe 3 very (thankfully) brief moments in the film that can only be described as cringeworthy. (""Oh, come on, guys--seriously?"" moments.) There were times when I genuinely felt this was going to end up as the Ken Russell version of TOMMY for the new millennium.
3. Never, at any point in the film, is Paul Buckmaster mentioned or acknowledged. This infuriated me! For those who don't already know: in the early days of EJ's career, Paul was the orchestrator who provided EJ with the BEAUTIFUL, lush string accompaniments that added so much to EJ's early music (classic example: EJ's soundtrack to the 1971 French film, FRIENDS) and, IMHO, could have been a big player in his success as a burgeoning artist, firmly introducing/establishing The Elton John ""Sound."" He SHOULD have been a part of this film--even a small one, if deemed necessary--but for him to be utterly omitted from the story mystifies me. Maybe someone in the know can enlighten me on this.These 3 things, however, are about my only problems with the film. Credit must be given where it's due:1. Taron Egerton is actually pretty amazing. Some might see his acting as occasionally over the top, but frankly and for all we know, maybe EJ really did act that ""extremely"" at times, considering his anger issues. His singing, most of the time, is virtually spot-on, catching EJ's lilting singing style quite well.
2. The supporting cast:
Jamie Bell (Bernie Taupin), Bryce Dallas Howard , Richard Madden (EJ's agent & self-centered 1st lover), Stephen Graham (Dick James), Tate Donovan (L.A.'s Troubador Club manager Doug Weston), Gemma Jones (Ivy, EJ's grandmother, I think...? Or friend of the family?) & Steven Mackintosh (EJ's cold, uncaring father)...and all others in the film, essentially faultless. ESPECIALLY Jamie's portrayal of Bernie. Wow.
3. You can't really find fault with the staging and choreography of the musical numbers. Very professionally done.
4. You will learn many things about EJ's life in this film that you may not have known before...I know I did.
5. Have a few Kleenexes handy. Enough said.
6. Don't leave right away after the credits roll.So, is it worth seeing? My criticisms aside (and we all know what they say about opinions), it really comes down to this: if you're a fan--and especially a DEDICATED fan, like me, who's followed him from his humble beginnings in America in the summer of 1970--go see it. Decide for yourself if my gripes hold any water.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Give Taron Egerton an Oscar IMMEDIATELY!!!,He was AMAZING in the spirit of an fabulous Elton John biopic musical.... and Jamie Bell was awesome.. as usual!,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A musical as pop as sad,"First things first,Elton Johnbeing one of the most famous artists in the world, with a career of about half a century and 300 million albums sold, a biopic was then more than legitimate and was even eagerly awaited. This film is conceived like a musical based on the songs and the life ofElton John, from the 50s to the early 80s, the selected songs being representative of the manifold events of his life, the ups (his life as an accomplished artist mainly) and the downs (his whole private life according to the movie), since his childhood during which he quickly turns out to be a natural born musician until his first sentimental disappointments and the first cures of detoxification (alcohol, drug, ... and tutti quanti). The movie ends with the punchy « I'm still standing », song written in 1983 after a bad patch and foreshadowing a frantic recovery of his life, the lyrics being written by his friendBernie Taupin.One of my favorite scenes among many others is the meeting at the Royal Academy of Music, with the third movement of the Sonata Piano No. 11 byWolfgang Amadeus Mozartplayed twice. I do not know if it's true but, if so, this child is ingeniously bluffing!The costumes are superb and the actors are fabulous. The realization is ingenious especially with the appropriate and relevant insertion of the songs in the film, like in a musical. As a synthesis: 7/8 of 10.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Rocketman > Bohemian Rhapsody,"Rocketman decides to focus on Elton John's character evolution more than anything else, chronicling his life from when he was a wee-little boy to his glory days as the colorfully decorated, piano-playing, musically blustering star. One detail I must address that really hoisted the exploration of John's life was, in reality, the ""R"" rating.You get to see a respectful and psychological turn in his persona, you get to witness the heartbreaking ""addictions"" that he constantly forces himself into, you get to view the uncut collision of him dealing with his sexuality, and you even get to feel that loss of love that Elton had felt when he persistently questioned his relationship with peers. All of these affairs are dispensed without and blockades or any desires of censorship and I must commend the filmmakers for going about this risky decision.And sure, Rocketman is arguably quite the corn-fest at times, but the movie is able to take these cheesy elements of the typical rockstar biopic and format it into a creative fashion that characterizes more charismatic and less repetitive exhibitions. Which brings me to my next point...I am so pleased that Rocketman turned out to be a nearly full-on musical? I mean, it had to find some way to be different from Bohemian Rhapsody, right? Whenever a musical note comes on it's not just there for Elton John fan-a-holics. The songs always pertain to the presented events transpiring on screen. The methods they use to present the songs as well, offer some more than compulsive and devouring visuals. I also appreciated how they redid all the songs to fit the scenes in a more appropriate manner. It makes the film seem less like a compilation of Elton's original greatest-hits and more like a rendition of what each song means to the story.Now, Taron Egerton's performance in this is...wow, wow, wow, wow, WOW. He is just bleeding with range and chaotic pizazz in this encapsulation of a contrasted human individual. If someone is worthy of an Oscar nomination this year, it's this guy.Rocketman doesn't entirely rely on nostalgia like most of its kind does-that implying that sometimes it does, however-and most of its misfit adventures proved about in the story seem earned rather than glossed over at a maximum pace of negligence. Definitely check this one out, especially if you're an Elton John fan!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Here is what many people don't understand,"This is not a movie about a rock star with their music simply part of the facts of the story. It is a musical in the truest sense, that uses his own music to show his tribulations through the eyes of a man during the troubled years of his life. The movie is not always chronological and in some cases is more figurative than historical. In this way it can convey Sir Elton John's life and struggles in a way that the viewer may understand on a more personal level. The acting, writing and singing are superb.
The star did not try to truly imitate Elton but instead preforned the pieces in his own style that he molded as closely as possible to the original. It sounds odd, but it works.
As always you can never sum up any life, book or story in a 2 or so hour movie, but this comes close. You leave feeling like you really got to know the real, yet flawed, human Elton John. Overall a wonderful movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Good, but felt a little rushed.","Not really sure where I sit with this one. A gripping tale of one of music's biggest icons. While Egerton shines as the glorious John, all the surrounding characters seemed to be simple generic caricatures of staples from this kind of stories. And the story blazes by, many of the acts with little explanation of motives. It follows the basic by the numbers of the musical biopic, never really seeming to let the weight of one single action hit with the viewer before moving onto the next tragic act. While the characters and story seemed to ring a bit formulaic and hollow, Egerton's performance is able to carry the gravitas. And the music, oh the music. John's catalog is beautifully strewn throughout the film in all its glory, though Taron's vocals struggle in parts and he is outsung by his supporting cast at points. And in the end, the conclusion and resolution come, yet once again seemingly easily and out of nowhere as had the conflict earlier in the film. A great story of a great artist that just seemed to miss on a few points for me. Did I enjoy the movie? Yes. It just seemed like a cliff notes version of what could have been a deeper and more compelling story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Elton John is amazing, and he is a complicated man....this film reflects his tormented side","Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton John is superb and only heightened by the producers allowing Taron to sing his own versions of many of Elton John's classic hits. It would be impossible to capture all aspects of Elton John's life in the 2 hours provided in this musical/biographical film, so instead the producer/writer/director concentrated on Elton's early childhood which helped shape his destiny when he first met his partner in song writing the great Bernie Taupin played by Jamie Bell.There were far too many other excellent performances from the supporting cast members to mention them all but I have to mention two in particular who were top notch. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Elton's irresponsible (wife cheating) mother, and Richard Madden who plays John Reid one of Elton's early but serious lovers remained Elton's manager for decades after their sexual relationship ended. Both of these actors added a lot to the films depth in the one area that focused on Elton's tormented soul and led him to binge drinking and pill popping which is the area this film reflected.I hope we don't have to wait for Elton John to pass away (God forbid) before some producer realizes that Elton John and Bernie Taupin whose lifestyles and personalities are so diametrically opposite that they deserve their life stories to be developed into a (minimum) ten (10) hour TV Mini-Series to cover a heck of a lot of both of these musical genius's personal lives as well as their successes with their musical portfolios.Rocketman is well worth seeing and rates a perfect 10 out of 10 in my version of Elton John's quasi autobiography book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Should NOT been a self-pity musical, and should HAVE had accurate song timelines","What a disappointment. Bad writing. Pitiful representation of EJ. I couldn't stand the musical portions and ended up FFW past them. And how do you screw up concert/show dates with when the actual song was created? Casting was great and Egerton nailed his role, but he should've lip-synced the music and had the actual EJ songs played. Not saying his voice was bad, but basically I just saw a 2 hour pity party played/sung by a cover band musical. This film would have been much better as an actual biopic. Compared to Bohemian Rhapsody, this film was a huge flop for me. It's a generous 6/10 mainly for Egerton's great performance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Emotionless,"Elton John is one of the greatest contemporary artists of the world, no doubt. However, this highlight of his life is a terrible overrated film, without any emotion and an exploitation of Elton John as a needy alcoholic and drug addicted gay. He is needy because of his one-dimension parents that are never developed and the viewer never knows why they treat the boy that way. His gay side is also poorly developed and more exploited. In the end, the film is lost between a shallow drama and a boring musical. The performance of Taron Egerton in the role of Elton John is the best this movie can offer. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Rocketman""",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Elton the Truth,"Not just a biopic of Elton John, but a musical biopic. This may sound blindly obvious but it does not follow the regular formula of lead character strumming guitar or taping at keys on piano, then music swells and film throws another classic tune at you. No here it's delivered in full blown musical mode - street full of people bursting into dance, non-musical characters bursting into song, even people floating as songs connect with them. Just relying on auidence good will on the basis of great songs, will not be enough, and here you have Taron Egerton showing he can not only act but has a pretty good singing voice as he performs those classic tunes. It also has the advantage with the main protagonist still being alive, and clearly wanting not to hold back on his own personal demons that shaped his character. So often in uncompromising ways we see the dark journey that he went through to achieve his fame, and the real cost it had on him and those he loved. The magical musical realism that the film uses to tell his story works well for the most part, but I did find that it relied on some knowledge of his life story that im places did seem to be rushed over and not quite as clear as it should have been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
I so wanted to love this movie but sadly I didn't.,"I've been an Elton John fan most of my life. My love for the music of Elton and Bernie literally shaped who I am. So I REALLY wanted to love this movie but I left the theater irritated and disappointed.My biggest gripes were:
1.) Some of the musical numbers were corny and out of character (e.g. young Elton dancing through the streets, acting tough and singing ""Saturday"". The young Elton John actors/singers were not very good either.
2.) The ""fantasy"" aspects and creative liberties taken to distort facts were annoying. For example, the scene at the Troubadour. It was corny having Elton and the audience flying but I get that the filmmakers wanted to communicate that the concert was a surreal, life changing evening for everyone there. What made me MAD is that he was playing Crocodile Rock! That was absurd. He and Bernie didn't even write that until '72. Plus, that song is NOT why people would have been blown away with him performance. It's a catchy little ditty that got great airplay but is not one of the songs that make Elton & Bernie great. The real set list for the Troubadour was songs like ""Your Song"", ""Border Song"", ""Take Me to the Pilot"", ""Burn Down the Mission"". That's the amazing stuff he played that night that rocked people's worlds. Not radio pop ""Crocodile Rock"". I don't see how any real Elton John can be happy with that gross distortion of facts. How about him playing part of ""Sad Songs"" for Dick James in 1969? What? That song, one of their worst commercial pop songs, was written in '83. Decades after that scene. Do the filmmaker's think we are stupid? That's not fantasy - that's just wrong!
3.) The majority of the movie was about Elton's struggles with drug/alcohol abuse, sexuality/relationships, and Mommy & Daddy issues. While it was interesting to learn about him as a person, other than some great scenes about his early days writing with Bernie, there was almost nothing about the music and how it was created. The fact that he and Elton and his band (Davey Johnstone, Nigel Olsson, Dee Murray, Ray Cooper and others) recorded dozens of great albums in cooperation with producer Gus Dudgeon and arranger Paul Buckmaster and that the band performed thousands of concerts was completely omitted from the film. In fact, the movie suggested that Elton didn't enjoy performing concerts. Like the only reason he was there was because his manager propped him up and forced him onstage. Really? Elton must have spent a huge amount of time writing, recording and performing during the first decade of his career. Was he really a wreck who was constantly wasted and feeling sorry for himself the whole time? Were there no happy moments writing music, in the recording studio, onstage? If not then I feel I have wasted my time being a fan all these years. I thought he actually liked the music but the movie suggested that once he became famous it was all about sex, drugs and depression.Were there things I liked? Sure. I really enjoyed the depiction of the early days in Elton and Bernie's relationship and particularly loved the scene with Elton writing the music to ""Your Song"". The Elton/Bernie relationship was well represented throughout the movie and the acting/singing of Taron Egerton was superb. Jamie Bell was fantastic. It made me like and admire Bernie even more than I already did. The recreation of scenes like Elton's childhood home, the Troubadour, Dodger Stadium, etc. were really well done with a ton of attention to detail. Which made it even more irritating that the filmmakers thought it was OK to distort other facts like claiming the Elton's last name was inspired by a picture of John Lennon. Sure, that would have been nice but they rewrote history. Elton has documented that it was because he liked Long John Baldry. Why change well documented facts? That's not being ""fantastical"" - that's just lying.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Some things work, some don't","This film tells the life of Elton John and his decorated career.It is unavoidable to compare this with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". This film has great costumes and great acting by Taron Egerton. However, I'm not sure about the story. It is not as engaging as I would like. It doesn't draw me in, and it lacks a poignant climax. Perhaps the ending is a bit too introspective to be entertaining.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A tad superficial & self indulgent,I love Elton John's songs and know a bit about his history having grown up with much of it but this film felt like a missed opportunity to tell his story with true pathos or make the most out of his friendship with Taupin. It's enoyable enough and Egerton puts on a good show but not stand out for me. Good DVD fodder for a rainy Sunday afternoon.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Disappointing,"First of all this is a musical & reminded me very much of The Who's Tommy - it's not just a biop so if you like traditional musicals you will enjoy this.
Second, Taron Egerton was fantastic. Jamie Bell aside the rest of the cast were bland and forgettable
Problem is that I just couldn't warm to Elton. I know that as part of this vanity project, Elton wanted a warts and all portrayal, I think there was just a few too many warts. Whilst Bohemian Rhapsody was uplifting & celebrated the music of Freddie & the Queen boys this to me didn't celebrate Elton's music just showed what an almighty Pr*** he is. Disappointing",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE - TARON EGERTON,"I have been waiting for weeks to the premier and Taron's performance blowed me away. I can't tell it was going for a movie about Elton John or going to a premier of a concert where Taron singing and performing and telling his life story from the screen (or from the stage cause it's a premier). His voice is precious, is emotional and is skillful. He got that powerful voice yet that soulful and soft that I am sure that he is the right person, the PERFECT person for those songs and for this film. Such a perfect actor, with a gifted voice.
His acting was outstanding and his eyes told things. I can felt his thoughts and feelings, his sadness, disapointment, his emptyness. Just, breathtaking.
And Jamie Bell did great, Richard Madden also, such a wonderful compilation of these three talented and professional actors.

The circle of life,"Following hot on the heels of Bohemian Rhapsody. Comparisons are inevitable especially as Dexter Fletcher, the director of Rocketman was brought in to finish Bo Rap. Both films also feature the character of John Reid as business manager for both Queen and Elton John.The film is framed with a rock bottom Elton John (Taron Egerton) wearing a heavy costume going into rehab for his various addictions and talking about all the issues in his life.Reg Dwight was a child prodigy on the piano. His life changed when he met Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) and Elton put music to Bernie's lyrics.In the 1970s came big success and battle with his demons. From 1975 Elton admits to being a twonk to his friends and family as he got addicted to booze and drugs. A year later his homosexuality became public.The framing device works well. Elton felt a lack of love from his parents especially from his distant father. When Elton found success, he found his business manager and lover John Reid more interested in Elton's career than providing him with love and affection.The songs weave around the film and sung by the cast. It seems the writer Lee Hall took the songs and built the structure of the film around the lyrics, you could easily guess what the final song was going to be.Like Bo Rhap it is not chronologically accurate. Elton John married Renate in 1984 when the film reaches its natural end in 1983.I did feel Rocketman was lightweight even when it goes into Elton's darkest aspects of his life, it just seemed too tinged with sweetness. A surprise because Elton John has never shied away from talking about his dark days so it could never had been a contractual thing.Egerton does well as Elton but it is a performance that never blew me away. Bryce Dallas Howard surprised me with her English accent as Elton's mother.Like a lot of other recent films based on true events. The film wants to blow its own trumpet by showing how much detailed they have gone to recreate the sets and costumes. Then you realise what was the point? Part of the story has been fictionalized for narrative purposes. I liked it much more with some nice humorous bits such as when John Reid strokes Elton's receding hair and some of it falls off on his hands.I saw Elton John in concert some years ago. His core band have been with him for decades, half are from Britain and the other half are from the USA. I would liked to have seen how they reacted to Elton John when he was loaded on drugs, did they try to wean him off or just joined him. The film does not tell you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Legend of rock and roll,"I do think an appropriate end for this musical fantasy biography of Elton John would have been him singing Goodbye English Rose at the funeral of Princess
Diana. It's where the world really got acquainted, a considerable more audience
than who usually go to concerts ad buy his records/CDs. I think Elton John as a
performer was truly the voice of his country expressing their grief.Saying that I did enjoy the film with Taron Edgerton playing the legendary
rock performer. It was quite the transformation from this gay shy nerdy English
kid who was studying to be a classical pianist who decides rock and roll is a
better method of expression.We see him going through the usual problems celebrities have, the bigger the
celeb, the bigger the entourage and it's tough to separate those who knew you
when and those who are hanging on and around.The film interestingly enough I think Rocketman bears comparison to is the
musical biography Cole which starred Kevin Kline as Cole Porter. Different type and era of music portrayed. But the film is structured the same way in
the way the numbers are done.Fans of Elton John will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Hmmm...,"It's alright. I really didn't like how much of a musical it was. There was a sad scene that instantly turned into a fun and happy song, this really took me out of the movie. Another thing that felt stupid was when someone would start singing mid sentence, maybe it's just because I don't like musicals...but it was rather annoying. The music is obviously good and the acting was great there was just so many things that pulled me out of the story and got me thinking only about the songs, which is the main part but I came for a movie not a collage of music videos. The ending was pretty bland also, another sad and depressing scene turned into a bright and happy song. Then it ended, just like that. The movie is enjoyable though I just personally prefer more realistic movies such as bohemian rhapsody which was executed superbly. I can understand how and why people enjoy it as much as they do. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Surprisingly dark,"There was never any way that 'Rocketman' was going to avoid being compared to 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Which is a little unfortunate because 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was a masterpiece. 'Rocketman' is an excellent film, however it couldn't live up to what that film managed to achieve. They're similar films, although rather different in a number of ways too. 'Rocketman' has a lot of spontaneous singing with back-up dancers appearing out of nowhere, making it feel more like a musical. I didn't mind that to be honest. It was what it was and didn't pretend to be anything differently.This is also a much darker film than the other one was. Both deal with a couple of very depressed artists in their prime, but this film really rams it home. There are a tremendous amount of unlikeable characters in this film. Apart from Elton himself, there is really only one likeable one that I can think of. It's almost a relief when he is on screen because otherwise the film is just too bleak.I was thoroughly impressed by Taron Egerton's performance. He maybe didn't ""become"" Elton to the extent that Rami Malek became Freddie Mercury, however his singing was excellent and his acting in the emotional scenes was of a very high standard. Elton John fans will have a particularly good time with this film, but even if you're not his biggest fan I think there is enough here to keep you satisfied and interested.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
wonderful musical biography of a great composer and performer,"""Rocketman"" tells the story of Elton John - it's not an actual biography, though. It's told in the fantasy setting of a music, using many of his fabulous songs.The timing of events is often inaccurate, songs are used at times before they were written. the story has inaccuracies, but who cares - it's not meant to be accurate, it's meant to be fun. And it is.Elton tells his story while in rehab, about his cold father, his relationship with his mom and nana, his beginnings playing piano and composing, meeting Bernie Taupin, stardom, lovers, and addictions. One thing not emphasized - Elton supposedly had a warm relationship with his mom's second husband, Fred, whom he called ""Derf"" - but you really don't get that impression in the film.Taron Edgerton sings like a dream and makes a terrific Elton. What can I say about the music? I loved every note.Elton John is a brilliant musician. a flamboyant performer, a humanitarian, and an interesting personality.

Rocketman is no Tiny Dancer but isn't exactly Still Standing.,"Rocketman is no Tiny Dancer but isn't exactly Still Standing. And I think it's going to be a long, long time before these crowdpleasers fill my soul with pure enjoyment. Very similar to last year's 'Bohemian Rhapsody', I find myself in the internal battle for conforming to an opinion that readers will appreciate but understand, or give it that elusive perfect rating because it's ""enjoyable"" to the point that flaws are ignored. I mean, this is coming from an individual who isn't particularly enamoured by Elton John or musicals for that matter. Sorry to say, and it certainly is the hardest word to say, that this musical biopic packs sequins and extravagant costumes only to follow the most uninspired clichéd narrative structure that has been recycled time and time again. Elton attends an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and revisits the life that he has lived, leading him to the dangers that fame and fortunes bring.As I mentioned, I'm not a massive fan of Elton John. Mainly because I didn't particularly grow up with his music, or was remotely interested in his personal life, however I will say the man has undeniable talent. This film depicts that wonderfully. From when he was a musical prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music to writing legendary songs with his musical partner Bernie Taupin. Hall's screenplay, with both John and his husband Furnish overseeing the end product, captures his life and condenses it down adequately where the pivotal moments are illustrated with emotion and pride. John seemingly did not want to shy away from his downfall with drugs, depression and sex addiction, which makes Rocketman that instantly more personable. Over half of the film's runtime tackles his succumbing to depression, and is more often that not heartbreaking to watch. Don't go breaking my heart, Elton!Fortunately Fletcher keeps the tone light by integrating fantastical musical numbers that depict Taupin's lyrics and reflects them through John's life. ""I'm Still Standing"" and ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" being the most notable examples. Ridiculous show stopping costumes, packed with all of John's razzle dazzle, allow for these musical numbers to glow and illuminate the stage. These outlandish attires were effortlessly worn by Egerton, who simply gives his best performance to date. The perfect balance of emotion and character interpretation, without leading to a caricature performance. It's obvious that Egerton looks up to John as a role model, and he did a stunning job. Heck, even his singing voice is pretty decent! Bell and Madden gave solid supporting performances, although weren't given enough to make a lasting impression. Howard on the other hand, I felt, was miscast as John's mother. Her American accent creeped in on occasion, and she seemed out of place considering the predominantly British cast.However, unfortunately I come to aspect of this review that I'm sure will garner some discussions. It's no surprise that the narrative structure for Rocketman offers the same clichés found in every other mainstream musical biopic. Start of a career, rise to fame, corruption of fame and money, near-death scenario and then the inevitable moment where the singer/songwriter turns their life around. Predictable to the very tip of the writer's pen. And with that, there was an overbearing sense of familiarity that prevented me personally from fully enjoying this. Despite John's melancholic depressive state, that may catch many off guard, it did feel occasionally boring. Surprisingly, with John and Furnish onboard as producers, the film wasn't as self-indulgent as I expected.But John's views on his parents, accessible to us on most tabloid papers, unfortunately taint these characters. They are written with such animosity, to the point that they become almost inhuman, preventing us from understanding their perspective on the complex childhood that John had to endure. They were one-dimensional antagonists. I'm sure they weren't pleasant to John, but some dimensionality towards them would've made for understandable sympathy. The final criticism I have is with the ending. It just ends. It's no spoiler that John eventually turns his life around. Yet as soon as he does, we are presented with typical onscreen text depicting the rest of his life. Underwhelming, I must confess.It may sound like I'm being overly critical, but that's only because these glaring issues are noticeable to me. You may enjoy the film better than I did, and I would not judge you for it. Elton John is undoubtedly a legend, and this subjective statement alone will attract several audiences into what is an enjoyable musical. Rocketman unfortunately failed to lift off for me, and seemed like an exercise in therapy for Sir Elton John.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
wow. just wow,"Ok this is the second time that i need to write something, im feeling responsible to tell the world that this movie is a must watch !

Dazzling presentation of a cliche,"In the past decade or two Broadway has been inundated with ""jukebox musicals,"" a genre that uses existing pop songs instead of a new score and shoehorns them into a story. After MAMA MIA was so successful using ABBA music, there has been an avalanche of musicals using the songs of, say, The Beach Boys, Earth, Wind, and Fire; The Go-Gos, The Motown catalog, Carole King, Peter Allen, Donna Summer, Cher, etc., ad infinitum. They usually don't work because pop songs are not theatrical. However, with ROCKETMAN, the jukebox musical comes into its own on film. We've gotten used to experiencing pop songs as background music while a montage of scenes is flashed on the screen (z.B., BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID) and the MTV music video has become a new art form. ROCKETMAN tells the story of Elton John's life (he is the executive producer, too) using songs he either wrote or performed to further that story. At key emotional moments, the actors burst into song and that songs turns into a very cinematic production number. A lot of this is brilliant and exhilarating. But alas, the story is all too familiar: unhappy child grows up to become a successful entertainer and cracks up, but thanks to the love of a significant other, they pull through it and live happily ever after. The only surprises are in the WAY the story is told. The gay love story is done pretty much the way heterosexual love stories are done, including the nude bedroom scene. No genitals are flashed, but it does present two naked men enjoying each other's body. I haven't been to that many movies in recent years, but that's the first time I've seen that in a mainstream movie. But the basic story is pretty hackneyed these days. Production values are top notch, with lots of stunning visuals, and the cast is excellent. I especially liked Jamie Bell as Bernie Taupin. Basically I enjoyed it, but it's not the masterpiece I was hoping for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Genuine goose bump moments, one hum dinger in a early first major performance.A hell of a strong cast, with really too many to mention, the casting of Taron Egerton as Elton was genius.This is a moving story, which flew past and really is as good as the reviews imo.

All you need is love,"There was a scene near the end that was near perfect and deserving of 10/10 but the rest of the film meandered too much to achieve that accolade .Warning don't go to see this expecting another Bohemian Rhapsody it's a completely different type of movie - it's closer to La La land or Mamma Mia on its jukebox approach to a musical film.Undoubtedly there will be a stage version of this it sets itself up for that . It's a retrospective film using many dream sequences that tackles the price of fame namely , sex drugs and rock and roll and hides no secrets of his sexuality- the male/male sex scenes might surprise some for their graphical content.The film could have been better but it's not a bad film - it's a good film - it's close to 8/10 but there were too many musical scenes where the songs were shared by various characters and not enough live performances . But they weren't all bad you can see them working in musical theatre it was just that they sometimes seemed incongruous in this film.The key relationship that lasted through the film was the brotherly love between his long term writing partner Bernie Tauren excellently played by Jamie Bell who for me was the star of the show .Apart from Bernie the only other person who loved and believed in him was his nan .The marriage to Renata seemed to be rushed and unexplained - it wouldn't have distracted from the film if it was edited out .Ultimately the film was the story of longing to be loved , loved by his parents , friends , lovers and the lack of achievement of that love and replacing it with drugs and alcohol .The story doesn't end with the present day but rather at a point in his life where he realises he needs to change his ways and we are left with an update on today in the credits .Pad.A 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

I didn't know that much of Elton before watching the movie, but definitely heard many of his masterpieces through the years. But, about the movie now.

Could've been better..MUCH better.,"I have to agree with an earlier review. I think the emotional effectiveness was lost with the sub par ""musical numbers"" in the film. The real emotions would have carried better had they simply done lip syncing to the ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. Don't get me wrong Taron Egerton CAN carry a tune, he has a really great voice and does an AMAZING job playing Elton. But everyime that the movie burst into music, the impetus was lost with these bland reworkings of Elton and Taupins great music. As for the story? Wasn't the worst I've ever seen, it just seemed rushed at certain points and it tended to be a bit maudlin overall. I wouldn't say it was a bad film, I would say watch it..and whenever you feel a musical number kick in? Pause the film and put on the original song. It may go down as a better viewing experience that way",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Taron Egerton is unbelievably amazing,"I loved this movie. It was a unique and creative way to do a biopic and I really felt like all the images were straight out of Elton John's mind. I felt as if the whole film was based on how Elton John felt about himself and everything he went through. Fantasy was such an amazing genre choice for the film.
I've been a Taron Egerton fan for the past five years. I've followed his career since the first Kingsman and I've always loved him. When I saw ""Eddie the Eagle"" I was so impressed by how he managed to completely alter his appearance and capture Eddie's mannerisms so incredibly well. Taron blew my mind in ""Rocketman"" as well. There's no denying his insane talent and ability to capture Elton John's persona. His singing was fantastic as well. I'm so impressed by the lengths he went to to make his performance shine. I feel so proud to be a fan of his.
Overall, ""Rocketman"" is exactly what an Elton John biopic should be. I hope it isn't forgotten when awards season rolls around. It deserves all the attention and praise it's getting. Beautiful cinematography, great performances by everyone, and a very moving script. This film is a triumph.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Very good, but not great","Although I give Taron Egerton a lot of credit for doing his own singing, this movie is no Bohemian Rhapsody. It did not have the energy, excitement, and irresistible appeal of Bohemian Rhapsody. It will be impossible for people to not make the comparison with Bohemian Rhapsody being so recently released. However, maybe Rocketman will appeal more to critics, since they just didn't seem to ""get it"" with Bohemian Rhapsody. I guess the overall success (worldwide) and the many awards (including a Golden Globe for best picture and an Oscar for Rami Malek) spoke to whether the critics or the public knew what they were talking about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Easily the best musical in years.,"There is very little wrong with this fanatical biopic. Any fears of a clean telling of Elton John's story should be put aside as he is not afraid of talking about the darker parts of his life.Before I gush on the film for several paragraphs, I thought I'd throw out my only major problem with the film. You can't really get a good grip on the passage of time. Once Reginald changes his name to Elton John (spoiler?) you don't really know how much time is passing. There are two story telling tools that kind of help. One is the montages, which are very well made and include performances that might help if you know when Elton's song were released. The other Taron's hair throughout the film. You can see that his hair thins out in the front. The problem with this is I think the hair just had two settings. Full moppy hair when he is in his twenties and thinning out like he is in his... late thirties? The rest of him doesn't look any older so that doesn't help me figure out when a scene takes place.With that out of the way though, and on the subject of Taron Egerton, he gives the best performance of his career.which is even before realizing that he actually sang all the songs in this movie; unlike a certain musical biopic that came out last year.Speaking of Bohemian Rhapsody (a film that at the time of writing I haven't finished, which is why there is no review or score for it) I am still shocked that that movie was nominated for Best Editing. Some scenes have quick edits like a Micheal Bay action sequence. The camerawork was at best uninspired...I guess what I'm trying to say is that Rocketman is a better movie in every way. This is my favorite biopic film. Not just because of the lead acting role, but also because just about every other piece of the puzzle. I look forward to seeing what the director, Dexter Fletcher, does next. This is a well shot film which shines brightest during the musical numbers. I was immediately hooked with the first scene, and how it uses the song ""The Bitch is Back.""Full credit goes to the films choreographer, Adam Murray. His only other credit is for Ready Player One. Which just makes me stop and stare at my screen. I never thought of Ready Player One for its choreography, let along think it was great. Don't know what to do with that.I could go on, like how the supporting cast is just perfect for each of their roles, or how the costume design is so good you forget that you're looking at the kid from Kingsmen and not young Elton John. This is a great film that I recommend to anyone who is a fan of Elton John, biopic films, or film musicals.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Music Is Still Great, Film Is Disappointing","I've been an Elton John fan ""since the beginning"". What made him so great is his musical genius. That should have been the focus, rather than the Ken Russell-like garish portrayal in the film. It is also very disconcerting for me to see the many instances where the songs are glaringly out of sequence, the most striking example was ""Crocodile Rock"" used as John's opening number at the Troubadour in 1970 when the song wasn't even written until two years later.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
What a disappointment:(,"I am a huge Elton John fan starting from way back when I was a kid in the '70's, and although I knew not to expect a straight biopic from what I had already heard about the film, I certainly didn't expect this! From the first song straight through the rest of the film, all I was thinking is that what we were watching was the Broadway musical Elton has probably always wanted to do, and probably should have done instead of a film. Ironically, now there's talk of turning this into a musical, so why not have gone that route instead?I cannot even single out what was the worst thing about ""Rocketman"", but certainly the most irritating was the time frame of events/songs. My concern is that people of a younger generation who don't know much about Elton and see this film will think that certain things that occurred are fact, like that one of the songs he performed at the historic Troubadour show that helped catapult him to superstardom was ""Crocodile Rock"", when in reality, it hadn't even been written yet. Another concern was an example from a fan review I read on another website where a woman(who didn't seem like she was real familiar with Elton's life)said that after seeing ""Rocketman""(which she loved), she ""felt sorry"" for him. I really don't think that Elton John would want pity from his fans, but because there is so much emphasis on the unhappy events in his life, one who is not familiar with the man and his body of work would think he hardly had ANY good times in his life during that crazy superstar time, and he DID have a significant amount of fun, he has admitted in interviews over the last couple of decades.If this film was going to be a musical, it should have had at least a fair balance of good and bad times, and not so much a woe-is-me film. But even with a fair balance, the whole thing would have still probably been a hot mess with the way it was made. A straight biopic would have been SO much better. Somebody needs to make a REALLY good and detailed documentary(and it doesn't even have to be a film in theatres; it can be a multi-part series on a network like HBO or Showtime)on Elton John. If you really want to see something that more successfully captures the fascinating complexity that is Elton, I recommend watching ""Tantrums and Tiaras"" from 1997, the documentary that was directed by David Furnish(then-boyfriend, now husband). That will be far more interesting than ""Rocketman"" was, so save your money and skip ""Rocketman"", and I say this as somebody who's loved Elton John and his music for decades. Because I am a longtime fan, I really, really wanted to like, no, LOVE the film, but unfortunately, I just couldn't.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
did those scenes of the AA meetings really have to go on throughout the whole movie,"Not quite sure what I expected here. Despite pre-release assurances to the contrary was this going to be a saccharin heavy glory tale? Or maybe it really would be a warts and all transgressive tale of absolute excess? Inevitably, I guess, the result is something in the middle. The early minutes are appalling with dancing in the street and Elton as a small child but things improve and the meeting and early days with Bernie Taupin extremely good. It is the second quarter of the film as Elton struggles to establish himself as a performer and a person that are the best but sadly things then take a turn downwards, but just not darkly enough. There is far too much of Elton feeling sorry for himself and blaming everybody else while the soundtrack races on like some over excited tribute band. I have always like the man's voice but not much else and here, we do not even get to hear his voice. I'm sure some will love this but it would have to be someone steeped in his music from the beginning.

Jamie Bell gives strong support as Bernie Taupin and he has the most moving line of the script ""yes I love you ,Elton,but not that way!""He's the sensible guy who hardly knows his good friend in his extravaganzas, his flashy costumes ,and he's the one who saved his life ,not only tonight as Elton sang in 1975 ,but later,when he made his descent into Hell.

Watford Rhapsody.,"I enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody very much - I really did. But I did get some stick for not giving it the full 10*'s: I gave it9*'s (which is still pretty good for me!). I think my main reservation was the sanitisation of Mercury's life. With ""Rocketman"" - a full-on musical based on the life of Reggie Dwight (aka Elton John) - the word sanitised doesn't enter into it!It's an extraordinary life story. As a child, Reg had a talent - very nicely demonstrated in the film - for hearing a piece of music once and being able to reproduce it. As a teenager Reg (now played by Taron Egerton) meets Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), and a writing partnership of the quality of Lennon and McCartney is formed.Dick James (Stephen Graham, so brilliant in Season 5 of ""Line of Duty"") is Elton's original manager, dismissive about many of the songs but canny enough to see the potential and send the pair to LA for a shot at fame. There Elton meets the gay empressario John Reid (""Bodyguard's"" Richard Madden) and a business and personal relationship drives Elton into megastardom. But that all comes at a cost, as drink, drugs and sex become addictive.The star turn is Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton. It's extraordinary. It's so brilliant because its not really an impersonation: by the end of the film, he just *is* Elton. When we hear some of his classic songs, most notably his 'recording' of ""Your Song"", it's the Taron Egerton version that you hear... not some slavish attempt to recreate the single. And Egerton can sing!But while Egerton deservedly gets a lot of the praise, he is supported by some really solid supporting performances: most notably Jamie Bell and Richard Madden. Bell's Taupin is a quiet supporting figure, never over-stepping his brief: he's arguably a bigger star than Egerton. Madden on the other hand - probably breaking womens' hearts the length of the country - has steamy sex scenes with Egerton but is otherwise fantastic portraying the controlling monster Reid.Whis is surely a contender for a Costume Oscar. TThe costume department have a whale of a time with this film. But, after all, they have a huge back-catalog of historically outrageous material to work with! It's all brilliantly done by costume designer Julian Day, and adds greatly to the style and dynamics of the film.Showing great directorial flair is Dexter Fletcher, famous for coming in and 'saving' ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" after a less than easy initial shoot with Bryan Singer. Here he's got full control from the get-go, and it shows. The opening of the film is a memorable entrance to a therapy session, and the use of that environment to frame the story is simply brilliant.It's also not really a biopic with music but a musical framing a biopic. This might come as a shock to ""La La Land"" haters! But it's intriguing that - apart from some of the historical releases that frame the story - all of Elton's hits are scattered through the film without regard to release date. It's comical to see the reaction of Dick James to 90's hits back in the 70's!Talking of which, another highspot is the memorable video for ""I'm Still Standing"" with Egerton cleverly CGI'd in.The film is a UK 15-certificate, so if you are prudish, prepare to be offended by the homosexual sex and drugs usage. Elton recently commented that ""I haven't led a PG-13 rated life,"" and he pushed that the film should not be diluted to appeal to a broader rating. That's a good decision.An occasional feature of my blog are sightings of my son-in-law's brother, Paul Jones, who does a lot of film extra work. He's in ""Rocketman"" but it's not an obvious appearance! During recording of Elton playing ""Bennie and the Jets"", a call went out to the extras as to whether anyone could play the piano. Paul's hand went up first, so those are Paul Jones' hands - gaudy rings and all - playing the keys!This will undoubtedly make my Top 10 of the year. I loved it. It's got all the heart of BoRhap, but has 10 times the soul. If you've not seen it yet, I heartily recommend it. How long will it be before I see another music biopic this good? I think it's gonna be a long long time...",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
trippy musical biopic,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's billed as a musical fantasy. If you are familiar with Elton John's discography and history, you'll want to keep that in mind as the film unfolds. The reward is a colorful spectacle worthy of one of pop music's most successful songwriters and greatest showmen. Director Dexter Fletcher (EDDIE THE EAGLE, 2015) and writer Lee Hall (BILLY ELLIOT, 2000) make frequent use of Elton's music within the fabric of the storytelling. It's no traditional biopic, nor should it be, given the wild ride of the man whose story is being told.Taron Egerton tears into playing Elton John like it's the role of a lifetime. And he succeeds in a way that makes it seem that could be true. Most of us first recognized Taron's talent as ""Eggsy"" in KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE (2014), though I'm not sure we expected such a dynamic step up so soon. This is not some actor merely mimicking the movements of a celebrity. This is an actor taking possession of a role. Without the costumes, Taron doesn't look much like Elton John. He certainly doesn't sound like Elton John ... though his voice does justice to the classic songs. Despite those things, he is captivating on screen, both in the dramatic moments and the musical mania.Elton's childhood and the strained relationship he had with his parents (played here by Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Macintosh) are given much attention, as is the support and love of his grandmother (Gemma Jones). With two self-centered parents wishing he didn't exist, the child piano prodigy might never have attended the Royal Academy of Music if not for grandmother Ivy. Of course, the professional relationship that meant the most to Elton's career was his songwriting collaboration with lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), and much of the film is devoted to this prolific partnership - in fact, one of the most spine-tingling moments occurs as Bernie hands Elton the words to ""Your Song"" and Elton proceeds to set it to music right in front of us and Bernie. Whether that's historically accurate or not, it provides a thrilling moment on screen for the creative duo.Elton John in rehab is used as a framing device for the film. This allows him to walk us through his life ... after admitting to having issues with drugs, alcohol, sex, shopping and anger. In other words, one of the most successful musicians of all time was a mess. And we get to sit front row as he details his early sexual confusion, his desire to be loved, his early professional frustration, and finally a career that exploded - covering him with money, adoration, stress, and more frustration. We see the warts and all.Supporting roles are filled by Richard Madden as John Reid, Elton's lover and manager; Tate Donovan as Doug Weston, owner of Sunset Blvd's Troubadour; Rachel Muldoon as Kiki Dee, Elton's collaborator on their big hit ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart""; and Stephen Graham as Dick James, the famous music publisher who first signed Elton.As someone whose favorite Elton albums are ""Tumbleweed Connection"", ""Madman Across the Water"", and ""Honky Chateau"", it's easy for me to appreciate the time period covered here (roughly 1970-1983), and also to recognize the 'artistic license' taken with the timelines and events. His 1970 gig at Troubadour features a rowdy version of ""Crocodile Rock"", which wasn't even written yet ... although the scene makes for great cinema. Many of the songs that advance the story are used out of sequence, but it's quite effective to see and hear them in context. His marriage to Renate Blauel and the rehab stint featured both occurred after 1983, which we can assume is the story's stopping point given the use of the ""I'm Still Standing"" video as a finale. Even the use of John Lennon over Long John Baldry doesn't really matter since this is all about the spectacle, and for spectacle, you've likely never seen costumes (including eyeglasses and headdresses) used to such startling effect ... and so frequently. The baseball ""uniform"" Elton wore during his 1975 Dodger Stadium gig has always made me a bit uncomfortable, but it's recreated beautifully for the film.Given that comparisons to the recent BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY are inevitable, it should be noted that director Dexter Fletcher rescued the final production of that film before finishing this one. Freddie Mercury and Elton John are two of the most fascinating figures in music history, and while both films are enjoyable, it's ROCKETMAN that is willing to take the riskier path by highlighting the flaws of a creative genius. So criticize if you must, but you'll probably still be singing in your seat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

His search for love starts with his cold parents. He finds a brother in song writing partner Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell). In LA, he is taken with the dashing John Reid who eventually takes over his business as his manager. Reid turns out to be a ruthless taskmaster and a callous ex-lover. Elton's life spirals downwards until his drug use hits rock bottom.It's a surreal musical bio of pop icon Elton John. The central theme of finding love is a powerful one for him. In a way, this movie falls into a trap. Elton has so many great hits that it's too tempting to do a Mamma Mia!. They use the songs to project every turn of his life. It concentrates more as a musical. It could have been more powerful emotionally as a darker bio-film. It should be a movie of Elton and Bernie. Every time the movie has a chance of achieving emotional tension, it decides to do a song. While it worked well for the first half, it becomes somewhat tied down by its surrealist musical style. The best use of the songs seem to be Elton writing them or the crass producer rejecting Elton's biggest hits. That part is a bit funny. Egerton has the feel of a sad clown. I wonder if Jamie Bell would work better as Elton. The movie does achieve an emotional punch in the end and that's a great moment. I do like this movie but I also question whether a more compelling telling is possible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Underappreciated,"This film, and Taron Egerton, deserve more praise. His performance was brilliant and the bio musical concept, which could have been a disaster, was surprisingly effective. It is also a tribute to the long creative partnership of Elton John and Bernie Taupin, the brilliant lyricist and friend who has lived in Elton's shadow. Curiously, while the songs are used to tell Elton's story, the words come from Bernie's experiences.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Not bad,"A work of efficient legacy image-management by Sir Elton and his team. It's quite funny in places, visually impressive in others (the costumes are a real treat), harmlessly enjoyable on the whole. It's like watching an unusually raunchy school pageant, basically innocent but with a lot of knowing references to that naughty world of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll beyond -- or maybe on -- the sports fields.Taron Egerton is a good, perhaps very good, character actor in the making. He has a certain hidden quality that makes him intriguing. He doesn't have the charisma of a Brad Pitt or a Leonardo de Caprio, or the young Johhny Depp. Using his acting chops, he successfully recreates Elton the performer. He doesn't communicate the depths of despair that we're shown the great man going through, though. I'm not sure why. Perhaps the problem is the glib psychobabble of these scenes that are the weak points of Lee Hall's otherwise nicely-wrought script. Acting support varies from the excellent (Jamie Bell, Gemma Jones) to the inexplicable (Bryce Dallas Howard).The film is a juke-box musical, drawing on Sir Elton's extensive back catalogue to slot in to appropriate on-screen situations. Mostly these are easy fits (Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, for example), some more oblique. The most successful is the title number, which is realised in an entirely unexpected, totally effective way. Kudos to all concerned.I have no doubt this movie, like Bohemian Rhapsody before it, will make a several mountains of money. It's not a bad film. On the whole it's an entertaining film. Credit to director Dexter Fletcher and his team for that. For me, this attempt to be mega-popular is always going to mean punches are pulled, that the unhappiness is never going to be particularly intense, while the highs are only tolerably high. On the other hand, the movie embraces Elton's gayness, working it through from a secret to a point of pride. That's excellent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

I hate musicals but I liked this one,"Hh
Rocketman (2019)Normally, I don't watch musicals. The dancing and singing always look out of place and do nothing but distract me from the plot. I couldn't imagine that Rocketman would be a musical so when they all started singing I automatically lost 90% of the interest. However, as it went along, I saw that this film is not simply a story about music and the actual ""musical"" elements are different from what I saw in other films.Rocketman is not on the level of Bohemian Rhapsody, simply because Elton and Freddie are different kinds of musicians. The objective here was to show his early life, his incredible talent and the choices that he has made along with valuable lessons that he learnt from them about the messed up world of music and people in general. Taron was outstanding and energetic as Elton aided by musical performances that were crisp, colorful and to the point instead of becoming 5 minute dance shows.A lot has been shown in the film and yet it feels like even more is missing with many interesting parts of Elton's career being omitted. Questionable story telling with the plot often jumping through time and forgetting the audience behind but that does not damage the film too much. The movie has a LOT of music and songs that make the 2 hours feel like 20 minutes of one big concert that makes this drama come alive.#moviesshmovies - Instagram",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"FIRST HALF NOT BAD, SECOND HALF RUNS OUT OF STEAM","The screenplay misses the mark in two important ways: the framing device of Elton's therapy session shows him wearing one of his freakishly garish costumes, the surreal touch meant to reflect his determination NOT to be ordinary - but all it really does is allow us to not take him seriously and see him as a bit deranged, compared to the other patients in the circle. An opening scene showing him removing the costume, make-up and glitter and walking into the therapy session as a reluctant but ordinaryfellow would have been an improvement. The other mis-step is the fact that the section showing him drowning in drug abuse and alcohol drains the energy and life from the movie itself, not merely from poor Elton. And there is not a big comeback moment for him following his re-habilitation, certainly nothing comparable to the final moments of Bohemian Rhapsody. No doubt Mr. John or his ""people"" had some input on the direction this project took and the choices that were made. It just seems his wonderful music deserves a much better movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Amazing!,"This movie is thoroughly enjoyable, regardless of if you are an Elton John fan. I can guarantee you will come out of this movie playing the soundtrack for the rest of the week!

Egerton shines in electric take on the biopic genre,"Last year's Oscar-winning Queen medley Bohemian Rhapsody certainly proved that the tried and tested musical biopic is still a favoured subgenre among audiences, blending the highs and lows of artist's lives with all their greatest hits. Rhapsody's quasi-director, Dexter Fletcher takes on another charismatic and troubled figure in Rocketman, an ode to the song-writing legend that is Elton John. Fletcher's film is a fervid breath of fresh air on the biopic scene, a moving and undeniably feel-good flick that takes a look at the height of Elton's turbulent career. Rocketman is not your straight biopic by any means; first and foremost, it's an unashamed musical that dismisses the chronology of Elton's music for a smartly crafted jukebox soundtrack of some of the singer's most memorable tunes. The form of Rocketman is a stroke of genius from Dexter Fletcher; gone are the limits of factuality and linear storytelling, in favour of time-jumping and metaphors... all complete with the Elton-esque pizazz of a modern musical. From the beginning, Rocketman sets itself out from the crowd and the ride that follows is a gripping tale of love, talent and the tempestuous nature of fame.
Perhaps the greatest asset lies in a brilliant central performance from Taron Egerton. Where Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury was a remarkable turn in impressionism, Egerton's portrayal of Elton is an altogether meatier performance full of unbridled charisma and nuance. It is said that the film's subject himself requested that Egerton refrain from an impersonation and instead play ""his own version"" of Elton John; this certainly comes through in Egerton's role, less of an impression but still a masterful turn from the actor, who simply engulfs the part. The supporting cast here is strong too; Jamie Bell's Bernie Taupin is a heartfelt performance and Bryce Dallas Howard is unrecognisably nasty as Elton's distant mother. Richard Madden's portrayal of the star's manager and lover John Reid is a little predictably 'boo-hiss', but this is masked by some other delightful appearances (Stephen Graham briefly steals the show by practically chewing the scenery in the first third).
Dexter Fletcher casts a smooth hand over the production, proving himself to be a sure maestro of the musical genre. Though perhaps some songs could have been more suitably placed, there are some gorgeous moments that really make use of both the energy and heart of Elton's music; a rendition of 'Your Song' sung solo by Egerton at the piano is slow and goose bump-worthy whereas the 'Saturday Night's Alright' sequence early on in the film is a joyous burst of colour and choreography. It is of course well known that much of John's career wasn't all blissful song and dance; Rocketman takes its time to reflect on the issues of substance abuse and sexuality, often in a thoughtful and compassionate way. The film certainly doesn't hide away from the flaws of its subject... and it is in Elton's many faults that the most impactful moments appear. While most of it is expertly paced, the final third suffers a little from a meandering focus, becoming a slightly repetitive chorus of psychedelic escapades and impassioned arguments that certainly takes the scenic route towards what ends up being a pleasing, if slightly cheesy conclusion.
In the end, however, there is so much that is excellent about Rocketman that makes up for its problems. It is not necessarily revolutionary (certainly not in its story) yet still manages to give its own flavour to the often placid biopic, using the music of its star not just as a plot aspect but as a structural device that really makes everything tick. Rocketman is an honest depiction of fame, both of its hardships and triumphs; it may not be all smooth sailing (with Elton's life and the film itself), but Fletcher puts forward a vigorously entertaining piece of work, bolstered by an outstanding Taron Egerton. If nothing else, you'll appreciate the mesmerising musicality of it all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
It's a Two Hour Pity Party for Elton!,"I love Elton John...but this movie is nothing but a long pity party for him!

Meanwhile, he's the center of the world's attention and making millions. There is not one ounce of joy in this movie.

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!!!!!,"This was one of the best films I've ever seen! I truly mean that!I hate musicals. That being said... This film was just F**cking EPIC!!!This film is how all biopics about rock stars should be done. It wast't the most historically accurate, didn't follow the most chronological storyline, but it showed the life of Elton John soooooo well. The film gave just enough historical accuracy to make a great biopic, but also presented Elton John just the way you want to see him. Rock Star films are similar to Superhero films in the way that we want to relate to them in a personal way, but we also just want to see them at their very best. Rocketman achieved this perfectly!I film never really shows Elton writing a song. You never get this taking pen to paper song writing process. Instead, you genuinely get to see how the life he lived affected his song writing and where the song really came from in his heart. I loved this style of story telling. It really gave the full story Sir Elton John from the worst of the worst to the best of the best, and I loved every minute of it.Taron Egerton gave the performance of a lifetime as Elton John. I don't think they could have cast a better actor for the role if they would have had a lifetime to do so. I will deeply surprised if he doesn't win an award for bringing this film to life.

"A stunning film, about a stunning man","Rocketman was an instant launch for success! It contained amazing visuals and really captured the heart and soul behind every song. Rather than being a film which only focused on Elton's music, it was a film about an individual, an individual who struggled with addiction, mental health and being accepted. Through out the film, Taron's portrayal of Elton was captivating and kept you drawn to the screen, with his ability to normalise this extravagant figure.
The music written by Bernie Taupin assisted the narrative, and gave depth to each scene. Rather than watching a biopic, it felt more like you were witnessing a piece of theatrical magic where with each song the audience were drawn closer to Elton and his story.
However, on the other hand I chose to rate it 7, because personally I believe some scenes could have been developed and furthered, to create a sense of fluency through out the narrative, rather than the constant flashbacks which were not placed in effective parts of the narrative.
Overall, personally, I would recommend everyone to watch Rocketman; it effectively tackles some serious issues which should be discussed more frequently. Furthermore, I would recommend that everyone should watch this film even if one might not be a fan of Elton John. This film will definitely make you sing along to every tune, and make you want to rock with some crocodiles!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Taron is one gifted individual.,"I hated Bohemian Rhapsody as thought it was amateurish and got by simply by the music.

Wonderful fantasy musical!!,"'Rocketman' could easily have been just another biopic. Instead, it is a beautiful fantasy musical. I thought it kinda weird at first watching a documentary film about an artist who is very much alive still. But eventually realized the film only documents his life until the 70's.Even if you're not an Elton John fan, this is a film that will appeal to everyone. The musical scenes are wonderful, colorful and vibrant. I also rather enjoyed the different versions of some of his popular songs.Having done a bit of research on Elton John - and with Elton as executive producer - 'Rocketman' is a pretty accurate depiction of the music icon's life. The attention to detail is incredible. Elton was a flamboyant, outspoken and openly gay man in a time when homosexuality was still a controversial topic. Interesting also, was the fact that Elton actually married (a woman) 'to try something new'. Needless to say it didn't pan out so well. For those who still didn't realize Elton was gay (yeah right!), the film might reveal more than you wanted to know about the superstar. Taron Egerton's performance as Elton is wonderful!I also enjoyed the fact Bernie Taupin features prominently in the film, being the brainchild behind most of Elton's chart topping songs.

"Campy, heavy-handed mess from the get-go","This highly-touted film about Elton John that blends the biopic and musical genres together has one big selling point: Taron Egerton's go-for-broke performance as the deeply troubled musical genius. Regrettably, the film as a whole is self-indulgent and cliche-ridden to the hilt and goes down as a misfire.Problematic right out of the gate, the film has to overcome a befuddling start which takes place from the tawdry vantage point of a psychiatric support group and frames the film's narrative from that trivializing angle from there on out. Perhaps a film of better nuance could have pulled this off but here we have camp, mawkishness and exploitation all rolled into one. The end result is a film whose tone is dumbfounding, annoying and at times embarrassing to endure. The musical numbers in this film are mostly perplexing and very rarely effective in conveying this life story.I am not one to criticize a biopic because I realize it's a genre that is beholden to the life it is portraying. While I don't question the film's accuracy in portraying how awful Elton John's personal demons were, a film with more discipline almost definitely could have done better. A campy film, one that keeps poking you in the eye with how bad it is, will not tell anyone's story all that well, let alone a legend like Elton John.Bearing in mind that Egerton's performance has to be seen to be believed, I nevertheless decline to recommend this.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Good musical,"The problem with this movie is that I expected Bohemian Rhapsody and got Mama Mia.
I wish I had been told this movie is a musical movie. Like the greatest Show man, Les Misérables and many others, there's hardly any dialogues and the songs represent what the characters are feeling. The theme of the musical is based in Elton John's life with Elton John's music.
Once you understand that, the movie is quite good. The choice of songs is great and the singer are pretty good. Except for the 8 year old Elton John. That kid is amazing! I'm talking extraordinary here. I thought the child in Coco was amazing. Specially the singer in the Mexican version. But this child is FAR better. A rising star no doubt.

two movies in one,"Ok, I'm sure that headline is confusing but hear me out and I'll explain it.

However, I do feel like it Id liked it better if it just stuck with the Mama Mia-isqe theme throughout. I understand the want of life details in this film, Elton Jhon is a very interesting man, this story needed to be told. But, the separate themes contrast at times, in my opinion, making it come off a little messy. Once again I did fully watch and enjoy it so I do recommend this movie. The main reason I recommend this movie, other than its just fun, is Taron Egertons' character work.Taron is so good in this film. To the little gestures to the big dramatic, he does such a good job of channeling Sir Elton. My favorite thing he does is the signature Elton smirk he nails it and it made me giggle every time.

Good biopic,"Good biopic. Where the direction and the acting succeeds is portraying the conflicts inherent in one man's story of massive musical talent, world-class wealth, deep-rooted parental issues, and life lived in the public eye as a closeted homosexual. But the character's narrative, while very strong, is often not only uneven, but uses production values that at times are much too sparse. To me, the budget constraints were frustratingly obvious during much of the film and detracted from the story. The actors are all stellar and because of this, the strong performances are what gives this film the power it has. Particularly good were Bryce Dallas Howard, as Mum (Sheila Dwight), and Richard Madden (Robb Stark in ""Game of Thrones"") as Elton's treacherous lover Jon Reid.

'Kingsman' star Taron Egerton portrays the legend with such a unique performance that he's basically not trying to imitate or impersonate him by look or how he sang, but an embodiment of what Elton went through in his lifetime with its ups and downs.His costars Bryce Dallas Howard, who portrays his cold-hearted mother was quite troubling to watch, including the struggles of finding his calling in life during the 70s and 80s. Whereas actor Jamie Bell as longtime friend and lyricist Bernie Taupin was pretty uncanny. Whether it was performing for small crowds, meeting people who would give him his big break (and ultimately one betraying him at one point), addiction, or a self-identity he would establish on his own altogether, he would find his way around.I say that this is a music biopic that seems to capture the essence of how Elton John came to be. Egerton's way of singing some of his hit songs was worth listening to and that he seemed to have captured it flawlessly. I sense awards season has a place for him and this flick.If Sir Elton was able to earn himself a Best Original Song Oscar for 'The Lion King' back in the mid-90s, I think there just might be room for Taron Egerton to earn a nod as well.Although this movie depicted how troubling his life was in the beginning - including a few fictional moments that is likely meant to keep the story going - there's always that glimmer of hope that can only be achieved your own way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Egerton is simply magnificent in his portrayal of Elton John! [+68%],"Six-line Review: The stand-out feature of this musical biopic is Egerton's stunning performance. He is ably supported by Jamie Bell, Richard Madden, and Bryce Dallas Howard. Dexter Fletcher's skills in visualizing the various tracks from EJ's discography warrants plaudits. Lee Hall's screenplay tries to point out how fame and wealth often come with their own share of emotional struggles, case in point being Elton John's life at his musical peak. While the film did come across as slightly self-indulgent at certain points, it redeems itself with a scene where EJ speaks his heart out to the folks who played key roles in his life. Again, none of it would have worked if not for Egerton's dedication.Verdict: Worth a watch!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Great movie, GREAT performance by Taron Edgerton","I have been impatiently waiting for this movie to come out, grabbed the 1st pre-viewing I could. Big fan of Taron, even bigger fan of Sir Elton. He helped me survive my formative years, love, love, LOVE Elton. My only criticism of the movie is, that not knowing a lot of detail about his life during this problematic time in his life, I would have loved to have been provided a clearer time frame that all this movie addressed, as well as a more in depth explanation of key issues that I didn't know because of a lack of detail or biography explaining what we were witnessing in relation to what happened & when.

Love Elton John but hated this movie,"I really love Elton John's music, but I hated everything about this movie. It was just all over the place. Songs being sung before they were actually written and sung by other people. I almost always hate when other people try to sing someone else music, especially a kid.This movie just seemed like one big pity party for Elton. Apparently, everyone hated him when he was growing up, even his parents, and this led to drugs and stuff. This does not make for a good movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A fine tribute to a great entertainer,"Based on the life of Elton John: from childhood to a discovery of musical talent to superstardom to addiction to recovery, the episodes of Elton's life are dramatized with his famous songs used as a backdrop in the traditional musical form.""Rocketman"" has many similarities to ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" released late last year: 1) both are about British men who were born in the late 1940s each with great talent; 2) both had attractions toward other men; 3) each was unfortunately involved with the despicable leech John Reid who also ""managed"" (aka manipulated) their careers in destructive ways; 4) both also reached great fame in the excessively wild 1970s; and 5) each had the inevitable fallout. A great difference is that while Freddie Mercury passed away in the 1990s, Elton John has survived the notorious traps of fame as he continues to perform after many decades in show business.Perhaps it is because ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was seen first, it had the greater impact. But ""Rocketman"" is still a powerful and enjoyable film. It is a fine tribute to one of history's most endearing and enduring entertainers. It is also a salute to Elton's inner-strength, humility and wisdom in knowing when to hit the breaks on a destructive life and the ability to see what really matters. And the chance to start again and win with a new life while still keeping the best of the old one. And kudos to Taron Egerton for his rich and touching performance. He even did his own singing in those spectacular musical numbers.With two recent movies exposing the evils of John Reid, maybe it is his turn for a biopic. ""Predator-Parasite"" would make a great title.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Absolutely fantastic.,"Blew me away. Much better than Bohemian Rhapsody. It Honestly did about everything correct. One thing that both get right is the performances, so let's start with those.Honestly, Taron Edgerton is better than Rami Malek when it comes to leads. The main difference between the two is Taron actually sings all of the songs in the film, and he does a fantastic job. I'm guessing the reason for his casting is because of Sing where he sung I'm still standing, and honestly, I cannot thing of better casting. He had nothing wrong with his performance, just like the rest of the cast. None of the cast really did anything wrong. Their performances were great, and the singing was worth the price of admission alone.Obviously, a film has to have more than Oscar worthy acting to be fantastic, and luckily, the film delivers on everything else. The story is wonderfully told, and the script is written perfectly. The entire story is filled with so much heart and care, and told the story of Elton John in a way where you can tell the people making it actually cared about making a great movie about the story of Elton John. Also, the Cinematography! It looked great, and was very well done. However, the main thing of note when it comes to the Cinematography is the colors. The film was extremely colorful and it worked with the rest of the film perfectly.In the end, it's simply fantastic. The editing, pacing, storytelling, dialogue, script, music, and more were simply wonderful. It's a must see for any fan of Elton John, and I would recommend it for people just simply looking for a good movie. I gladly give it ten out of ten stars. So far, my favorite movie of the entire year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"If I hear ""Bohemian Rhapsody was better"" one more time!....","I'm reading these reviews having a little chuckle to myself... people are mad that it was more of a musical than a bio; comparing it to Bohemian Rhapsody or just hating on it because it's about Elton. Why that's a problem, I have no idea. You're going to watch a film based on Eltons life and music... like, what are you expecting? A horror/thriller?... Here's an unbiased opinion for those of you who haven't seen it. Yes, it's more of a musical but it still tells Eltons story in what I think is actually a really creative idea.

"A Glittering, Emotional Journey Through Elton John's Life","""Rocketman"" (2019) is a dazzling, heartfelt musical biopic that captures the essence of Elton John's life with flair and emotion. Taron Egerton's portrayal of the iconic musician is nothing short of spectacular, bringing a raw, vulnerable depth to John's character that resonates long after the credits roll. Egerton's singing is a revelation, matching the legend's vocal prowess with impressive accuracy and emotion.The film's narrative structure, weaving through Elton's life in a non-linear fashion, is both innovative and engaging. It allows for a deep dive into his psyche, showcasing his struggles with addiction, identity, and the relentless pursuit of fame. The musical numbers are where ""Rocketman"" truly shines; they're not just performances but are integrated into the story, often reflecting Elton's inner turmoil or joy, making them integral to the plot rather than mere spectacle.However, the film isn't without its flaws. Some might find the fantastical elements and the way certain events are dramatized a bit too theatrical, potentially distancing the audience from the real emotional core of Elton's story. Additionally, while the supporting cast is strong, some characters feel underdeveloped, particularly those closest to Elton, which could have added more layers to his relationships.Director Dexter Fletcher manages to balance the glitz and the grit, crafting a visually stunning film that's as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the ears. The costume and set design are impeccable, transporting viewers back to the various eras of Elton's life with vivid authenticity.Overall, ""Rocketman"" is a bold, energetic, and deeply moving tribute to one of music's most flamboyant figures. It's a film that, while not perfect, captures the spirit of Elton John's journey with enough heart and soul to earn a solid 4 out of 5 stars. A must-watch for fans and a compelling introduction for those new to Elton's story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"In my opinion, the perfect movie.","This movie deserves every award nomination it could possibly get. The film is so amazing and is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Taron gives a breathtaking performance as Elton John with his real, stunning vocals and didn't fail to make me feel so many emotions. The casting is amazing, especially with the younger versions of Elton. Child actors usually aren't at the level of adult actors, but the kids really knocked it out of the park. And of course, so did everyone else. I see people saying they didn't like the musicals aspect of the movie, but I thought it just enhanced the fantasy. And people need to stop comparing it to Bohemian Rhapsody in their reviews. You're supposed to be reviewing the movie itself, not comparing it to others.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Could have been much better,"Imagine the near-impossible task of creating an epic biopic that fully captures the over-the-top eccentricity and energy that is Elton John. And Taron Egerton did a dang good job.Disclaimer: I'm a big fan of Elton John. Yet, I'll do my best to keep my admiration of his music separate from this movie.Rocketman tells a half-fantastical, half-true story of the life of Elton John. It's more of a surrealist fantastical musical than a to-the-point accurate portrayal of his life. But, maybe it's better that way.The music numbers hit all the right spots. Performed out-of-order from the times Elton John is alive, Rocketman aims more for style than accuracy.Sound design and costume design are true to Elton John's nature and the entire team deserves praise for their hard work.And did I mention Taron Egerton's amazing vocal performance?Yet, my admiration for this movie stops there. The portrayal of this movie is told from a flashback perspective while Elton John is in rehab. We start the film from the present (rehab) and hop back and forth between the past & present. Though a fan of everything else about this movie, I found this method of storytelling is lazy, overdone, and uninteresting.Time is not fluid in this film as years and months are blended in this film and everything seems handed down to John. It's confusing and a disservice.Shame, as this movie was missing that one special ""pow"" that takes it to the next level.3/5.

Rocketman Review,"This is a great movie. Rocketman is everything Bohemian Rhapsody should have been. Here are the very few negatives to this film. Some of the family drama does feel kinda forced. It doesn't take a lot away from the experience but it does feel odd. Some elements of the film are not entirely accurate. One such thing would be that the ""John"" in Elton John's name did not come from John Lennon. Rocketman had very few inaccuracies unlike Bohemian Rhapsody where they changed parts of Freddie Mercury's life to fit a story. The film does start to hit the same beats as every other musical biopic out there. Here are the positives. The acting is phenomenal. Taron Egerton does an outstanding job as Elton John. He embodies so much emotion into his performance and he is an outstanding singer. I am confident in thinking that Egerton's performance could be a possible Oscar nomination. Jamie Bell and Bryce Dallas Howard both do an outstanding job as the people who Elton cares about. Richard Madden does a great job as a manager and also the ""villain"" of the story. Even the child actors who portrayed a young Elton John do a great job. The musical numbers in this film are amazing. Each musical number has its own visual flare. They keep your interest and get the other characters and surrounding extras involved. Unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman's musical scenes are intriguing. Costume Design and Set Design are also really good in this film. The costumes look almost exactly like the actual costumes Elton John wore. The sets just look amazing. The tone for the film remains consistent and the film is paced really well also. The narrative for this film is great. The film focuses on Elton's John musical skills, alcoholism, and drug abuse. Bohemian Rhapsody barely focuses on the effects of Mercury's drug abuse while Rocketman shows the effects of what happens with these substances. The film's structure is great. The story is told from Elton John while he is therapy and ends with him overcoming his problems.. While I do thoroughly like Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman is 100% the superior film. Overall, Rocketman provides amazing performances, outstanding musical numbers, and great costume design. I give Rocketman a 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Rocketman Fails to Launch,"After about thirty minutes or so, I realized this was in fact a musical. If you like musicals, you'll probably like this film. But, stay away if you're not a fan of themOne aspect I disliked was that too many scenes start in one ""area,"" then the singing/song starts, then they resolve the song into a different ""area"". Also, I can't recall a single song lasting more than a minute or so, at best. You more-less get snippets of a lot Elton's songs, with the occasional symbolism added to some of them. What's unfortunate, in my opinion, is that some of his hits aren't at all played like the real songs themselvesIn regards to the acting, it was decent. There are some emotional scenes which were filmed quite effective, but, nothing that'll leave you sobbing. In addition, you may find out some things that you never knew about Elton JohnIn conclusion: I think die-hard Elton John fans will probably like this movie.

"He was never ordinary, still a magical bio type of the lift off of a pop superstar, who had plenty of highs and lows.","Always liked enjoyed and respected the songs of one ""Sir"" Elton John as his music was about love, life, and struggle as his words really touched one's inner soul. With this big screen picture called ""Rocketman"" it tells the rise and break out of the stardom of one Elton John it's like the film also teases in a fantasy like way with parody that involves certain songs from John. Flashbacks and looking back at his life are the norm thru the film, as his life is heavily focused on. Looking all the way back at his childhood days you the viewer see that it was tough that Elton grew up without his real dad after the split from tough overbearing mommy Sheila(Bryce Dallas Howard) it was clear that Elton needed a father figure.At an early age this little shy boy took interest in piano and ""Elvis"" and would later sing and entertain for escape, and one by one this would mold him into a pop rock superstar! Still along the way this man like everyone else had high and low points from addiction with hard drugs and alcohol, plus he had to battle his inner demons and come to terms with his sexuality. I must also say that actor Taron Egerton was great as Elton he really hit all the high notes from the singing, acting, and he captured all of the man's emotions and brilliant madness of the fairy tale ride of life! Excellent wonderful work for certain go see this if you are an Elton John fan, as it shows how a pop legend came about thru struggles and pain, as this ""Rocketman"" is still standing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"""I´m not the man they think I am at home!""","Dexter Fletcher brought Queen and Freddie Mercury to the big screen with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" in 2018. 2019 should follow Elton John. The British pop star, who is almost done with his musical career, is still alive and certainly had a lot of involvement in the film. Since I really liked Elton John and especially his music, but didn't know much about his life, I really wanted to see ""Rocketman""... and not just because I also really appreciate and like the leading actor Taron Egerton!Elton John joins a support group and tells his story when he wasn't called Elton but Reginald Dwight. He describes his highs and lows and his rise as a world star!""Rocketman"" surprised me positively in many ways, such as the musical flair that I hadn't expected. But all the song numbers have all become very great, some even stunningly beautiful and graceful! Exciting dance choreos and great singers, Egerton in particular convinces with his beautiful voice. But above all, I like the somewhat ""relaxed"" moments!Between the gaudy, colorful songs there is always room for honest and beautiful moments. On top of that the movie can be funny at times. Of course, this is also due to the charming actors. Taron Egerton is the star and his non-existent Oscar nomination is disappointing. I think it's great that he has grown from a young action star (""Kingsmen"") to a seasoned character actor who can´t just dance, but also sing! There´re also the small details with which he brings Elton to life that touched me. Jamie Bell is also good, Richard Madden is doing well and Bryce Dallas Howard surprised me probably the most with her role.Nevertheless, I found the film a bit too long and some scenes were stretched out too much, especially in the second half. Other moments, however, were too rushed for me, as if one wanted to end the film somehow. I also felt the apparently inevitable ""Hollywood-Kitsch"" the whole runtime. Sadly Dexter Fletcher was unable to resist some clichés ...But ""Rocketman"" can still convince in my opinion and is extremely entertaining until the end. Not just because of the great music: Matthew Margeson composed the score and arranged some great numbers. Well-known Elton John classics feel fresh and new. ""Rocket Man"", ""Tiny Dancer"" and ""I'm Still Standing"" knocked me out of the park and ""Your Song"" moved me to tears as so often.Visually, the film convinces with some spectacular pictures and tracking shots, especially in the musical scenes. Some CGI effects were a bit too artificial for that, but whatever, I can forgive that for a film like this ...Conclusion: ""Rocketman"" is certainly not just a very entertaining work for Elton John fans. Of course, not everything in Elton's story will be accurate, but you can do that in a film like this, if the end result works on an emotional level and is able to entertain. And ""Rocketman"" entertains, even if it is a little uneven here and there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Great acting.. Excellen soundtrack.. Interesting movie!,"Don't go into this movie expecting a biography style flick... but expect something closer to a musical or even a rock opera like ""Tommy"".
First, Edgerton's acting and singing were top notch!! This movie used music to transition time and place, and had a lot of fantasy aspect to it. It IS the story of Elton John's life and climb to fame, but not painted as a pretty picture in any way. It doesn't gloss over his lifestyle and actually contains some pretty explicit scenes related to this lifestyle, but it's part of the realism of his life. It's interesting the dynamic of the movie and what is based on reality, yet with scenes filmed that were ""fantasy"".
The updated versions of Elton's excellent songs remade by Edgerton were in no way disappointing. In fact, as a former radio announcer (playing these songs hundreds of times on the air), Edgerton really REALLY did the songs justice! Just a phenomenal job covering Elton's songs, but with a really nice twist to these ""altered covers"".
There movie was really well done and they did an awesome job recreating the 70's in set and design. Visually, it's stunning work.. and in most other ways, you'll get lost in the movie (which shows the film makers and production crew really paid attention to detail and did a great job all together).

Rocketman Fizzles Out,"I'm not sure if I saw the same movie as everyone praising it. I thought it was okay, but definitely not an 8 or 9 out of 10.
There are many problems with this film. The main issue, which I didn't realize until someone pointed it out in their review, is that the magic of listen to Elton John singing his songs is missing in this one. If you compare it to a recent, similar film by the same director (half directed by him), Bohemian Rhapsody, we get to hear Freddie's voice. Malik lip syncs to it, but that's why we fell in love with the artist. Taron does a good job singing, and performing, but he's NOT Elton John, vocally.
Second issue is that it's tonally all over the place. It wants to be a musical, or it wants to be a drama, it can't be both. Usually musicals are more upbeat. But I think the placing of a music scene is critical, and it just felt very repetitive in this movie. In fact, I took a bathroom break during one of the middle music scenes because I didn't feel compelled to stick around. I felt the drama scenes were worth more to sit through. The uneven tone just kept kicking me out of the movie.
The makeup for Bryce Howard was horrible when she was playing the older version of the mother. It looked like all they did was make her face lighter, it was pretty lazy. And why was the step father/boyfriend not considered a supportive person in Elton's life. I get that the mother and father were not as warm, but the step father, in addition to his grandmother, seemed to be a pretty good father figure.
Ultimately, this film fails to make Elton a sympathetic character. At least with Freddie Mercury, we did feel emotion for him and his plight. With Elton, it just felt more like 'woe is me' x 20, i.e. over and over again. Then the movie ends, and you're like 'okay, what was the point of this movie?' There is no point, no message. We just watch Elton's life set to a Mamma Mia-esque framework, with mediocre results.

A disjointed biography that checks off all the tired tropes.,"After the critical success of Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), it felt like the market was ripe for another movie about a homosexual piano-playing musician. Enter Rocketman (2019), a biopic about Elton John (Taron Egerton) that didn't quite know what to do with itself. Was it supposed to be the greatest hits of Elton John songs, like Mamma Mia! (2008) was for ABBA? If it was intended as a straight biography of Elton's life, it falls into all the tropes that seem to be requirements for the genre. There didn't seem to be anything original here other than sex, drugs, and rock and roll.One aspect of Elton John's rise to stardom that I found interesting was his ability to pick up and play any song after hearing it once. This skill is quite a rare trait, and I almost wished this film played up that aspect a little more. I also was intrigued to learn that, while Elton was great at playing the piano, he needed someone to come up with the lyrics for him. Again, it is a great talent to be able to put words to music, which felt like a missed opportunity that was set aside in favor of focusing on Elton's homosexuality and drug abuse.I understand that these issues doesn't help tell the ""tortured artist"" narrative. Still, when the songs themselves don't integrate well into the story, I felt that Rocketman was too disjointed to make any sense. If you took the songs as well-choreographed music videos, then they'd be great to watch individually. However, they usually stray from the main point of the story when they start, and they don't seamlessly work themselves back into the plot without some sort of clunky transition. Still, like how Yesterday (2019) was a bland realization of a great idea, at least it and Rocketman contain some excellent musical scores.A disjointed biography that checks off all the tired tropes, I give Rocketman 3.0 stars out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Rocketman (2019),"Directed by Dexter Fletcher. Starring Taron Egerton, Jamie Bell, Bryce Dallas Howard, Richard Madden, Stephen Graham, Charlie Rowe, Steven Mackintosh, Kit Connor, Tate Donovan, Celinde Schoenmaker, Matthew Illesley, Ophelia Lovibond. (R)The life and times of rock star Elton John (Egerton), told largely through flashback from a rehab group session. Not so much a biopic as a musical fantasy, allowing the film to cleverly avoid accusations of being a ""true story"" with numerous historical inaccuracies (which it certainly has), or being a formulaic jukebox musical that trots out loads of popular hits (which it certainly does); music and image have a life of its own here, shattering the constrains of reality, informing the emotion and experience of its flamboyant protagonist, and giving the familiar songs new context and fresh voice (Egerton did his own singing). The scene near the end with Elton confronting the ghosts of his past is crashingly obvious, and certain episodes are brushed over too hastily (his relationship with eventual wife of four years, Renate Blauel, comes out of nowhere and ends just as quickly). Egerton is sensational as the music legend, inhabiting the role enough to almost (but not quite) disappear inside it; Fletcher (who previously took over directing duties from Bryan Singer on a different gay British rock n' roll icon picture, the greatly inferior ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") stages several visually exciting musical numbers both onstage and off.70/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Taron Egerton is Elton John - but he NEEDS the others too!,"A truly surprisingly good film. Taron Egerton is - and continues to be - excellent, but this is an ensemble piece - without the superb performance from Jamie Bell, the unexpectedly skilled presentation of a truly unlikeable character by Richard Madden and the inspired choice of both Matthew Illesley and Kit Connor as the younger Reg Dwights this film could not have worked. It has a masterful weaving of fact with fantasy and - as you might expect from a film about Elton John - there are a number of hugely enjoyable musical set pieces. It is no surprise that a film about the music of someone who appears in most music collections is such fun to watch. Very enjoyable. For some odd reason several people compare this film with Bohemian Rhapsody, but that would be unhelpful. This is a musical about the rise to fame of Reggie Dwight as he became Elton John. It has musical pieces interspersed with the story and works very well. Bohemian Rhapsody is a better crafted film (I was absolutely blown away by Bohemian Rhapsody when I saw it at the cinema), and it deserved the Oscars it received but (sshhh - little secret) I actually find watching Rocketman more enjoyable, somehow!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"A stunning and dazzling cinematic marvel, and nothing less.","Let me start off by saying that if you are a fan of Elton John, this movie is an absolute must-see. I walked into the theatres to see this movie not really knowing what to expect and simply adoring John's music, but I left completely blown away. I can say with complere confidence that this movie is like nothing I have ever experienced in a movie theatre before. John's music is used to portray his struggles and joys and his life from when he was a young child in a manner that can only be described as whimsical and dazzling. It is beautifully eye-catching and tells the story and struggles of Elton John fantastically. Additionally, this movie does an incredible job at portraying the raw and brutally dark emotions that Elton went through in his life and how huge his demons he had to overcome were. This movie does not hold anything back and is really all-in when it comes to emotion and darkness. It is ""R"" for a reason. Be warned. In a tragically beautiful sense it spins John's woes and defeats to the tunes of his songs we are all too familiar with, putting new spins and orchestration on them to allow us to see them in new lights and show how dazzlingly defeated John became during his early and breakthrough years with drug and drink. Finally, I can't go without mentioning Taron Egerton. Give this man an Oscar. He masterfully portrayed the singer, gaining both a spot-on match in both looks, mannerisms, and personality. Going so far as to do all of the singing himself, Egerton is a shoe-in for an Oscar. In conclusion, Rocketman sparks to life and dazzles on the screen.

Atypical biopic of a singer,"I accept the less typical musical biopic of a star musician but just wished more songs were completed, even if some had to be cut. I had not known about his relationship with his parents. That was probably the best part of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Amazing acting on a not so amazing story.,"I'm not really sure what the point of this movie is. Half of it was happy song and dancing, half of it was sad and dramatic. It felt disjointed all the way until the rather abrupt end, when they tell you things got better instead of showing you, which was incredibly annoying. I spend almost two hours suffering through the drama, only for the happy ending to happen off screen.However, I have to give credit, where credit is due. The acting is superb, and I'm not only talking about Taron who is deserves every superlative that has been used to describe him in this film.

A bit of a mess,"If you are an Elton John fan and wanted to see a movie about the rise of Reginald Dwight to superstar - This is not the movie for you. The biggest problem begins with twisting the chronology of musical compositions putting popular hits in to the days when he was a struggling musician. If you wanted to put all of the chronology and music and costumes and origin story into a blender and then have somebody write a musical filled with actor singer dancers about the goo that came out of the blender... This is the movie. It's not unwatchable, and does have some entertainment value but it's just kind of strange and leaves me wishing there were an actual movie that told Reginald's story - about the evolution of the music and his career as it actually happened.

Superior Musical - Rocketman,"I generally do not care for musicals, nor bios of musicians. However, in this case I would like to make an exception. Rocketman is an excellent musical as well as a gripping personal story of Elton John. The Taupin/John relationship is wonderfully crystalized, and the brilliance of Elton John's musical genius is professionally delivered by great direction and acting within the film. Although the lead actor seemed to be a bit off for casting, he and the rest of the cast were letter-perfect when it came to delivering the goods. The music, of course, is the real star of the film. Only the Beatles can match the scope and magnificence of Elton John's prodigious output over the course of many years in the music industry. The tragic revelation of his unfortunate relationship with a loveless father is heartbreaking. It was amazing that Elton John survived all of this adversarial treatment and still emerged with his great talent and production. A must see film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

I don't see the point,"I didn't know it was a musical going in, so that was an unpleasant surprise. I'm okay with a well done musical that explores the origins and motivation for each song (displaying it in context), but you didn't get that in Rocketman. The songs were played during events that occurred before the song was written, and sung by people who weren't even involved in writing the lyrics. So what's the point of that?Next is the story (or the 20 mins of story in between songs). This is not the story of Elton John, it's a story about a guy called Elton John. Everything is different to reality, so again, what's the point? If you're gonna change primary characteristics of people you're portraying (eg Dick), change the name and everthing else as well. Instead, this reeks of a propaganda piece by Elton rewriting his role in some pretty crappy stuff that he did throughout his career, making him out to be a victim.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

CRAZY,"Rocketman is a biopic which preferred to tell its story like a musical. That's awesome because there are some crazy and spectacular scenes. But in second half, it becomes boring. Tempo is great at all but before final sequence it falls. In final, movie shows itself and everything becomes better when we hear Sir Elton John's voice. Taron Egerton is amazing. He lives in the character. Also his singing is so much better than I expected. By the way, lots of people compare Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody and that sounds so normal to me. If I say something about that, although I liked them both, Bo Rhap is better with one or two steps.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Better Than Bohemian Rhapsody,"Rocketman has something very specific in common with (believe it or not) Deadpool. Both hang their hats on the idea that they are uniquely subversive stand-outs in their particular genres: Rocketman being a psychedelic, non-linear musical biopic, and Deadpool being a fourth-wall breaking, tongue-in-cheek superhero flick. While the skin and dressing of these films is certainly noteworthy, the soul of them is never far from their genre trappings. If you've seen Walk Hard, it's hard to miss the genre clichés Rocketman is playing in. Nonetheless, the highly-stylized musical numbers, along with the sheer amount of unexpected weirdness, make Rocketman fly above its banal shortcomings.
The comparisons to Bohemian Rhapsody are inevitable: the true story of a closeted British rock star from the 70s dealing with his success through sex and drugs, peppered with classic pop songs. Both are ""greatest hits"" biopics, less concerned with over-arching storytelling than with hitting the high notes and corny clichés.
However, what Rocketman gets right are its oddities. Like Elton himself, the movie is a cinematic display of flamboyant excess, with a dark sadness flowing just beneath the surface. Egerton continues his star ascension here, and he's strong with the little story he is given (most successfully centered on his relationship with writing partner Bernie Taupin). Instead of a linear ""here's-how-this-song-came-about"" storyline, it's a jukebox musical, with entire scenes bursting into unexpected song-and-dance numbers.
Could easily see this being on Broadway someday, and maybe that's where it really belongs, or as viewed as a string of high-production music videos. Nonetheless, in its current theatrical form, it's a toe-tapping good time that does justice to some truly incredible music, and leaves you wanting more Elton.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Loved it...,So many pompous windbags out there. Just hush I say to them. It was a fabulous musical. Very sad but it gave me insight on his music and where the lyrics were derived. I grew up with older siblings that allowed a plethora of music from various genres and timelines to be experienced. I have always loved Sir Elton John from the first song that I've ever heard. I was a grade schooler singing my favorites like Benny and The Jets and Crocodile Rock. Tried to imagine the meaning behind the words then but thanks to this movie I can appreciate the life lived behind them. I thank everyone involved with the making of this film and for sharing it with the world.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Average at best,"I thought 'Rocketman' was average at best. It seemed as though the filmmakers tried too hard to break the biopic mold by having people break out in song and dance every time they were in danger of committing the 'biopic cliche crime'. It was too distracting for me. The song/dance breaks felt like an excuse rather than a natural extension of the scene. To me, 'La La Land' is the perfect mold for how a musical should be done. The singing and dancing was used sparingly and only when the scene absolutely demanded it. Anyway, I personally felt that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was a better film. It's too bad filmmakers are so beholden to the pompous critics. In bending over backwards to appease the critics, they only suck the joy out of film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Poor Poor Rocketman,"Well, you know the soundtrack is good, but you expect it to be performed by Elton John, not some high school musical rendition.You also know the story is about the most flamboyant entertainer of the time, an epic tale of sex, drugs, and rock and roll; but you don't expect it to only be the background in a one dimensional tale of poor, poor Rocketman, the most depressed, lonely, unloved music icon ever. This film is produced by Elton John, and I don't know why he felt it was necessary to make his fans suffer the same depression as he apparently was in his youth, but I actually resent him for it.

Sadly disappointing,"There was no bigger EJ fan in the 70's than me. I lived and breathed Elton, and even learned to play the piano because of his songs.

1. I didn't like that the movie was basically a musical instead of a biopic.
2. With a few exceptions, I disliked the arrangements of the songs. Why change perfection? The songs should have been presented as Elton recorded them.
3. Many factual inaccuracies and timeline issues. Songs were presented entirely out of chronological order- Elton did not sing Crocodile Rock at the Troubador.Acting was good, esp. Taron Egerton.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Rocketman is a real ""Rocket Man"", as it soars for a fun musical and shows that will ""Still Stand"" for a while","When going to a concert, are we seeing the ""singer"" or the ""show""? This may seem like an odd question, but it makes sense when considering what exactly were watching. We're not there to listen to some songs, but there to experience them as done by it's creator. Chances are their not just going to sing them, but also incorporate dancers, videos, lighting, costume, and perhaps more. A lot of singers/bands will do this to make their fans feel like their witnessing an experience. I've been to plenty myself that have included Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and Metallica. One of the biggest proprietors of this happens to be pianist Elton John.While I'm not a regular listener of his music, I will say that Elton John is a talented singer/rocker who's created some songs I like, including ""Crocodile Rock"", ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", and ""I'm Still Standing"". I've always seen him as the modern day Liberace, who happens one of the few famous piano players and also loves to incorporate a lot the theatrical costumes into his shows. I recall learning about him when I first saw The Lion King in 1994, but knew very little about the singer himself. It all comes front and center in Rocketman.At a rehab facility, a fully costumed Elton John (played by Taron Egerton) admits to being addicted to a lot of things and proceeds to tell his life story. Cut back to his childhood, he was raised as ""Reginald Dwight"" by his mother Shelia (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) and grandmother Ivy, as his father is largely absent and uninterested in his son. It's apparent right away that ""Reginald"" is a prodigy with a perfect musical year and becomes good enough to receive a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. He trains further and further while gaining an interest in rock artists like Elvis.He joins a variety of bands until he tries to make it on his own. Inspired by on of the bands he plays for, he changes his name to Elton John and forms a partnership with songwriter Bernie Taupin (played by Jamie Bell). The two get along, but Elton realizes that he himself is gay. Regardless, his first show in Los Angeles makes him an immediate star. Elton eventually starts a romantic relationship with his new manager John Reid (played by Richard Madden), but starts his addiction to drugs, sex and alcohol.I'll say that Rocketman is the movie that I had hoped Bohemian Rhapsody was going to be. It's informative, emotional, and most importantly, very entertaining. The biggest difference is that unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, which was a traditional biography, Rocketman is more of a fantasy-like musical, which incorporates his songs into his life story. The result feels like as if it's Elton John' story as told by him. I have no idea if this is close (this feels like it has to be) to what happened, but the filmmaker understood that it was more important to make a unique movie then anything.A lot of that is on Taron Egerton who does a fantastic job playing Elton John. Along with understanding the pressure the real singer went through, he also translates the flamboyance into something that resonates two meanings: escape and expression. Another screenplay probably would have made him one note. Rocketman allows Taron to express the various sides to come out just to show how complicated Elton was. I'll bet a million dollars that he'll get an academy award nomination for his performance. Perhaps we'll have two years of actors playing musicians winning awards.Is the movie grand? I though it was certainly very good. When the movie drifts into the drugs and alcohol territory, it does stray a little longer then needed. While I know Elton John did go through a lot of abuse, it's something I've seen a lot of rock star movies already do a lot. I might have been kinder had it focused on his sex addiction, which is rarely seen in movies. At best, Rocketman needed at least fifteen minutes trimmed so that the pacing feels a bit quicker. Regular movie goers probably wont see this as an issue and should have fun regardless.I'll give this eight flamboyant glasses out of ten. Rocketman is a real ""Rocket Man"" as it soars and shows it's audience an experience they could never experience at any of his shows. It's a fun musical and it'll ""Still Stand"" for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A Bit Mottled...,"While the acting and singing were excellent, I was confused as to if this was supposed to be a movie with music or a musical.Overall, it was a very stark and interesting story.

That was probably cathartic, but still painful.My wife loved it, I was of the ""take it our leave it"" mindset.The costuming was FANTASTIC, better than the original outfits. I was surprised that an extended sequence used the song Pinball Wizard by the Who, instead of some other piece by EJ. Yes, I am fully aware of EJ's role in Tommy.

"Taron Egerton, Jamie Bell and great songs carry a quite sad biopic","I always thought of Elton John as someone who had his bad days and tantrums but also didn't take himself too seriously and knew how to laugh at himself a bit but sadly this didn't come across at all in this film. It shows someone who was constantly brilliant but constantly unloved, lonely and sad throughout his whole early life. There are no happy times at all despite his great success, and we are reminded of both the sadness and success over and over again.It is also sad that, despite a great vocal performance by Taron Egerton, there are no versions of these brilliant songs that I think people will want to hear again from the soundtrack, just because of the way they are used.What saves the film, apart from the reminder of the phenomenal back catalogue Elton John has, is the acting performance of Egerton, Jamie Bell and The more minor role of Stephen Graham.

Bland,"The life of music legend Elton John.Underwhelming. I did not set my expectations very high and even then was disappointed. When this was released I figured it was an attempt to cash in on the success of Bohemian Rhapsody and make a biopic about a 1970s rock star. This despite growing up in the 70s and liking the music of Elton John. I thought Bohemian Rhapsody was excellent but just from the trailers Rocketman didn't seem to have anywhere near the same energy, profundity and solid storytelling.And the trailer was pretty much spot-on. Rocketman is a linear telling of Elton John's life...and that's it. Director Dexter Fletcher turns it into a semi-musical but that just makes it worse. Like most musicals, song-and-dance numbers being jammed into the middle of a scene makes for jarring, clumsy storytelling and this is no different. It might have been okay if they had used the original music but instead we have actor Taron Edgerton singing the songs, and he just doesn't sound right.There's never any spark that makes the movie interesting, Some scenes are downright clumsy: the scene that runs through the movie of John at an AA meeting seems pretty implausible and contrived and merely there as a means for John to tell his life story.On the positive side, performances are very good. Despite his singing, Edgerton is great as Elton John and Jamie Bell puts in a solid performance as Bernie Taupin.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Doesn't know what it wants to be,"Rocketman, tonally it's all over the place. When it comes to making films about musicians there are generally two choices that can be made. It can either be a drama, telling the story of the musician in a realistic way or it can be a jukebox musical, where the musician's music is used to shape a fictional narrative. In this case, the film try to tell Elton John's troubled life story within a jukebox musical; and it doesn't work. One of the elements that contributed to the issue with the film's tone was the directorial choices to have so many scenes which were surreal and frankly trippy. At one point an entire room was levitating. In another scene Elton was singing while underwater, with a child in a space helmet playing the keyboard. There are many other scenes equally as weird, and each time something like this happened it completely took me out of the movie. The problem is that this movie for the most part is not fun. It's actually really dark and depressing. If they wanted to tell such a dark story they should have made this a proper drama, not a musical. In terms of the performances, to be honest I didn't find them believable. Egerton had some good moments, but it never felt like he was Elton; he was always just Taron wearing silly outfits. The supporting cast were not very good either, apart from Jamie Bell, who played Elton's song writing partner Bernie. Richard Madden as Elton's manager came across as a one dimensional villain, with no interesting character traits. In the technical department, I thought the costume department did a tremendous job in finding/making outfits which resembled many of the iconic looks Elton sported over the years. The hair & makeup team on the work they put into the movie was fantastic. Visually, the characters looked great.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! THIS MASTERPIECE IS ROCK&ROLL!,"I finally got time to watch #rocketmanmovie. No words can describe how amazing and inspiring this movie is. YES IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!
Just like Taron Egerton said: It's full of colour, glitter, sparkle, magic, beautiful music, sex, rock&roll and most importantly of all, heart.Everything was absolutely wonderful, from the music to choreography, from the costumes to the performances, from the direction to the cast and the crew.
🚀#rocketmanmovie is showing Sir Elton John's perspective on his own life without hold back traumatic experience and is showing many layered emotions most people can't understand. What a brilliant journey to celebrates the ups and the lows of Elton John's life.
🚀Taron Egerton is nailed it as Elton. He portrayed Sir Elton John in the most stunning way, he really captured his motions and his facial expressions, it's amazing. His voice doesn't sound exactly like Elton, however, he performs so freaking wonderful it's easy to ignore that fact, it even more awesome because he can successfully put put his own spin on it and and make it sound incredible. And Jamie Bell, he did so good as a friend like Bernie Taupin. I love that he was casted for this role. There was so many chemistry between them in the movie. What a special friendship they both portrayed.
All the other cast were spectacular too. Btw: Richard Madden has left me wanting to punch him in his beautiful face :).
🚀The soundtrack is unreal, it's so similar and different from the original at the same time, and it had somes beautiful new touches.🚀The costumes, it's all in the details. THEY'RE SO GORGEOUS OMG! Hand down!Every review I've hear about #rocketman is just so positive and I love hearing about it, because it's honestly what the entire cast and crew deserve.

A Gritty And Realistic Portrayal Of Elton's Early Life But A Bit Too Heavy On The Fantasy Bits,"Given that Elton John was himself involved in the production of this film as one of the Executive Producers, I have to say that it's a courageous and at times painfully honest portrayal of Elton's early life. It pulls no punches, depicting the troubled home life he had as a young boy (and especially his troubled relationship with his father) along with his descent into booze, drugs and sex as his career took off, along with the abuse he endured in some of his early relationships. There's certainly nothing sugar coated. On the other hand, the movie portrays Elton as a prodigy, apparently destined for musical greatness from early in life. It seems a reasonable depiction of Elton's early life, set as a sort of rock opera at times, as everything is placed among various songs Elton is famous for. I thought the choreography was good, and Taron Egerton did a fantastic job of portraying Elton - surely no easy task when the man you're portraying is also the Executive Producer of the movie you're playing him in. So kudos to Egerton and to most of the rest of the cast who did a fine job and portrayed their characters believably.I thought, however, that the movie did go a little overboard in paying homage to Elton's music. At times this becomes little more than a musical with some dance routines thrown in for good measure. At times it's a bit of of fantasy, and perhaps because of that and because the movie tried so desperately to fit the story of Elton's life with Elton's music (it's a little bit like ""Mamma Mia"" in that respect except that the story is true) it at times seemed a bit disjointed. The most obvious recent comparison one might make for ""Rocketman"" would be ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" which told the story of Freddie Mercury and Queen, and also pulled few punches in offering us a glimpse into Mercury's life. On balance, I'd have to say that I preferred ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" which is a little surprising to me since I actually prefer Elton John's music to Queen's. But that movie flowed better and was markedly better paced than ""Rocketman.""But saying that I preferred ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is not the same as saying that I disliked ""Rocketman."" It's a very good movie - often enjoyable (if you're a fan of Elton John's music) and often quite heavy as the more troublesome aspects of Elton's life are portrayed. And it really is worth watching for Taron Egerton, who actually performed most of Elton's songs and did very well with them. And the movie does end on a high note, highlighting (through captions and pictures) Elton's life since he overcame his various demons and addictions. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Feel the energy!,"I wasn't looking forward to this movie, because I thought this was just gonna be another musical biopic of one of the biggest stars of all time, his ascent into glory, how he gets lost in the booze, the drugs, the sex and then his final redemtption. This movie is that, but there's just so much more to it, particularly in the way that it's executed. Dexter Fletcher, the director of the film, really did a wonderful job at incorporating musical acts into the structure of the film, and it's done in a really creative and energetic way. It's not just, here's the life of Elton John, this happened, then that, it's way more creative than that and I loved it. Great performances all around, but man, Taron Egerton knocks it out of the park, fantastic performance that I was definitely not expecting at all. I liked him a lot in Kingsman, but I think this is the film that really makes his acting abilities shine and I'm excited to see what else he does in the future. As for flaws, I think I would really have to be nitpicking the film, but at the end of the day it is another biopic with the beats that you would expect. But it's in the energy and execution that the film really shines bright. I think they did a wonderful job at making us understand why things turned out the way they did with Elton and how much of a genius he is, but also how tragic his story is.

"A well done, well acted, biopic of a life void of self love.","First thing you should know this is a bit of a musical in the sense it does break into sing and dance using Elton Johns song in real life situations and feelings. If you hate musicals it might not be for you. That aside it was beautifully done. The acting was spot on, Egerton did a fantastic job as Elton John and Jamie Bell was perfection as Bernie. Some may have known more about Eltons past and his demons than others, as for me I was heartbroken by his early story and happy to know he found joy and self love later in life. I had no idea he faced so many demons and had so little to no self love. It's s very real and raw story intertwined with the music from Elton John we all love.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Slightly disappointed,"I had high hopes for Rocketman to be my film of the year so far. Unfortunately it failed to live up to those expectations.The film focuses on Elton John's formative years via way of flashbacks in a rehab meeting. Never been a big fan of his music, but there's certainly some classic tunes in his back catalogue. Taron Egerton plays Elton with Jamie Bell playing his sidekick Bernie Taupin. There's no doubt that both leads and Egerton in particular put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into their roles. Although it didn't quite live up to expectations it's still a pretty entertaining watch. Have seen a few press clips saying that some of the content isn't 100% accurate. There is no doubt that this is the way that Elton John feels about his early years, so it's therefore reflecting those feelings.I wasn't aware that this was a musical production, so if you are not a fan of actors bursting into song you are probably best advised to give this one a miss.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Meh,"So I just saw an advanced screening of Rocketman and I have very mixed options about the film.To get the positives out of the way, I thought that Taron Egerton did a Fantastic job as Elton John, nailing both the personality and appearance. Jamie Bell also gave a solid performance as John's lyricist Bernie Taupin. All of the other performances were decent as well. The dialog wasn't bad or cringeworthy, with the exception of executive Dick James. Nothing was done POORLY necessarily, but I will say if Egerton was not in this film, I probably would have rated Rocketman a 4/10 or even a 3/10.
Let me get into all of my issues with this film.Firstly I need to mention that Rocketman is a musical, where moments of his life or feelings are related to John's many songs. I only feel the need to mention this because I feel the marketing was very misleading, convincing people that Rocketman was going to be a more conventional biopic. Now, the musical moments are done badly, but for a feature film that is about a REAL person and story, it doesn't fit well. What the writers and director were trying to go for would have made a better broadway show, instead of a theatrical release. There are also WAY too many of these musical-style moments, particularly in the final third. And to clarify, by ""musical"" I'm referring to a film like Moulin Rouge.I also felt like Rocketman glossed over a HUGE amount of events In John's life such how he recorded his first few albums, how he wrote songs with Bernie, etc. They could of included a scene of Elton helping John Lennon overcome stage freight or any other interesting stories during Elton's golden era, but Rocketman flashes forward to the start of his career to when he starts to descend into drugs. The most important part of his career is pushed to the side. Another example of this involves John's wife. We don't know who she is, how she knows him, or even her name. The actress is literally given around 6 lines. So when her three minutes of screen time are up, and you find out her and John have divorced, you don't care because you learned nothing about her.Also, going back to the musical aspect, some inaccuracies end up being raised. Like how Elton wrote Saturday's Alright for Fighting at 12 (which he didn't). I also question the idea of everyone he knew, save Taupin and his grandma, were so harsh and mean.Overall, Rocketman isn't an awful film by any means, and with Egerton's performance and the Your Song scene, I can still recommend this to extreme John fans. Otherwise, wait to rent.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
They say biographies do not make good movies -WRONG,"Two years in a row - great movies about great musicians. This film is introduced so well and the telling by Elton John of how he got where is was in the different timeframes - well done. Also the music connections to what he was going through at the time - well done. Learned so much about his life - two uncaring and incapable of caring parents, but thank heaven for his grandmother since she was the only one in the house who encouraged him.
Another movie about the hard time a gay person has when trying to be themselves. Yes it deserves the R rating and I am glad Elton Joh insisted that he had not led a PG-13 life.
Stay for the credits - so worth it. Hope this gets the oscars it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Well Worth A Watch,"RocketmanI really liked this movie, on the whole the dramatic impetus was supplied by Elton's chronology mirrored in the songs that were written at roughly the same time. It was quirky, inventive and showed an aspect of Elton, the national treasure.What was good,1, the music was fabulous and Taron Edgerton did a fine job, he really tried to reproduce both Elton's style and range.2, the ensemble playing was strong throughout and they seemed to gel well. I really liked the boss of the record company.3, the staged set pieces were brilliantly realised.What was not so good:1, it was never really explained why Elton's father rejected him, it inferred he was scarred by the war and left incapable of demonstrative behaviour or any depth of affection. And yet later in the movie he is a changed man, was he just a homophobe?2, there were several weak spots, I will detail two, when the song Saturday Night.. came on it seemed just shoe-horned into the movie, as happened in Mama Mia, it was just too contrived. The second was the gathering of family in the therapy group, if this was an epiphany moment it fell way short.3, the need to have flashbacks from a rehab group was just an unnecessary device and just did not work because he did not interact with the group in any real way.This was a great movie, certainly one for the fans, it won't win an Oscar but it was a jolly good night out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Beautifully done. Not sure why anyone would not love it,"I HATE HATE HATE the all too typical biopic, and especially the musical biopic.This is lovely. Imaginative, new, just joyous...except when it's sad, repressed, hopeful, disappointed, etc. The near-musical storytelling works beautifully to convey the story without the typical bogging down explaining everything, or by linking (most of) the individual vignettes into a single story.I did not at all get why some are super disappointed in not all songs being played in full.

Rocketman > Bohemian Rhapsody,"Rocketman decides to focus on Elton John's character evolution more than anything else, chronicling his life from when he was a wee-little boy to his glory days as the colorfully decorated, piano-playing, musically blustering star. One detail I must address that really hoisted the exploration of John's life was, in reality, the ""R"" rating. You get to see a respectful and psychological turn in his persona, you get to witness the heartbreaking drug-runs that he constantly forces himself into, you get to view the uncut collision of him dealing with his sexuality, and you even get to feel that loss of love that Elton had felt when he persistently questioned his relationship with peers. All of these affairs are dispensed without and blockades or any desires of censorship and I must condemn the filmmakers for going about this risky decision.And sure, Rocketman is arguably quite the corn-fest at times, but the movie is able to take these cheesy elements of the typical rockstar biopic and format it into a flamboyant fashion that characterizes more charismatic and less repetitive exhibitions. Which brings me to my next point...I am so pleased that Rocketman turned out to be a nearly full-blown musical? I mean, it had to find some way to be different from Bohemian Rhapsody, right? Whenever a musical note comes on it's not just there for Elton John fan-a-holics. The songs always pertain to the presented events transpiring on screen. The methods they use to present the songs as well, offer some more than compulsive and devouring visuals. I also appreciated how they redid all the songs to fit the scenes in a more appropriate manner. It makes the film seem less like a compilation of Elton's original greatest-hits and more like a rendition of what each song means to the story.Now, Taron Egerton's performance in this is...wow, wow, wow, wow, WOW. He is just bleeding with range and chaotic pizazz in this encapsulation of a contrasted human individual. If someone is worthy of an Oscar nomination this year, it's this guy.Rocketman doesn't entirely rely on nostalgia like most of its kind does--that implying that sometimes it does, however--and most of its misfit adventures proved about in the story seem earned rather than glossed over at a maximum pace of negligence. Definitely check this one out, especially if you're an Elton John fan!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Everything I wanted ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" to be.","I do not hate the film, but I do not like the reputation that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" has received (Best Picture nomination, seriously!?) and thought that it was a hugely overrated film filled with flaws. What that film failed to do, this film did it in spades. The film does follow the typical beats of a biopic and it's a formula that is hard to get away from. However, what director Dexter Fletcher did here was to focus onto the life of Elton John as a musical and in a very nice fashion, used various songs of his to tell this story and I thought that was brilliant. I don't know much detail about Elton John, so it was nice to learn a little about this great singer and to know the life that he had lived. If you've seen or heard stories about famous musicians, they tend to tell the same story and had similar problems from addiction to music producers. This is no exception as this film does tell a similar tale, but at the same time, I was intrigued with this film and just enjoyed watching this story. Another great point is that the people involved in this movie did a great job recreating some parts of his life, but to make costumes that are really close to the original. The best thing that this film had done was to have me interested and wanting to listen to his music.I've always liked Taron Edgerton and I thought he was absolutely phenomenal here as he acted his butt off and actually sang proving how great of an actor he is. Without a doubt, he really deserves an Academy Award nomination for this role. From the first time you see him, he embodied himself as Elton John and for the whole film, he was able to bring so much emotion to his role, allowing us as a viewer to connect and sympathize with him. His singing is amazing and I really liked the fact that he actually sang those songs rather than using another person to sing it for him. Edgerton is not only the stand out role as every single person in this film was great! Jamie Bell was great and I never knew he had singing chops. Richard Madden was amazing and brought a sense of cynicism to his character. Also, Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh as the parents of Elton were such terrible parents, especially the father and their performances were so good that you simply despise them and sympathize more with Elton. I won't say much, but I absolutely hated his father in this movie.One of the major surprises of the film was that this was a full on musical. I expected to see the basic biopic story, but to tell this story as a musical and actually using his music as a base to tell the story was a pretty smart choice. Most of the musical numbers were extravagant with great visuals and unique shots, along with having a cast who can sing. Each number did allow us to see what Elton was going through, from his ups and downs to showing part of his life that was filled with joy to this downward spiral he had entered due to his addiction.I'm praising this film a lot, but I did have a few minor gripes. I did feel that there were parts of the movie, mostly in the third act that dragged a bit, which felt that the film had gone a tad bit too long. Also, some of the musical numbers, as well sung as they were, felt a bit too overbearing in the third act and I felt that the movie focused more on the singing rather than the actual dialogue. There are moments where after a song, the characters will briefly talk and then the film will jump to a new song. I would have been nice to have a little breather in between rather than having a slew of songs being sung back to back.Overall, this is definitely one of the best films of this year and Edgerton does deserve an Oscar nod for his performance here. If you love musicals or are interested in the life of Elton John, then I highly recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
More Broadway Musical Than Movie. :(,"I was expecting this movie to stand up to Bohemian Rhapsody. I was immediately taken out of it whenever a big musical number would pop up with all of the different characters singing parts of the EJ songs out of nowhere.

Works On Every Level - Despite My Lack Of Love For Elton's Music,"I really don't know how to quantify this; I have no great love for Elton John's music (though I do gladly acknowledge that Your Song is one of the most romantic songs ever written); I really don't like Taron Egerton's blank canvass acting. But this film still creeps in and worms into my emotions. It's a brave decision to play this film as a full-blown musical, complete with Elton John's back catalogue recast as a set of show tunes with accompanying choreography. There are some brilliant moments - the decision to tell the story in retrospect through an AA meeting (this film is very good on addiction, and it's refreshing to see a portrayal of a man with an eating disorder); there's a stunning sequence during the first American gig which perfectly captures that special moment of connection between performer and audience where a gig transcends to something truly elevating; there's a great supporting performance from Richard Madden; and for all my cynicism, Taron Egerton really can sing. For most of the film, I suspected emotional involvement was directly proportional to the viewer's love for Elton John's music, hence my sense of being impressed but unmoved most of the time. But towards the end come two striking emotionally cathartic moments; a moment of reconciliation between Elton's adult and childhood selves, and a wise decision to close with I'm Still Standing, a song. If the test of a musical biopic is to draw in and move those who don't love the music of the central character, this film works on every level; even if I retain a far greater affection for the dame director's earlier musical, Sunshine On Leith.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"An Emotionless, Campy, Cringey Biopic","Yeah, the writing is bad. It's eye-roll inducing. Egerton tries his best to overcome the bad writing, the bizarre, campy musical numbers, and some weak supporting performances, especially from the usually great Bryce Dallas Howard. Her acting is over-the-top, her accent isn't natural, and she looks far too young for the part. This is just total miss for me. Elton's music is phenomenal, but the pacing is also all over the place and it all felt rushed. This seems like nothing more than an attempt to ride the coattails of Bohemian Rhapsody's success, which was also a film that I wasn't too fond of. At least that one didn't have such weird musical numbers. I didn't realize how much I didn't need to see Richard Madden attempting to sing Elton John in a Kimono while filing his nails. Egerton is great, but yesh, this one is a total misfire.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Fantasy musical magic,"The marketing for this film was a tad misleading. Rocketman is much more of a musical with fantasy elements than a standard rock biopic. This was a bit jarring at first, with some sequences being a bit cheesy, however, you do get used to it as it goes along. Taron Egerton is fantastic and captures much of Elton John's presence. Plus he actually sings all of his songs, unlike Rami Malek in Bohemian Rhapsody. He is more than deserving of an Oscar nomination. I especially enjoyed the focus on Elton himself, as opposed to just his music. You really get a sense of his struggles and difficulties. Rocketman still has a lot of typical music biopic notes, but it's creative and vibrant enough to emerge as a hit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Blew me away.The lights came up after the movie was finished and credits were rolling, but I was so breathless I had to sit still in my chair for another five minutes just to catch my breath and get my wits back.And I'm not saying it was the all out best movie ever, but seeing it in theaters, yes it almost definitely is the best in-theater movie ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Biographical musical about music legend Elton John.,"Rocketman is a new film adaptation of a biography. The film is directed by Dexter Fletcher, the director of Eddie the Eagle.The film is about the biography of Reginald Kenneth Dwight, who is more known by his stage name: Elton John. Elton John is played in the film by Taron Egerton. The film is further produced by Elton John. The film focuses on the ups and downs in Elton John's life. How in his childhood he always had the feeling that he did not get enough love from his parents and then little from his father.When he shows that he has a musical talent, he is sent by his parents to a special school for music. At this school he meets Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), who is good at thinking up and writing lyrics. In this way the two become friends and know how to break through in the music world. Elton John quickly touches many people with his unique music style and lyrics. In this way he comes into contact with the positive sides of the music world such as money and fans, but also with the negative sides such as too much alcohol and other drug use. He did these wrong things to try to escape his inner loneliness. Elton must try to overcome the negative sides in order to find his own happiness for himself and his fans.Dexter Fletcher has turned this biography into a musical, because in the middle of the scenes they often suddenly switch to a song. This film is a bit different, for example, last year's Bohemian Rhapsody musical biography. Dexter Fletcher has also taken over the directing work of this film, after director Bryan Singer went the wrong way and was fired by the studio work. Dexter has corrected his mistakes and finished that film.
With Rocketman, he was given the opportunity to make a musical biography himself. By turning this biography into a musical rather than a biography, he has taken the opportunity to portray both similar films in a different way. With Bohemian Rhapsody, they also played it safely and did not delve too deeply into the negative aspects of Freddie Mercury's life. With Rocketman they have dared to take this step more and show some dark times from Elton John's career, but as a viewer you also get the necessary explanation to understand why these things happened in his life.In many biography films about well-known music artists, the artist who is making the biography is often deceased, but Elton John is still alive. The film ends sometime around 1990 and so misses some happy moments of Elton's daily life these days. If they had spent a little less time on all dark sides in the script, there would have been enough time left over for example to meet his partner, how he starts his own family or how he supports charity actions.By playing this biography as a musical, as a viewer you actually get the chance to sing the songs or to tap the beat with your hands or feet. In Bohemian Rhapsody they used Freddie Mercury's audio clips on which Rami Malek who played the role of Freddie Mercury only had to play on. Taron Egerton and the rest of the cast really sing the songs of this film themselves. The songs may sound a little different than you know them. This has given the cast the chance to put the songs in their own way.
Taron Egerton and Elton John have already collaborated on this movie in the movie Kingsman: The Golden Circle. Elton John also advised Taron Egerton not to copy his personality completely, but to make it his own version. This way Taron Egerton knows how to portray the role in a good and personal way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Uneven at best . . .,"Uneven is the kindest verdict I can give to Rocketman. There are a three or four brilliant scenes where the film absolutely sparkles. And there are 30 or 40 other scenes where it slogs along clumsily and overwrought. And shockingly, the film runs completely out of storyline at least 40 minutes before it finally ends. The filmmakers desperately try to fill this extra time with endless scenes of poor Elton feeling so sad and misunderstood that only drugs and self-pity can help. And he takes ample doses of both . . . over and over . . . to the point where you will begin to roll your eyes and lose interest.But do not despair, the movie eventually comes to an end. And when it does, you are immediately greeted by an onscreen newsflash notifying you that Elton is now sober! And what a relief you'll feel - like a double-dose of good news! Not only is Elton okay but this mess of a movie is finally over!The music is good but you knew that going in. (It's Elton John for god's sake.) There are a couple of fantastic magical-realism scenes. (Concert at The Troubadour; suicide vision at the bottom of the pool). And there are some interesting coming-of-age, discovering-musical-genius scenes. But the vast majority of the film is insufferable whimpering: ""mommy doesn't love me; daddy's so mean; no-one understands me; and you don't like me 'cuz I'm gay.""

Comatose,"Melodramatic Afterschool Special music video with tired Public Service announcements between every track. Misfires from the first frame. Nothing stirs, nothing registers, nothing moves.

Just someone dressed like Elton John wandering from costume party to costume party. Evidently, as Elton John is an Executive Producer, that is exactly the way he wants it. All show.

Hold Me Closer,"I think it's going to be a long, long time before we see another biopic as whimsical, freeing, high-flying and visually spellbinding as Rocketman. Everything this movie is, ultimately, is what Bohemian Rhapsody should have been. A flamboyant whirlwind, so fitting of the wonderful, colorful world of Elton John. You couldn't have made it any other way. True, it's a bit unusual to be making a musical biopic about a man that hasn't died, but Elton has lived so many lifetimes and lives, it's hard to imagine him leaving us anytime soon.Rocketman is a tapestry of Elton's life from childhood to his troubled, but decadent adulthood. What is revealed is how miserable a life he truly had. Dealing with a father who was never truly there for him, and a love life filled with so many grifters, it seemed as though he was never going to fill the emptiness of his heart. Artistic brilliance truly comes from grief, as Elton pours his feelings out into every last song. Listening closely to the lyrics, and along with Dexter Fletcher's impeccable cinematic structure, we realize how many of these catchy, unforgettable tunes represented Elton's loneliness and longing. We also explore Elton's many unfortunate addictions. Drugs, sex and alcohol kept him at bay, until they nearly killed him. I got a kick out of how the film was crafted along the confines of an intervention, populated not only by Elton's many lovers, loved ones and acquaintances, but the many versions of himself.Not to mention, Rocketman is a jukebox musical on steroids. All the hits are here, and the entire cast has a swinging time performing them all. Shouldn't all musical biopics be like this? For my money, this is a nice change of pace from how formulaic and tiresome some biopics have become these days.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
An entertaining musical that's let down by following the music-biopic formula too closely.,"'Rocketman' is a pretty entertaining Elton John biopic, but unfortunately it's just that: a musical biopic. While it does differ from the majority of them as it's a straight-up musical as opposed to just featuring on-stage performances, every beat of the narrative is very generic and therefore predictable. This means that for all its different qualities, its generic traits actually overcome them leading to a film that's unfortunately much more forgettable than it should be. Like I said though, it is definitely entertaining in the moment and the musical sequences are well-realised and enjoyable. Egerton is great in the leading role, too, and holds his own in the singing. Actually knowing that he is performing the songs himself really adds to the believability of the whole thing and doesn't just make it seem like an old album is playing over a mime act. In the end, this is probably one of the best examples of the music-biopic thanks to the fact that it's trying to be something different. Unfortunately, though, that's not enough to overcome the traditional trappings of the genre, leading to a picture that's enjoyable in the moment but ultimately rather forgettable. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Enjoyable biopic of Sir Elton John,"This is an credible though not perfect biopic of Sir Elton John. Understandably, it doesn't cover his whole life. It ends before it even touches on his more recent career achievements, such as writing the music for the Lion King movie or Billy Elliot stage show. Even his long term relationship and marriage with David Furnish is only mentioned as part of the end credits. No, this movie focuses mainly on earlier days of the star's career, the struggles he had to overcome his demons and the influences that brought them into his life in the first place - starting from a young age. As you would imagine, there is a lot of Sir Elton's music included and if you're not a fan of that then this movie is probably not for you. There are a number of highly stylized scenes too, but for the most part they work well in getting the message across. This movie doesn't try to gloss over anything either, but it still doesn't pack the same emotional wallop as, say, the recent Queen movie - Bohemian Rhapsody. Perhaps that is because Elton John is still with us, while Freddie Mercury has passed on.I don't know how close this movie is to real life; a lot of the characters are painted with broad strokes and there is little nuance. Elton John himself is portrayed as some sort of child prodigy. Regardless of its veracity, however, I enjoyed this movie and am happy to suggest you give it a try.

Boring,"I went into the cinema with high hopes for this
movie. I was bitterly disappointed. This movie was boring and a typical story of rags to riches with all the emotional baggage you could think of. Elton John is far more of a person than what the story told and to focus purely on all his destructive behavior, poor choices, sexual identity and sad family life is not anything new. Elton John has achieved far greater things in his life than what was depicted in this movie and none of this was shown. Sad really.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Yep, watch it","Let's just start by saying this movie is totally a musical so if you hate them with the passion that my father hates them, well, I take it back, nope, don't watch it! If you are ok with with a musical, then as you were. I learnt a lot about Elton in this movie and I appreciated the educative experience that came with a bit of fun and fabulousness. Certainly a nice easy ride, nothing that will make you ugly face cry, have night terrors or rip your heart out so off you go and enjoy the songs, glasses and outrageous outfits",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Hooked from the beginning to the end,"First of all, Taron Egerton and Kit Connor were amazing as Elton John. Kit Connor plays him when he's a kid and you barely see him but he just leaves such an impact that it's great. It also helps that he looks like a tiny version of Taron. Now, Taron Egerton is just amazing as Elton John and he helps make him seem like a normal human which is hard for somebody like Elton. As I was watching him I got so invested into his performance that at certain points I actually was starting to tear up all because of his performance. He also, at the request of Elton John, did all of his own singing and it's amazing. I really hope that he gets a nomination for his role. Jamie Bell, who plays Bernie Taupin, also did a great job. Instead of just using the songs as if he was recording them the movie used them to help transitions from one point to another and it was really clever. The music was used to help montage parts of his life and show what was going on in his life. This was definitely the best option because if they didn't do it then the movie probably would have dragged out longer. This movie is two hours and one minute long and honestly, I never felt it dragging on for too long. Each moment in his life felt the appropriate amount of time spent on it but there were certain points that I wished they would have spent a bit longer on. The one thing I would've added in though is little title cards that say what year it is because it got a little confusing at times what year it was and how much time has passed since the last scene. Like I mentioned earlier in this review the story got me emotional and that's because of how the film felt like a fly on a wall throughout his life and showing the ups and downs he went through and honestly you can't watch this movie and not just want to help him out. All of the costumes in this film are hands down spectacular. You can see how much care and work went into making these costumes look as accurate as possible to the real thing. In the end, this movie does an amazing job of showing the like of Elton John and definitely not holding anything back. I highly recommend watching this even if you aren't a fan. I give Rocketman a 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"""Victim of Love"" looking for redemption","""Rocketman"" (2019 release; 121 min.) is a bio-pic about Elton John, ""based on a true fantasy"" as we were promised in the movie's trailer. As the movie opens, Elton is in an outrageous costume and he staggers into what we then understand is his very first AA meeting. Elton begins telling his life story to the group, and as he starts singing "", the movie morphs back to Elton's early childhood. We get to know Reggie Dwight as a 5 yr. old, living with his miserable parents (his dad is cold and aloof, to say the least), but Reggie takes an immediate interest in his dad's record collection... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: Elton John's biopic has been in development hell for many years (at one point Justin Timberlake was attached to play Elton), but the movie is finally here, directed by Dexter Fletcher, who also came to the rescue for last year's Freddie Mercury bio-pic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". The interesting thing is that these 2 movie's couldn't be more different. Whereas ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" follows the traditional bio-pic path, ""Rocketman"" does not, and cannot be relied upon to be an accurate reflection of Elton John's musical career (example: it shows Elton performing ""Crocodile Rock"" at one of the famed 1970 LA Troubadour shows, a song from several years later that he didn't perform in 1970). Later on, ""Rocketman"" (the song) is played out as a long fantasy scene in a pool. And so on. The movie feels more like a Broadway play, and in fact I will state right now that it's only a matter of time before this becomes a mega-Broadway show. The other big difference with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is that the songs we hear are sung by Taron Egerton (best known for his role in the ""Kingsman"" movies and also in ""Eddie the Eagle""), and often in dramatically different arrangements than the originals. Let's be clear: Egerton is absolutely fantastic as Elton, and he also has a great voice, but there is something slightly unsettling about hearing these songs in such a different way. But in the end, the movie clearly is about love (or the lack thereof), and Elton's never-ending journey for redemption (which he eventually finds). The movie does not shy away from Elton's love for men (and the movie is rated R accordingly). ""Victim of Love"" is surely what he was, and the song is featured prominently in the film. But the ultimate redemption is equally deserved (as we see in the end-titles update).""Rocketman"" was released wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in a fairly large theater was sold out to the very last seat. I quite enjoyed the movie, although I don't think it's up to the same level as ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" but Taron Egerton deserves props for his performance. If you have any interest in Elton John or in rock history, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

there's a lot to know about those to whom we look up,"I first learned of Elton John when he won an Oscar for his song from ""The Lion King"" (a movie that I've still never seen). I later heard about him when he wrote a song for Princess Diana's funeral, and from there learned about the rest of his career.So, it was inevitable that there would be a biopic. I didn't expect a musical biopic, but it probably made sense to make it a musical. After the movie won an Oscar for Best Original Song, I figured that I might as well see it. The movie shows John in all his facets: genius, drug addict, and all-around flasher (it was the '70s, so how could he not be such?). I should admit that I've never paid much attention to John's work; nothing against him, just not my style.The movie starts with John's childhood (and an emotionally distant father) and goes through the years, showing John producing some notable songs while leading a typically '70s life and eventually coming out as gay. It's no masterpiece - especially since they had to take some creative liberties for storytelling's sake - but there's a lot of impressive stuff in store here. Whatever you think of Elton John, there's no denying his impact on popular culture over the past half-century.All in all, I recommend the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Wow! Taron Edgerton is Oscar material!,"This was probably the biggest surprise film so far this year. I was not anticipating this film at all, but I thought it was great! The performances were pretty stellar, Taron Edgerton gives an Oscar worthy performance in this film. Jaime Bell and Richard Madden were also great. This truly is a musical fantasy, it was stylish and different which I loved. The directing wasn't anything special, although there were some long takes that I appreciated. The structure was a little flimsy, it was a little too long, the pacing was a little boring and repetitive in some areas, but not overall. It also follows your typical biopic formula, but it's pretty unique on its own, so overall that overshadows it's familiar formula. Overall I loved this film, and I hope Taron Edgerton is not overlooked in this year's Oscar season.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
An Amazing Film And Oscar Worthy Performance By Egerton,"Elton John has had a career that has spanned decades, millions of albums sold, packed venues, awards, and more than a few headlines. In the new film ""Rocketman"" audiences get a look behind the man thanks to the amazing and Oscar worthy portrayal by Taron Egerton.The film opens with a flamboyantly dressed John entering rehab in one of his stage costumes. As he opens up with his group, he shares the story of his childhood as a shy child who is desperate to have his father show him any signs of approval or affection.When it is discovered that he has talent with the piano; his grandmother encourages him and even takes him to apply for a position at the Royal Academy of Music.His mother (Bryce Dallas Howard) is moderately supportive but is more focused on her social life brought on by her failing marriage.As the film unfolds; we see Elton working in a backup band and in time answering an ad that puts him with an agent. Paired with the man who would eventually change his life; Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), Elton and Bernie combine to write a series of songs which in turn leads him to a series of gigs in Los Angeles. The film shifts into high gear at this point as we see how their music becomes a smash and leads to a series of parties, drugs, and money.Elton meets Manager John Reid (Richard Madden), who becomes his partner both socially and professionally as Elton embraces his Homosexuality which he has kept largely hidden.As the record sales and hits mount, so does the destructive behaviors which leads Elton down a destructive path that threatens everything he has worked for.The movie is a masterpiece of music and story and it cleverly uses musical montages and segments around the performances to outline various segments of his life and his rise to stardom.The performances are amazing and Egerton was simply amazing as he not only captured the complexity of his character but performed all the vocals of the hit songs himself and they were spot on.During our Press Screening I noticed many people singing along, tapping their feet, or bobbing their heads along with the music which helps to underscore just how timeless and popular his catalog of music has been as the songs have endured the test of time.The film also evokes some unexpected emotion as there were more than a few people wiping their eyes during the film which at its core is a store of a young, shy boy desperate to be accepted and loved.I truly hope the film is recognized come Awards season as it is a wonderful and memorable cinematic experience.5 stars out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Elton John Gets the Great Film He Deserves,"If you're tired of formulaic, paint-by-the-numbers musical biopics, then look no further: ""Rocketman"" is here to come to the rescue. This outstanding biopic blew me away by managing to both inform the viewer about the ups and downs of John's life in a wholly engaging and all-encompassing manner, yet also entertaining the viewer through absolutely dazzling musical scenes that manage to make the most of both the lyrics and subtext of John's lyrics.Unlike some other entries in the musical biopic genre, ""Rocketman"" manages to not only fully develop Elton John as a character, but also those around him. Bernie Taupin as well as Elton's parents make fascinating supporting characters with far more depth and complexity than supporting characters in similar films. The acting in the film is superb across the board, and Taron Edgerton truly knocks it out of the park as Elton. He displays an astonishing range and stays in total control of both the film's narrative and his music. Unlike many other similar performances, such as Rami Malek in ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" he does all the singing here as well, and he manages to nail that too! The film's music numbers are all unique and complement each other. They're well-choreographed and manage to be both escapist and substantial to the progression of the film's narrative and such associated plot structure. The film refreshingly doesn't sanitize neither Elton John's struggles with vices nor his identity as a gay man, unlike the watered-down content in the (PG-13) ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" This edge helps the viewer more fully understand the struggles that Elton went through in his life, and allows us to further empathize towards his character on screen. The film's production design is incredibly strong, combining both flashy costumes with understated British elegance and class--sometimes even in the same scene, in the case of the music numbers. I won't give away how the film does this, but I was also surprised by just how emotionally impactful it gets, as well as how the narrative truly feels like it builds up to a true crescendo. I think it's gonna be a long, long time before Elton John is honored again in a manner as unique as this film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Love Elton John, Thought the Film was OK","Reginald Dwight grew up in a loveless home on the outskirts of London. A shy, musical prodigy who could play classical pieces by ear, the only support he finds is from his Grandma, who encourages him to develop his gift. Ignored by his Dad and shunned by his Mom, Reggie takes delight in Elvis Presley records and decides he wants to not only pursue music, but rock music. From forming his high school band Bluesology to meeting young lyricst Bernie Taupin, Reggie's career takes off. Eventually he changes his name to Elton John (though the movie lies about how he came up with the name for some reason), adopts a flamboyant stage persona complete with gaudy costumes and loud accessories and becomes one of the biggest rock stars during the 1970s. As success grows, so too do bad habits, leading a fast downfall and the question if Elton John would ever regain his fame and popularity that he had in his heyday (which, unless you've lived under a rock for the past 30 some years, you know the answer to that question).I will give this film credit. Unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, which carefully protected some of the more dark elements of Freddie Mercury's life, John lays bare all his warts and short comings. He had a lot of demons and darkness during his career. However, the overall execution is spotty. It can be campy at times, which fits with John's stage persona during this time, but sometimes it goes way beyond, to the point where it's uncomfortable to watch. The actors are good and some of the scenes are very powerful, but then others fall flat. I also would have liked maybe cutting down on some of the stuff (maybe shortening the musical numbers. That ""Saturday Night"" number goes on way too long) and touching on his ""revival"" in the 90s, when he did the duet with George Michael, wrote the soundtrack for The Lion King and wrote the biggest selling single in Billboard history with the Candle in the Wind tribute to Princess Diana. Nothing from this timeframe is shown in this movie, and it would have been a good conclusion to the darkness and despair that is throughout his life in this film.Overall, better than some of the bio pics I've seen, but some weird artistic choices leaves it lacking in some areas as well. If you like Elton John or rock music from the 70s, watch it. If not, you might want to pass.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A refreshing take on a musical biopic,"The musical biopics I've seen so far follow a traditional way of telling their story so it was refreshing to see one like Rocketman try something different.Rocketman follows Elton John as he looks back on his childhood to his moments of inspiration, success and excess in rehab.One of my biggest complaints with Bohemian Rhapsody is how disingenuous it felt. It took a very safe approach in telling its story without going deep into the characters. I'm happy to say this wasn't the case with Rocketman. The R rating was very suitable and took us into the mind of Elton John and explored dark parts of his life without sugar-coating it. I still wish the film used its R rating to its full potential but regardless of that, I think Dexter Fletcher did a great job depicting the highs and lows of this person. What felt really refreshing was the film's use of musical numbers to convey the thoughts and feelings of Elton John. It was a fantastical approach to tell the story that livened the experience for me. The visuals were striking and the entire film was shot and edited very well.The biggest takeaway was Taron Egerton's performance as Elton John. He genuinely delivered an excellent performance that may be the best of his entire career. He had an infectious presence that I felt all the way through and made me care about him especially during his low points. I loved the costumes he wore during many scenes and it's impressive how he sang all the songs by himself. The supporting cast were also great. Jamie Bell as Bernie Taupin, Elton John's long-time friend and writer, was really good. Richard Madden was also great. Stephen Graham and Bryce Dallas Howard delivered strong performances as well.Rocketman is one of the better musical biopics I've seen. It does go through the same stuff we've seen in other related biopics but it's the way Dexter Fletcher approached this story and Taron Egerton's outstanding performance that made Rocketman stand out from the rest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A musical reverie that works!,"Not your traditional paint-by-numbers biopic, but instead Rocketman is a beautiful flight of the imagination that hits at the emotional heart of its subject in all its vagaries, and is both affecting and insightful.

All of the actors do top-quality work (god I love Jamie Bell -- catch him in Nicholas Nickleby sometime) so you feel the episodes onscreen as opposed to just observing them.If you've never heard of Elton John or if you hate musicals where people burst into song, stay home.

Entertaining but fanciful soft-focus 'biopic' of legendary showman,"A young artist struggles with family, passions, and demons to become one of the top acts in the world as his personal life disintegrates - a true(ish) story but nothing new. Taron Egerton is quite good as glittery soft-rock king Elton John but I found the framing device (an older John reminiscing while in therapy) gimmicky. There are a lot of memorable songs presented in a number of ways (sometimes sung all or in part by secondary characters) but not a lot of real/recreated footage of John's massive stage shows (the famous Dodger Stadium concert is recreated in part, one of the best scenes in the film). Like ""Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018) (the Freddie Mercury biopic with which 'Rocketman' is inevitably compared), the film deviates from the facts at times for dramatic effect (allegedly the harsh portrayal of John's father was inaccurate and unfair). Given the fantasy look of the film, viewers will likely not expect documentary verisimilitude but overall the film comes off as a bit of a vanity puff-piece, not surprising considering John himself was executive producer and had been pushing for the film for decades. While I didn't really like the film's structure, the filmmakers should be given credit for trying to do something different with a well-worn storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Good biopic,"I realise it is a musical but I saw the story as the most interesting part.
His influence on music with his soul-rock-pop-country-blues genre mashing is still understated in real life, I reckon.
Didn't ""resonate"" as much as Bohemian Rhapsody but I think that's cause the man is still alive!
My artsy fartsy comment is that you're going to find it very tricky to use one artistic medium (movie musical) to create a piece of art as an homage to someone who has already made a much, much larger impact on the world in another medium - popular music. It's like paying tribute to the 100m sprint by doing a good long jump - if you get what I mean.

Disappointing,I'm a huge fan of Elton John but this movie is not a sincere biopic but rather more like a musical set to the music of Elton John in the spirit of Mama Mia or rock of Ages. Because of this it's hard to tell what's real and what's made up. You get the feeling that the story has been embellished to make the Elton character seem sympathetic rather than just pathetic.I was disappointed. Waste of time and money.

Not quite what I expected,"First of all, I have great respect for any actor that does his own singing in a movie and Taron Egerton did an admirable job in that respect. While you could tell the difference in j=his voice and Elton John's, the phrasing. tempo and accenting were spot on. Also, with glasses on, he looked a lot like him. Unfortunately, when he took them off, he looked more like Kevin Spacey.What disappointed me was the movie itself. I was expecting more of a documentary of his life and career, but it is purely a musical set to the music of Elton John, The chronology was off and I do not believe there was a complete song in the entire movie. Overall, it was not as good as ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Jersey Boys"" or ""The Buddy Holly Story"" All of which painted a more complete life story. At least the music was good enough to have you singing along.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Spectacle serving the actual story in the most beautiful way,"So it is a musical, and not a ""straight biopic"". Given that this is a story about Elton John, it probably works better that way.The film has plenty of interpersonal drama without a music score. But the musical fantasy scenes, all rearrangements of Elton John songs performed by the cast, are the heart and soul of the story. They reminded me of Moulin Rouge and also of Jesus Christ Superstar, with clever edits to flip between different timelines. The trip down memory lane along to ""The Bitch Is Back"" used colour filters to distinguish between the 1950s and the time Elton John spent in rehab. The young Reggie Dwight's fantasy of conducting an orchestra in the dark with a torchlight that he uses for secretly studying music in his bedroom is another inspired choice. Not only do these scenes fit the artist's exuberance, but they also offer possible insights in the creative processes behind the songs.Apart from this, the focus of the film is clearly on the themes of friendship, lack of self-love and redemption. The timeline including flashbacks suggests it is a well-rounded story rather than a step-by-step biopic for people to pick factual holes in. The contrast between Elton John's relationships with John Reid (sex without love) and Bernie Taupin (love but not in a sexual way) may seem a bit binary in that context, but the characters of Reid and Taupin do come across as very realistic.Elton John's parents in the film seemed very one-sided, and especially the mother just sat there looking expectantly in another direction, like she was in a film of her own. For me, though, this was more than compensated by scenes with Elton and Bernie Taupin, as well as so many others.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A musical fantasia about Elton John's life that overdoses on drugs and sex.,"Dexter Fletcher, director of the ""Rocketman"" is also responsible for rescuing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" when its original director (Bryan Singer) was fired. It might be unfair to compare these two movies because they are the stories of two distinct artists. But, each film tells stories about a British gay rock 'n roll superstar during roughly the same period, each film uses an artist's hit song as the title, each film displays the artist's flamboyant on-stage and off-stage personas and each film has plenty of hit songs. Despite the high energy and exorbitant costumes and eye-wears, the Elton John character in this film lacks the exhilarating visual appearance compared to Freddie Mercury. Even though Taron Egerton (Kingman and Eddie the Eagle) is good at playing Elton John, he doesn't reach to the same intensity as Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury. Although this film doesn't whitewash Elton John's homosexuality, it doesn't really explore the theme any deeper than Freddie's either.The enduring warm relationship with Bernie Taupin, his longtime lyricist, and the reliable and likable Jamie Bell is the solidest & warmest presence in the film. Ultimately, ""Rocketman"" is not so much a biopic as vibrant, full-fledged phantasmagoria of a movie musical. Also, with a piano man as world-renowned as Elton John, the songs should really speak for themselves in a biopic about his life but mostly they don't. The tunes sometimes take center stage, although the musical arrangements have been changed ... for the worse. Perhaps this is a sin to say, but ""Rocketman"" is one film soundtrack I never care to hear again.The fact that Elton John is one of the executive producers and his husband David Furnish is one of the producers makes us wonder whether the film can be reasonably objective about which stories should be told in the film about Elton John.Rating: For fans 8+, for us others 6+/7- and please lower your expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"What you want, plus so much more!","It's everything you would want from an Elton John bio pic and so much more! The trailers hide the fact that this indeed is a full on musical. Not just Elton singing his hits, but the people around him and in his life from childhood to adult hood, all singing. They do this all while beautifully fitting his songs into his life story. I think you do not have to be an Elton John fan to like this movie as the musical numbers, comedy, and emotional beats are spot on perfection! This truly puts Bohemian Rhapsody to shame on so many levels, the most important of which; the lead actually sings in this one and sounds amazing. It sounds cliche, but I truly thought on multiple occasions Taron Egerton was Elton John himself, I was truly impressed with him. I can not recommend this movie enough.As I did see this at an early screening, my biggest complaint is I have to wait 2 weeks to see this again. I will absolutely be watching this multiple times in the theatre and at home.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A warts-and-all biopic.,"Unlike ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", which director Dexter Fletcher is said to have a hand in after Bryan Singer 'left' the project, ""Rocketman"" is less of a straightforward rock star biopic and more of a jukebox musical that uses the songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin to tell the story of one, Reg Dwight, who remodeled himself, as in any good adult fairytale, from a shy schoolboy into a glam-rock icon called Elton John. It's also, presumably, more truthful since it was made with Elton's blessing and gives us a warts-and-all portrait that lets us see the monster he was, or at least believed he was, before turning into the sweet-natured, sober and charitable saint he is now and whatever you think of his music I suppose credit must be given for such an unflattering picture of a living artist.That leaves the question, is it any good? Well, actually yes. There are missteps to be sure; not all the production numbers come off and there's a little bit too much misery before he seeks rehab. It's told in flashback, ending when he reinvents himself as the Elton we know now and before meeting his husband, David Furnish but it's a well-told tale, (Lee Hall wrote the fine screenplay), and it does have an outstanding performance from Taron Egerton as the Rocketman of the title. If Rami Malek can pick up an Oscar for putting in a pair of false teeth and camping it up as Freddie Mercury then Egerton, who does his own singing, should at least get nominated for what is a much better performance. There's good work, too, from Jamie Bell as Taupin and nice cameos from Stephen Graham and Gemma Jones, (the granny).The villain of the piece is nasty Richard Madden as John Reid who gets Elton coked up and into bed and then treats him like dirt and unfortunately Madden can't give his character any shadings, if indeed he had any, Their sex scenes might put off a few Aunt Ednas and rednecks but then it's unlikely they would be going to see an Elton John biopic in the first place.

Rocketman Soars,"This moving, heartfelt film documenting the life of Elton John is magnificent. It spans the years from his boyhood growing up in Pinner, England yearning for love from his cold father, his partnership with lyricist Bernie Taupin and his rise to super stardom.This is a warts and all tale featuring both the success and drug-fueled sadness of a man searching for love in his Circle of Life story. If you are a fan of Elton John, this film captures all of the notes and the tales you've read about. Director Fletcher has created a spectacle perfectly suited for an entertainer who has thrived on lavish lifestyle, costumes and crowd-pleasing performances.The songs chosen from the Elton/Taupin songbook perfectly mirror the particular scenes portrayed in the film, even if they don't match the specific era they were created in. This film is magical. A musical is the perfect fashion to present Elton John's life story, comprised of soulful solos to high-octane choreographed production numbers.Elton John's lift-off performance at the famed Troubadour in Los Angeles was the gig that catapulted his career. It's only fitting that both Elton and his mesmerized audience levitate into space as the gifted piano man bangs out an uproarious rendition of Crocodile Rock.Taron Egerton is a knockout and superb as Elton John, capturing all of the mannerisms, moves and speech patterns of this gifted, troubled musician. This is an Oscar-worthy performance that dances circles around Remy Malek. Egerton is a tour-de-force and triple threat as actor, singer and dancer. His vocal interpretations of John's music are rich and powerful. High praise too must be given to Jaime Bell for his poignant, touching portrayal of lyricist Bernie Taupin.The film beautifully depicts the relationship of the two artists from young men to super stars, a brotherhood and a bond, it is a love story all its own. The attention to detail from John's outlandish costumes and changing looks through the decades is spot on, the resemblance of Egerton to Elton by virtue of talented hair and costume designers is miraculous.This compelling, thoroughly enjoyable film will whisk you away and take you back to those golden days of youth and the Elton John songs you listened to growing up.

A decent entry in an underserved genre.,"'Rocketman (2019)' initially seems like a refreshing step in the right direction for the most consistently restrictive genre there is: the music biopic. Its fairly unique presentation as an actual musical leads to some entertaining sequences and the fact that it's frank about its protagonist's troubles is certainly welcome - especially coming off the back of its recent unavoidable comparison, 'Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)'. However, this is soon all revealed to, essentially, be nothing more than a veneer. The foundations of the feature are as rigid as ever, forcing the whole thing to follow the predictable beats of its predictable genre practically to the letter. It's actually quite remarkable how similar the lives of most music biopics' subjects are. Still, this isn't an excuse. The formulaic plot that this follows isn't just sub-par because we've seen it before, either. It spends too much time on John's childhood without really saying anything significant - at least, anything that couldn't be conveyed in a single scene or, even, line later on - and it seriously rushes the third act, placing a lot of seemingly important stuff in an annoying 'text ending'. It's frustrating because the style is quite appealing, it just far outweighs the substance and it didn't have to. The musical moments are entertaining and it doesn't feel like John was interfering with the narrative in any way - in fact, it seems as though it would be quite painful for him to watch. However, the musical segments don't do anything significant for the plot, either just harmlessly slotting into scenes or replacing montages where they'd usually be found anyway, and the honesty - which isn't typically absent from good biopics - doesn't do anything, really, other than make the movie feel a little downbeat. This is, again, thanks to the rushed ending; the majority of the film is dedicated to John's substance abuse and self-love troubles but these are all resolved incredibly quickly, if somewhat satisfyingly. I think the main reason that the flick gets away with as much as it does is the performances. Everyone on screen is great, especially Egerton (which is, incidentally, another cliché of the genre). It's also fantastic that he did his own singing. Generally, the experience is quite entertaining, too. It does wear a little thin, though, especially when you realise how closely it conforms to the tropes of its genre. It's just frustrating, really, because there are flashes of a much better film in here; the first few moments set up something quite counter-intuitive and potentially great. It's not great, though. Of course, it's not bad, either. It's a decent entry in an underserved genre. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Dazzling, well acted biography of a modern great","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGrowing up in Pinner, with his emotionally negligent father and domineering mother, young Reginald Dwight showcased a prodigious talent for the piano, which saw him penning his own songs, before adopting the stage name of Elton John (Taron Egerton). From here, he developed a personal and professional partnership with songwriter Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) and enjoyed phenomenal success but was also plunged into a wild, hedonistic world of celebrity, parties, drink and drugs, as well as a struggle with his own sexuality, that almost threatened to send him over the edge.It's a bit of a risk making a dramatization of the life of a 'living legend', where the slightest deviation from the truth could result in a lawsuit. And so director Dexter Fletcher has taken a brave risk with this musical biopic of one Mr Elton John, which, given he's aware of it and probably seen it, means it must have met with his approval. Which can only mean his life has been every bit as wild and outrageous as Fletcher has portrayed it to be. He's certainly a character who provides interesting subject matter for a biopic, and Rocketman is a slightly disconcerting but still effective and well made production that delivers the goods.Although you might expect it to be a musical (given its subjects profession) it's not made immediately clear, and when the first musical numbers come through, they catch you off guard and unsettle the tone somewhat. They're not expected, given unlike recent musicals such as Jersey Boys and Bohemian Rhapsody, it's not been adapted from a stage musical, plus there's been the 2013 Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra, which featured no musical numbers. Still, on their own, they're electrifying, and when they become more consistent towards the end, they slot into the backdrop of the story, as the film delves into Elton's personal issues and wild excesses.If you can appreciate it in the format it's in, it's wonderful work, with a strong lead performance from Egerton, really capturing the spirit of the flamboyant but troubled John. It manages to include most (but obviously not all!) of his back catalogue, and for the true devotees, will serve the same function as the Broadway stage musical it obviously wants to be. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Truth/fantasy mis-mesh,"Rocketman tries to walk a line between the paint-by-numbers musician biopic bog standard, and epic musical fantasy. A lot of the time when a movie tries to be a blend of two things, it ends up being neither. Rocketman, conversely, ends up being both, just never at the same time. It's basically two movies, and that epic musical fantasy movie I was talking about that's in there, that's a great movie. Unfortunately, the other one, is not so much. I'm still gonna come away giving it a recommendation, because there is enough in there to mean that I enjoyed it, especially in the core casting, all of which is great, not least Egerton. But I was little disappointed, not because my expectations were too high going in or anything, but because every time Rocketman began to slip into a euphoric high, it was moments later wrenched back to, well... Reality, I guess. Albeit a reality we only see on a movie screen. And we see on every movie screen when it's a musician biopic. I mean, this is Elton John we're talking about, if there was ever a moment to reject the mundane and fully embrace the over-the-top flamboyant fantasy it was here. But Rocketman just kind of Awkward Christian Camp Side Hugs the over-the-top flamboyant fantasy.Final rating: 6/10 - I liked it.

"""Rocketman"" - I'm Not the Man You Think I Am","In wistful eloquence, Director Dexter Fletcher captures Taron Egerton's Elton John composing his signature ""Your Song"" donned in bathrobe, playing the piano in his Mother's living room. Elton's dear friend lyricist Bernie Taupin, played by Jamie Bell, listens in enchanted wonder. Glancing at Bernie, Elton sings: ""My gift is my song and this one's for you..."" Elton is gay. Bernie is straight. ""Your Song"" is my very favorite Elton John song, since I was a teen. It never occurred to me: Was that Elton's love song for Bernie?Throughout much of his life, Elton experienced the ""slings and arrows"" of Rock Star fortune: illicit drugs, overdoses, and wanton gratuitous sex. In Director Dexter's musical bio fantasy ""Rocketman"", music icon Elton's tragedy may have sourced from the frightened lonely boy, who just wanted to be loved.Dexter Fletcher took over as director for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", the rock group Queen bio pic about the late legendary Freddie Mercury, when Director Bryan Singer was fired by the studio. Both Freddie and Elton are gay men, who suffered in inauthentic self-expression. In familiar ""Rocketman"" affinity, Dexter creates touching compassion amidst the absurdity of prejudice. Dexter wisely infuses the offbeat sense of humor.Taron is courageous vulnerability and resilience as tortured Elton, born Reginald Dwight. Taron awes in his vocal renditions of Elton John classics like ""Rocketman"" and ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"". As song lyricist partner Bernie, Jamie Bell embodies gentle wisdom and affection. He's Elton's only enduring friend. Bernie confesses to Elton, ""I love you man. I really do. Just not like that.""Paradoxically, that 'incomplete' love evolves as fate. At the narrative arc, Elton tells his emotionally bankrupt Mother Sheila, played by haunting Bryce Dallan Howard, that he's homosexual. She says, ""You will never be loved properly."" That too, becomes Elton's sentence.In the mural of fantastical sexual and musical narrative excess, Screenwriter Lee Hall poignantly constructs Elton's transformation as he begins to heal and love himself. Albeit clumsily, like the musical number emerging in Elton's dinner with his Mom and her boyfriend Fred, played by whimsical Tom Bennett. Yet, we still hold out hope that Elton discovers his measure of joy and peace.In flashbacks, Elton grew up in a dysfunctional English family. His Dad Stanley, dispassionate and disinterested Steven Mackintosh, is rarely home because of his work. When he is home, he listens to jazz, but not to his son. Elton's Mom tolerates her loveless marriage. In the aftermath stands young Reggie, played by bright innocent Matthew Illesley. Also Dad had never hugged his own son.Reggie is the gifted piano prodigy. He gets a musical scholarship to the Royal London Academy. His family spirals in demise. His parents divorce. Eventually, Reggie forms a band and tours with a Black Rhythm and Blues band, which reveals his soulful music roots. Furthering his music career, Reggie changes his name to Elton John. In apparent divine intervention Elton, the brilliant composer, who can't write a lyric, hooks up with lyricist Bernie Taupin. Elton and Bernie would emerge as one of the greatest songwriting duos of the 20th century.Alas, the downside of fame and fortune. Duplicitous John Reid, played with mercenary charm by Richard Madden, seduces innocent Elton. John insinuates his way into his life as Elton's business manager. Elton and Bernie continue to create prolific songs, as Elton succumbs into the abyss of addiction and depression with his eyes wide open.In an interview years ago, Elton said when he first started working with Bernie, he thought the words were superfluous. What mattered was the melody. That's what determined a great song. Years later, he got that words defined the song. Words resonated with the soul. Music and lyrics were like Yin and Yang for a song.Perhaps, the narrative failing of ""Rocketman"" is its resolution. We know that Elton John in real life emerged from the darkness. He's in love, has a family. Recently, he announced his retirement from touring. Amen, good for Elton. The ending needed its own ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"".That being said, I got ""Rocketman"" in the bigger picture. Much like Elton may have written ""Your Song"" for Bernie. Perhaps, Bernie wrote the song ""Rocketman"" for Elton. He wrote: ""I'm not the man you think I am at home... Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone."" Elton was all alone. He just wanted to be gotten, to be loved. In that way, we can see a little of ""Rocketman"" in all of us, too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Elton Way,"First things first: this is close to a musical, with people starting to sing and dance (though Elton John is doing most of the singing of course). Now that is important because some people will cherish that fact and others will be annoyed to say the least.This is a different kind of musical biography ... you can't even begin to compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody. While there were some who didn't like the fact that the other movie went out of its way to interpret things and be free with the truth, this movie is pretty straightforward, that it does not play in the normal world, but yes a heightened feeling to it from the beginning. That doesn't mean, that certain things did not happen, it is just exaggerated. The main performance is great, though the Queen movie seems to have more powerful songs - of course Rocketman and other songs are great too and you may feel different about that sentiment anyway. Not an easy watch, especially considering the sexuality of Elton and some of the depictions - this also focuses on a certain time period. All that just fyi",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Worth The Price Of Admission For Taron Egerton's Lifelike Performance Alone,"Playing more like a fantasy-musical than a straightforward biopic, Rocketman brings the colourful life & persona of Elton John to silver screen in a vivid, vibrant fashion, and is championed by a star-making performance from Taron Egerton. But despite that, I don't really feel much love for it, and found it to be a rather okay biopic.The film chronicles the highs & lows of the famous musician's life, starting with his arrival at a rehabilitation session and then recounting his life in flashbacks. The plot covers his troubled childhood, his breakthrough years & meteoric rise in the music industry, followed by his struggle with addiction, thus bringing the journey full circle.Directed by Dexter Fletcher, his musical storytelling is going to be a hit or miss with many and unfortunately for me, it's the latter. Fletcher's decision to tell Elton John's life story with a bit of theatricality & fantasia goes well with the notable artist's own flamboyant stage shows but the narrative flow isn't smooth and it fails to strike the right emotional chord.The switch from drama to musical numbers is often jarring, and more could've been done to streamline this aspect. Pacing is also slightly on the slower side, especially in the second half. Nevertheless, the rich camerawork, melodic songs & impeccable costume design do provide it the required facelift, plus fans of the artist will enjoy & appreciate this wild ride.The real show-stealer, however, is Taron Egerton who treads the fine line between impersonation & reinvention to embody Elton John from inside out. And unlike last year's Best Actor Oscar winner, he is actually singing the artist's songs. This is no doubt Egerton's career-best performance, and he is brilliantly supported by Jamie Bell & Bryce Dallas Howard.On an overall scale, Rocketman captures the highs & lows of Elton John's life with finesse, features a standout performance from Taron Egerton that overshadows all other aspects, and will manage to please most viewers, if not all. I never dived into his discography so I'm not part of the chorus yet, but the film as a whole still didn't do enough to garner my interest & keep me captivated.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Rocketman (2019),"Based on a true fantasy. I heard some great stuff about this film and it peaked my interest. I know that Dexter Fletcher filled in to direct the final weeks of Bohemian Rhapsody but for me this felt like his first true musical biopic I didn't like Bohemian Rhapsody all that much outside of the music and Rami Malek. I'm glad to say that Rockeman is substantially better. Its well acted, well curated, and is even in nature. Its something that's welcome as far as the quality of musician biopic's go.The film starts off with Elton John in therapy where he tells the story of how he got addicted to alcohol and drugs, primarily cocaine. We see the story of Elton's youth, originally known as Reginald and how he grew up in a loveless household. He goes far with his natural gift but the pain of his past and his current affairs drive him off the deep end. Still, the talented musicianship remains and the film shows the journey of the highs and lows of Sir Elton John's life.The film is a musical in nature, as characters burst into song spontaneously, throughout the film. Taron Egerton brings a surprisingly great performance as Elton and brings the bombastic nature and all the intricacies of John to screen. He is really good in this. The music, all sang by Egerton himself also shows how much work was put into this. Fletcher's film captures the magic of the music and the showman while also showing the dark stages of his life and the impact that substance abuse have on his well being.The film follows the biopic formula, yet it does so fairly uniquely with its presentation in musical format and its connecting imagery. Its a colorful film and does a lot in its run time. Its a good time to be had whether you are familiar with Elton's work or not. It'll probably be a long long time till we see another biopic about a musician that is actually competent. Rocketman most certainly exceeded my expectations. Its the best film of the new releases this week at the cinemas.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Better titled as Yellow Brick Road,"The title Rocketman doesn't really work for this musical biopic by Dexter Fletcher, a longtime actor trying to direct and with not much success. As others have noted, the production is kind of all over the place, some parts decent other parts forgettable. Many key sequences are put to music which are hit and miss, take Rocketman for instance, you'd think it would have something to do with outer space or its loneliness but they pair it with a hospital scene, ugh. Taron Egerton excels in the role but the supporting cast fades pretty much. The film, with Elton John as one of the EPs, does reveal to us his life of being mostly unloved by parents and those that profess to love him, with Bernie Taupin really being the only one by his side the whole time. One key disappointment was that it gave such short shrift to his first marriage to a woman and whiffed on the associated ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"" hit song. Another disappointment is that it doesn't keep us informed of what year many of the scenes play out. This biopic could've and should've been so much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Fails to launch,"People must have very low expectations if they thought this was good. Mine were set at ""Bohemian Rhapsody low,"" a standard it still failed to meet. There's nothing moving about this; they really F up the music by trying to create a book musical about Elton's early life with all of the actors singing it - probably the only pleasure of BoRhap was hearing Queen's originals on a good sound system. You'll get none of that here. It's all re-arranged, truncated, poorly sung. You have to tolerate the poor singing even though there's nothing realistic about the script, no dramatic scenes of note, just images and montages, the actors are just stand-ins for characters we never get to know much about (Gemma Jones, of course, being the best of them). For some reason, Bryce Dallas Howard is innit trying to talk like Adele - surely they could've gotten any number of British actresses to play/stand-in as Elton's mother?! It's a bit like watching a stage show on film. But the script hasn't a clue what's going on in the middle - and you won't either - with its muddled timeline (erm, Elton John was a huge star when he duetted with Kiki Dee - he hooks up with Richard Madden's John Reid after the Troubadour gig in August 1970 and we're meant to believe they don't see each other again until the recording of Don't Go Breaking My Heart in March 1976 but still somehow carry a white hot flame for each other? Whatever). The absence of anything from or even about Captain Fantastic is a disappointment. But this rubbish is what passes for a 5-star film these days. There's a lot of whinging about how hard it is/was to be Elton John but in the hands of Fletcher, Hall and Egerton, no actual pain or anything to empathise with. There are moments when it looks a bit like Ken Russell's Tommy - the worst bits. Hall's rendering and Egerton's performance are both just one note: ""poor me, I'm Elton John."" For the most part, Egerton looks like a children's party entertainer. Nothing like the original, for those who remember the times. It ends very anti-climatically with Egerton CGI-d into the original video for I'm Still Standing which was more of a curio at the time, rather than a career high; and a slideshow of Elton's public and personal accomplishments since then, done as the type of thing you'd expect at a surprise party rather than a major motion picture. If it makes $900M I'll be surprised. Again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

DOING ELTON PROUD...!,"Coming out on the heels of Bohemian Rhapsody, we now have this Elton John biopic, played w/gusto & energy by Taron Egerton, which like other biopics of someone famous feels pretty much par for the course. Directed by Dexter Fletcher (ironically brought on to pinch hit on Rhapsody after original director Bryan Singer was unceremoniously canned), this tale follows John's rough patch as an unloved child (his parents split & the seemingly only support system was his grandmother) but having a facility for playing the piano later becomes an interest in being a musician. Knowing how to play but not having a decent tune to his name, he falls in w/a record label which hooks him w/a struggling songwriter named Bernie Taupin (a writer who he will forge a 50 year career with, played here by Billy Eliot's Jamie Bell). The rest of the film follows his ups & downs as he becomes a superstar but has to wrestle w/his drug, sex & shopping addictions while somehow coming out on top in spite of his excesses. The film's dramatic moments are sturdy (w/Egerton doing his own singing) but ultimately workmanlike & boilerplate but whenever we have music set pieces (shot like music videos or dance numbers from an MGM classic) the story comes alive. Memory serves a 1997 doc called Tamptrums & Tiaras (it aired on Cinemax I believe) covered a lot of the biographical ground found in this film so if you're an Elton maniac, this is the one for you. Co-starring Bryce Dallas Howard as John's mum, Richard Madden (The Eternals) as his combative manager/lover & Gemma Jones (I think she played Renee Zellweger's mom in the Bridget Jones' flicks) as John's nana.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

All About The Music And That Works Here!,"When I think of biopics, especially about musicians, I think of films like ""Walk The Line"" or ""Love & Mercy"" that told pretty much straight biography stories and then interspersed the artist's music at certain points. That is not the approach taken in ""Rocketman"". No, this one is all about the music, and because it's the legendary Elton John, it works basically as well as anything.For a basic overview, this film tells the story of Sir Elton, both as a young Reginald Dwight (Matthew Illesley) and the uber-star he would later grow into (Taron Egerton). Many of his now-infamous tunes are covered in song-and-dance numbers, all painting a narrative of his struggle to make it in the music business, come to terms with his sexuality, and deal with drug & alcohol problems.If you want a basic idea of how ""Rocketman"" unfolds, think of a movie like ""La La Land"", where it's basically a straight drama that routinely transitions into elaborate song. In this case, though, it could almost be better described as a musical about John that is interspersed with a little bit of bio. If I had list this under a genre, it would be ""Musical"" and not ""Drama"" or ""Biography'. Normally, I have a feeling that this approach might not work for many audiences, but in the case of Elton John his songs are so iconic and cut through the generations that I feel the film-makers make the appropriate choice in putting the music front and center.The bio material is still present, but in all honesty it plays out in pretty much cookie-cutter fashion, including the standard points of parental arguments, manager feuds, substance abuse, and reclamation attempts in the end. Whether this is because that's literally how Elton's life went or because the film-makers needed that sort of drama I am not sure, but fortunately those scenes are not the heart of the movie.No, what you'll mainly take away from this experience is some amazingly-produced numbers of many of John's greatest hits (he had so many they couldn't all even be included!). I can almost guarantee that before you are practically even out of the theater, you'll be browsing your music subscription of choice for Elton John playlists.All in all, I enjoyed ""Rocketman"" even more than I thought I would. I was worried that the unconventional approach would turn me off, but it ended up being the perfect choice instead. It may not be an incredibly deep-dive into the life of John, but it still hits all the necessary notes (pardon the pun) and provides some incredible musical numbers you won't soon forget.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Sure, Taron Egerton deserves an Oscar - I only found out afterwards that he'd done all the singing himself, which makes his performance even more remarkable. I didn't enjoy the dance scenes, though - but maybe that's me. I just feel this is such a good story, just tell it without the distractions.
What really got to me, though, was that every one of EJ's tantrums was conveyed with a powerful sense of sympathy, justified by a tough childhood and unsupportive parents.
The sneaking suspicion I had that EJ himself had had a hand in this was confirmed when I saw that the musician himself had been its executive producer. Subjects of biopics often decide to have nothing to do with it. EJ decided the opposite and cannily went on to preserve his reputation as a ""difficult darling"" and nothing more. The closing text, which glorified his contribution to charitable causes and sought to emphasise what a remarkable human being he is and how lucky we are to have him, only served to confirm that he had won the battle to portray himself in the best possible light.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Perhaps the truth isn't that interesting.Even a story as gritty as NWA's Straight Outta Compton overlooked facts for audience appeal.

He delivers a very layered performance, showing off a variety of different emotions, while also having a beautiful singing voice. Jaime Bell is also great as Bernie Taupin, Elton's close friend and songwriter, as well as the most likabile person in the movie, along with Elton. Bryce Dallas Howard delivers an incredible performance as Elton's mother; Sheila Eileen. Howard does a great job of making you absolutely despise the woman she's playing. While it's difficult for an actor to make you love a character, it's also just as difficult for an actor to make you absolutely loath a character as well. Another actor who does a great job of making you loath his character is Richard Maddern, who plays Elton's manager; John Reid, who I wanted to punch in the face once the movie was over. The movie functions sort of like a musical, by using the songs to help tell the film's story. At several points in the film, Elton and the people in his life will start singing one of his songs to convey the emotions they're currently feeling, like in a musical. I found this to be a very clever way to incorporate Elton's songs into the movie, as it's far more interesting than just having Elton peform the songs at a concert, which would be the obvious way to do it. The film's cinematography is also stunning. It perfectly captures the grand, heart pumping atmosphere of Elton's best performances.If there are any flaws I have with this movie, it would be that some parts of Elton's life are skimmed over pretty quickly. Primarily Elton's relationship with his wife; Renate Blauel, which comes and goes in about five minutes. I understand that it probably wasn't as important as other parts of Elton's life, but I could have used a bit more development. However, a few minor pacing issues are really my only problem with this movie.Overall, This film has phenomenal acting, wonderful cinematography and a very clever use of beautiful music. My only real problem are a couple of issues with the movie's pacing. I definitely believe that this film will nominated for Best Picture and Best Actor For Egerton at the 92nd Academy Awards. Rocketman deserves a very high 9/10, though I'm debating whether or not to change it to a 10/10. It really is that good. I highly recommend checking this film out. It's a wonderful biopic about one of Britain's national treasures.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A refreshing music biopic,"It's a very creative movie, and what stood out to me was how honest it felt. I loved how it felt like a stage show musical.
Elton John produced the movie so that automatically adds a lot more value to it. Tarron Egerton is fantastic. Elton John himself said (about Egerton) ""it was like watching myself.""
So there's a lot here, and the emotion does work. Although it has it's flaws and isn't in some ways fully accomplished, it is a really enjoyable, but also emotional and dramatic cinematic ride. My rating might change.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A Life-Long Music Therapy,"Elements of cognitive behavioral therapy are presented in this movie. The main character is described in elaborate detail.

A soul sealed by a hideous appearance,"In an age of justice or justice, obesity and ugliness have almost become the harshest sentence for a person. As human beings, we cannot actually ignore the flesh and reach the soul directly. Sometimes, the beautiful soul is trapped in a flesh that can't bear to look directly, which leads to an indescribable tragedy.
This movie describes this deep sorrow and loneliness. Fuchs was an ugly fat man who worked as a baggage porter in the ground handling department of the airport. He was of no age, never had a girlfriend, and still lived with his mother. The few hobbies are playing with sand table models and listening to heavy metal music in World War II . He has few friends, and one or two people who keep socializing are connected by these quirky hobbies. He was kind, timid, and dared not to meet with people's eyes. He always lowered his head when speaking with people. Therefore, he was teased and mocked by his co-workers and questioned whether he was a virgin. In a depressed life, he encountered an unpredictable love. A woman with depression came together with him. He thought that he and the other party could save each other, but in the end he found that things did not get their wish.
As an Icelandic film, all its details naturally permeate the unique chilliness and alienation temperament of Northern Europe. The cold mood and this lonely story mutually support each other. The opening scene very beautifully laid the director's ambitions. Under the overhead shot, on the empty airport runway, the baggage-carrying vehicle passed slowly around, silently, and the light sprinkled on the ground. Refining emotions from the common scenes of daily life is a unique skill, which is very refined in many Nordic movies. For this movie, all the scenes are reflections of the character's psychological map.
Foss bought himself a remote-controlled car, which was controlled by the wind on the open space downstairs, and he controlled it alone. For him, real life was something he could not shake and control, what he could control, and what he liked , Are childish things that are childish or adolescent. For example, the sand table of World War II, such as this toy car, such as the tacit understanding of the song between him and the midnight radio DJ, he was arranging the soldiers, remotely controlling the car, he heard a favorite from the radio Yes, a song that can vent your emotions, this is all the fun of his life, everything is related to ""things"", things will not hurt him, but people may be more terrible. He re-arranged the formations for the battle of World War II, but he had no way to deal with his real life.
Fuchs himself was an isolated symbol, and everyone regarded him as a monster. His kindness can only be understood by the neighbor 's children, he accompanied the lonely little girl, but was suspected by her father to be a pedophile, and the love he met was initially at a loss, and later regarded him as a life-saving straw. The flip was very interesting this time. At first, it was the woman who led him, a little bit to make him understand how a relationship is in love and how to get along. Soon, he discovered the problem of the other party. When the woman fell into depression When he extricated himself, Foss became a teacher. He cooked breakfast for her, went to work for her, and helped her out of the haze. The two ""patients"" accidentally became each other's doctors.
The relationship experienced twists and turns. They had been intimate and alienated. Later, the woman felt that the fat man was worthy of trust and asked him to move in with him, but in the end, he changed his mind. However, even so, she still saved the man, let him finally take the first step in independent life, let him understand how much warmth and change in the real world human relationship, as an adult must face For all this. The emotional ups and downs between them is actually the change of emotional cues of normal men and women, but it is placed on two different bodies, so that everything seems to have a diffuse grief. But this grief eventually dissipated, giving Foss insight into the real world.
The second half of the film shows a subtle change. After Fowth had a girlfriend, everything was changing. He went to the garbage station for the woman, and his colleagues there were far more kind than those who made fun of him Many, they invited him to go to the bar to drink and watch the ball, like treating an ordinary buddy. His girlfriend was like a fulcrum, prying him out of the life he had fallen into, and let him see that although the world is full of holes, it is also worth diving into it for one experience.
Eventually, he burst out smiling on the plane flying abroad. That was the smile that Foss couldn't see in the movie, and he changed the past dullness. He walked out of the original family, out of the closed heart, and the smile was almost an expression of the most healing department.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Okay,"I have to be honest and say I was disappointed with this movie.I'm not sure why lots of reviews here are making comparisons to Bohemian Rhapsody, this is a completely different thing.Taron was excellent, as we're most of the performers.However it took me three sittings to get through this film. I was waiting for something interesting to happen.To be Frank, it was depressing, really hard work and despite the occasional impressive scene, it was disjointed and certainly could've been at least 40 minutes shorter.I wanted to live this film, but I'd have been pretty gutted if I'd have paid to see this on the big screen.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Enjoyable, brilliant biopic of one of Rock's icons.","""And I think it's gonna be a long, long time. Till touch down brings me round again to find, I'm not the man they think I am at home. Oh no no no, I'm a rocketman!"" Elton John (Taron Egerton)Elton John's remarkable removal from reality while he really defines a new rock performance style in the late '60's expresses in ""Rocketman"" the tension between performance dynamism and the formulaic loneliness fame and success bring to a legend. Taron Egerton's Elton is every bit as good as, if not better than, Remi Malik's Freddie in Bohemian Rhapsody. Egerton sings with his own voice, not imitating Elton but recalling his genius while retaining Egerton's own distinctive sound-recollection not ompersonation.Besides a career-defining role for Egerton, the biopic approaches the subject matter not so much historically as impressionistically, where each scene illuminates a character trait or moment that comments more on the human condition than the showbiz at hand. Elton's struggle with his sexual identity and a legion of typical 70's drugs like alcohol and cocaine highlight the difficulty any artist might have overcoming a culture of excess. So 70's, so rock 'n roll.Director Dexter Fletcher brilliantly finished Bohemian Rhapsody after Bryan Singer's departure, and in so doing prepared to one-up himself with an Elton John more nuanced than Malik's Freddie. Fletcher and writer Lee Hall also make the standard Elton John repertoire express the moment rather than just provide a delightful chronological feast. The montage-like presentation, with the resonating emotion and psychological exposure, evokes the best of Baz Luhrmann, who never found a song that didn't fit a true emotion as in the memorable Moulin Rouge.Rocketman is an impressionistic fantasy about the growth of Elton with an outstanding central performance, iconic songs, and a formulaic but not any less profound arc from glory to debasement and back again. Come to think of it, the ancient Greeks had that dramatic formula down so well that their drama is fresh even today.Rocketman shows that Elton's signature flamboyance becomes a natural part of his genius: ""Don't you want to just sing without this ridiculous paraphernalia?"" Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell). Thank goodness John knew it wasn't ""ridiculous.""",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Very good,Soundtrack was phenomenal obviouslyActing was phenomenal especially Taron Edgerton.

Rocketman was a fine musical version of Elton John's life and career,"After finishing the Freddie Mercury and Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, director Dexter Fletcher then made this musical biopic of Elton John played here by Taron Egerton.

Misses the mark,"First up I'm a big fan of Elton John. He is a truely creative hugely talented composer, singer and entertainer. I have utmost respect for him. I was looking forward to getting to know more about how he became who he now is. The film in my view lacked authenticity. The story flipped flopped from one character to another without revealing any glimpse of the true character or motivations of the key people in his life. Why did his father and mother act as they did. Never explained. Everyone is two dimensional. Simplistic.Wooden. No depth. It inferred that Elton was in great emotional pain for a large part of his life but it wasn't clear why. As a result he came across as petulant and indulgent.
The story arc is confusing with glaring inaccuracies which is annoying when the movie is supposedly describing the life of someone so public.
It has of course gorgeous costumes and lots of big musical numbers. It is in essence a musical. As a musical it had the most potential, but Elton has a unique voice. Taron Egerton does a great job being Elton, really captures his look, but how could he be expected to reproduce the greatness that is Elton's performance. The film may have worked if we could have been swept along by Elton singing. What's wrong with miming. How uplifting that would have been. Instead we are treated to a karaoke. The movie falls flat and I grew bored. Disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

but at least in this movie it makes more sense why they wouldnt do that as Elton John is still standingThe music is good which is pretty self explanatory.The actors were also really good especially the actor for Elton john he was phenomenalOther than that, there's not much to say about this movie to be honest it's just very sad and that'll kinda affect my rating as I like happy movies more than sad movies, but I'm still gonna get this movie a pretty good rating as I will rate it a solid 7/10.

Competent filmmaking. Nothing new.,"It filled a market after Bohemian Rhapsody. Essentially was a showcase for the music mixed in with some elements of his story LOOSELY interpreted. But that's the nature of these ""Based on a True Story"" things. Sure, the changes serve the story in a demanding medium, but they are still false stories.Egerton was energetic and enthusiastic but was not really given much to work with. The rest of the cast were likely very good actors but were not able to fire up the screen. Madden was effective as the bad guy, though. And Bryce Dallas Howard is a good lookin' woman even when they put some pounds on her.The direction was by-the-numbers with the big venues falling flat from unimpressive CG. It seem to take a lighthearted tone, although lighthearted is not what you'd call substance abuse. Apparently Elton John didn't want it to be PG-13, but I felt like it was in that ballpark.The father elements were very ham-fisted and kind of melodramatic.If you miss it, you're not missing much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"A Really Human Story, but worth 1 time viewing","Rocketman, in many ways is a rather generic musical biopic. Imagine the colorful musical numbers from Across the Universe with the persona humanization of Nowhere Boy, even to the recent Bohemian Rhapsody. In performance, Egerton is a superb embodiment of Elton's anxty sass. It is in grasping the traits the man himself has that the story is superbly human. By holding his most human struggle of knowing love as the vein of the Elton John biopic and with Teron carrying that struggle in his physicality, this film will move you to tears. It creates a total understanding of who Elton is from the very intimate inside to the flamboyant show he puts on. Rocketman is a wonderful watch for seeing a very human story, the depiction of his alcoholism wrecked me it's so real. The other half of the musical biopic however, is the spectacle of the music. It was just fine. Seeing as much of the story is told by stepping through the musical catalog of Elton (what you expect from genre) when it is fine song show after another fine spectacle, viewing gets winded, where you just want the story. Therefore I give it a 6 and say it is a great film, but only worth viewing once to grasp the emotional life of Elton, so glad to know after, but never again as the music and campy fun of it isn't all there to make it as lovable as say Mama Mia as an example of how musical catalogs be displayed. The frivolity of what you want was over steeped in Britishness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

I would probably not sit and watch this movie ever again sadly. I feel most people will be of the mind of, I loved it or I hated it, I myself are somewhere in the ""I don't care"" end of the spectrum, it did not impress me at all.Stick with his Music you will not be disappointed.

Good Movie - Not Quite What I Expected,"I have to say I was expecting a movie much more akin to Bohemian Rhapsody, and not one which could be described as 'EJ does Mamma Mia'. I many places the movie uses the music to replace, or accentuate the scripting, and in general does this in a good way - if not a little flamboyant and self indulgent. But behind this there is a moving story of Eltons childhood and early life in the music industry that he clearly was not mentally strong enough to steer clear of.A good watch and very touching, although each will make their mind up of how much this was self inflicted or otherwise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

This movie does not do justice to Sir Elton John.,"No wonder this movie performed so badly compared to Boh Rhap. This movie is nowhere as entertaining or uplifting as Boh Rap. It's a very mediocre movie full of self pity and doesn't even qualify to be a musical. It feels very amateur in all departments. Right from direction, to acting, to screenplay, to music, every single aspect is straight up mediocre.Elton John is one of the greatest musicians on this planet and this is such a poor movie that he doesn't deserve. He deserves so much better. The actor portraying him also barely passes. He doesn't possess an iota of charm that Sir Elton does. Sir Elton is always dorning that adorable smile of his whereas this actor comes across as quite obnoxious. But I don't entirely blame him as the screenplay and direction is only such that the poor fellow couldn't help it. I loved Kingsman in which he was there and know his potential, but here he disappointed me.Being a musical you would expect every hit of Elton to be played but they only play a few lines every now and then and two full songs that are not that well recreated.This movie deserved no nominations and idk why some people were whinny about it. Rightly so, it didn't get any major nominations or win any for that matter. On one hand we have Boh Rhap that was a true musical which was very uplifting and on the other hand, this film which is neither a proper biopic nor a musical. It's full of self pity and depression and out right boring.Only scoring it a 6/10 because of the real life photos of Sir Elton John that they put at the end, right from his childhood to today, where he was giving that charming smile, rocking his crazy costumes and just being so damn amazing. So only for the photos and the start of the movie which was good, giving it a rating of 6. Otherwise a really bad film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Rocketman Soars...,"First off, this isnt a very traditional bio-pic. It definitely is more a musical. But I really quite liked that. In comparison to last year's Bohemian Rhapsody which had good casting but felt like an average movie overall, this one just way more interesting and engaging. Taron's wonderful and its also great to see him actually singing (rather than lipsyncing). Although I personally really loved Jamie Bell in this who is such an underrated actor. He really made me feel for his character (or I guess real person). And directing wise, there's lots of really interesting shots. Also, I give it more props than Bohemian Rhapsody for the gay scenes. Although, I still wouldnt call it explicit or ""squeamish"" like one poster did.Of course its not perfect. There were a couple parts where the fantastical element went a bit far. There is literally a scene where Elton turns into a rocket. It was hilariously stupid looking. I also take some issues with some of the make-up jobs, and some use of green screen was super obvious. But overall, I was pleased with the movie.If you love Elton, then Im sure you'll be happy with the film. But even if you dont really know him or his music, I still think there is something in there for you.

But what made Bohemian Rhapsody this bad is its troubled production anyway, right? Not really!The first half is almost as perfunctory as Bohemian Rhapsody, and the second half is almost as messy as Bohemian Rhapsody. And it still has many outdated techniques that were used to force more events into sequences and make them more brief. Actually, it sounds as if Fletcher used here the same exact formula he used to make Bohemian Rhapsody. But these flaws can be partially justified this time by the fact this film doesn't intend to tell a story that captures the highs and lows of the artist, but rather to express them through the semi-fantastical approach it takes to tell its story. But there are also two major problems here that hindered the film to fully compensate for its shallow characters, clichés and messy structure.I'm glad that Fletcher took some risks here. He tried to visually express Elton John's inner turmoil. He tried to tell his story of ups and down surrealistically using Elton's point of view. The thing is I couldn't even see there are ups and down; they are all downs. I believe that was intentional because the filmmakers knew that the plot is dramatically poor.I think the fantastical elements don't add much to neither the story, nor the protagonist. Mostly, they ended up being nothing more than gimmicks. I believe no one can deny it was pretentious decision, and that Fletcher's ambition obviously exceeds his grasp by taking this decision besides using some other narration techniques.However, I was quite entertained. Honestly, I think I never had a moment of boredom throughout the film's two-hour runtime! Mostly due to Egerton's powerhouse performance that definitely should earn him an Oscar nod. Jamie Bell who played Elton's writing partner, Bernie Taupin, is also great. I can say the same about all the actors and actresses in this film except for Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintoshwho played Elton's mother and father respectively. I know that it's their skin-deep, archetypal characters who are to blame, but I simply couldn't stand their appearances on the screen.The second reason I enjoyed this film is that pretentious its narrative style as it is, I felt that it added some frequent and refreshing glimpses to an otherwise formulaic story that tries to conceal itself under the glitz and glamour of the irresponsible Elton John.Finally, the third reason I kinda liked this film is that despite its glaring lack of dramatic heft, I found some rather emotional moments here and there that touched me quite a bit.Rocketman really had potential to be a great, rather than an OK, film, if it was made by more efficient filmmakers. That said, I believe it's still better than Bohemian Rhapsody. I mean, at least it didn't make me stop listening to Elton John's songs!(6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"It's difficult not to compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody (and detrimentally so), but on it's own merits it's certainly worth a watch","First of all I must confess I've never been the biggest fan of Elton John. There are a few of his songs that I do love, such as 'Your Song,' 'Tiny Dancer,' 'Sacrifice' and 'I'm Still Standing,' and I admire his talent as a songwriter, especially in the early seventies. But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, which told the story of one of my alltime favourite performers and songwriters, I was less excited going in to see this biopic.I have to say though, they did a great job. Taron Egerton is convincing and compelling as Elton, and you certainly sympathise more with the notoriously 'difficult' Elton when you see the struggles he's been through in his life, from coming to terms with his sexuality, to drug addiction and dealing with manipulative managers.Of course a film like this will always hinge on the music, and the performances and cinematography for these scenes works really well. I preferred the less 'obvious' use of the music in Bohemian Rhapsody perhaps, and it drifts into over-sentimentalism at times for me.But overall, it is a well produced and paced film. It's difficult not to compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody (and detrimentally so), but on it's own merits it's certainly worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Looks like a cheap vanity production,"Somehow, though, the bloat is almost appropriate in a story about excesses, and the devastating pitfalls of fame. ""Rocketman"" portrays both poignantly, movingly, well but there's plenty of room left for a much better biopic about Sir Elton John.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
I wasn't expecting that!,"Well that was a bit of an emotional roller coaster! I had a lump in my throat several times watching this. The music is excellent and the timing of its usage is where the real emotion is. Taron is completely believable as Elton and portrays the flamboyant star like no one else could. He owned the role like malek owned Freddie and the story doesn't hold back on Eltons sad relationships with hie mother and father in childhood and in later life. Ultimately uplifting it does contain some tear in the eye moments.

Taron Egerton is Incredible...The Movie is Just Okay,"It was an interesting choice to actually make a musical biopic, but the choice doesn't really pay off. As a musical, it somewhat lacks energy and it doesn't use John's catalog to full effect. As a biopic, its unfocused and lacks depth. We get no indication of what time the scenes take place in, some parts feel rushed, and Elton John's personal struggles don't have the emotional effect it should've had. To put it simply this movie wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to be a fantasy musical and a expansive biopic but it doesn't really work as either.With that being said, Taron Egerton is incredible in this movie. He's electric and he really holds this whole thing together. All and all, this was a okay movie with a incredible performance at the center of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

It can feel somewhat fragmented as we get more than a few climactic breakdowns but scene for scene its always rich and well paced.Moments of surrealism really help but the conversation scenes are also expertly crafted.The set pieces and musical numbers are phenomenal.I dare say this is everything the fans could have hoped for and more.At times it's really quite devastating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A good musical biopic that triumphantly steers clear of some clichés,"So I'm a little late on Rocketman, but having recently watched Bohemian Rhapsody (and been slightly underwhelmed by it in many areas,) I'd heard Rocketman was a better alternative, and my interest in watching it went right up. It's overall not a perfect film, and indeed it's hard not to compare it a whole lot with the aforementioned Freddie Mercury/Queen biopic, but it is quite a good one. It's the kind of film where I loved aspects, found faults in some other areas, but came away from it feeling mostly pretty positive. The music biopic is one genre that can feel very clichéd and by the numbers, and while there are conventional parts to Rocketman's story, a good deal of the style and impressive musical numbers help give it a slight (and very welcome) fresh feel.Firstly, it's worth reiterating what everyone else has realised long ago and comment that Taron Egerton is great in the role of Elton John, and showed range as an actor that I for one wasn't aware he had. His performance was charismatic and always very engaging, and I was glad that it was his skill as an actor rather than just the costumes, hair, and makeup that made him so convincing as Elton John (although those all helped, of course). It's also worth mentioning that Richard Madden was also really good. I only know him as the heroic and sometimes a little bit boring Robb Stark from Game Of Thrones, and so to see him play a really despicable character here was surprising and refreshing. I think Madden's surprisingly good at playing a villain and I honestly hope he takes more roles as absolute sleaze balls in the future.The film really does shine during its imaginative and lively musical sequences, to the point where I kind of wish there had been more of them. I realise it would have been harder to tell a straightforward story if the film had been told entirely through the music of Elton John without lengthy and more traditional dialogue scenes in-between, but I think it's the kind of bold experiment that could have helped turn a good film like Rocketman into an absolutely great one. Those non-musical sequences aren't bad, but they are less consistent, with the pace often feeling too rushed, although it does help keep it from being boring. For an example, Elton John gets married at one point, to someone he just met, and then no more than two minutes later, they're already about to separate. It felt odd and rushed, and there were other scenes that gave me this sort of feeling. Pacing wise, perhaps a shorter window of time being covered could have helped, focusing in on just a few key moments in the subject's life like Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs from 2015 did, or maybe even made the film just 10-15 minutes longer, to allow the really fast scenes to breathe a little more.Also on the topic of the non-musical sequences: for me, they looked a little too bright, digital, and shiny. It makes more sense for the musical numbers to be similarly flashy and colourful, but for the scenes without musical numbers, it didn't work as well. While it's technically solid, I wish the film looked a little more 70s, as it really didn't evoke the time period very well (maybe it did with things like fashion and hairstyles, but not so much with the production design or technical aspects). They didn't have to shoot it like a typical 1970s film exactly, but if you look at how Tarantino shot his recent Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, it's done in a way that really evokes the time period without feeling exactly like a movie shot in the late 1960s. The colour, pacing, and more authentic locations all helped Tarantino's latest to truly feel like it was set when it was, and the shooting on actual film rather than digital cameras helped too (I wish Rocketman had employed a similar strategy). There is one moment where Egerton is digitally inserted into an old Elton John music video, and even though that video was colourful and flamboyant, it had a certain grit and graininess to it where you could really tell it was filmed around the time the film was set. I wish the film as a whole had taken a bit more inspiration from this original music video.The glossiness of the film's look in its non-musical sequences did occasionally clash with the darker, grittier story it sometimes tried to tell. However: I must say that overall I did really like how Rocketman was edgier and more direct with its depiction of a wild rock star lifestyle, which Bohemian Rhapsody frustratingly dialed down to an extreme degree. Rocketman wasn't over the top or overly graphic which was also good; it got the balance just right in showing things in a more intense, mature way, without being gratuitously shocking.I don't think you have to be an Elton John fan to like this movie, as I wouldn't describe myself as a huge fan (although I do absolutely love the 11-minute song 'Funeral For A Friend/ Love Lies Bleeding,' and was disappointed that no part of it found its way into this movie). I can imagine if you do love his music though that will help, and perhaps allow you to have a more favourable reaction than I did. The film paints what feels like a mostly honest yet still celebratory and sometimes joyful depiction of this iconic man's life and his music. It's quite good and does contain moments of greatness (mainly a few of those aforementioned musical sequences), so I could ultimately feel comfortable in giving it a solid recommendation to most filmgoers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Elton John Gets High on Psychotherapy: The Musical,"Another musical biopic of a pop star from Dexter Fletcher, who was also behind completing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (2018), ""Rocketman"" is an improvement upon its predecessor in some ways, but an uneven movie in still others. Taron Egerton makes Elton John his own, and unlike Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury in the prior picture, reportedly does his own singing. This one is also different in that it's an integrated musical instead of a backstage one; that is, characters break into song and dance during their daily lives and, thus, the musical numbers are more ingrained in the narrative. ""Rocketman"" is like ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939); whereas, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is nearer ""A Star Is Born"" (1954, or the two later ones, too). (I also recently viewed ""Judy"" (2019), another backstage musical biopic, and with Elton singing about ""the yellow-brick road,"" well, you get the idea....)At best, this integrated format supports a seemingly drug-induced momentum, from one stage in the star's life to the next, which is entertaining spectacle, including the dreamlike imagery. It's also apropos given the focus here on Elton's drug and other addictions. I'm less fond of the psychotherapy framing device, though, whereby he faces his mommy and daddy issues and related desires to be loved. Not exactly profound insights there in a production that's largely an Elton John vanity project in itself. Meanwhile, his music here largely does appear to come to him easily, which his mother criticizes of his life in general in one scene. Ditto his flamboyant concert performances. At least, in ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" there was a bit covered of the experimentation and genre-mixing that went into the success of Queen. On the other hand, ""Rocketman"" benefits from being rated R and so doesn't fear some depiction of drug abuse and gay sex, which is more than can be said of the PG-13 ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" where Mercury's romantic life was mainly and outrageously represented by his relationship with a woman. Like many others, I enjoy the rock and roll of Elton John and Queen, and these movies are pleasant vehicles for that, but they're also flawed and flimsy pictures otherwise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Although not my favourite format in the half biopic, half story musical - Rocketman seemed to balance it fairly well to keep me entertained with a lack of the 'eye roll' effect.Where it falls short and starts to roll into less successful film territory for me were the AA scenes, in which Elton tells the audience exactly what was going on, it felt a bit typical for me. I want to be shown, not explained.Some scenes felt like a mindlessly self indulgent attempt to tug at audiences heart strings. I felt like I was being shown when to cry, and asked to.Because of my indecision, this deserves a 6/10.

How Wrong I Was.,"I am of that certain age wherein Freddie Mercury and Elton John defined my early life. (Back when people still spun vinyl and listened to music on AM radio.)I didn't think ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" could be topped, but it now has been.While it would be easy to say that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Rocketman"" are just biopic films about two different 1970s-1980s British music greats, it's not that simple.The films are quite different. ""Rocketman"" is much more like ""a musical,"" with big casts performing in numbers. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was (IMO) more of an alternation as between drama - concert - drama - concert.IMO, ""Rocketman"" really takes you inside the mind, heart and soul of a man who is so enormously gifted, but hurting the hearts of those around him. Terribly sad that Sir Elton HAD TO BE the one person who understood his talent and worth. (And I think he does, now.) But he didn't really grasp how important he was at the peak of his career.I don't think this a ""spoiler""? I believe ""the core"" of the film is about his collaboration and deep friendship with lyricist Bernie Taupin.

A musical journey,"RocketmanLast night I watched the movie Rocketman. Starring Taron Egerton as Elton John. The movie is another music biography, but this is a musical biography. Which is different in biography movies.Taron Egerton did a wonderful job portraying and singing Elton's songs. We all know that Elton didn't like Rami Malek for winning a Oscar. For a movie he didn't sing and he got Taron to sing his songs. He wanted it to be authentic and real. Well he did.The movie, Which I thought it was pretty decent, odd at first but got better during the movie.
The movie is something to behold. I did like the storyline of how he became Elton. Elton has some iconic songs and I wish they showed how those songs come about. That's all I want. I wanted to know how Tiny Dancer & Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was made . Now we know on how I'm still standing came about, but that's all I want.The cast of characters were good, not great. Now I did like Jamie Bell as Berne Taupin. He as great , wish there was more of him in the movie. I would have liked how he come up with those iconic songs.The music is to be by far the best of it. Truly love hearing, Your song, Tiny Dancer & Sorry seems to be the hardest word. Those are my favorites.
Now is wish they didn't end it like it did, I wanted to know more after his drug infested rehab and how he became who he is now and the other songs he sung.Overall this was a entertaining movie to watch.

A Suave Musical-Biopic,"Rocketman is a stylish hybrid of a Musical and a Biopic. With Elton John serving as executive producer, his story is told in a sophisticated manner. The musical aspect falters in the aspect of certain actors singing.

This film transitions really well, with cinematography mirroring that of a broadway extravaganza. The CGI in this film is terrible, and downright embarrassing for a blockbuster.

Taron Egerton is the standout in this film, as his portrayal of Elton John is spot on and incredibly respectful (unlike other biopics).

"It's trying to be magical, but I could see the strings","There is a scene towards the end of the movie in which young Reggie Dwight (Matthew Illesley) asks for a hug and finally receives one - from the grown up Elton John (Taron Egerton). That scene is a perfect illustration of why this film should have been great and why it ultimately didn't work for me. At its core Rocketman is by the numbers musician's biopic - early natural talent, meteoric rise to fame and fortune, alchohol and drugs, an abusive partner/manager that nearly gets him killed. I felt like I saw that same movie last year. Luckily for the filmmakers, Elton's songs not only provided ready chunks of the script, they also made those moments when characters burst into song almost organic. I cringed when characters other than Elton would start to sing though. This would work in a stage musical where you expect everyone to sing. And it does sometimes works in movies. Here it felt weird. The dance numbers, though disappointingly generic looking, did manage to illustrate the mood of the moment. Most of the time. The problem is that in order to make a movie that injects fantasy into reality like that one needs to do something akin to magic. There are times when the movie achieves precisely that, like the attempted suicide scene in the pool. But too often what we get are these obvious symbolisms, which I personally dislike. People lifted off their feet by Elton's performance. Elton gradually removing parts of his elaborate costume - he is peeling off the layers of fake persona and revealing the real person underneath. And the scene I mentioned in the beginning - Elton hugging his young self - look, he learned to love himself. It's like they are trying to do magic, but I could see the strings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"A Kaleidospic View into the Crises, Opportunities, Tensions and Redemptions in Elton John's life, and on his Music","Rocketman offers a peak into the early life, adolescence, and years musical ascension of legendary Sir Elton John. It features Elton John's nuclear family environment, his calling and talent for music, and his longing for love above all.The film offers a naked view of his struggles at home, with his search for his relational and professional identities, and for his sheer talent and stage presence. Featuring. also, his famous songs in the context of his life stages and experiences, the musicality of the film comes through, at times on-point, at times not so much.And yet, all in all, the film ""works"" in its own way: it lends you a kaleidoscopic view into the crises, opportunities, healings and reparations through which Sir John passed and survived. TAt the end, the viewer will thus be well-informed of the artist's life story, and of some of his hit songs too, while left impressed with the excellent acting by the lead actor.The only points of improvement, to my view on the film, would be on providing for a more immersive experience into how it felt like to be in one of his concerts, through photography, audience views, and the like, and on the landscape and photography of the settings featured (e.g., London, LA, Australia, among other places).

A loose retelling of his life and people in it, hugely entertaining with big choreographed dance sequences. Don't care that it didn't stick to timelines (cos it's a film) or exact interactions (cos it's a film) because it's well-acted, well sung, the sex and drugs have been depicted far more gratuitously in tv shows like GoT and BBad so nothing at all shocking. Taron Egerton, Jamie Bell, and other leads have great singing voices, while the child actors who play Elton at different ages look spookily similar. This is a jukebox musical and is miles better than Bohemian Rhapsody in comparison.

Daniel Radcliffe and Harry Potter are all growed up and transformed into Elton John. 75%,"This is the truthy story of Elton John (the pop-rock musical phenomenon who composed the song ""Rocket man"", from which this film takes its title), from his time as a young boy who turned out to be a child prodigy on the piano, to the coda where we find out where Elton is at in his life right now. Like a Hollywood (or Bollywood, going on one scene in this film!) musical, the cast often breaks out into song - Elton's, naturally! - with various cast members singing, usually Taron Egerton, playing Elton, as well as other actors sharing the vocal duties with him. Mostly you hear fragments of songs, so be aware that you won't be hearing the original recordings as sung by Elton himself.Often in this film I would be wondering: ""Did that really happen?"". Seeing that Elton and his partner are listed as producers, I would hope that much of the dialogue which made me take notice did, in fact, take place. By ""made me take notice"", I mean comments made to or by Elton, which were especially cutting or what have you. They could be read as being particularly telling or illuminating about the people involved.Often in this film it's quite obvious that what is depicted did not happen, which is why I say that the story has a ""truthy"" quality to it. In fact, there are moments when magic realism is deployed...to good effect, at times. One such time involves Elton's first performance (from memory), in the US. Perhaps at the end of the film, an actual photograph of that performance is shown, which would naturally lead to the magical realism treatment of that moment. On a related matter, I remember years ago seeing a photo of a Buddhist man, I assume, levitating off the ground. The photo would have been presented as actually depicting that. However, many years later (and ago), I saw footage, I believe, of something of that sort. The video gives the lie to the saying ""the camera never lies""! Spookily, having looked up that phrase just now, I see that it is also the title of a song by Elton!Another example of the 'truthy' element to this film...I'd wonder if Elton really did write a song at a certain point in time. Then I'd hear a song which I KNEW was definitely not of that era! Sticklers for accuracy, you have been warned! It's magic realism, people!There is one scene where Elton is kissed by an African American music artist, before Elton had begun his solo career. I wondered if that really happened. Was it true, or truthy? Since I've been aware that Elton mostly composed the music to his songs (and not the lyrics), I also wondered if he really did write the lyrics to ""Your song"", which the film gives the impression that he did. Even though that song isn't a favourite of mine, I must say that it evoked the most powerful emotional response in me of any scene in this film. Not affecting me quite so much, but I did note a moment in Elton's final therapy session, where he is asked a question which he has often asked himself. That was also moving, but I can't say that it made a lot of sense to me in the context of this film, as I didn't get the sense that this was a relationship in which it was germane to express that sentiment. Perhaps that sense could have been better expressed in the film? Maybe. In fact, there's one scene where Elton comments about how he feels about himself. Again, the film didn't show to me that Elton was feeling that way.In any case, one of the themes of this film is how we perceive ourselves and what we imagine that people expect of us. Elton's private life, as shown in the film, could be viewed as a performance piece of what Elton imagined what was expected of him, as far as relationships and his persona went.Told in broad-brush strokes and seemingly covering every dot point of Elton's life (not that I'd know), it did occur to me at the time, or after seeing the film, that I wished that we got to know Elton better, as the film often functions as a snapshot of his life. For instance:* What happened to Elton's piano studies at the Royal Academy of Music?* Who were his early childhood friends?* What was his first relationship? If that was shown in the film, why not delve deeper into it?* The film seems to imply that Elton made an immediate musical impact. I don't think that he did. I would have liked to have seen some scenes concerning this.* Elton's relationship and marriage to a woman is briefly covered. The scene dealing with their married life was quite telling. Was it like that from day one, though?* Elton mentions how promiscuous he was during one therapy session. There's nothing in the film to back that up.* Elton's last marriage appears to be off limits, apart from some (literal) snapshots of his partner). It seems that Elton is being very protective of his privacy here...but maybe also throughout the film?I suppose that my major criticism of this film is that what Elton says, for example, isn't clearly seen in the film, as is the case for his feelings for his manager. It therefore surprises to hear him say that.Miscellaneous:* Elton accounted for 5% of all records sales at one point, it's stated.* I think that the real Elton gives one of the all-time great rock vocal performances in ""Saturday night's all right"". Wouldn't trade him for Plant or Mercury et. al!* Sometimes Egerton reminds me of Elton (as opposed to Radcliffe!).* The trailer for this film seems to have a scene that I didn't see in the film, where a receptionist, I think, says to Reginald: ""That's my grandad's name!"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Amazing performance from Taron Egerton and a great biopic story.,"Rocketman (4 out of 5 stars).Rocketman is one ordinary biographical musical film that delivers with an amazing performance from Taron Egerton and a fantasy musical direction that showcases the highlights of Elton John and the rise and downfall in his life. I am a fan of Elton John and his music. The movie does show from his high points in his career to his struggle with his relationship with his mother and father. And his addiction to alcohol and drugs. The film also focuses on his relationship with John Reid (Richard Madden) who is also his manager and abusing his power as a manager.The plot is a good biopic showing Elton (Taron Egerton) always wanting to be a musician since as a kid. After his father wants nothing to do with him and his mother not really caring about him. He meets a song writer Bernie (Jamie Bell) which they become best friends. And after a few songs attracting a few managers. And one of them being John Reid (Richard Madden). Which they both fall for each other.Taron Egerton delivered as Elton John. From his dramatic performance to his musical sequences. He sure can sing. And the outstanding flashy wardrobe. Jamie Bell is also good as well. Playing his lifelong friend. Richard Madden was good playing John Reid, a shady manager. Bryce Dallas Howard was also good playing Elton's mother.This is no straight up biopic film. The script and direction did turn this biopic into a musical film. From the opening scene with Elton walking towards an addiction group to discuss moments from his life. Turning some events into a musical about how he was feeling. It worked. There are some great fun musical sequences and the songs were great. The cast ensemble all had a moment in a musical. Sure, the audience will be cheering for it.The film also focused on his rough relationship with his father. Which can be emotional that brought him into his addiction. And his emotional abusive boyfriend John Reid.I did feel like the film ran a little too long. With a few musical sequences too many which ruined the pacing of the movie. That slowed the progress of the story.Overall, Rocketman is a good biographical musical film. Taron Egerton should be nominated for awards for his outstanding performance as the legendary Elton John. The film has some fun musical sequences and some powerful dramatic moments. Which turns a biopic story into a fantasy musical story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Good for the masses, but not the EJ-knowledgable","Fairly good bio-pic/jukebox musical as these things go, but...1) i'm sorry, i can't get past the screwed-up chronology of when songs appeared in real life, vs. where the movie used them2) i don't understand all the praise for the star's singing--his voice is ok, but nothing special, and he only very occasionally evoked elton john's style/tones. they definitely should have lip synced EJ's vocals; would have been much more powerful3) should have shoe-horned in a few more details from his life and career and music making; it would have taken maybe 10-15 mins. of screen time, but would hvae lended so much more authenticity to the project. they left so much important stuff out4) the style employed of dramatic scenes breaking out into musical scenes was ok, but seemed somehow forced; especially w/the incorrect chronologies employed. seems like they were trying to repeat the oscar-winning approach used in La La Land (very overrated movie in my opinion). 1 or 2 scenes were more effective (swimming pool/under water), but most just seemed a little sillyon the plus side, the child actor who played EJ as a kid looked just like EJ looked as a kid!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
The Movie this Summer Needs,"At this point, I can't really imagine this movie starring Tom Hardy, who was originally attached years ago. In many ways, it feels like Taron Egerton was born to play Elton John. In fact, some may say, myself included, that this is a better performance than Rami Malek gave as Freddie Mercury last year (also partially directed by Dexter Fletcher). Egerton sings and dances on his own and commits to this completely fantastical rendition of the acclaimed singer/songwriter. Although, in many ways it follows the same beats as a cliched music biopic, when it breaks out into song and Egerton spends time breaking down the character emotionally, 'Rocketman' entertains like no other. This is the type of summer movie we needed this year.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

I was so annoyed by Rami Malic winning an Oscar for playing Freddy Mercury in a far more inferior film role where he didn't even sing! Taron sang and did it brilliantly! And looked like Elton. I don't think he even got a nomination, that's the craziest thing. I also liked the warts and all in Rocketman as apposed to Bohemian Rhapsody.

In one scene, a young Elton tells a man to take his drink off the piano as ""it'll get knocked off."" He then plays a few bars (har har) on the piano then takes part in the dance montage around him. Really, Reginald? Is that exactly how it happened?
It's cinematic choices like this that make this movie less than what it could have been. Why couldn't we enjoy a young Reg' Dwight playing the piano and the crowd in the pub reacting to it?

I think Bohemian Rhapsody did a better job regarding Mercury's sexual preference.That said, John's story was definitely one worth telling and the acting was REALLY good. If you liked his music (not sure how anyone couldn't!), then you will enjoy the movie.

"In an exceptionally demanding role with sky-high expectations, Egerton was spectacular.","To be upfront, I am notedly critical of the biopic genre, particularly those that center around musicians and performers, primarily because a life's story does not provide a narrative structure with an actual plot. When the totality of a career is the crowning achievement of a life that is being depicted, the guidelines are often too vague to create an actual cohesive tale about said life. Biopics are the film counterparts to nonfiction biographies you can find at your local publicly funded library, and if you have not read one of those since doing a book report in Elementary School, you can be forgiven. While the material could be fascinating, the medium consists of a recitation of facts and events, as opposed to an actual story. In my opinion, biographies translate better into a documentary-style film, rather than a forced narrative out of a compilation of factually embellished, loosely connected significant moments.Having said that, it is to a film's credit when it tries to be creative with the material it is given, even as it is simultaneously handicapped by its ill-defined goals. ""Rocketman"" attempts to remedy this obstacle by using Elton's group therapy in rehab as a framing device, where he recounts his life up until that point. It is not the most original technique ever utilized, but it does signify an effort to create an organized story. But ultimately, people do not go to see films like ""Rocketman"" to identify if there is a narrative structure or not. Chances are that I am amongst the few who suck the fun out of an experience by demanding certain checkmarks that are irrelevant to most. The masses flock to the theaters to see Elton perform his many hit songs and possibly learn a little something along the way, and by that measure, ""Rocketman"" succeeds beyond a shadow of a doubt. This is a film with exceptional performances and musical displays.If you are a fan of Elton John, and I believe that is a safe assumption if you are a viewer of the film, you shan't be disappointed with the renditions of most of his greatest hits in the film. The cast is brilliant with their singing, treating the songs like the true art they are, often incorporating elements of fantasy into the choreography that accompanies the lyrics. And to the film's merit, the songs are actively used as plot devices to facilitate character development, a technique that can often be difficult to effectively execute. The entirety of the productions of ""Saturday Night's Alright (for Fighting)"", ""Your Song"", and ""Yellow Brick Road"" are personal favorites of mine, as they display the heights of heart and passion within Elton.Lead actor Taron Egerton deserves an immense amount of praise for his performance in this role. He fully encapsulates every aspect of Elton, including his display of exceptional vocal talents and energetic, rhythmic dance moves. On the more personal angles of Elton's life, Egerton totally espouses the pain and rage of the loneliness he endured, whether it be due to him coming to grips with his sexuality or the void left by the cold-heartedness of his mother and abandonment by his father, as well as the hedonistic lifestyle Elton embraced as a coping mechanism throughout much of his life.

But why am I being so harsh, you might say? Well, for one, this is unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, a very emotionally drained film, with really poor acting performances from leads.Taron Egerton tries hard to play a confused and impressionable Elton, yet his performances fall flat, as we never really feel we are invested in his problems, and in fact come to find him rather annoying by the end of the film. Yet the award for poor performance must go to Bryce Dallas Howard, whose clumsy effort to speak cockney and her wooden acting leave one with the sense that she was reading off a page held in front of her, off camera! In fact every scene she appears in goes from bad to worse, and together with Taron, the critical relationship between mother and son falls flat emotionally.The other aspect that really makes a mockery of this film is the very premise, as it seems to be a pale copy of Bohemian Rhapsody, with every shift in the narrative being a poor carbon copy of that superior film. This is not a surprise as it was Dexter Fletcher who came aboard Bohemian Rhapsody when Bryan Singer left the film, so similarities abound, yet where Bohemian Rhapsody was actually emotionally invested, this is just a 'meh' film that ends with us less sympathetic to Elton John than when we began the journey.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A fantastic musical journey,"A brilliantly conceived, directed, and acted piece of film.

a swirling kaleidoscope of emotion and music,"The traditional musical is the oldest film genre and it still relies on magical fantasy for suspending audience disbelief. This allows characters to spontaneously break into song or dance, unlike musical bio-pics such as Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) that realistically integrate the music into their narrative flow. The epic-scaled Rocketman (2019) is a nostalgic reversion to the traditional musical form; knowing this beforehand helps to make sense of what is a swirling kaleidoscope of emotion and music.Where bio-pics tend to look at a life story, the musical Rocketman is a selective biography that traces a musical icon's ascent to the starry heavens during the 70s. The opening minutes are bold, brash, and fantastical: Elton John (Taron Egerton) is resplendent in high-arch feathered sequins, storming toward camera after bailing out of a packed concert hall. He walks across a city and straight into an alcoholic rehab group, plonks into a chair and, staring through trademark crazy glasses, proceeds to unravel his journey as a lonely youth prodigy who became a substance abusing mega-star.What follows is a series of loosely connected vignettes that use musical lyrics as narrative entry-points to explain his complex vulnerabilities. The young Reginald Dwight was raised by emotionally abusive parents who were incapable of loving him, a burden that intensified his desire to be whatever it took to please others. Encouraged by his grandmother, his musical talent grew as a self-defensive response to what he experienced as an uncaring world. The mature Elton John progressed to singing odes of pain, awe, and confused sexual identity, mostly delivered with flamboyance and electric energy. Much of it comes from an unhappy place and this makes the film more revelationery than celebratory.Taron Egerton channels the icon with mesmerising brilliance; it is a performance made more astonishing by singing with astonishing authenticity a dozen songs from Elton John's enormous repertoire. The cinematography is as exuberant as the performances; many scenes verge on musical artworks as the human dynamo appears disconnected from the earth's gravity. The sets and costumes are fabulous, and the pace of the story is captivating.What you take away from Rocketman depends on what you bring in terms of fan status and personal interest. Some will see it as a story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll; others a musical hero's journey to mega-celebrity. Others may reflect on why there are so many music-inspired films in current cinema. The rise of anti-progressive forces in today's frenetic and fractured world means new generations lack heroes; the revival of heroic musicians might go some way to filling this gap.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Rocketman Film Review - Dexter Fletcher Directs Taron Egerton In Elton John Crystals As He Hits A Dodgers Home Run,"Having helmed Bohemian Rhapsody to Oscar success Dexter Fletcher is once again in mission control for Rocketman, with Taron Egerton donning the platforms and glasses. In 2013 I saw Sunshine On Leith, Dexter's first film, and loved it. He clearly has a handle on musicals. Giving plenty of the old razzle dazzle. Exactly what Elton John has. Funnily on holiday recently I met a guy who had actually been at school with Elton; then the young Reginald Dwight from Pinner. Was he always someone that stood out?, could you tell he would be a star? I asked. In fact he thought that Reg was just a fat kid with glasses who had no foreseeable signs of greatness. Well looks can be deceiving because look at him now. I may one day even forgive Elton for that shameful Snickers advert. That may have broken my heart!Taron was excellent, as were all the kids as Reggie. I first saw Taron in Eddie The Eagle, then Kingsman, Sing and recently in Robin Hood. He has the voice and isn't afraid to don the feathers for a romp through Elton's back story. The script by Lee Hall and produced by David Furnish was always going to be sympathetic to Elton. But this is no Pg-13 story, as Elton said, his life was R rated, and there's no hiding in a chicken suit; he wants it to be told. And promptly checks his tangerine ass into an AA dream.Unsurprisingly the film has the feel of Billy Elliot, also written by Lee Hall, with a gorgeous rousing bop through the mean streets of middle-class Pinner. (My old stamping ground!). Elton's fantasy started with talent, a tune picked out on a piano by Matthew Illesley as the young Reg, and a Gran, played by Gemma Jones, who was interested in her grandson. Mum played by a love starved and almost unrecognisable Bryce Dallas Howard, and an emotionally clipped war damaged father played by Steven Mackintosh, almost sink Reggie's early promise. Singing their own solos of unhappiness. And with his start in life Elton deserves every joy he now has. Shy young Reggie just wants a hug.A tinkle on the ivories by Kit Connor as the teenage Reggie at the Royal Academy of Music, and a nice moment with Harriet Walter, playing her classical piece by ear, what a precocious talent he was even then, leads Reg to rock and roll and adulthood, where Saturday Night Is Alright For Fighting. And a life on the road with a band.Lovely Charlie Rowe as Ray Williams gives the reinvented Elton an envelope of lyrics in his bosses Denmark Street office, see if you can make something of these. Songwriter Bernie Taupin is Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell and they come up with songs. Dick puts them in front of his boss, the terrific Stephen Graham's Dick James, of Dick James Music. Their music is rubbish, but Dick, pushed by Ray, sees potential. With Your Song they're on a trip to LA, and gigs at the wildly flamboyant Tate Donovan's Troubadour club. The stakes couldn't be higher, with Elton locked in the toilet and pop genius's in the audience. But he takes off as the gig defies gravity. If it feels emotional it's because it is, the papers are full of Elton's success, and he storms the charts.Bernie is the songwriter in the shadows, I know nothing about him, I guess that's the way he wants it. Elton is the flamboyant showman with diamond shoes, loving and loved by his lifelong writing partner, even after they (never) row. And while Jamie's Bernie was a straight A kind of guy, I vehemently disliked John Reid, a dastardly Richard Madden. In this R rated film of Elton's life, this guy was a Class A dick. But a totally believable dick, the manager muscling everyone else out, and in his sharp suit getting his 20% of flesh, in more ways than one. The same guy from the Bohemian Rhapsody story. A real Killer Queen. And pushing Elton to the limit. But there is no spending limit, Elton is a millionaire. And forcing him to come out to his mother, who like all mothers, already knew, but condemns his lifestyle choice to a life of never being loved. And sending him in his Rolls round to the now happily re-married, once more with feeling for old times sake Dad?, okay still stiff upper-lip father.The music of the partnership plays like a greatest hits jukebox, that accurately, naturally!, matches the highs and lows of Elton's life. The melody of a tune we all know, tried out for the first time on a piano. How amazing that Elton could see the notes to fit Bernie's words. And how emotionally stilted were those around who couldn't see him.In my youth I remember 'I'm Still Standing' as my first intro to Elton John, with the video and jazz man outfit, Taron edited into the original, and the unhappy first wedding that added respectability to the flamboyant Elton. John Reid whispering in his ear again. Funnily it was 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' with Kiki Dee that brought Elton and John together again, after their first meeting in LA.All of Elton's music is virtually on repeat on the radio so feels so fresh. And because I don't remember them the first time around, I don't care about the ipad shuffle of songs and dates as much as the purists. It's as if they were written only yesterday, and yet Elton has been a titan of the music industry for 50 or so years. His life has been one of strops and petulance, with Class A wild living and sex orgies, and trying anything once, as he swallow dives into the pool! And yet what a man that has made him. Maybe he was never really there. But Bennie and the Jets would beg to differ. He used to be so wild, but now we can call him Sir.With costumes by Julian Day, from the black and white childhood to the fun you can see he had recreating those wild designs, as Taron looked so precious in over a million Swarovski crystals. Gorgeous cinematography by George Richmond and music by Matthew Margeson. Riffing on Elton's back catalogue down the yellow brick road.An outrageous technicolour ode to excess with Dorothy ruby platforms, and I loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
For the fans,When I saw this musical documentary movie for Elton John. I can't think another word and how to describe it. When I saw it oh man blown away I was felling excited so much that my head exploded. One of the things about this I'll say his personal unique looks and styal wardrobe and funky glasses . To conclude long live rock and roll,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Not for me...but it seems like a really good movie,"I had the same problem with Saving Private Ryan. Originally, I left the theater with about 20 minutes left. Took me about 3 years to finally see those 20 minutes. Sometimes, I just don't really care about the movie. That said, I don't have to like something in order to recognize how good it is. I've never been a fan of musicals. And personally, I didn't care for where the screenplay was headed pretty much from the jump. But it is Elton John and his music and story. And that Egerton kid is very talented and does justice with songs that I believe are made for anyone with a voice to sing. But he does them Elton and I have to say Taron justice. I only made it about 40 minutes in. That doesn't mean it's not a helluva a movie. Just not for me. Watch it!",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Loved It !!,"I've always loved Elton John and his wonderful music. I was so excited to see this and I brought my seventeen year old daughter with me. After seeing the movie she is now a huge fan and I've fallen even more in love with him. Rocketman put a huge smile on my face and had me singing along. I never really liked ""I'm Still Standing "" , ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down on Me"", or ""Tiny Dancer"" but now I'm obsessed. I bought the soundtrack immediately and I've been listening to it nonstop ever since.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
FANTASY is an understatement,Rocketman is the best movie I've seen this year unless once upon a time in Hollywood can beat it it will stay at the top as it isTaron Edgerton was good in kingsman but in this you really get to see his acting shine I don't know a lot of these things are true or not but the tagline is a true fantasy or Elton John really did launch up in the sky In his dodgers uniform and explode another good thing about the movie it doesn't hold back it's 14a and I like it that way it's what bohemian rhapsody should have been with its PG rating only big problems are that the movie is a bit slow at times and some scenes go on for to long other then that great This is definitely worth your money even if your not the biggest Elton John fan and a amazing musical,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Reimagined history,"As a fan of Elton John and lover of musicals, this seemed right up my street. But the film falls flat from the start.
The songs are muddled in order and the facts drastically changed to suit the story - Elton's dad is made into the bad guy, the manager into a fool, and relationships are invented or ignored. Far from a candid look back on his past, Rocketman sees Elton reimagining his life.
The plot is thin, the dance routines over the top, and the songs sqeezed in an attempt to compliment the story.
Whilst Queen's recent biopic 'Bohemian Rapsody' packed a punch, this left me bored and unmoved. More like a long episode of Glee than a proper film.
The problem may be down to the lyrics, in that they're not Elton's, they're Bernie's. Elton plays the piano and sings, but the words aren't his. Therefore, using them to tell his story doesn't really work.
Recently I saw 'Blinded By The Light', the film based on Bruce Spingsteen songs; it is far superior because the songs matched the story, and the story itself was moving and character driven.
This film was pointless. A listen of Elton's greatest hits album would be a much better choice.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Funny, sad, happy and the sometimes awful truth about the great Elton John","A great movie and Taron Egerton gives a wonderful performance as Elton John. As someone that grew up listening to Elton John I had no idea what a sad upbringing he had, there was only one decent relative to help and guide him. His talent and showmanship shone through and he endured the highs and lows to be the artist he is today.

Sensational!!,"I've seen this movie close to 11 times, firstly I'm a baby boomer and remember this era well, I loved Elton's music it always took me back to a happy place when i was older, this ,movie was never boring for a second, the start is fabulous and while it's a musical drama fantasy, it all works, the acting is top notch and Taron Egerton deserves an Oscar!, If Rami Malek scored one for BoRhap which didn't really have a super strong story line, it was Rami's 20 minutes at Wembley Stadium that sealed it as it was magnificent. Taron was singing right throughout and delivers very emotional and heartfelt scenes. If your not into musicals you may not get overjoyed by it, but if you can understand that this was a great way for him to incorporate his songs into certain times in his life, you will enjoy it. It's raw, not politically correct which I love and there's a love scene between himself and his manager, it's an important part in his life and his first love, I loved BoRhap but if these two movies were lined up side by side for best Oscar actor and picture this wins hands down for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

What a shy boy,"Hello ladies and gentlemen. We're doing a quick review of Rocketman. Elton John is played by Taron Egerton and this musical follows his childhood into adulthood. That's right. It's a musical. So if you don't fancy musicals then I suggest waiting to rent it from your local movie store. Also, I feel the need to get it out of the way that Bohemian Rhapsody and this movie are very different but if i had to choose one, I'd go with Rocketman. That's all i will mention on that topic. I normally would give spoilers on a biopic but i guess this kind of gives a couple if you're unfamiliar so just a heads up. Okay, so you know who Elton John (who will be referred to in this review simply as EJ) is and such so no need for the overview, right babe?So the movie has a good starting point. EJ is in full costume and goes into an AA meeting where he gives all his flaws and how he's feeling stressed and such. Pretty quick right? The course of the movie does take a retrospective view on his life since he's in the meeting but it works. The build up from childhood through adulthood happens very very fast. He's a child prodigy pretty much and finds himself in a band before you know it. As a child he didn't have acceptance from his father and touch on the gay aspect right from the beginning which i thought was interesting. The comment is from his father when he was at least younger than 10 years old. So anyway, he's in this band and plays in the background. Before you even know what's going on he's already EJ. If you haven't picked up on it yet, this review is kind of like a check list, right? Yeah, so is the film.Don't get me wrong though. The acting is pretty great and you buy Taron Egerton as EJ right away. He's got a great voice and looks damn near similar so what else could you ask for? Not much. Remember this is a musical and even the performances are spot on great with the choreography and how they were weaved into the film. However, the film doesn't give you enough to really connect with the characters for the long run. It's like going to Costco and getting a bunch of samples. You know, it's good but you're kind of like ""meh"" I'm not gonna buy it. That's kind of how i felt with this movie.So getting into the performances. Unfortunately, it does have the same choppy feel as the other scenes but they are pretty amazing to say the least. The first show they play at the Troubadour is electrifying and exciting but it just doesn't last long. There's a big fantasy aspect to the film during the performances where it gives a euphoria feel where people are floating and all that stuff but it overtakes the actual performance if that makes sense. Ironically for a musical, the performances were very short in comparison to the other scenes. That's where I'm torn on this movie. It looks amazing and has the capacity to be an amazing movie, it just felt rushed. One huge example of this is when he gets married and divorced in, I kid you not, like 3 minutes. Who was the wife? Who knows and who cares because if you went to the bathroom you would have missed the whole thing. Kind of disappointing right?His character development is shown pretty creatively however. For a lot of the film hes very self-pity negative Neil and gets a little old naturally because we all get down and it's annoying, but he moves forward and says all the right things in really touching way. I understand that timeline is something that people are gonna moan and groan about it and i get it but let's face it, there's no way a Hollywood Movie is gonna get it perfect. Anyway, one of the best scenes i thought was when he comes out to his mother and she says something very hurtful and that was the most i connected with the character. I'm not gonna tell you of course since you should see this in theatres, but Tarons emotions and the depth from this scene really makes you feel for the guy. It simply is a great performance. Overall I was torn on this movie, but looking at it objectively, it was a pretty great movie and would see it again, likely. Not for sure for sure, but likely. I'm giving this movie a 7.6/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

I like how in the end during credits they explain his current status.

I did enjoy how they play his music during the various scenes. I must say it served its purpose. I was very entertained. Very informative. You see his struggles and success. I personally met him a couple of times as I lived in Atlanta and attended several of his big fundraising gay parties. Great job by the main actors Taron Egerton and Jamie Bell. I was shocked that Bryce Dallas Howard is the same actress in the Jurassic movies. Wow. Richard Madden and the boys all acted very well Kit Connor and Matthew Illesly.

Expected a deeper insight into Elton John's life! 4/10,"Review:
When I heard that they were making an Elton John biopic, I thought that they were going to give the audience a deep insight into his flamboyant life, but we ended up with a weak musical, which didn't really tell us anything new. As soon as the ""Guys & Dolls"" type musical numbers began, I cringed in disbelief, and the way that the director only touched on the interesting things about his life, was disappointing. As Elton John is still alive, and he was the executive producer of the film, I thought that we were going to get a really deep movie that will make us want to go out and find out more about the musical genius like I did when I first watched the Doors, but I was left feeling empty and uneducated. Also, if I want to hear a classic Elton John song, I wouldn't want to hear a Taron Egerton version, so I found all of the musical numbers a bit pointless. That's not to say that he didn't put in an excellent performance, which he will be remembered for, but I was more interested in the drama than the music. Anyway, the movie kicks off with Elton John (Taron Egerton) dressed in a flamboyant devil's outfit, as he enters an addiction rehabilitation session, recounting his life in a flashback. Young Reginald Dwight grows up in 1950's Britain, raised by his unaffectionate mother, Sheila (Bryce Dallas Howard), and more loving grandmother Ivy (Gemma Jones). Reginald is interested in music and hopes to perform for his father, Stanley (Steven Mackintosh), who takes no interest in his son nor his talent. Reginald begins piano lessons, making his way into the Royal Academy of Music. Stanley abandons his family after Sheila has an affair. Reginald develops an interest in rock music and begins performing in local pubs. As an adult, Reginald joins the band Bluesology, which is hired to play backup for touring American soul bands, The Isley Brothers and Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles. Isley Brothers lead singer Ronald Isley recommends that Reginald writes songs and puts his old life behind him if he wants to become a famous artist. This inspires Reginald to change his name to Elton John. Elton is the name of the saxophonist of Bluesology and John being adapted from the Beatle's John Lennon. Elton begins writing music and tries finding success with Dick James label, DJM Records under the management of Ray Williams. Williams introduces Elton to lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), and they form a friendship and move into a flat together to work on their songs. When Elton admits he is homosexual, he ends his romantic relationship with their landlady, and he and Bernie are evicted. Elton and Bernie move in with Elton's grandmother, his mother and her significant other where they continue writing and create ""Your Song"". James sets up a performance for them at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Elton is nervous before his Troubadour debut, but the audience eagerly embraces his performance. Elton is overjoyed by his success but feels abandoned when Bernie leaves him at a party to spend time with a woman. He is approached by John Reid (Richard Madden), a music manager. They sleep together and reunite later. Reid's influence over Elton launches a downward spiral into a life of debauchery even as his career rises to high heights. Elton develops a flamboyant, over-the-top stage persona and becomes one of the most successful artists of the 1970s. Reid's manipulation increases into outright abuse after becoming Elton's manager. Reid insists that Elton come out to his parents as gay, so Elton reconnects with his father, who has a new family but still displays no interest in Elton. Unhappy and hurt, Elton calls his mother and tells her he is gay. She informs him that she already knew, but tells Elton he will be forever unloved. Struggling with parental issues as well as Reid's increasing physical and emotional abuse, Elton becomes addicted to alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, shopping and sex. His mood swings and short temper alienate his friends, and he catches Reid cheating on him with another man and breaks off their relationship. During a party, Elton binges on drugs and alcohol and attempts suicide by jumping into his pool. He is rushed to the hospital, then thrust on stage at Dodger Stadium to perform. Elton descends further into a life of drugs, alcohol and loneliness. He has a short-lived marriage with a close female friend, Renate, but his homosexuality dooms his relationship. He falls out with his mother and Bernie. Elton's dependence on prescription pills and alcohol result in a heart attack. Realising his life is out of control, Elton seeks help. He enters rehabilitation and realises he no longer needs support from his parents or Reid. Elton rekindles his friendship with Bernie, who brings him new lyrics. Elton is worried that he cannot perform or compose without alcohol or drugs but writes ""I'm Still Standing"" and returns to a successful career. After the success of Bohemian Rhapsody, which was a proper biopic without the pathetic singing and dancing numbers, I thought the director would have taken a leaf out of Bryan Singer's book, but he chose to concentrate on matters that are well known. In terms of entertainment, it wasn't a bad watch because it showed what he was going through whilst releasing some of his most popular work, but I can't help thinking that it was way too safe. Oliver Stone pushed the boundaries with the Doors, even though Jim Morrison isn't alive, so he used his imagination to come up with his interpretation of how Jim was feeling while he was intoxicated on drugs and alcohol. This director didn't even try to show Elton's point of view when he was totally out of it, so I felt a bit cheated. Anyway, it's worth a watch for Taron's performance but I think another director needs to tell Elton's true-life story, from a deeper point of view. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Dexter Fletcher, who brought you Wild Bill in 2011, Sunshine on Leith and Eddie the Eagle, which also starred Taron Egerton. He's due to direct the next Sherlock Holmes movie, taking over from Guy Ritchie, which I personally don't think is a good idea. I haven't been that impressed with his movies so far, so he wouldn't have been my first choice to make a biopic about such an iconic genius. He's not totally to blame for this film because Elton John didn't want a ""full-out"" biopic about his life. He wanted people to see a lighter version of his life story, so I can't wait to see a deeper version. As long as Dexter Fletcher doesn't return as the director.Budget: $40million

See it to hear it,"""Rocketman"" is a weirdly surreal telling of a true story. But what makes it exceptional, and worth seeing, is the new arrangements for familiar songs.The songs as performed by the star of the movie, Taron Egerton, are much more than covers. They are new versions of resonate hits, evocative of the source material, while bringing new elements that suit the vignettes to which they are set, even if they are completely out of chronology for the timeline of the story.Essentially, ""Rocketman"" is a mediocre movie in which the story elements are interstices between outstanding music videos. But those ""videos"" are worth the price of admission.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"""Rocketman"" Blasts Off New Exciting Biopic","Described as a ""musical-fantasy biopic"" this film tells the life/career of famous eccentric singer Elton John.Seeing the trailer for this, I'm not gonna lie I was very excited for this film. I'd seen Taron Egerton is a few movies from the past and thought he was charming, but I wasn't sure how he'd be in this film....did he PERFORM! We'll get more into that later, but it had to be said! Many people are comparing this to ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that came out last year for obvious reasons. Both are about famous musicians rise to stardom, while also claiming to give us entertainment and behind the scenes looks into their lives. Yes I'm aware that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was said to be about Queen and not just Freddie Mercury, but let's be real here. They marketed it as a Freddie movie, he's the only one on the theatrical poster and the focus points of the trailers.That being said ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was okay. It was enjoyable enough due to Rami Malek's performance, but it missed the point of what a biopic is supposed to be about. Raw emotion, ups as well as downs and not just a glamorized music video. Yes ""Rocketman"" has music throughout it, but it keeps the story going on in the most beautifully done way. It has its borderline ""cheesy moments"", but we see a lot of heart shattering stuff in this film. Parts had me wanting to reach into the screen, shake Taron Egerton's Elton John and say ""You're amazing just the way you are and you're better than this!"" We see drugs, alcohol, sex, family issues, suicidal thoughts, fake personas, and more. It's a crazy emotional ride and with Taron giving such a stellar performance it feels real. Way more real than ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ever felt and in this people literally levitate off the floor at one part! Yes there is a sense of surrealism in this including that scene, rocketing off of a stage, long sequences like the shopping scene and the sex addiction scene. But it worked.I want to give the costume designers in this some love because they knocked it out of the park. Elton John is of course known for his flashy, flamboyant fashion choices, this was definitely given to us on a silver platter. When we see scenes of Elton on stage in his various outfits while ""Pinball Wizard"" plays, its both haunting and something really special. There's a few moments in this film that shocked me with their intensity. The pool scene with ""Rocket Man"" was spectacular, I got literal goosebumps from how powerful it was. The creation of ""Your Song"" was also very moving, the scene in the phone booth, ugh there are so many moments that stuck in my head!This is a musical movie, so it moves the plot along with some of Elton's most famous songs. If you hate musicals, you may still like this movie! But be prepared to watch emotion unfold with song on occasions. The fact that Taron Egerton sang this entire soundtrack is so impressive to me, most actors would lip-sync to actual songs from the artist, but not Taron. Speaking of Taron, let's get into this. If you for some reason do not like this movie (no idea how!) you have to at least appreciate the genius that was Taron Egerton in this film. He reached into a deep part of himself and gave the performance of his career at 29 years old. His emotion in this was so painfully in his facial features I thought at times that he really was a young Elton John. I felt his heartbreak, addictive tendencies, anger, frustration, happiness. It was all there so flawlessly! This may be the best biopic related performance I've ever seen, not joking.Yes, we all know Taron was incredible in this and if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination at least we riot, but what about the rest of the cast? They were also clearly bringing their A game here. I wanted to strangle Richard Madden's character on multiple occasions, ugh! Jamie Bell brought a warmth to his character that radiated off the screen. What a great casting choice on all ends. Honestly, I haven't had a movie fly by so fast and me being saddened that it was over in a long time.Finally, because it's such a topic of discussion right now I want to talk about the LGBTQ aspects of this film. First of all, it's a story about Elton John...what the hell were you expecting? Yes there's men kissing in it on multiple occasions, yes there's a sex scene. It's done between two men whom at the time loved each other and it's honestly just a really intimate loving scene. If anyone has a problem with that, don't see this movie and stay away from my vicinity! If I can see this in a packed theatre with 90% of it being older people and they don't even bat an eye, you have no excuse.Please see this movie, it deserves all the love it can get! It does Elton John justice and showcases an incredible performance by Taron Egerton as well as the rest of the cast.

Our gift is his song!,"I'm already a big Taron Egerton Fan, I think he is a rising star and going to be really big. He completely excelled in playing Elton and his acting and voice were phenomenal. The emotion he was able to portray throughout gave substance and depth to the movie and there were times I got quite chocked up in learning of just how tough Elton's childhood and adulthood was.I am not that familiar with all of Elton's earlier material but have loved his music especially what he writes for Disney for years and his lyrics never cease to amaze me. This musical gave me a new found respect for Elton not just as a musician but as a person who has come from humble beginnings and had to be true to himself despite being made to feel unloved and unworthy of the attention and credit he deserves.I was expecting something a little different in this and I guess I would have liked to have seen more on his relationships with family and others but you will certainly see enough to shed a tear and to be able to feel on a journey with Elton. Taron did an outstanding job and I wasn't sure if I enjoyed the musical more than Bohemian Rhapsody or not, I think I liked Rocketman more as it had more of an emotional affect on me. I wasn't trying to compare the two really but either way Taron deserves an Oscar. I think both movies are great in their own right for different reasons. One thing is for sure Is that after seeing this film I felt both moved and blessed to have had the privilege of having a better understanding of Elton and a glimpse into his world. Bravo guys.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Brilliant performance & a great movie musical experience,"I am absolutely mystified by the bad reviews of this movie in this thread. Taron Egerton is brilliant as Elton John, the script is cleverly crafted, and the way song is used to tell a story is excellent.There's a bit of magical realism, with the people that live in one's head appearing before one's eyes. Time turns in on itself, dream is reality is dream, but the sureness of the director's vision makes all malleability of time completely believable as a movie experience and story-telling device.There is cruelty, which is fortunately overcome. The movie captures the look of the 1950s to 1980s really well. The costumes are, of course, fabulous!The supporting actors are all strong foils for Mr. Egerton. The music is great, and Taron sings his own songs and is wildly better as a singing/dancing/creative person than most every other movie about singers that is out there.I am astonished that Rami Malek won the Academy Award the year his movie came out. That was some heavy duty hustling on Malek's part. Taron's performance is by far the more complex, the more layered, nuanced, emotional.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
I should not have high expectation,It is not a movie it is more like a documentary where Elton John want to get even with his parents and his manager with a cheesy west end/broadway style.

An unconventional and unique biopic.,"With a superb combination of dazzlingly energetic dance-musical numbers, terrific portrayals from Richard Madden, Jamie Bell and Bryce Dallas Howard, as well as the excelling main lead in Taron Egerton, Rocketman might fall into some conventional storytelling aspects, typical out of a biopic, but Dexter Fletcher's take on the iconic popstar has a unique (and surprisingly profound) way of telling its own story by adding context and thought-provoking themes to an already exhilarating film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Fascinating view,"My disclaimer first: Elton John has been one of my favorite singers but I started listening to his work way after he was famous, so I did not know anything about his personal life, struggles, etc. Watching this movie, it was clear to me how his roller-coaster made him a better artist. As opposed to Bohemian Rapsody, this movie is based on his work and hearing his songs in the context of his own life is a great twist. It is not a masterpiece but it is raw, entertaining and definitely a window into one of music's largest personalities. I came out respecting and liking him more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

While usually they take one side over the other, you'll find that rare treasure that finds the balance.

Not The Same Music Impact for meSUMMARY:To recreate a living legend you have to hire the right person and Taron Egerton killed it with the recreation of Sir Elton John. The mannerisms, the look, and the showmanship are all captured brilliantly in his performance, playing the tormented soul that is the Rocketman. While the rest of the cast supports and plays their parts well, it is the focus on Egerton that draws everything into the movie. Hollywood brings the full arsenal of creation into the film, doing wonderful work on the make up as Elton ages, with not only facial changes but hair line. The recreation of his costumes mirror the performers quite well in terms of detail in all the spectacle that they were. Going along so well is an impressive set design and shooting locations that drop us back in time and places that he made famous. It's these special effects that help bring you into the full moment of the movie as well as increasing the spectacle of the numbers. Rocketman's musical numbers go on the trend of utilizing the song and dance routine typical of a musical and cueing them to potentially hint at the points/events of their creation. If you love those moments from High School Musical and show tunes of the theaters, then the numbers should get you real good, with similar techniques inspiring and highlighting some of his eccentric works. It's a different style compared to Bohemian, but the traditional route should get lovers of the genre smiling and potentially singing in glee. And to top it all off, this movie really hits one in the heart, as you learn about Elton's demons and the lessons he had to learn along the way. The ending in particular gave me goosebumps, and really puts a perspective on someone I never even remotely knew compared to all his numbers.
Yet, the thing about Rocketman is the approach they chose did not quite have the spunk and energy of Bohemian Rhapsody's melody. The pace is slow at times, drawing on the drama to fill the gaps rather than the comedy/energy of the numbers. For those who love the deep dive into the darker aspects of life, you've got it in this film, though I could have done more for the censorship myself, especially if it could have led to more concert and musical numbers. In addition, the analysis of overdramatic vs. real is always a question, especially given how the drama moments take a firm grasp on this movie. I myself like more of the musical spectacle and seeing that creative process, rather than getting downtrodden at the demons that plague us all. And while I appreciate these moments quite well, and attempt to learn from this, I missed the full-blown musical edge that I've gotten in some other films, especially because those numbers were not interrupted like in this film. As such, the numbers did not affect me as much as those in Bohemian Rhapsody, despite the mental moments they addressed.
Overall, Rocketman is a beautiful movie, focusing on the artistic side of things vs the full-blown concert relieving. Utilizing the pain and struggles of the artist, the movie is grounded in the plot of discovery, recovery, and all out creation from the motivations life throws at us. The special effects and showmanship will have musical numbers and John fans amazed, watching the recreation of the wonders unfold in modern day dynamics. As much as these moments moved me though, the movie is by far for those with a passion for the drama vs the music itself. Therefore, this movie is definitely a theater visit, but don't go in expecting a repeat of Bohemian in terms of straight up musical grandiosity, they may not quite enjoy this as much, especially when the numbers are interrupted. Still a fine musical biography to say the least and worth it for those who like Jersey Boys, Get Up Off That Thing, and musical numbers from theater.My scores are:Biography/Drama/Music: 8.0

Rocketman (2019),"Rocketman is a strongly directed, performed and put together cinematic experience about the life of Elton John.Taron Egerton excels as the titular Rocketman with a poignant, soft but still all guns blazing performance. His singing is wonderful and he jumps head first into the role and gives a brilliantly tender soul to the film.Egerton is only as good as his support and my god his support is good. Jamie Bell as Bernie gives for some of the film's most poignant scenes.Bryce Dallas Howard is an inspired casting choice to play Elton's mother and she gives it her best (although it was very clear she didn't do her own singing!)Stephen Graham is just fantastic as usual. Charlie Rowe and Tate Donovan do very well with their limited parts.Steven Mackintosh and Gemma Jones were great reliable support whilst Richard Madden was brilliant fiendish as John Reid (who was also played by Game of Thrones alumni Aiden Gillen in Bo Rhap and one wonders where he could've taken the role if it was as fleshed out as Madden's).Little Matthew Illesley and Kit Connor were fantastic as little Elton and they deserve as much praise as Taron.The film is so well put together, the way the film is constructed with this circular narrative puts Bo Rhaps' circular structure to shame and although one shouldn't compare, the comparison between these films is hard to avoid, because Rocketman is so bloody brilliant.The set pieces / transitions between scenes are just wonderful, director Dexter Fletcher deserves all the praise for how he has constructed this film. He directed the bloody hell out of this film and deserves all the accolades coming his way.Never been a massive Elton John fan, didn't grow up on his music and that is exactly why I wanted to see this film, everybody I know loved Bohemian Rhapsody for the ""nostalgia"" but nostalgia shouldn't overshadow poor storytelling and construction.Rocketman proves you don't need to rely on nostalgia to make a bloody great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Disappointed with Rocketman,"Well .. I really wanted to love this movie. But, I didn't. I love Elton John. I've seen him in concert three times. This movie was disappointing. First off -- I didn't expect it to be a musical. I thought it would incorporate Elton's music .. with this was an actual musical with people dancing and singing. Sometimes, things didn't seem to be chronologically accurate.
I thought that the acting was good and the singing was terrific. I learned some things. And the lack of love and support and kindness from Elton's parents broke my heart. Every child should feel cherished. I've seen the trailer multiple times since I saw the movie Saturday night - and honestly - the trailer does not make it seem like the viewer is going to see a musical.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Egerton was snubbed of an Oscar-nomination for this one.,"Rocketman is more than an Elton John biopic: it's a star-driven vehicle showing Taron Egerton's acting chops are very strong, and that he's definitely going to become a very unique leading man in Hollywood. Also this is one Hollywood movie that makes gay sex actually sensual for straight people.Rocketman's a 4/5 star experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Simply awesome!,"This is the first review I've ever written and it's only because a week on from watching this I can not stop thinking about it and singing along to the soundtrack!I'm not a Elton John fan so to speak, I like some of his songs, but I do love a good film about any kind of music genre and this by far is the best music film (or just film!) I've seen in years.Taron is absolutely amazing in this, please give him an Oscar immediately! The supporting cast are all outstanding too though and just make the story even better.There are 4 musical moments of brilliance in this film, in my opinion...Saturday nights alright, your song, crocodile rock and pinball wizard. All of which made me want to go to watch Elton live or just listen to the songs non stop.I also had no idea what struggles Elton John went through and it was quite emotional at times (again Taron made these scenes!).I wasn't expecting this to be so much of a musical spectacular and I could watch it over and over again!

"Taron, Elton and Bernie - 3 great stars","It's been a week I saw this film and it haunts me. I still have these marvelous songs in my head and I remember the poetic images that the filmmaker put on these hits.It maybe not the reality, some had proved that it's Elton's point of view on his father and other cruel characters around him, but the lyrics of Bernie were prophetic. They have been written in the first year of his carreer and they are accurate about what happen years after.I don't want to compare with Bohemian Rhapsody. They are 2 different films and 2 different styles. I like both for the same reason, the beautiful music. But I also like them for different reasons: BR is a biopic with an actor who was like the original Freddie and he deserves an Oscar for this interpretation, RM is a musical with an actor who play a character inspired by Elton John and he was great for that too.Taron Egerton is a very good actor and I know that he will be on the AAA list for a long time.Just wait to see the movie again on my home cinema big screen with volume high!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Taron Egerton does a wonderful job. Please see it, that's all I'm gonna say.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Good musical biopic,"Musician biopics are in at the moment so no surprise there is one of extravagant Elton John. As somebody who once had the pleasure to meet him in person I was especially curious about a look at his often troubled life. I liked that they made a musical version than rather telling the life story. The casting of Taron Egerton was absolutely inspired and totally paid off. He totally pulled the role off and not concentrated on too much interpreting the music icon but rather interpreted his own version of him or rather on the character itself. Also a fantastic singing voice. I loved that all of Elton John's songs actually fitted his life situations perfectly.
Jamie Bell was also good, having some really strong moments. Not the biggest fan of Bryce Dallas Howard, she rather made a cartoonish parody of her role and I found she was rather miscast. John Madden was also rather a stereotype more than a real character. I really liked Gemma Jones though.
The soundtrack was obviously great, the choreography natural and well organized, The costumes are probably a shoe in for an Oscar nomination.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"It's not just a biographical film, it's a beautiful poem on screen!","So this movie certainly calls for comparisons with another film that came out last year. When I had seen the first trailer for 'Rocketman', my initial reaction was ""Wow, now there's another 'Bohemian Rhapsody' - style movie coming out. I don't think I would watch it in a movie theatre"". I thought this not because I didn't like Bohemian Rhapsody; in fact I had goosebumps throughout that film! But honestly that was because I'm a huge 'Queen' fan and a major part of that film was literally a series of scenes showing the composing / recording of the greatest Queen songs followed by recreation of some of their iconic stage performances of those songs (a total fantasy for a fanboy! :p ). But I'm not a ""fanboy"" of Elton John. I do love 4 or 5 songs of his (""Can you feel the love tonight"" is one of my all-time favourites), but there was nothing strong that would excite me for this movie. But looking at the very positive critical response for this film, I decided to watch it, with a fair amount of skepticism, on the big screen. Boy, I was wrong to doubt this film from its trailer. This film's approach is very different from Bohemian Rhapsody. Rocketman is a very well-crafted film with brilliant direction, some gorgeous set-pieces and camera-work, and a flawless work by the lead actor. Taron Egerton completely merges into Elton John's character and delivers an outstanding performance, which I liked even better than Rami Malek's Oscar winning performance last year. The first 10 mins of the film itself captured my full attention and I knew then that I'm in for a very refreshing experience. This film feels like an epic poem portraying Reginald Dwight's story in a very personal and emotional manner. Unlike ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", where the purpose of the songs were limited to entertaining the audience (mostly fans), here, Elton John's songs (recreated, and sung by Taron himself) serve as a device for storytelling: the film-makers cleverly use the musical-style approach to depict happening of events, and passage of time. Sure, there are sequences where people burst into singing and dancing, but all of them feel to serve a narrative purpose, rather than mere entertainment or extension of the film's run-time. The film does feel to drag a bit in between because we are quite familiar with the framework of a biopic of a huge star. Moreover, we have revised this arc only last year. But here the usual tropes of a film about the rise, fall, and comeback of a star are interwoven with strong thematic elements of loneliness, longing to be loved, and embracing one's true self, all of which make Rocketman a much deeper film that I had imagined!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Such a great movie!,"Taron Edgerton is amazingly talented at both singing and acting; the true MVP of this movie. He captured the fun and serious tones of the film perfectly.You DO NOT need to be an Elton John fan to enjoy this movie. I wasn't much of a fan going into the film but I came to really appreciate his life's story. I was captivated right from the beginning through the performances of each actor and remained interested for the full movie. Despite the slightly longer runtime, the film's pace was great and never seemed to drag.I don't even usually enjoy musicals but the song choices and segways into the musical portions made sense in the film and were not too long/gratuitous.All in all, a wonderfully done film featuring a great cast that shows a side of a legend we've never really seen before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Flying Slightly Above Most Musical Bios,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A fine performance by Taron Egerton and some fancy direction elevates Rocketman from its tethered script.JIM'S REVIEW: I remember when rock was young...and a young singer named Reginald Dwight a.k.a. Elton John exploded on the music scene with hit after hit after hit. Rocketman, an exuberant film biography of this musical legend, plays those hits too, as the film strings together the soundtrack of his life with varying degrees of success. Due mostly to a sensational performance by Taron Egerton in the title role, the musical interludes are performed and viewed very imaginatively, even if the storytelling is strictly mundane.Lee Hall's screenplay follows the contrived formula usually found in most bio-pics by showing the highs and lows of Elton John's personal story and expansive career: a child prodigy, unloving parents, a doting grandma, a caring music partner, a destructive relationship with his first lover/ manager, the typical drugs, sex, and rock and roll, etc. The story goes from Point A to Point B in a very predictable manner. The supporting characters are stock figures with little development and the writing never brings any depth to their motives or backgrounds. It expects the songs to tell the story in a most obvious way.Still, what sets this tired old cliché set-up apart from most bio-pics are the clever musical numbers that give the film a surreal and engaging quality. The songs are performed in no chronologic order. Instead they are the lead-ins and exposition to the many mercurial stages of the singer's life. This is strictly a juke box musical ala Mamma Mia, only much much better, with hints of The Who's Tommy thrown in at full throttle. The actors sing and dance their emotions through Mr. John's infectious music and Bernie Taupin's expressive lyrics, adding so much class to the film.And the whole concept mostly works.Yes, it's all too obvious and at times, overdone and excessive...but so is the man on stage. Director Dexter Fletcher knows how to stage his musical dream sequences and concert performances with the needed style and flourish. He also unflinchingly shows John's sexuality and does not sanitize these encounters as he did with the crowd-pleasing Freddy Mercury biography, Bohemian Rhapsody, which he previously co-directed. Special mention must also be paid to Julian Day's costumes which replicate John's iconic outfits with nostalgia and creative edginess.But it is Mr. Egerton, who does his own singing (a daring choice), and he captures the megastar's vocal intonations quite well. The actor delivers the emotional gravitas, especially in depicting Mr. John's abusive behavior. One hopes his performance will not be overlooked during award season. Jamie Bell plays John's writing partner, Bernie Taupin, and makes his character believable and real. As the villainous business manager / evil lover, Richard Madden tries to underplay this character with some degree of credibility, but the writing undoes his effort. Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh as Reginald's feuding mum and dad are wasted in their stereotypical roles.With an excellent lead performance by Mr. Egerton, Rocketman is always entertaining. Yet, while the film attains lift off, it just doesn't soar as high as it could.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Amazing!!,"This movie was great! Taron was born to play Elton, he did a fantastic job, and he was amazing with the vocals. I loved the song arrangements that they did as well. The only thing I didn't like was that you never really knew where on the time line they were year wise. You had to kind of guess based on the song. Other than that I loved the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A great movie in every way.,"Personally this is my favorite movie, and I've seen many movies. Taron Egerton's performance as Elton John is spectacular, he knows how to convey the right feeling for each scene not to mention his great resemblance to Elton in many scenes and his incredible voice that is part of the film's soundtrack. Dexter Fletcher's direction is amazing and that can be seen in his work, especially in ""Eddie the Eagle"", ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Rocketman"". The direction of photography by George Richmond I dare say is the best thing about this movie, the lighting of the instrumental scene where an orchestra performs ""Rocketman"" is impressive, the transitions in the musical numbers of ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting"" and ""Honky Cat"" are the best I've seen in my life, everything he directs turns into gold, like ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"", ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle', ""Eddie the Eagle"", all productions that have starred Egerton counting ""Rocketman"" as their fourth collaboration together and also their fourth collaboration with Fletcher. And obviously we don't hate to forget the incredible cast of this movie, Jaime Bell from ""Billy Elliot"", Richard Madden from ""Eternals"", Bryce Dallas Howard from ""Jurassic World"", Steven Mackintosh from ""The Postcard Killings"" and Gemma Jones from "" Bridget Jones's Diary"". I feel this movie is underrated with only four awards won, a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Egerton, a Satellite Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture, Comedy or Musical for Egerton, a Satellite Award for Best New Actor for Egerton and an Oscar for Best Original Song for Elton John and Bernie Taupin. I feel that this masterpiece should have had more recognition, Taron Egerton's performance was more than worthy of an Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Music and pain,"I love Elton John, his music has been a huge part of my life over my 40 years on this planet. So to see him get the biopic treatment is just crazy. I know the talk when it comes to these types of movies is on how close to life they are and how much stuff is left out. This was one of the issues that just drove me crazy with Bohemian Rhapsody. The time line was moved around so much that as a big Queen fan I noticed that years and events did not match up. Well I happy to say that this time around that didn't matter because while this is a biopic still, the take was on a more fantasy journey so the timeline didn't matter.So I am not going to waste time telling you who Elton John is. If you don't know then you have some big damn issues in your life. But the movie traces his life from when he first started playing the piano to around the time in the mid-80's when he started to get cleaned. We get all the high's and low's, the nasty family backstory and heartbreaking lovers along the way. It doesn't always paint John in a perfect light and so you feel some of his pain along the way. But the story would be nothing if the music was not great, which it was. Taron Everton does a great job at painting the piano singer but so does everyone in the cast. I loved how so much of the music was mixed in and how it didn't hold it's self to that whole time line thing. A great example of that would be when we hear the song I Want Love sung when he was a kid, when of course that is a song from the 1990's. This was a flat out great musical that never loses focus on who the star is, Elton John. Another aspect that I am glad was in focus was his personal relationships. Yes we all know that John is gay, but we are reminded that everyone is hurt and fooled no matter what your sexual orientation is.So should you see this? Yes, yes, yes. Right now. And love it because his story can be our story even if we never were rock stars or famous. We all have lived rich lives and have had pain along the way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

STOP COMPARING RAMI TO TARON,"I adore rocketman and bohemian rhapsody equally. if you can't appreciate how amazing taron and rami did portraying COMPLETELY different people without comparing them, then borhap and rocketman don't want your support. elton and freddie were friends, do not compare their biopics !!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Awesome!,"Taron Egerton is the heart of this movie. He is phenomenal. How he didn't get an Oscar for this role is crazy. He can break your heart with one look. I thought he was a decent actor until I saw this film and now he is a firm favourite.
Film is well made, songs fit perfectly with the narrative, big musical numbers and subtle intimate ones.
The subtle transformation of Elton in rehab over the course of the film as he peels back the public facade and we see the man behind the costume and glasses is beautifully done, a highlight for me.
Only fault I can find with this film is that it ended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
ROCKETMAN is shy of reaching the goal it aims at albeit hitting all the right notes,"Dexter Fletcher's jukebox biopic about British national treasure Elton John, né Reginald Dwight, ROCKETMAN touches all the right notes: Taron Egerton wonderfully shows off his vocal range and re-records John's hits with assertion; it doesn't skip John's queer sexuality like what they have done to Freddie Mercury in BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY (2018) and faithfully reproduces John's flamboyant outfits to bedazzling potency; plus an imprimatur from the singer/song-writer himself, a rare holdover surviving the inimical double influences from alcoholism and drug abuse, the blasé trimmings of showbiz stardom, and for that matter, the film indeeds commences with John, in his devil-with-horns attire ablaze, strutting into one of the addiction rehabilitation meetings, eagerly relates his own redemptive tale from the very start.Flashback from his early days, to his smooth sailing to fame and then its heavy tolls are welded with John's signature songs, Lee Hall's script mainly attributes his success to his inborn talent (a distinguished retention of strains, a natural pianist with no difficulty of churning out hit numbers) and good luck - roundly hitting it off with his long-time collaborator....keep reading my review on my blog: cinema omnivore",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Not perfect, but damn entertaining!","I understand those people who don't like this movie, because it's not what i expected it to be.But with that said, i enjoyed every moment of it. Taron Egerton is so damn good in this movie and his singing is amazing! It's not just that he sings Elton Johns songs, he performs as Elton John.What i ment by that i understand those people who doesn't like it is that it's a musical telling the story of Elton Johns life and that was a risky move but i loved it! It wouldn't work with any artist but Elton Johns music and his persona makes it work.I loved this movie and i like to thank everybody who made it in to what it is, great job!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Strong lead performance,"I have to admit, I thought the Freddy Mercury bio-pic BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY was just ""meh"" and that Rami Malek was ""just o'k"" as the Queen frontman (personally, I would have given the Oscar to Christian Bale for his portrayal of Dick Cheney in VICE) so I was not rushing to the multi-plex to check out the Elton John musical film ROCKETMAN. And the fact that the release of this film was ""buried"" in the summer and not right before ""Oscar Season"" gave me room to pause.And...I would be wrong...for ROCKETMAN is a fun, fantastical fantasy musical depicting the rise and fall (by drug and alcohol abuse) of one of rock's most flamboyant showman of the 1970's.Following the ""Jukebox Musical"" blueprint of something like JERSEY BOYS, Rocketman follows a young Reggie Dwight as he discovers his musical talent and grows into the Global Superstar known as Elton John.I was happy that the filmmakers went this route (vs the bio-pic route that BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY went) for they were able to use the vast catalog of Elton John/Bernie Taupin tunes to their fullest advantage, when it made sense to drive the narrative forward - or to give the storytelling a shot of adrenaline.This film had Elton John's blessings and he was not kind to a few people in his life - most notably his mother (an almost unrecognizable Bryce Dallas Howard in a strong turn), his father (Steve Mackintosh, who I had never seen before) and his Manager, John Reid (Game of Throne's Richard Madden). All 3 are pretty one-dimensional villains that help contribute to Elton's drug and alcohol abuse.On the other side of the coin is his writing partner, Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell, the original BILLY ELLIOT in a performance that I think is the best of his career) and his Grandmother, Ivy (good ol' Gemma Jones BRIDGET JONES DIARY and Madam Pomfrey in the Harry Potter films). Both of these characters are generally positive influences on Elton's life, trying to understand and support our hero on his journey.As for our hero, Taran Egerton (the KINGSMAN films) embodies Elton with panache and zeal while showing an underlying shyness and insecurity that helps lead to his abuse issues. Egerton is EXCELLENT in this role - both in acting and singing. He doesn't so much imitate Elton John but embodies the essence of Sir Elton and his performance is quite effective. If Rami Malek deserved his Oscar for playing Freddy Mercury in BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY then Taran Egerton better be in the Oscar conversation this year.The film was Directed by Dexter Fletcher (who was brought on to finish BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY once Bryan Singer was fired from that film for his on-set behavior), so he puts to good use his experience on the Queen movie, keeping the action moving fast, the characterizations simple (but satisfying) enough while showcasing just enough music to fill a ""Best of"" Album.While BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY was a ""meh"" movie with a buffo ending (the recreation of the LIVE AID concert was amazing), ROCKETMAN suffers from just the opposite problem. Starting off strong and growing weaker until it ends in ""meh"" fashion. The fact that this film musical fantasy decided to end with a faithful recreation of the I'M STILL STANDING music video is at the heart of the issue. I understand the implied underlying meaning of this song selection, but it just doesn't pack the punch that a live concert appearance would have.Come for the music, stay for Egerton's performance and you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A riveting combination of candor and glamor!,"It is always unfair to compare one movie to another; however in the stream of recently popularized biopics about music icons, it is impossible not to yield into the urge. Both Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman were built base on legends imprinted on me from early childhood, thus it only took me a second to decide to watch this movie in theater alone. And this time i am in utter bafflement at the candid depiction of such a renown figure in modern times.
Unlike the overly- romanticised version of Freddie Mercury, Rocketman feels more like a drama than anything else. Albeit some minor plot holes, cliche, and of course the unavoidable exaggerations that always inserted themselves in these types of film, it still demonstrates the struggle, sufferings, and inner- conflicts of a lost, heart- broken, forsaken and lonely person who also battles with identity- crisis. I found myself not shedding a tear even once during the entire time watching this, yet my heart grew heavier and more despondent every time Taron Egerton used his magnificent talents to open the closed door, allowing me to have a peek to what's behind the sparkling costumes and cheering stage. It is a very very personal and relatable movie to me. I wholeheartedly enjoy it, not because it was about someone who i grew up with (the sole reason why I enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody, the music and the talent of Freddie Mercury), but the lingering feelings it leaves long after I left the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"It is a very emotional story, even heartbreaking at most times.","I did not know much about Elton John to be honest. Sure, I have heard his songs like everyone else, but I did not know much about him as a person. This movie was very interesting to watch and I learned a lot. It is a very emotional story, even heartbreaking at most times.The acting and singing was great. The only thing that I find quite annoying is when it gets too much musical. When everyone starts singing, like the mom, the dad, the boyfriend etc. Especially when it happens at the wrong occasions. An example of the wrong occasion is when Elton and Bernie are having a deep and serious conversation towards the end of the movie, and in the middle of that Elton start singing, stands up and walks out while singing. Bernie then also start to sing and walks out after Elton. For me, it ruins the moment a bit. But otherwise the movie was fantastic!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Go see it, and then go see it again","I have never before been compelled to leave a review on this website, but I have also never before been so blown away by a film that I had to go see it twice in it's opening week just to feel like I didn't miss anything (something I highly recommend doing, by the way). This film made me feel so much that I want to tell everyone about it. Go see this film. This movie is so perfect and energetic and beautiful and epic and incredible and soaring and sad, yet it leaves you on such a high note that you'll be listening to the soundtrack for days afterwards just to feel a semblance of what this movie made you feel again. It's a movie about Elton John, yes, and an incredible portrayal of him and the soul of his music while at the same time adding something completely new and different to it, but it's also about choosing to get help when you need it in the darkest, lowest moments of shame and addiction and about what music can do and how it can make you feel. This movie isn't like other music biopics that almost entirely rely on the lead performance. This film has personality and energy that'll having you thrumming (on top of a career making performance by Taron Edgerton who fantastically does all of his own singing), but this film is first and foremost a film, and a great one at that. The way they incorporate Elton John's songs into the narrative and sometimes slightly alter them to make them fit the emotion of the situation is amazing, and they even do an incredible job of choosing Elton John's iconic outfits to fit the context of the scenes. I just honestly want to tell you every little great thing about this movie, but to save time I will instead spare you a mile long review to simply say: do yourself a massive favor and go and see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Contageous,"I expected a musical and was not are it would be something I would like, ( not liking Musicals,) but the opposite was true. The music added seemlessly to the story. What they showed was how personal his music was and how he was making music about his life . It would be interesting to hear how much imput he had into the movie making. And how his old manager felt about the way he is presented... As being greedy and self centred. It is a lesson on addiction and overcoming addiction. Well done John. And for making sacrifices to be present to raise your kids",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Absolutely a must see,"In a world of bio pics, comic books, and book adaptations i was sure this was going to have nothing original in it. Depending on your background knowledge of Elton John you may agree. However, the acting in this movie and the genuine emotion that is shown makes this movie an absolute treasure. After Bohemian Rhapsody, if this movie doesnt win awards hand over fist its a crime because Rocketman is better in every way! The only reason this is not a 10 is there is a slight musical element. (That is a few scenes where the actors seem to be directed by the music) which kind of broke the flow for me personally. It would have been fine had they used these in place of montages, but there is one of those as well. I personally think that sort of thing os best utalized in musical theater. This is the only, and small, complaint i had in the entire movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Thanks for sharing Your Song, Elton John","I grew up listening to Elton John songs. His hits came out just when i was old enough to appreciate them, and so his songs have bookmarked my life. I have always admired Elton John as a performer so when Rocketman was released, i made sure not to miss it. And i am glad i didn't. What a treat for a fan. The songs from the first half of his career are in the movie, woven seamlessly into the storyline so that this really is a musical biopic. The actors do a great job, especially Taron Egerton who sings just like the Man himself; the portrayal is really on point. Songs like Crocodile Rock and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road transported me back to the days of my youth. Thanks for the memories!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
