Nature fights back,"After the hype created by Bird Box, it is worth revisiting The Happening which was critically mauled upon its release.The reason might be M Night Shyamalan who wrote, produced and directed this film. His success in movies such as The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable meant that critics were just sharpening their knives and waited for him to fail.It starts off shockingly as people kill themselves in New York, such as throwing themselves off a building. The mass suicides soon spreads and the authorities initially think it is some kind of a biological terrorist attack.Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher at high school in Philadelphia. When the school hears about happening in New York, it causes a mass panic.Elliot, his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his young daughter Jess try to escape Philadelphia on the train. The train comes to a halt and they are stranded in the countryside.Julian goes back to look for his wife who could not make it on the train. Elliot tries to figure out what is causing this phenomenon as they witness more disturbing suicides. He thinks there is something in nature, especially the countryside that is causing the happening.Shyamalan was let down by Mark Wahlberg, the most unconvincing high school science teacher. Zooey Deschanel was not much better. I know she is supposed to have marriage problems but there was no chemistry here between the actors. Leguizamo would had been better as the lead.The film itself is much better than its reputation deserves. There is an environmental subtext to it. It is eerie, disturbing and mysterious. I can understand what Shyamalan tried to do and he largely succeeded with a psychological apocalyptic horror. It would had been better with stronger actors.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unfairly maligned,"Love him or hate him, Shama has a quirky vision and some very interesting ideas in his films. He also works with some paltry budgets by Hollywood standards, and cares more about story than effects. Does it always work? No. But considering just how effective his best work is - - 6th Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Visit--it's a pretty great body of work. I predict there will be a reappraisal of his work in the future, and with some bigger budgets and some careful rewrites, his remakes will reveal what a brilliant guy he is.The Happening is a small movie - - simple concept, low budget - - that doesn't try to be anything other than what it is, a cool spooky flick about a mysterious pandemic of suicide gripping the Northeast. Sign me up! Even if it comes across as lightweight by the end, like The Village, these armchair auteurs who trash MNS should try making even half an effective film as those two.Good for a rainy afternoon, probably not much else. But that's fine with me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's not happening,"Who keeps giving M. Night Shyamalan money to make these movies? Seriously, what studio executive read this script and thought that making this movie would be a good idea? After the disaster that was Lady in the Water Shyamalan comes back with a movie which unbelievably, almost impossibly, may actually be worse. Lousy acting, laughably bad dialogue and a story which is just downright stupid combine to make one terrible movie.Anyhow the story here is that starting in New York City and then quickly spreading through the Northeast everyone is suddenly killing themselves. Everyone drops what they're doing, seemingly goes catatonic for a moment and then offs themselves anyway they can. Fling themselves off the top of a building, shoot themselves in the head...whatever. What could possibly make people do this? Obviously it must be some kind of terrorist attack or so everyone thinks. There certainly is something bad in the air and people need to flee. And here we meet our main characters, a Philadelphia high school science teacher and his wife along with his friend and his friend's daughter. They get out of the city, inevitably get stuck in the middle of nowhere, the characters begin to do and say things which make no sense whatsoever and the whole movie falls apart as we watch people try to run away from the wind.Mark Wahlberg has the central role here and his performance is truly awful. Certainly he isn't helped by the hideous script but it really seems as if Wahlberg can do nothing right. He seems rather emotionless for a guy trying to figure out why everyone's engaging in mass suicide. As his wife, Zooey Deschanel goes through the film with a blank stare on her face. Some of the corpses show more life. Most of the other characters we meet make a bad impression if they make any impression at all. Some truly bizarre people wander in and out of this movie. And all of them are forced to spout dialogue which is so bad it often becomes unintentionally funny. Somebody wrote that? Really? Ha-ha. But as bad as the acting and dialogue are it's the story which is the biggest problem. Once the movie reveals what actually is happening it becomes impossible to take the story seriously. Stupid. So very, very stupid. The premise makes no sense, doesn't work at all, and thus the movie is doomed to failure. I really can't fathom that after reading the script anyone actually encouraged Shyamalan to go ahead and make this movie. The Sixth Sense sure was a long time ago.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This is a joke, right?","Allow me to provide some background information on my relationship with the films of M. Night Shyamalan: I adored ""The Sixth Sense"" and still think of it as one of the best films of 1999 and one of the best supernatural thrillers in ages. ""Unbreakable"" was a fascinating take on the superhero genre. I loved parts of ""Signs"" to bits and consider the sequence in the basement towards the end of the film one of the finest examples of suspenseful build-up in recent film history. I even liked ""The Village"" and could easily dismiss ""Lady in the Water"" as a mere misfire. I was greatly anticipating ""The Happening"", especially as it seemed to be echoing one of my favorite guilty pleasures- the paranoid 70's sci-fi thriller.Let's get one thing out of the way- ""The Happening"" is unbelievably, impossibly, ridiculously, hilariously, inconceivably bad. Normally I would refuse to rate any film that had any good scenes or that was well-directed less than four out of ten, but ""The Happening"" has to have one of the worst scripts among recent big-budget Hollywood films. It's absolutely shocking how retarded the logic behind this is and how poor so much of the dialogue is. This script began as ""The Green Effect"", a tremendously poor (trust me, I read parts of it) script by Shyamalan that was soundly rejected and eventually reworked into ""The Happening"". Having seen the critical reaction to ""The Happening"" prior to going into the film I found myself pleasantly surprised by basically the first thirty, forty minutes of the film. It was nothing special but it had something going for it, Shyamalan's direction was top-notch, and Wahlberg was playing the sort of goofy science teacher I'd loved (and loved to hate on occasion) in high school.Then the descent began. The bulk of this film is some of the most hilariously awful crap produced by a talented filmmaker since Schaffner's ""Sphinx"". Shyamalan, who was using close-ups and steadicam shots to frankly brilliant effect early on, begins to use the same shots to comical effect. There is one painfully, painfully long close-up of Mark Wahlberg pleading for time to think and then calling for his group to 'keep ahead of the wind' that is up there with Nicolas Cage in ""The Wicker Man"" in terms of hilariously awful acting. That scene may very well be the turning point in the film, with Wahlberg's acting becoming more ridiculous by the second, culminating in a performance that essentially wipes from memory all his tremendous recent achievements as an actor. I don't blame Wahlberg for this, I blame Shyamalan. Wahlberg claims Shyamalan tried to force him into real paranoia so his performance would work better. What happens here (no pun intended) is that Wahlberg ends up looking amazingly uncomfortable for the last hour of this thing and struggles to deliver any reasonable line deliveries.Okay, I do have to credit Zooey Deschanel for making this movie watchable. Besides being amazingly, ridiculously gorgeous she is a fine actress and creates a sympathetic character (and a fairly well-drawn one at that- one of the few pros in Shyamalan's script). There's also the score: oh my it's gorgeous. Seriously, ignore this film and just buy the score CD by James Newton Howard- it's brilliant.""The Happening"" starts out well but ends up being an absolute embarrassment. I was prepared for a mediocre offering- perhaps a misguided effort such as ""Lady in the Water"". I was not expecting a disaster on the level of ""The Happening"". Its last forty minutes and especially its last ten minutes or so are among the worst I have seen in a long time.Have you ever wondered if it was possible for a film to go from enjoyable to absolutely horrendous in the space of ten or fifteen minutes? ""The Happening"" is proof that it can, pardon the (intentional) pun, happen.3/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
Believe it...,"I hate this. I want to tell you guys that this was Shyamalan's comeback and that this film is just as terrifying as you've been promised. But, I cannot.The film starts off actually quite well. Minus some less than stellar acting (in fact, its horrible) and some just as bad dialogue, I really thought that maybe this film could pull it off. Disturbing death scenes ensue.Then, bring in Mark Wahlberg. What happened to this guy? Nominated for an Oscar for his turn in The Departed, Wahlberg seems like a safe bet, but in actuality, he's playing a role that just isn't made for him. This role was made for someone nicer. Walhberg has been typecast time and time again as the angry and bad-ass guy, and now I see why. He's good at that and god awful at being nice.No one else is particularly good either. Zoey Deschanel disappoints, John Leguizamo (Everyone in this movie has a name that's difficult to spell), and all of the extras are just as bad. There is not a single moment of good acting in this movie.And all of that is because of how rushed this film feels. This is one of those movies that it seriously felt like the director was working on a very limited budget and then took the first take for every actor, none of them had a chance to get into their roles (or so I hope).It's obvious who will get all of the blame for this (M. Night Shyamalan) and it's really too bad. I can't say that the plot is necessarily bad, it isn't, and with maybe one more draft the script would've been good. The faults of this film all land on Night's shoulders though. I hate to say it because I am very much not a hater of his (I love The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs) but I'm forced to say I hate this movie. Not so much for how bad it actually is (it's very bad) but because I really had faith in the director. The trailers almost felt promising and Shyamalan (am I even spelling this right?) promised me that I'd walk out shaking. Instead, I was shaking my head in disappointment.One thing I'd like to add on though, I can tell that they were going for a Hitchcock vibe and the best way I feel that I can describe this is ""a very bad version of The Birds."" That is all.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I didn't think it was THAT bad.,"Yes, there are of course bad things about this movie, don't get me wrong. Specifically, the line delivery and script were pretty dumb and much of the acting was wooden and unconvincing. There was only one good performance (Mrs. Jones). Some directing choices weren't that good either, but other than that I thought the tension built well and the premise of the story was interesting and original, and the beginning of the movie for the most part was captivating. There were some well-executed emotional and scary scenes as well! I don't believe that this is a bad movie and I was surprised to not be completely dissatisfied!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It might be cliché, but it has to be said: The Happening is not happening.","Shyamalan has proved to us earlier that he can be as good as the best with masterpieces of cinema with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Yet, since then, he has declined steadily. Signs and Village were good movies, but with Lady in the Water and now The Happening, he has touched a level of incompetence that could never have been expected of him.The Happening is about a pandemic that is gripping north-eastern USA. It starts with a stunning sequence of events that show people succumb to an unspecified threat  the brilliance of this opening repeated only once more for a five-minute sequence towards the end of the movie. Unfortunately, Shyamalan's writing is a big let-down for the rest. As the focus moves from metropolitans to towns and from crowds to smaller groups, the sense of fear is lost  the biggest sin a horror movie can commit. In the oft repeated criticism for its director, this movie would have been best served as a half-hour episode of Twilight Zone to make it really work.And to add woe, the actors do not do much to better the experience  Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are grossly miscast as the protagonists. Any of his previous leading men (Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Paul Giamatti) can be imagined to have done a better job for the Science teacher that Wahlberg plays. The camera scrutinizes the performance to a degree that requires an actor with strength in emotions  Wahlberg instead brings a physical presence that the role does not need. Zooey, on the other hand, struts around like in a Disney movie, not for once threatened by the pandemonium.This time, though Shyamalan humbles his vanity  you don't see him on screen. He now should swallow his pride and leave the writing to the writers. Armed with a better script, we can still expect Shyamalan to make his future movies worth waiting for. For now it is only the memory of the opening sequence, which can be proclaimed as mind-numbing greatness, which is really worth taking away from this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Highly Under-rated,"I'm not sure exactly why this movie has been bashed and low rated so much, maybe it's just a bandwagon thing? I'll admit it's no movie of the year and was a little cheese at parts. However overall it was actually quite entertaining, the plot moves along steadily and it was a standard 90 minutes. Anyway long story short my last point is that I believe M.Night was attempting to do a sort of throwback to the 50's and 60's era of film making. I see many Hitchcock styling within this film and I think he actually did an excellent job of creating a modern version of ""The Birds"" I mean let's face it this is the birds re-done. and re-done fairly well. The color, the music, the overall atmosphere, quite similar and well done. Maybe kids these days just can't appreciate this type of film, maybe they would low rank The Birds as well. As for the claims on ""confusion"" or not being realistic enough I don't understand that either. I think it is fairly clear that the cause is not going to be understood but likely has something to do with the plants and some sort of biologically active chemicals they emit. This is actually completely within the realm of possible. Trees and shrubs release chemicals into the air that can have subtle and sometimes overwhelming affects on human emotion and behaviour. Example is essential oils (the oils in plants that give them their smells).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The End of an Era (but not a career),"Let me preface these comments by saying that I am a major Night fan. I look forward to news of his next project and love the stories of his supposed total control over his movies and carte blanche from the studios. If those stories are true, I have a feeling that era will be ending for Night with the release of The Happening. I ignored all the pre-release press I could before going to see this movie. I read none of the reviews, but one word I did catch was ""uninspired."" Unfortunately, that one word describes this movie perfectly. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I thought it was due to the acting and that maybe Mark Wahlberg was miscast. However, after another ten minutes I realized it wasn't the actors; it was the extremely lame script. Without giving away any details, this is a disaster film where the disaster ""happening"" starts with the first scene of the movie. Unfortunately, no suspense builds and there is absolutely no sense of dread or panic on screen and so none translates to the audience. Surprising, since the 21st century has provided us with too many occasions to study how we react in times of disaster, whether by nature or terrorism. It's as if Night ignored all this when writing the story. The characters sleepwalk through the scenes (and, no, it's not a symptom of ""the happening"") with no believable sense of the horrible events taking place. Granted, we don't need to see people running around in circles screaming and crying, but people do not stand in small groups after a disaster calmly taking turns talking one at a time. Without sharing in any of the horror that the characters are suppose to be experiencing, the film is a total bore for the audience and the source of ""the happening"" is laughable when revealed. I found myself repeatedly checking my watch, saying, ""I can't believe how bad this is""  not something I'd expect to do in a Night movie. Looking around the theater, I could tell others were sharing the same feelings. Most were scrolling through emails or texting on their phones.During the movie, since I wasn't paying much attention to the screen, I started thinking that there might be a good reason why most filmmakers do not have total control over their films. When they do, they can reach a point that it seems Night may have reached, where they say, ""I'm going to make people scared when the wind blows"" and actually believe themselves. Maybe other producers or execs can step in at that point and bring the filmmaker back to reality. I'm not giving up on Night, but I'll feel better if his next film is not ""Written, Produced and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.""",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't understand the hate,"I have watched this movie probably 15 times since it was released.

Good enough to watch,"It's not as bad as the Professional Critics say it is, but I can understand why they hated it. The Characterization of basically everyone in the Movie is pretty poor, although Zoey Deschanel, Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo does work hard with Material they have and sort of work to a certain degree.The premise is also a bit problematic, Plants are everywhere and there is no avoiding them if they are releasing Toxins unless you wear some sort of breathing filter and almost none of them got to that in the Film.But it is a fairly effective Thriller, certainly good enough to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Not Much Happening,"What can I say. This movie sucked. Not even Mark Wahlberg, whom I rate as a great actor, could save this turkey.I don't intend to include any spoilers, unless you include the fact that nothing of any note goes on in this picture. Equally the script seems to be written from the perspective of a naive 10 year old for a U-rated audience. The details concerning the relationship friction between the central characters seem so childlike as to be pointless.Zooey Deschanel, who I enjoyed in Failure to Launch, seems completely miscast or just terrible. Her principle role seems to be to appear as a giant doe-eyed girl stumbling from scene to scene as though awakening from a drug-induced coma.Shyamalan made a great first movie and I also enjoyed Unbreakable. Other than that he's been sliding into an abyss of drivel and somebody needs to stop funding his crap so I can stop kidding myself into sitting through it with the idea that surely this time it'll be worth it.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not brilliant but it is worth a look,"When I first saw the trailer for 'The Happening', I was quite excited at the prospect of another film by M. Night Shyamalan. After all, I enjoyed all his previous films, save 'Lady in the Lake', and was sure he would deliver another breath-taking blockbuster. Sadly, I was wrong and while the film was not a turkey, it was not of the excellence I had expected.The film sees some sort of mysterious ecological event leading to people committing mass suicide, the phenomenon spreading first from large cities then to smaller towns until it is clear a huge chunk of the East Coast is affected. At first, it is assumed to be a terrorist attack but, as more and more people are spontaneously kill themselves, it is clear the cause may be something else entirely...One of the problems with the film was the quality of the acting and the characters themselves. Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot, the science teacher who is our main protagonist, and he does flounder in many scenes as if he forgets he's playing an intelligent but ordinary everyday guy, not a gung-ho military hero who is cool in all situations. He could have injected more emotion into his performance. Zooey Deschanel plays Elliot's girlfriend Alma and she too fails to make the audience care for her with the way she depicts the character to be some sort of an escapee from a teeny-booper romance flick. To be fair, it is not entirely Deschanel's fault as Alma is a weak, self-centred character with the emotional capacity of a young adolescent (for example, she puts Elliot and a child at risk a couple of times with her stupid decisions and, at the start, when it's clear people are dying, she is in a huff because Elliot and his friend 'hurt' her feelings).When it comes to the actual storyline, the plot does start off intriguingly and there are many chilling moments when we see people are coolly committing suicide like mindless zombies. However, the finale doesn't deliver what the build-up promised. There are no real explanations or solid end result. In many ways, this film is similar to Shyamalan's previous project 'Signs' both in terms of a mass disaster and no real end resolution to the events but 'Signs' worked better because the characters were more effectively portrayed and their personal storyline was enough of a finale to compensate. This is not the case in 'The Happening' where the storyline fizzles out.Overall, this is by no means a terrible film. It is enjoyable and fits nicely into the apocalyptic genre but 'Signs' has done this sort of idea before and did it better. That said, there was not only moments that had me on the edge of my seat but also lines which were quite humorous. And certainly, it does make one think about the state of the planet in regards to whether humanity does have it coming to them and how we would cope in such an event. It is worth a look, especially in a week when the other premiere is 'The Hulk, a film aimed at keeping twelve-year-olds' entertained.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"The Happening: Woefully Acted, Barely Written and Just Absurd","I suggested that my friends and I go to see this film in the cinema when it was released. As a result, I have never since been allowed to choose the film.The Happening concerns a mysterious phenomenon which is leading to mass death and causing wide-spread panic around the world. Mark Wahlberg plays a high-school teacher thrust into the middle of this emergency situation with his girlfriend, played by Zooey Deschanel. They are journeying across the country to escape ""the happening"".The premise is interesting to begin with, a message lying at the heart of the film. It is, however, taken beyond the point of redemption by Shyamalan. The script is simple, generic, unimaginative, boorish rubbish. Stupid, emotionless, and inhuman lines spoken by characters which might, with a degree of kindness, be described as two-dimensional. The relationships between them are entirely unbelievable and insincere. And the acting? Oh the acting... Wahlberg deserves a slap as the blandly irritating and vapid ""hero"" who appears to have only a single tone of mundanity available to him as a voice, and Zooey Deschanel is... well, simply, Zooey Deschanel isn't. Having Wahlberg speak to himself would have been less painful (oh wait, he does try that). The ""expressions"" of joy, fear, shock, and sadness upon Deschanel's face are entirely indistinguishable from each other, and indeed from emotion at all. Possibly the single worst ""performance"" I have ever seen. To make matters worse, both characters seem more attached to turning their heads to the side than they are to each other. You'll think they're trying to get something out of their ears. Perhaps its the sound of the dialogue, clunky and tacky as it comes.Woefully acted, barely written, and just absurd, the only thing happening with The Happening is the steady flow of people leaving. Shyamalan continues his recent trend of awfulness, digging ever deeper his cinematic grave.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If it's intentional, it's still a bad film","I'm a Shyamalan fan. He's not afraid to take chances. And he believes in himself and his story. Most of the time, that helps. Gems like Unbreakable en The Village would never have seen the light of day if someone other than Shyamalan came up with it. His direction always makes sure his story gets the maximum effect. I like his screenplays because they always consist of two things: originality and well written characters. His new feature has neither. It's that simple. As a Shyamalan fan, I felt this disappointment a little with Lady in the Water. But now, it's twice in a row.In a nutshell: Beginning in Central Park NYC, people are effected what is first believed to be a neurotoxine causing people to behave irrational, even to the point of suicide. But then the survivors start to uncover signs that it's not terrorists, but nature itself spreading this virus: yes, it's nature against men. And nature is winning.I thought Wahlberg was a very poor choice. His range as an actor is far too narrow to play in any production that needs a little nuance. In other words: he shouldn't be in anything else than a movie about cops or (ex-)marines. Also the rest of the cast is surprisingly aloof. This includes Zooey Deschanel, who looks like she's a live-action version of a Manga character. Can those eyes be any wider?The way the information is brought to the viewer is simple. There is a hinge of a critical message about massmedia, how we get our information and how we as a society are depended on TV, mobiles phones etc. to get in touch with each other. But it's nothing major. Because there really isn't much to tell. The first 15 minutes are the most interesting. Although the very first scene with the two women on a bench in the park (in hindsight) is telling. I really had my doubts about everything: the acting, the actions taken by the characters, the total mood and feel of the film. Once it goes into the 2nd act, the movie becomes more and more (non intentional) laughable and silly.After seeing this I read that Shyamalan intended this to be an expensive B-movie, in the tradition of Romero etc. If that's the case, then my original rating of 5 (outta 10) should be a 3. Because nowhere in the movie does this become apparent. If you want a good homage, take a look at Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead (although that's really a remake.) I don't like a these talented filmmakers who want to take $100 million budgets, to make movies who look like they've been made for $10.000. But at least someone like Tarantino or Rodriquez adds originality and a real love for the genre.The Happening is really bad as a serious film. As an homage it's boring and without heart. Take your pick. But you will be disappointed either way.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
come again?,"This movie can be summed up very easily, interesting but lacking plot. M Night spent too much of his budget on casting Wahlberg to afford sufficient special effects to give this movie a cleaner look. With as poor as the effects in this movie are it makes you wonder what they spent the 60 million dollar budget on, they clearly could not have spent anywhere near that The Matrix had a 63 million dollar budget...This is a suspenseful thriller with a mediocre plot.

There is a reason why this movie was written, directed, and produced by him, because no one else was willing to take a chance with it and after seeing the film you will understand why.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Solid, Albeit Imperfect, Tribute To 50s Sci Fi B Movies","""The Happening"" is arguably one of the most critically slammed blockbusters of the past 10 years. Beloved as ""so bad, it's good"" cinema at best and regarded as an abysmal failure at worst, it's regarded by many as the film that began M. Night Shyamalan's descent from beloved visionary to embarrassment of the industry. However, when one looks at the movie from the perspective Shyamalan intended (As a cheesy tribute to 50s Sci-Fi a la ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"") it's not half bad. Don't get me wrong, ""The Happening"" isn't a film like ""The Wolfman"" or ""Attack of the Clones"" where I genuinely can't understand why people think it's terrible; it has problems. BIG ones. But for what it was trying to do, the film succeeds more often than it fails.One thing I loved was how ""The Happening"" never took itself 100% seriously. Clever themes on the dangers of uncontrolled fear, emotion overpowering reason, environmentalism and strength of community aside, the story is somewhat silly; plants releasing toxins in the air making people kill themselves. However, unlike insipid films like ""Winter's Tale"" or ""It Follows"" that seem to be under the impression that ""seriousness + themes=intelligence"", ""The Happening"" KNOWS that the concept is BS. I know this because of the film's frequent use of bonkers dialogue (""You know hot dogs get a bad rap? They got a cool shape, they got protein. You like hot dogs right?"") and intentionally campy (But not at all ""bad."" John Leguizamo in particular is outstanding as Elliot's terrified friend Julian, a character EXTREMELY out of his element in such a horrific and catastrophic event) acting reminiscent of B-Movie classics like ""The Blob"" and ""The Body Snatchers."" It's in the smart execution of an inherently stupid premise that ""The Happening"" shines.And the execution is smart indeed. Hokiness aside, ""The Happening"" is extremely subtle in the delivery of its themes and certainly worthy of post-viewing analysis. Shyamalan's use of color to convey emotion (Blue representing calmness and yellow representing hope for example) is brilliant, and refreshing in an age where too many directors merely use a particular color scheme cause ""it looks cool."" Whatever issues one may have with the writing, visually it's an undeniably well directed film. Major props must also be given to Shyamalan for not being ""on the nose"" with the delivery of its themes or giving easy answers to questioning viewers. For example, while the film says that plants are responsible for the outbreak, there are several background visuals that many audience members may not even notice that imply that the film may not be talking about literal botanical plants, but by polluting, power plants (An idea that is also supported by easy to miss visual cues such as Elliot and his party hurrying past a real estate billboard subtitled ""You Deserve This!"") The film also toys with the possibility that the virus was released in the air long before the start of the movie, but only triggered/activated by negative emotion; that said, we never get a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" to said possibility.The musical score is positively chilling, certainly among my personal favorites. There is an almost delicate beauty to it that slowly transitions into a much darker and more ominous tone. The music fits in perfectly with ""The Happening""'s truly horrific and disturbing kills. M. Night really makes the most of his first R-Rated movie, making the suicide scenes as graphic and uncomfortable as possible (One particular scene involving a zookeeper is downright cringe worthy, and I mean that in the best possible way)As I stated earlier, ""The Happening"" is not perfect, and I recognize that it has some major problems. Zooey Deschanel is positively DREADFUL as Elliot's cheating partner Alma, almost unbearably so. Her delivery barely resembles anything even REMOTELY humanoid, and every time she opens her mouth, my immersion in the film is shattered. Also, while I can enjoy most of the dialogue as part of the 50s Sci-Fi B movie thing the film was going for, some of the characters can occasionally speak in lines so over dramatic I could have sworn they were written exclusively for the trailer.That said, I don't think that these problems are enough to wreck the mostly enjoyable experience I had with ""The Happening."" It's no masterpiece, but it's a damn impressive tribute to a long forgotten age. Distracting flaws aside, ""The Happening"" is a refreshingly self aware but surprisingly clever B-movie directed with the skill of a true artist.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Proof that a movie with such potential could fall so hard,"As I have said before, I am not a M Night Shyamalan detractor, I just feel saddened that somebody responsible for a masterpiece such as The Sixth Sense and a great movie like Unbreakable could fall to lows by being responsible for a movie as strange as Lady in the Water and as horrible as this. For me, Shyamalan's worst film is between this and The Last Airbender.The Happening did have a brilliant idea, but sadly this is living proof that a great concept could fall victim to such poor execution. The only redeeming values were the score that brims with beauty and intensity and Zooey Deschannel's sympathetic performance.Everything else however is a failure. The film doesn't look so bad actually in the scenery and effects, but because there is no life to the film I could never properly enjoy it. Plus there is some camera work annoyances that were one of many flaws for Lady in the Water, such as the focusing on nothing and half-faces, not to mention the ridiculously long keep ahead of the wind close-up.I wish I had better news about the story, script and characters, but I can't. The script is incredibly contrived and ham-fisted especially Mark Wahlberg's lunatic conversation with a plastic pot plant which is a contender for Wahlberg's worst ever acting moment, and Shyamalan's direction is either unfocused with the uneasy mix of disaster thriller or 1970s eco-horror or over-ambitious with again the trying to cram in too much notion that eluded a vast majority of his resume after Signs.The characters are stereotyped, with Deschannel's the only one I had any sense of care or sympathy for. The story is a mess, it may have started off intriguingly but suffered from a lack of suspense, dull pacing, the sense that the film doesn't know whether it wants to be disaster thriller or eco-horror and one of the most hysterically awful last forty minutes I have seen of any film.Mark Wahlberg I am not a fan of, but he has been capable of some good, even great, performances namely in The Fighter and especially Boogie Nights. But he is awful in this, one minute he is dull and the other minute he is overacting embarrassingly, it is painful to watch really. In conclusion, a mess of a film and considering the potential it should have been so much more than it was. 2/10 Bethany Cox",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enigmatic Terror,"After ""Lady in the Water"" has disappointed critics and audiences alike, M. Night Shyamalan rebounds and reclaims his dignity as a filmmaker with ""The Happening"". I really do not like talking much about a good Shyamalan movie because the power of his movies usually come from the revealing surprises it gives audiences; his movies tend to scare you with something you cannot immediately understand. And Shyamalan is the master of mysterious threats, which is quite clear with this movie. All you need to know is that there is an unexplained phenomenon that is inexplicably exterminating human beings in and around the North American region.This movie is such an enigmatic horror movie that reminds me of Radiohead's music video for ""Just"" and also mirrors classic horror flicks of the 60's, specifically much like Alfred Hitchcock's many works, it also has that Stephen King feel to it. Shyamalan has gone back what he is good at; tapping at the power of fear. And fear is what you get, as The Happening creates a realistic state of imminent threat creating a paranoia that easily infects the audience. The film actually belongs to the Twilight Zone sort of sci-fi suspense; it is freaky and frighteningly mysterious, injected with a B-movie appeal but with a strong sense of realism.The music was also an excellent mood-setter that appropriately enhances its very unsettling setting. The cast gave a convincing performance, with Mark Wahlberg, and the very charming Zooey Deschanel on the lead; they are supported by explosive performances by John Leguizamo, Ashlyn Sanchez, and a very disturbing role played by Betty Buckley. Shyamalan's direction of making the movie simplistic, non-flashy, and just lets its realistic storyline simply unfold without any unnecessary visual gimmicks. The story simply doesn't even attempt to make a detailed accurate scientific explanation, because the main character in this sort of movie is the fear, not the science. The fear feels real up to the point that I feel like I couldn't just wait till the main characters overcome this threat they're facing.Maybe it was just because I expected so little, but The Happening really took me by surprise, and if you ask me, this movie was way scarier than Sixth Sense. If you want a really good scare or a really good scream, and get to learn a little something as well, THE HAPPENING is something you should watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I am offended by pretentious reviewers/comments,"1. I have an attention span 2. I like ALL other M. Night movies 3. I hated The HappeningThe biggest laugh, the greatest joke here, is that M Night has stated in interviews that HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE A B-MOVIE.In other words... The Happening is INTENTIONALLY BAD. The acting, the editing, the pace, all of it was intentionally hokey. The problem here though... is that no one got it. I'm not going to lie like most reviewers and say I knew, it didn't click with me until M Night stated it was his attempt at a B-movie.So all those armchair critics trying to pretend this film was deep and high-art must have their heads up way, way, up their own rectums.If having an imagination means making a worthless movie more than it is, then yeah, I must not have an imagination.Furthermore, Ebert is a old pretentious gas bag who is just as clueless. His review only states the obvious of ALL of M Night's films. If you haven't figured out by now that M Night is more focused on the human condition and how it reacts to odd or strange events rather than the event itself, then you need to quit watching movies.To summarize Ebert, {not verbatim} ""This movie is not a summer mindless blockbuster and explores how these people deal in a crisis""... wow Ebert... um, which M Night movie are we talking about again?Go ahead and try to be deep about this one... you'll only look foolish.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why this film is important...and why people don't like it that way:,"I was disappointed to see such harsh reviews from the critics when there are clearly much sillier and stupid films out there. ""Zohan"" was about 60% at rotten tomatoes, while ""The Happening"" was at 14%. The disappointment didn't last long when I realized, given the information above, if critics had liked this movie, that might have been a bad thing. I focused my attention on interviews with Shyamalan himself talking about the film instead of the pretentious critics who have grown accustom to hating his movies. I decided to take HIS advice and go into the theater looking for a ""fun B movie"".You will find that, and so much more. This movie is not your average thriller by any means. ""The Happening"" holds a solid ""Twilight Zone"" feel without being cliché or overused. This might be why the average masses didn't like it. We are used to being fed sequel after sequel after remake after remake. Don't get me wrong, those are fun movies to watch but the ART of film is being lost. The stereotypic perfect leading man who is smooth, witty, handsome and quick thinking who always saves the day will not be found in this film. Nor will the overuse of incredible special effects, slashing and squirting blood and gore, erotic sex scenes, fast paced chases, or crude language. Yes, the content is uncomfortable and disturbing and times, but it has a point. It's not goring for the sake of being goring and it's not uncontrolled in it's violence.This film is simple. It has flawed and awkward characters who don't always say the smoothest thing. Everyone is imperfect and they don't handle the situations in the best ""hollywood"" type manner. Shyamalan did this on purpose. This movie is not paced for the ""entertain me entertain me entertain me entertain me"" type audiences we have mostly become. You are given the elements, but it's up to you to be able to slow down and feel the emotions in order to appreciate the film. The parable and meaning are so much deeper and innocent than what is popularized in media today. It will challenge you. It will make you think.""The Happening"" on the outside is a very fun and funny film. It is a ""B"" movie on the surface because of it's amazing simplicity, but by the end of the film you realize what it's actually all about. It's sad to see that so many people have completely missed it.Bottom line: If you liked his other films, you must see this one, it falls into the ranks of everything made before Lady. If you didn't like his other films, stick to boring remakes and sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
M. Night Rocks,"This latest movie by the redoubtable Mr. Shyamalan is being ripped to shreds. Seems Hollywood's former golden boy earns nothing but disgust and disdain nowadays. Say what you will about this guy, his movies are DIFFERENT. He does not follow the all-too-standardized templates, prevalent in every genre from action to horror to sci-fi. Are his films flawed and uneven at times? Yes, every single one has been. They all have this in common.They also have in common uncommon storytelling, fantastic mood, appropriately chilling scores, and engender a sense of unease in the viewer that almost no other filmmaker has been capable of.Were there mistakes in the plot, character development, editing? Yeah. And you know what? Nonetheless, I was enthralled. This man imbues his films, however flawed, with passion, something lacking in most big-budget summer blockbusters. Whatever his technical shortcomings, this is a filmmaker who truly loves to tell a story. Golden Boy status-worthy or not, I applaud Shyamalan and his latest movie. The man has got the cojones to think originally and make movies that no one else could, or would. ""The Happening"" rocks! -MKA, Ft Walton Beach, FL",,Anonymous,Mystery
From a first-timer's perspective.,"Let me get this out there before I start - ""The Happening"" is the first Shyamalan film I have ever seen.And I have to say that if anyone believes this movie was thoughtful, brilliant or creative, they have to be biased towards what I have been told is Shyamalan's former brilliance in earlier films, because this movie is downright awful.Despite the ""message"" the movie may have been trying to subtly shove down our throats (ala the completely unnecessary pan to the chalkboard about how humans would die without bees in 3 years), it fails by quickly transforming from a half-interesting suspense film into a completely awkward and unintentional comedy.I can't even say Shyamalan was making an effort to direct a believably terrifying film - the script is beyond laughable. Every scene that was supposed to be either heartbreaking, terrifying or downright creepy was completely shattered by some mind-numbingly stupid response like ""cheese and crackers!"" (usually from the main character Elliot played by Mark Wahlberg, but the provided one is thanks to Jeremy Strong.) I felt as though Shyamalan treated the audience like a bunch of idiots in presenting the concept of this film in the most dumbed down way possible. It spins around in circles, taking itself seriously then suddenly busting out a line like ""You know hot dogs get a bad rap? They got a cool shape."" It's negotiable when this movie jumps the shark, but i'm going to give it more credit than it deserves and say it's when Elliot starts talking to a plastic tree.And if that isn't enough, the movie gives itself away after a grand total of 5 minutes.In conclusion, I don't care who directed this movie, and I don't care what else he has made, it was bad.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Worst. Movie. Ever.,"This movie's so bad, you'll be thinking that Mark Wahlberg should've just stuck with rapping. I can't even describe how terrible this movie is. If you're sifting through reviews to find a reason to watch it, don't. It's normal for a film to have cynics and skeptics, but in this case every criticism is well earned. The acting? Nope. The plot? No. And the dialogue? Hell no.This movie has absolutely no continuity whatsoever and the pacing is so bad that you'll have at least a dozen moments where you just sit and think ""Maybe they made this movie this bad on purpose. Like, to end up in the Hall-of-Fame for worst movies of all-time or something"". Because, trust me -- it's absolutely that bad!I literally don't understand how this movie could make it from production to premiere without a wall of people protesting it for its awfulness. I wish I could grade this film with dookies instead of stars, because even giving it the lowest slotted amount of stars (1) feels wrong. I'd feel much better giving this film one giant dookie...Or ten. Or 50,000. I'm not even sure at this point, that's how bamboozled I am by this horrible movie.I didn't even think it was worth a review until I realized I may be the difference between someone watching and not watching and so I feel it's my civic duty to not let that happen.

Appalling,"Absolute rubbish. Rubbish story, rubbish acting, rubbish directing. Not worth wasting your time watching. I was shocked at how bad this film is!! Characters seemed wooden and completely unbelievable and the science behind the story is almost as bad as 'The Core'. M. Night Shyamalan is capable of so much more than this drivel. Mark Wahlberg character is cringe-worthy, as is Zooey Deschanels. This is about as unrealistic as it gets. I hate to slag off a movie as much as I am, but i see nothing of any value is this film, apart from a lesson to filmmakers on how NOT to make a motion picture.PERSONAL RATING: 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"No aliens, ghosts or monsters here. Something far more frightening...","As stated in the summary above, if you are watching because you like some of M. Knight's previous efforts and perhaps are ready to make comparisons with some of his other 'hits' then prepare to be disappointed. Thankfully there's no ghosts, creatures, or aliens present in this one - and all the better for it, says I!! I have to admit that generally speaking I am not a fan of the director's output. Personally I find ""The Sixth Sense"" far from being the 'modern day classic' as some describe it; thought the 'twist' ending in ""The Village"" could be seen a mile away, and generally find the man's movies overrated and trite. In his defence however, I did like the pairing of Mel Gibson & Joaquin Phoenix in ""Signs"", which was an enjoyable outing - so it's not all bad! With this film though, there seems to be a general air of disappointment elsewhere in the IMDb comments, which I think is unjustified. Perhaps people feel let down due to the overall lack of an overt 'entity' that threatens the characters. Conversely, I found the invisible and natural quality of the threat quite sinister indeed and considered the environmental elements in the plot to be a very believable master-stroke. For a film that is shot almost entirely in daylight, and with nothing dark or monstrous or other-worldly hot on the character's heels, there is a remarkably strong sense of dread and fear of the unknown that saturates ""The Happening"" and works really well in the film's favour. Mark Wahlberg turns in a very human performance, miles from his hardened Bourne 'identity'(!) and the young child in the story was well selected and played. The entirety did not feel either overlong or overwrought, and levels of reprehensible over-sentimentality are kept to a fortunate minimum. If this is a mark of Mr. Shayamalan's future direction, then here's looking forward to his next project. ""Hats off"" to you, sir - for an engrossing film well made!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
worse even than expected - so what happened?,"The expansive laundry list of the failures of this mind-numbingly miserable, preposterous excuse for a film, which essentially includes every conceivable aspect and component of it, have been well detailed in earlier posts. I won't waste much time reiterating those comments. I have to say that I disagree with those who, in spite of their overall distaste for the film, with which I heartily agree, found the first so many minutes to be watchable, or the score to stand out as a positive feature, or who found anything else positive to say about any part of this thing. Perhaps you're just being kind. No need. OK, Deschanel is a cutie, but that's it for this film.So what happened to Shymalan? Sixth Sense was obviously a masterpiece. Unbreakable was brilliant, although the stilted dialog was starting to show. In Signs we still had a good story and very watchable thriller, but it was becoming clear that Shymalan had no idea how real people actually talked to one another. In these first 3 films we had Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Mel Gibson, top of the A-list talents, and one must wonder how much of the quality of these films was due to their great ability and superb performances rendered. Shymalan has not been able to recruit this caliber of actor since Signs, as no doubt actors and their agents do read the screenplays pitched to them. Not to take anything away from Hurt, Giammati, or Whalberg, who all have done and are capable of more great things, but they are a step down from the likes of Willis and Gibson, and this compounded with increasingly silly stories and atrocious dialog, the result was one mediocre, one bad, and one utterly awful film, in that order.Another possibility is that Shymalan stole his first two or three stories, or has since lost an important uncredited collaborator or muse, and really never had any talent himself. In any case, that's probably it for Shymalan, and it's about time.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Creepy fun for all the family! ...so long as you're childless,"I didn't realise director's could get type-cast too... or Shyamalan just enjoys the spooky, supernatural, Twilight Zone stuff to the exclusion of all else.Well anyway his enjoyment is infectious and I love the ride. There hasn't been another such distinctive and commercial director like him since Spielberg. A Shyamalan film is almost its own genre now - we know what sort of story to expect and we also know that we'll get a certain quality of direction and production that's beautifully shot, effectively scored and really immersive.What critics often forget is that even a mediocre Shyamalan film is still better than 73.5% of other Hollywood output. They can't see the forest for the trees! The Happening is rooted in familiar Shyamalan territory, but the bark is worse than the bite - this is spooky more than horror (no bad thing) - but you'll still leaf the cinema feeling relieved and uneasy (but maybe because of Wahlberg's wooden performance - he certainly can't branch too far out of his comfort zone - pretty unconvincing here as a science teacher. Sap!).So... not without it's faults but still lots of fun, and not nearly as silly as the last Indiana Jones movie. Spielberg is dead, long live Shyamalan!

The Pre-Release Negative Buzz was Deserved. Sorta.,"I never understood why critics (and audiences) were so hard on M. Night Shyamalan. I honestly believe that Lady in the Water and The Village are his best films (sue me!). That's why I overlooked The Happening's negative buzz, and went to see it on its opening day. To my surprise, critics were right (for the most part), and Shyamalan has disappointed me for the first time.The idea of an airborne toxic that causes people to unconsciously hurt themselves is genuinely original, creepy, and effective. Fittingly, Shyamalan comes up with the scariest death scenes in recent memory. My fiancée had to cover her eyes multiple times. Moreover, The Happening has a couple of excellent jump scares. Needless to say, Shyamalan is still excellent at composing his scenes. And as usual, James Newton Howard's score rocks. Unfortunately, that's were the good news ends.The very first scene of The Happening puts you right in the middle of the action. But that's probably why the film runs out of steam so quickly. This should've been a 75-80 minute film. Basically, nothing happens in the second half. We're just introduced to a couple of freaky, freaky characters. Mrs. Jones in particular did get huge laughs at my showing. And BTW, I was perfectly fine with the explanation the film came up with. After all, this is a super-natural thriller.Shyamalan was always able to get excellent performances out of his leads. I'd even say that's his trademark. However, Mark Wahlberg totally lets him down. He was terrible. He has same look on his face whether he's scared, joking, or thinking. The tone of his voice rarely changed as well. His turn single-handedly eliminates the emotional impact of a lot of scenes. Remember Lady in the Water's Healing scene? I cried like a baby when I saw that. The Happening has a similar ""redemption"" scene, but frankly, I couldn't care less. Deschanel was even worse. She was just standing there, reciting her lines. She got better near the end though.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Scifi fans beware,"I'm a sci-fi fan and its been a drought for us on original science-based fiction. Everything is a remake, based on a book or comic or a sequel. So it was with that objective in mind, I was eager to see the ""The Happening"". The premise of this movie had the makings of a top notch science-based movie. Leaving the theater, I am left asking what happened? This was not sci-fi, as the trailers lead me to believe, in even the most liberal use of the genre categorization IMO. Sci-fi fans will be much let down and should not see this movie looking for that element to be developed.So its not sci-fi, it could still be a good movie right? Well unfortunately it is not. The trailers also made this movie look a bit like Signs, which many people hated but I liked. Signs is all I'm going to say about Shyamalan, I'm not going to get into the ""high-brow"" critiquing of the director or whatever. I never care about any of that, for me a movie is about entertainment and if its worth my time. For many of you, whether a movie is worth your money is probably also significant (since you pay so much for movies). This movie is not worth your time or money. It wasn't even worth the >US$3 I paid to see it in THX, DLP, DTS, reserved seating, etc and it definitely wasn't worth my time.Movies, for me, are about story and how well that story is told. Effects, actors and the rest are all elements of telling the story and how they do is ultimately how well the story is told. The only time I was actually into this movie was in the beginning. I actually thought this would be a great movie at that point, but after around 10 minutes or so, that was it. It was then an hour and a couple dozen or so minutes of nothing. I wasn't drawn into the story, there was no air of suspense or tension, there was nothing. I know the approximate time marks because I checked my watch a half dozen times during this movie. I was so disengaged that I suggested to my girlfriend we sneak into the theater's bathroom for some actual entertainment, but she declined :(.I have to compare this movie a bit to Signs, because that was what I went in thinking this movie would be like. So if you find my review totally off, then this is where the disconnect would be, but I don't believe I am anywhere off base here, as my girlfriend (who I saw the movie with) totally agrees with me. While many people didn't like Signs, I found that it created a nice atmosphere of tension with climaxes and plot elements which kept me involved and engaged. That was totally lacking in this movie. It was more like a superficial attempt to do that, using those jump out and say ""boo"" elements which are so trite and overused, but lacking anything that set the sage to have those ""boo"" moments mean something.I felt that Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel were underwhelming. Knowing Wahlberg's ability I almost can't help but blame other people. However, even with a bad script or poor direction I expected more from Wahlberg. This is one of those bad movies where you expect someone like John Leguizamo to be able to steal the show. Sadly, even he was flat and his character's role was slightly confusing. I wouldn't be surprised if Leguizamo's acting was hampered by his own difficulty with understanding his role in the story.Instead of a 0, this got a 3 from me because there was some good. The first 10-20 minutes were interesting, there were some really beautiful shots and there was nice use of elemental effects. Nothing worth your time or money though, I wouldn't even recommend this as a rental, it was that bad.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

As movie begins in Central Park, NY people start killing themselves. This premise of mass suicide could have been handled in different ways.But, Shyamalan is not trying to weave an awe inspiring story, but provide you with an environment of devastation and make you interact with such an environment. The movie does make a lot of mistakes. Certain dialogues seem oddly familiar. The humour is at times contrived but, there are magical moments in the movie that reminds us how good Shyamalan is. After disappointing in "" the village"", and ""lady in the water"", ""The Happening"" signals the return to form of Shyamalan. Not among his best works, but one of his matured works.

Terribly funny,"I rewatched this for the first time in almost a decade. However, many years on, I still think The Happening is a spectacular failure that only has value if you watch it for the purpose of laughing at it. It is just shockingly inept and ridiculous as a horror movie, and the one defence of it (that it's a throwback to cheesy 1950s sci-fi/horror movies) I don't think holds up at all. Something like Mars Attacks feels like a throwback to that kind of movie. I genuinely don't think The Happening feels self-aware enough to be credible as intentionally funny. I think Shyamalan just dropped the ball in an unintentionally spectacular fashion.I tried to give it a chance on a rewatch with fresh eyes, but I still feel as though it's a tragically inept horror movie that's trying to be genuinely creepy, with its premise about deadly toxins in the air that are influencing people to take their lives. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is atrocious, and I don't think I can take anyone who says otherwise seriously (Shyamalan is honestly kind of a bad writer when it comes to most of his output, with comically terrible dialogue in many of his movies, and that's a hill I'll die on).If you like laughing at inept movies, The Happening is one of the best of the past couple of decades. If you want an actual scary movie, I'd say stay far away from this one, and it's probably Shyamalan's worst, at the end of the day.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This movie isn't perfect, but it's entertaining, worth a viewing and definitely under appreciated","The Happening (2008) is an M. Night Shyamalan gem that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a Philadelphia teacher who sees a viral outbreak on television that causes people to kill themselves. He tries to get his family out of the area and to safety. Complicating matters is that he and his wife haven't been on good terms and may be getting a divorce if life as we know it continues. As they plan their escape they start identifying theories on what's happening and why. Could the Earth finally be sick of the human race and trying to escape is a waste of time?As previously referenced this picture is directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Sixth Sense) and stars Mark Wahlberg (The Departed), Zooey Deschanel (500 Days of Summer), John Leguizamo (Spawn), Betty Buckley (Carrie), Jeremy Strong (Succession), Alan Ruck (Succession) and Kristen Connolly (The Cabin in the Woods).I may be in the minority but I really enjoyed this concept and how it was executed. I always have since the first time I saw this picture. The opening scene in the park is great and sets off the circumstances well as does the construction site sequence. There are lots of random acts of violence and decent gore that made this enjoyable and intense. The Lion scene, the old lady at the house, the porch sequence, all outstanding. The virus in the air and seeing people react to it was interesting the entire picture. Wahlberg also delivered his character to perfection.Overall, this movie isn't perfect, but it's entertaining, worth a viewing and definitely under appreciated.

wow.,"This is the first film I have ever commented on, because usually I just read them, but this one definitely deserved my time- not in a good way. First, let me say that I consider the Sixth Sense one of the best horror films of all time, and I definitely love many of his films, and I I will give him a break on Signs and The Village. But this movie was M. Night Shyamalan worse work ever. And Im not over exaggerating.I was very excited to see The Happening, the previews looked good and I was longing to see a good horror film, but what I got was an empty theatre and me and my friend laughing the entire movie. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard, for a while I thought this movie might be a joke or something. The plot was stupid, the acting was horrible, nothing made sense, and the film was loaded with pointless characters that said a few random lines. I don't have one positive thing to say about it, I walked out of the theatre upset and angry.This R rated film should have been rated PG-13, it should not have been rushed, and in all honesty, it should not have been made.And if you like Mark Wahlburg-don't see it. ( Aside from his horrible acting, and I love Mark Wahlburg, watching him talk to a tree just completely ruined him for me.)

What the hell is this?,"After the soaring success and near hysteria over ""The Sixth Sense"", a hysteria I didn't think it worthy of I might add, M. Night Shyamalan has failed to achieve the same level of success with subsequent efforts. I think it fair to say, however, that with each one he has gradually succeeded in becoming one of the most frustrating directors in the history of cinema. His initial ideas aren't at all bad (on the contrary, the ideas for his films tend to be rather compelling), but I have become rather accustomed to the fact that he nearly always drops the ball, the only variable from one film to the next being when this is going to happen. I say nearly, because in fairness ""Signs"" was a pretty well-crafted, gripping piece of work, albeit with a rather tenuous conclusion.It turns out, with ""The Happening"", the ball is dropped rather quickly, and never really gets picked up again. It opens well enough, the first five minutes throwing us straight into the bizarre events, and fully achieves the intended audience reaction of, ""What is going on?"" Then we're back to that frustration, with our attention very quickly being drawn to other issues, like the misjudged pacing, the 'made for television"" shooting style, the clunky dialogue that is often nothing more than plot exposition, and the pastiche performances that appear to have actually been directed to be as hammy and obvious as possible, because you don't get this level of awful by accident.Even if an actor isn't particularly great, it takes a special talent to draw a performance from them that is as plastic as the plant they end up talking to. Mark Wahlberg is a perfectly competent actor; he won't be winning any ""Best Actor"" Oscars anytime soon, but it is fair to say he serves his purpose in a film, so you have to wonder how on earth it is that every line he delivers is stilted and unreal. At first I wondered if it was his discomfort with the material, but quickly realised this phenomenon applied to pretty much the entire cast; actors you recognise as good at what they do, looking completely out of their depth, a very strange experience.A big issue I very quickly had with ""The Happening"" was the nasty sense I got of being patronised, and it even reached a point where I genuinely wondered if Shyamalan had decided with this film to do nothing more than make fun of his audience. As is nearly always the case, he develops ideas far above his station, and his view of himself as a visionary and hugely clever director gets the better of him. The problem being that this time, I suspect even he got lost in the ideas. With plot points and explanations (or lack thereof) being contradictory, it begins to feel as though he really never knew how he was going to resolve what he had set up in the first place, and so resorted to making it up as he went along. He ends up relying on the sound-bite that ""we'll never really know everything"", and expects that to be an acceptable coat hook on which to hang any unaddressed issue. This film does not give license for that, and the result is that he simply loses your trust.So was there anything I liked? As I say, the premise is good, and the score works as best as it can with such an awful set of images. Note to director: Attempting to personify the wind with 'dramatic' shots of fields is not innovative, it's just stupid! After films like ""Unbreakable"", ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"", all of which hit a different level of failure, you would think he would begin to accept he is simply an ""ideas man"", eat some humble pie, and pass all future thoughts on to somebody who can actually turn his ideas, which are more often than not perfectly fine unto themselves, into good pieces of cinema. Of course he doesn't! Instead, we get ""The Happening"", with Shyamalan once again doing everything (writing, producing and directing), and once again messing it up very badly! Better luck next time.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The one-hit wonder thuds out another one.,"The Sixth Sense was a fine movie, a truly great addition to the horror/supernatural genre that has so few really good movies (at least in proportion to the garbage). This movie is a waste of very expensive celluloid and I was amazed that Ebert cut it so much slack.1. The underlying message is a simple minded, heavy handed green preachment. I am a person who regards humanity as the metastasized cancer of the biosphere so I am not reacting to that message as some sort of knee-jerk dominionist corporate booster. If only the environment could defend itself so purposefully. In any case it is not a good enough pay-off to justify sitting through 80 minutes or so of contrived ""suspense"", mediocre, at best, writing, and all the over-acting.2. The so-called suspense strikes me as so much padding to a thin short story that might merit an appearance in a magazine or anthology. In essence it is a greened-up knock off of du Maurier's ""The Birds"" with plants instead of birds, padded out with horror sequences reminiscent of one of the bad Stephen King movies (e.g. Maximum Overdrive).3. I felt sorry for the actors straining to emote out the frail gossamer of this story line. All criticism of the performances should be laid at the door of the director. If any of these actors are favorites of yours, I recommend self-induced amnesia.4. It is a wonder that anyone interested in either art or commerce still funds this director's so-called projects after Lady in the Water, and more so after this turkey.5. I am grateful that the offense was not compounded by a heavy dose of quirky ""artistic"" camera work as well. It is a perfectly good looking movie, what a decent budget and hiring the right people will get you nearly every time.M. Night Shyamalan remains, in my opinion, a confirmed one-hit wonder. If audiences and his backers are fortunate, he might someday become a two-hit wonder. Time is running out for him to move up to legend from mere cult in danger of becoming camp.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Schlocky fun,"Kind of like The Village, I'm actually surprised of how much I actually enjoyed watching The Happening. Granted, it's not a good movie, but it has this B-movie charm to it, sort of like an ecologist version of an Ed Wood movie. As many have said, the acting and dialogue is extremely stilted and forced, but for some reason it doesn't annoy me as much as it did in films like Lady in the Water or Signs. I think a lot of it comes to the fact that this film is one of Shyamalan's shortest, at a comfortable 91 minutes, meaning that it really doesn't waste too much time with setting up the premise and moves by pretty quickly as well.The montages of people nonchalantly killing themselves in horrific ways is something I will praise, particularly with the guy just letting himself getting eaten by lions, the old woman at the end of the film smashing her head into the windows, jamming glass into her face, or the one-take sequence of people each using the same gun to shoot themselves in the head. The R rating benefits these kills massively, as this is probably the most overtly violent and bloody Shyamalan film I've seen.James Newton Howard once again crushes it with the score, no matter how vastly wide in quality Shyamalan films have ranged during this journey, his scores are always a high point for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well... That Happened,"The Happening is an M. Night Shyamalan film. Once upon a time that was a certificate of authenticity proving you were about to consume a good quality product. And as of late, it seems to be heading that way again. But The Happening came in the lull of his career. It begins with solid premise: everyone starts suddenly killing themselves for an unknown reason (not a spoiler, this is established immediately). But then it starts to drop off. And once the twist was revealed, only half way through the film, the plot became borderline ridiculous. Coupled with some particular bad acting scenes, this film was truly one of the films of all time.2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

How Many More Movies Could M. Night Fit In This P.O.S.?,"Maximum Overdrive, War of the Worlds, The Stand, Invasion of the Body Snatchers.....The list goes on and on.Not only does SHAMalan steal plot lines from all these movies, and more, he does so in such a horrible way. This is a guy who got lucky with what turned out to be the first in a long line of thrillers with a massive, jump-out-of-your-seat twist in the end. If The Sixth Sense had come out, say after Nicole Kidman's, far more superior, The Others, M.(good)Night's career would have died before it started.It took five more attempts to finally prove to world that this hack is nothing more than a b-movie writer/director and he should never be allow to be in charge of another film again.This is one of those movies whose trailers far out perform the whole film. Mark Wahlberg is one of those actors who Hollywood continues to throw in our faces while trying to make him a leading man. He is a C- supporting actor...at best.The rest of the cast is horrible as well. If this film had a laugh track, it would have been a very entertaining romp.

For those with imaginations... and attention spans.,"I'm surprised this movie is getting as many bad reviews as it appears to be getting... but the occasional good review is very telling, especially Ebert's. I'd recommend reading his review because in my opinion he 'got it', and no need to repeat his observations here.As usual, MNS comes up with a thinking-man's view of what exactly is disconcertingly eerie and/or profoundly horrible... that which you can't really immediately understand... and even more telling, that which is beyond controlling.But if your imagination is such that the sudden downfall of society doesn't shock after the first random suicide of a person sitting next to you, or your attention span is such that watching a normally calming pan across a countryside turn into something deeply ominous for more than a few frames bores you, then this won't be a movie to your taste.Within the microcosms created by MNS in his films, I never walked away with a feeling of having to suspend an untoward amount of disbelief... that seems to be a major complaint of many who are panning this movie, but I don't see it. I can only chalk it up to the 'cynical chic' of the South Park generation... those for whom empathy is an alien concept, to whom ennui is epitomized by screen images which don't provide visual bombardments even few seconds, and by whom mean-spirited irreverence is demanded in lieu of actual humorous or heartfelt dialog.If the dialog seems simplistic, well, look a bit deeper and realize exactly what 'regular folk' might say or do if the events of this Happening actually were occurring... this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends... not with the bang of snappy repartee or quotable sound-bytes, but with the whimper of incredulity and dread.Complaining about the acting or dialog in The Happening is like complaining about the 'jumpy camera work' in Cloverfield. In short, anyone who just doesn't ""get it"" to that extent really shouldn't be posting their opinions on movies.Finding the truly human and poignant moments in the outwardly mundane yet intrinsically significant details of his landscapes and characters is one of MNS's great gifts, and he hits the mark here too.The cinematography was superb, the actors all hit their strides, the story was compelling, the occasional odd character, visual pun, and good-natured joke worked well... no complaints on that score.I even went in expecting to be underwhelmed by the acting of the two lead characters, but came out pleasantly surprised.But then again, I loved The Village, and found many good things about The Lady In The Water... so I guess mine will remain the minority opinion.But if you have admired MNS's previous work, you will enjoy this film as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The score made the movie,"I love M. Night Shyamalan. He's a brilliant writer/director and I've been so impressed with his unique ideas or twists on previously attempted genres. This movie, however, I didn't really enjoy. Though, it is not for the same reasons as most other reviewers have stated.The movie delivered no one-liners, no stand up acting from any particular actor/actress, and no real climax. Those are the good things. It felt real. The characters reacted in a very human way, no heroes, the lines didn't feel scripted. It felt as though the person sitting next to me would react the same way. Amazingly realistic. Almost too realistic. But, MNS has always been one to push the boundaries.What I did not like was MNS's finding his way into the box of the environmentalist. Because of the huge ""green"" push and global warming phenomenon, we've seen a large rush of that in Hollywood. I thought MNS was better than that. Though the thoughts are underlying and he does a fantastic job of presenting the issue in a different light, we still see the ""humans as pests"" ideas and the overpopulation theories at work. I don't like the boxed up Shyamalan. Nothing against environmentalist but we've heard and seen enough of it. Keep it out of my thrillers.The best part of the whole movie and probably the biggest reason to see it is the score. Brilliant. Simply stunning. The music made the movie. Had the score not been as wonderful, the movie would not be worth seeing.Overall 7/10 in my book. But the score was the aspect that moved it from a 5 to a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What Happened?,"In this horrible global warming and nature spellbound movie, Mark Wahlberg (Elliot ),Zooey Deschanel (Alma), John Leguizamo (Julian ) and Ashlyn Sanchez (Jess); are survivors of an unknown attack that is said to have started in New York 's Central Park. The unknown threat is plaguing the planet with confusion and the current population is no longer thriving in numbers. They are trying to make it to the place that is not experiencing whatever is happening. The basic theme is the human population is being threatened by an unknown source and only the remaining population will be able to stop what is happening.Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a teacher who should be a student of acting with this boyishly played role. His friend Julian (John Leguizamo) has joined Elliot with his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) in what is happening. Leguizamo must have been confused in the reading of the script, he is just not one to take serious for helping mankind. Elliot has baggage of his disconnected girlfriend Alma (Zooey Deschanel) who is tagging along and is of little help with what is happening.This horrible rendition of global threats and population predisposition has no bar under the movie I AM Legend , in which we (the audience) at least had a hold of what happened. The dark comedy that Mark Wahlberg did not display control over got lost in a show tune at the door. Not to mention his bad acting. There are few scenes that have a tacky approach to what was happening in the minds of the reaming population that is still in the dark about what happened. The misuse and over usage of the word ""happening"" could have just been edited out entirely. Seriously the look on Elliot's face when calming his friend Julian down made me feel like I was going to hear the director say ""cut"". I do not know what's happening with that.The location of the natural surroundings added a personal feel to the soon to be dollar movie. The angles of the camera gave the sense that the entire population was in a panic and at risk with what was happening.The viewing of this movie can be prevented. If you want to know what is happening do not bother watching the movie The Happening. At the end of it you will find yourself asking the same question from the beginning.

Mark Wahlberg and cast are totally believable innocents, so much so that you really care about their almost-naive characters.It's definitely the most Hitchcock-like of Night's efforts to date (""The Birds"" comes to mind).

Laughably poor movie,"The Happening is by far Shamylan's WORST. I mean it's just so laughably terrible and hopelessly dull. It's void of any kind of quality filmmaking or anything that's remotely interesting.

Because their performances either look like just a bad acting from a TV horror movie or purposefully bad from an SNL skit. And even if this movie was trying to be bad on purpose in order to be comical, it would still fail miserably. There is just nothing at all of any value in this movie. I mean there's just nothing good about, it there's absolutely no reason for you to watch this movie. Scene by scene by scene it just seems to get progressively worse. A lot of times, you hope that just the beginning of the movie is bad and that as it progresses, it will get better. Well save your hopes for another day, because there is no point in hoping for that with this film. The plot actually interested in me and I thought that it would be intriguing.

'Wish 'The Happening' Never Happened,"I've never been much of a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's films. 'His debut film 'The Sixth Sense' was a competent effort. 'Signs' started off interestingly as the focus was more on the psychological aspect until Shyamalan presents the aliens at which point it becomes just another silly man versus alien flick. Then there was the horrendous 'Lady in the Water' and now 'The Happening' is just as bad if not worse. The only thing that makes 'Lady in Water' better is Bryce Dallas Howard and Paul Giamatti's acting. The same cannot be said about the performances in 'The Happening'. Mark Wahlberg's animated expressions look forced. I can see that he's trying to do something different but he's picked the wrong movie. Zooey Deschanel, is far from impressive. She looks confused and uninterested most of the time. Then again, with such dreadful writing, who wouldn't be. John Leguizamo does the best he can with a tiny part. The execution is average. It's not anything one hasn't seen before. Shyamalan grossly fails both as writer and director. The script might as well have been written by a six year old. I guess one good thing about this film is the eye-candy countryside setting. As pretentious as the 'The Happening' is, I found it to be unintentionally funny for the most part. It can be categorized as a so-bad-it's-good-type movie.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A quality effort.,"At the whim of a friend I went in to seeing ""The Happening"" knowing absolutely nothing about it. No preview. No reviews. All I knew was that Marky Mark was in it (whom I love) and M. Night Shyamalan directed it. I have steered clear of Shyamalan's work since Unbreakable despite the fact that there is a lot about him I like including his Hitchcockian pretensions, and his leanings towards suspense and horror. However, his films following The Sixth Sense appear to lack the intensity and intelligence of his brilliant debut.Whilst ""The Happening"" is far from perfect it is a minor return to form, with its clever story and classy direction. The plot is extremely ambitious with a villain that is largely unseen and unknown. However the tension is well maintained throughout and there are a number of genuinely creepy moments. Shyamalan struggles to keep the plot moving at some points opting out for cheap news stories as plot exposition rather than using the characters to advance the story.The film is terribly cast with Wahlberg and Leguizamo playing science and math teachers respectively. However, Wahlberg in particular settles more and more into the role as the movie unravels.Interestingly, Shyamalan doesn't offer his regular brand of shock twist endings here, opting to leave a lot unexplained. This was both refreshing and annoying as it meant we were spared a lackluster ending but were left with one that seemed somewhat empty.Overall, an intense if not flawed thriller on par with Frank Darabont's ""The Mist"".",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the worst films I've seen,"I doubt anyone will read this. So much has been written before. I just feel compelled to say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies. First of all, Mark Wahlberg's acting isn't good. Neither is Zoey Daschanel's. Don't even know if I spelled that right & don't care. The characters aren't likable or interesting at all. None of them. Then, Betty Buckley comes up. Betty Buckley?! Why would anyone cast her? Not that she's a bad actress but I don't see her in this at all. Her character is creepier than whatever is blowing through the trees.

A Nutshell Review: The Happening,"To me, this is not a movie about finding out what the issue at hand is, or trying to crack the mystery behind the phenomenon, or even about figuring out what the twist, if any, would be. It's a story about communication, how we, in today's context, are so reliant on mass media delivering every bit of incident deemed newsworthy, and providing that amped up ""insights"" to send us to paranoia. If you notice of late, we have been bombarded with crisis after crisis, or could it really be instead, the flavour of the moment that the mass media drums up? Avian Flu? Food Crisis? Fuel Crisis? Business Continuity? Terrorism? The list goes on, with news editors determining what to drum up, and where to send everyone crying out that the sky is falling. The Happening does just that, as we see newsflash after newsflash providing speculation after speculation that everyone listens, and accedes to.But it's not just the mass media alone, but the story also puts the spotlight on how reliant we are on our mobile devices, so much so that they actually have already become second nature to us. If we want to talk to someone, we pick up the phone, or we text the person. Gone is the value of face to face communications, as we talk to one another through an electronic device and medium. And we all know what happens to these wireless gadgets come a crisis, when base stations get knocked out, and we feel incapacitated, and so alone. And the rare occasion when our little island experiences unexpected power brownouts and we lose connectivity, we go into fits and strangely enough, feel at a loss at what to do next?We are creatures who must talk to one another, otherwise I guess we'll go insane, and not everyone's cut out to be a hermit living alone, making that informed decision choosing to be cut off from the outside world and be self-sufficient. Perhaps that's why isolation has been designed as punishment, and one probably might go a little bit cranky, losing social skills. Just like how the prominent old lady in The Happening become overly suspicious of every wee thing that doesn't go her way.Shyamalan gave us probably the weakest protagonist in his tales to date. We are familiar with Mark Wahlberg in his many alpha-male action roles, like those in The Italian Job remake, or his sharpshooter Sniper. Here, his Elliot is a school science teacher who's the most clueless amongst all clueless characters in Shyamalan's fictional worlds. He absolutely, like the audience, has no idea what's going on, has no plan, and doesn't hesitate to tell everyone just that, exhibiting some classic deer-caught-in-the-headlights look with wide eyes and flared nostrils. Even Keanu Reeves pale in comparison to what Wahlberg managed to do here. Zooey Deschanel's Alma too plays Elliot's just as clueless wife, only that she's harbouring a secret that you can decipher the minute it gets suggested on screen. Throughout the movie, husband and wife has to sort of issues as the clock ticks down to doomsday, and just like The Incredible Hulk, this little love story slowly grew in importance.And to pre-empt those who would dislike the movie, you're likely to find fault with the distinct lack of scares - OK, there's really one jump-from-your-seat moment, and various other scenes with an unflinching camera in the many faces of death - and the exclamation of ""you mean that's it?"" The build up is masterfully done, though the ending might be a little bit abrupt and I suspect there might be some cutting of corners which might find their way to the DVD. Forget the fact that The Happening had to undergo some massive rewrites by Shyamalan for it to be accepted by the studios. Forget that this movie contains elements of suggestion that it's eco-warfare and Mother Nature is fighting back with results as significant as that we've already seen and experienced, with unbearable temperatures and disasters of large magnitudes. Like movies such as The Mist, while it's about the great unknown, it also serves as a warning that one day, just one day, we might be faced with questions we have no answers to, and to compound the problem, we're no longer collaborating and communicating effectively to work toward a solution. And that is a scary thought indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not Lady in the Water,"OK people I UNDERSTAND. Lady in the water was definitely the worst movie of all time without any doubt. It would be absolutely fair to hold a massive grudge against m.night for that POC.However, The Happening was a completely different thing. Now it is a little out of the ordinary- many people have commented about the acting. The way I saw it was that M.night Was trying to show characters who were a little awkward and perhaps ordinary, without the smooth as hell Hollywood dialogue we're used to. Give the movie a chance.

The two college boys who get shot act completely out of character, and completely out of common sense. How and why do you bother trying to run from the wind? Why is the wind so selective all of a sudden? Small groups? Small groups???? Come on! Mark Wahlberg has carved out a good career and was great in The Departed, but here he is shown up as being as wooden as a fence post. And Zooey's character was just ridiculous - why does she have to explain her bog standard character foibles to everyone she meets? The only redeeming feature of the movie was John Leguizamo's performance, doing the best with what was in front of him. How Shyamalan is getting mainstream release is no doubt a mystery of his contract.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The final breath of a filmmaker who was once quite brilliant.,"The year is 1999, a year of disappointments Anna and the King failed to do the original justice, the Blair Hype Project was well over-hyped and Sleepy Hollow seemed to be the start of the decline of Tim Burtons Career. So it's a wonderful feeling for a young critic to walk into a cinema and watch h a newcomer make a name for himself with the ultra scary The Sixth Sense. A year after that he gave us the rather brilliant Unbreakable followed by Signs witch was two thirds brilliant. The Village needed a little more work but even at that it was a decent piece of work.It seems his decline in greatness has been rather abrupt. 11 August 2006 the eagerly awaited new movie from master director holds our anticipation in a tight grasp only to disappoint. Little did we know that his follow up movie would be even more disastrous. A tale that follows the imminent destruction on mankind, a film so poorly made that at one point (look out for this) while Elliot is talking to Josh in the modal home you can see the microphone hovering above them. Such a sloppy effort from the so called master director. With on/off pacing, a trademark twist that's barely a twist and a plot that shames that of prom night. The Happening is a real disaster.So a good place to start for this review would be to find out just what the hell is happening right? Wrong! The plot is the main reason this film stumbles.What's happening? It's a good question, and one that's asked by at least 10 characters, ensuring viewers will remember the title however hard they try to forget the movie. Is it a terrorist attack? Signs 2, perhaps? No, wait Can it be linked to the missing bees that Mark Wahlberg's unlikely science teacher was banging on about in class? Or is it the most ridiculous scenario imaginable, a concept so daft an eight-year-old child would dismiss it before settling on ""And then he woke up and it was all a dream""?Unfortunately it's the latter, meaning belief is not so much suspended as rudely upended. And if that doesn't do it  trust us, it will  there's the risible dialogue (""Oh no"" gasps a permanently bamboozled Wahlberg, Bill & Ted-style, when a companion blows their brains out), the wooden acting and the most inane set-piece you'll see this, or any other, year: our heroes attempting to outrun the wind.Shyamalan, then, has lost his way. The first misstep came in the last 10 minutes of the otherwise excellent Signs and the stumbles have become more and more pronounced. Yet he is a born filmmaker, capable of conjuring choking tension from a high-angled shot of a girl on a swing, a bank of rolling clouds.My Final Verdict? Avoid at all costs. The trailer might look tempting but truth is there isn't much happening in the happening. As much as i hate to admit it, this will be the directors last film. The last nail in the coffin if you will of his career. As for Wahlberg he could do a hell of a lot better. Not worth checking out in all. Sixth nonsense.

True, this film lags in terms of plot & I've seen better acting.

Buy some Popcorn and Enjoy,"I must say the thing I enjoy about M. Night's films are, they are different, yet entertaining in an interesting way. They cause the viewer to leave the theater and think and discuss the point, message, or moral of the story. Although that may irritate some, for others, it's a fresh change of pace on the Silver Screen. Some just want to be entertained by a movie without a philosophy the film may carry.With this in mind; ""The Happening,"" is the same way. One can't go into the theater and expect to see what they are used to seeing. Plan on something different, keep an open mind, and catch the vision of this amazing movie maker.By taking a step out of the normal to make the film ""R"" rated, it was for a smart purpose in revealing the story. It starts off really creating an impression on the viewer about ""what is happening?"" The pace of this film is somewhat quick yet occasionally it does get odd. Overall the film as a whole is a success in my opinion, it delivers some scare, some intensity,some justifiable gore, wrapped around a story at heart.My suggestion for one who wants to see this movie is, just go and enjoy. Don't be tempted like many others by comparing his films to the ""Sixth Sense."" This movie is not, ""The Sixth Sense2."" it's ""The Happening."" It does gives some intense scares, and is supported by a powerful musical Score. Another suggestion is, if you don't like his other films, don't bother with this one, and save your money because it is from the unique, Shyamalan, you know what to expect.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A pleasant surprise,"I must say that I am not a huge fan of M. Night, and have thought his movies to range from poor to mediocre. As I sat down to watch this film I told my friend: ""I am 100% sure this film is going to be horrible"". I was wrong. I thought it was an engrossing film about normal people stuck in unusual circumstances. The characters had a certain amount of the depth (only a certain amount), and were more interesting than your usual run of the mill Hollywood blockbuster characters. This isn't really a film with cheap thrills. You're not going to get cheap scares, which is what I think most people are going to be expecting. What is going to let this film down is the advertising. I think you average below average intelligence, movie goer is gonna expect something else. An action movie, or something, but this is just a story about people. I thought the script was a pretty good piece of hand work. Relatively tight and interesting. I found it to have an element of being able to put yourself in these people's shoes. Something I had more difficulty doing in, say, Cloverfield. These characters have to make decisions about their loved ones. They have to face up to risking their own lives for those they care about the most. Cloverfield is a pretty similar movie to this on, in certain aspects. I didn't really relate to its characters, and found it abysmal. I related to these people, and that kept my interest going, because this is very much a character driven film. Perhaps if I'd gone in with expectations of something grand, I'd have been disappointed. There is nothing grand about the scale of this film. I think it is M. Night's best so far, but others might disagree, as I heard some grumbles leaving the theatre. This film is far from perfect. Whalberg's performance is pretty dire. But, I think he's usually pretty dire, if not given a strong actor's director. Also, the script is weak in some areas despite being rather tight. I think this film might flop, just because of its marketing and people's pre-conceived notions. Although it doesn't deserve to.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So bad it's good! A 1 and a 10 simultaneously!,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" is an extraordinarily bad film. It's the kind of movie which begins with some small promise - in a couple of bizarre scenes of mass-suicide that might make John Carpenter proud - and then drops the ball with one hilariously discordant tonal-shift after another, leaving us to wonder: ""What was the purpose here? What kind of film did Shyamalan think he was making? Has he really been this BAD all along? How did this movie HAPPEN? And why is it still HAPPENING?""Well, with the push of a button, you may opt out of your film-watching experience.But I must confess: I have watched this movie twice, and both times I found it so hilarious that my sides ached with laughter.No, I don't think this film is ""supposed"" to be particularly funny. It is purportedly an apocalyptic thriller. And it does seem to try to live up to that promise - even earning Shyamalan's first R-rating by way of some gory moments, as if to indicate its serious intent.But the script is so silly, the dialogue so inexplicably bizarre, the acting so hilariously bad, and the concept so misguided, that the overall effect is one of unintended comedy.We sometimes say that a film is ""so bad it's good."" I think ""The Happening"" is a prime example of that kind of film. It is truly, truly bad, and all the better for it - regardless of the filmmakers' intent.If you can enjoy laughing at a film as ridiculous as this one, then I invite you to appreciate - for starters - how Mark Wahlberg spends the entire film making confused puppy-dog faces, and speaking like he's a frightened father trying not to scare his kids. (His character does not have children, but every character in every Shyamalan film behaves like a child, so I guess this is par for the course.) Also: Is there any reason why his every line-reading must sound like he's asking a question?Just when you think a performance can't seem more lost or clueless than Wahlberg's, Zooey Deschanel shows up as his wife, to match him. She is the ""Huh?"" to Wahlberg's ""What?,"" and it is that dramatic continuum which carries, and encompasses, the entire film.It really doesn't seem like anyone involved in this film understood what was going on here, and it's not hard to imagine Wahlberg and Deschanel having frantic but hushed conversations between takes:""Surely this movie isn't really this bad, right?""""Huh?""""I mean, who would've thought that 'The Sixth Sense' was a fluke?""""What?""""I think I hear the sound of a toilet flushing. That's not our careers, is it?""""I don't know?""But perhaps their cluelessness is understandable, given some of the bizarre dialogue Shyamalan provides the supporting characters. In one scene, as everyone is in a frantic life-or-death rush to get out of town, the entire film screeches to a halt so that one supporting character can pontificate at length upon the pleasing qualities of the hot-dog.""I'll bring some hot-dogs!"" he says, as if excited to be packing for a weekend campout. ""Do you like hot-dogs? I love hot-dogs! They've got a pleasing shape, they're packed with protein. I think hot-dogs get a bad rap.""There's no evidence that this character is supposed to be brain-damaged. He's merely as ridiculous as every other character in this bizarre film.Oh, the delirious joys of this film. I would love to spoil them for you, but then you wouldn't be able to discover for yourself Wahlberg's heartfelt plea for a potted plant not to kill his family (I'm not joking), or the multiple shots of characters ""running from the wind,"" (still not joking), or the film's ridiculous answer to its central mystery.I'd say that you can't make this stuff up - but hey, somebody actually did! These were choices. Choices that somebody actually made. Choices that somebody put into a movie, and released.Anyway, M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" is an uncommonly bad movie, full of so many bizarre and inexplicable decisions that it's hard to comprehend how anyone ever greenlighted it. Nevertheless, if you enjoy watching a movie that's so bad it's good, you might find that this one is both a 1 and a 10, simultaneously!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incredible film,"Like literally, I can't believe it. I can't give it more than 5 stars, cause it's a bad movie, but I also can't give it less than 5 stars, since it's the best movie ever. On one hand, there is no chance M. Night made it as a joke. On the other hand, introducing exhibit A: the movie itself. No way that was an accident, the film is hysterical.People have heavily criticised the casting of Mark Wahlberg and his performance, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Not only is he a perfect choice, he is the only choice. If you had for example Brad Pitt, reprising his role from something like World War Z, the movie would have been painfully boring. Marky Mark simply elevates it to heights never reached before.The Happening has a very strong opening and then, after 6 minutes, it suddenly cuts to Mark Wahlberg doing a high pitched, calm and slightly confused voice, and you go ""whaaaaAAAAAaaaat¿"". Its accompanied by insane dialog, it never stops and it's the best thing ever. At some point a kid gets shot in the face and it's still so funny. It's probably one of the unintentionally funniest movies ever, but it also feels very intentional, the whole thing is a mystery to me.Also what's up with my boy Mark catching all the flak? Even if you watch the film as a serious thriller, which... I mean... good luck, he is terrible, yet far from the worse. Jeremy Strong plays for a bit and is so bad, and Zooey Deschanel gives unironically one of the worst performances I have ever seen in my life. It's not even funny how horrible she is.Overall, 1/10 best movie ever, but for real now, I strongly recommend it. Probably much better with friends, but even on my own I had a blast.

Boring to the extreme,"So we have a premise where a mysterious disease is spreading throughout the world and we start to follow a group of survivors as they try to save themselves from the spreading destruction. Fair enough, it's another disaster movie with close calls, intense escape situations and general panic and mania amongst mankind. I've seen some good example of this and I'm open to seeing another one.Unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan has no idea how to direct a film such as this one. The start of the film actually isn't that bad and some of the imagery of people losing their minds is actually very effective and creepy, as it should be. But then the film focuses exclusive on Mark Wahlberg and his group of survivors and it becomes so unbelievably dull to watch. All the tension bleeds out of the movie while we're forced to watch his monotone delivery of lines while he strays between his two basic expression, neither of which isn't that emotive or expressive. And I'm not saying that I Wahlberh can't be entertaining. He's decent enough when he's in an action film or something that requires him to actually do something. But in a movie where the actual threat isn't that visible and most of the film's quality has to come from the actors and their ability to convey the feel of danger, he's not your guy. And unfortunately none of the other actors are good enough to pick up the slack.And then there are the sins of Shyamalan. He spends far too much time following these people as they flee aimlessly from one place to another. The threat itself is poorly established, makes no sense and is kind of silly when you stop to think about it. The problem is that this film takes itself far too seriously. Had it even hinted at the possibility that it had been made with some tongue in cheek, it would have been far more tolerable to watch. It's no surprise that this film has been parodied and mocked to the death.Long story short, this is a bad film. It has no direction, no goals, no aim. It's a poor man's attempt to film a horror film without understanding horror at all. The sooner we forget its existence the better.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Wahlberg, Deschanel & this film stink","Yet another intriguing idea by M. Night Shyamalan that fails.. That doesn't mean all of his films fail as he's made some good ones too, but just as many, if not more, are duds. This one tackles what mankind is doing to the Earth and one possible way for it to strike back. Now, as we all know from a bazillion films there are many ways our planet could rebel against what we do to it, and probably would deserve it, but I don't think the cause will be something as stupid as this. On top of a very questionable scenario, it has two leads, Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel who are both lousy in this, especially her, but John Leguizamo and Betty Buckley do well in smaller roles. It's 2024 and I hadn't seen this since 2008 and was pretty surprised when Jeremy Strong showed up in a goofy kind of role. Might be the highlight of this viewing.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Eh?!!!,I am confused with this film!! The plot is simple and its more than easy to follow but the acting....ermmmm!! I usually love Mark Wahlberg but not in this film. It was acted like it wasn't meant to be serious and he was about to crack a joke. It was like they were spaced out! Anyhow I had to watch it til the end because I just have too. Unless you're extremely bored don't bother watching its a waste of one and half hours of your life. If the acting was better then maybe it would be a fairly decent film. Its cheesy and dull.One compliment I can give this film is it is not predictable.

best post 9/11 disaster film,"This is not just light, silly popcorn fare, as some people would present it. Expect to see something disturbing, something that sets your nerves on end. It may take shocking, unflinching scenes to reach certain people and put them in a state receptive to the speculations planted along the way which allow us to reflect on the mystery of the story's threat and by extension the fact of human influence upon the environment. The tone set and the gradual reveal of each new stage of trouble makes the Twilight Zone premise play as plausible and the inevitability of horror is riveting. After the first coda, there was one yahoo that booed at the screening, but his second noise after the final coda seemed less critical. A misanthrope at the end personifies the worst of community spirit but so much has been woven by the time she turns up that she is clearly part of the film's fabric and thesis. The film should at least appeal to people who like to slow past an accident knowing they may see something awful. Awful but very well done and unflinching. We become our own worst enemies, on more than one level. The film seemed to fly by, as well. I recognized an actor from Clerks in a silent bit role that must have included some dialog when he signed on; it plays as a bit of a distraction for me but it wouldn't register for a non-clerks fan. What we may gain is a sense of loss as each fleeting character is introduced and confronts death. I had thought the movie would be about a mere prank, but it is not. I hope the makers of the proposed remake of the Birds give up when they see The Happening. Maybe not give up on life, but just their own stab at man-versus-nature. The Happening is a keeper, ultimately not as dark in its resolution as The Mist but likely to be appreciated by the same audience.",,Anonymous,Mystery

One simple message at a time,"As a Shyamalan fan I have an almost automatic bias. I love all his films including the infamous Lady in the Water. The reason is that he always brings something unique to the able. I believe what messes up the perception of his films are the way that they are marketed. All of his films are simple dramas covered with a touch of science fiction.With that said I disagree with most critics when they say the first half was the better of the film. The first 20 minutes have cringe worthy dialogue but some cool deaths. Things that detract from this film are some badly rendered sound affects(the gun shots), and the odd score(though it improves at the end.)Now onto the things that are good, I am a drama person and I know where nights coming from. Though I am an atheist I appreciate nights religious and spiritual overtones because there in total context with the situations. Wahlberg is sometimes stiff but he has his moments, especially towards the end. Zooey seems kind of odd but too lovable to hate. But the my favorite person in the film is Leguizamo, who brings a very likable nature to his character and I wish he had been in the rest of the film.This film is a kind of throwback to twilight zone and old school b-movie horror films but it has shyamalans in it everywhere. The throwback redeems the score up to a point though I wish it had been toned down. There are some unique ways people kill themselves. But what I appreciate most is that the situation is a kind of scientific possibility and I think thats what makes the film. Never have grass and trees seemed more threatening then when wind is just blowing.People are gonna hate this film but they are gonna turn to another mind numbing super- hero movie (The Hulk) and love it to death, (Don't get me wrong I wanna see Dark Knight badly, but at least its actually has some roots grounded in reality and suspense). But what I love about Nights films is that they always have a reason to exist, and this one does too.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Oscar winning - likely not, but definitely glad I watched this and I do think there will be a niche of fans that will really enjoy this movie.

not a real 'worst-movie-ever' like Lady in the Water... more like a high-budget/high-on-itself Ed Wood flick,"M. Night Shyamalan, sad to say, was a case of a fluke in Hollywood. This isn't to say that he hasn't had some good moments in movies like Unbreakable and Signs (more-so for the former), but The Sixth Sense, one of the great big wonderkind stories of the 90s has manifested itself with its creator churning out pieces of, frankly, crap upon its unwitting audience. This isn't to say that because his first few hits he wont make more movies- matter of fact he's apparently working on an Avatar picture (not the James Cameron one, the kid-anime one)- but following the Village, which took the ludicrous 'twist' ending to new horrific heights, and Lady in the Water which is, at least to me, a true unmitigated disaster unleashed on to celluloid, The Happening continues the thread of total nonsense in the guise of thoughtful blockbuster stuff.Point of order: The Happening's title first opens up the potential pit-falls for jokes on the title alone (does anyone else not picture a 60s flower-power flick?), and indeed ""something's happening"" or ""it's happened"" or some variation is said enough times to merit a drinking game after it. But then the actual movie, from its opening scenes all the way to the last, are so ridiculous in nearly every step of the way for the same basic reasons that Edward D. Wood Jr's movies are still totally ridiculous failures: give actors a screenplay that is loaded with laughably hackneyed dialog (at one point the Zooey Deschanal character says, and I quote, ""Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that can be invented""), delivered by more or less (usually less) competent actors with straight faces as they are put into a stupid sci-fi premise. In this case a mighty wind of sorts, or rather some chemical coming from the plants that are angry or incensed via nature's wrath or whatever the hell, is attacking the cities and towns of the northeast and the Moore family (Walhberg and Deschanal and daughter) run from it.Yep, that's right, a lot of the movie is just characters running from the wind- with the occasional pit stop for Wahlberg to talk to a plastic plant- and from scene to scene there is just one incredibly laughable inanity after another. To give some very minor credit where it's due, it's not always the fault of the direction; as was the case in the Village there are one or two moments that do reveal some sort of 'vision' in the works, a shot or two that stand out as impressive... and then we get put back into the ""what-the-bleep"" clockwork of this overwrought ""message"" movie that says, apparently, that what we don't know from nature and probably can't know since we can't really trust science will kill us. And all the while Shyamalan almost creates something inadvertently very entertaining; I can imagine the Happening becoming one of those classic bad movies years from now, so entirely dumbfounding with its totally serious-toned acting, dead-pan dialog and awfully staged violence (i.e. lion feeding, lawnmower) that one can't help but find it riotous.Maybe Shyamalan can continue his career that way, who knows? One thing is for certain: the guy is NOT the next Hitchcock or the next Spielberg. He's lucky the wind hasn't knocked him off his feet completely.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"M.

I didn't think this was a bad movie, I mean it's not brilliant but it's worth a look.

Night Shyamalan past reputation and since it's his first rated R movie which don't really need to be rated R.

Real SCI-FI isn't always about special effects.,"So SCI-FI films generally fall into three categories: social and human commentary, spaceships and war, and, shockingly awful. This film is definitely the first. This film, whilst not ground breaking or at the top of its game is still well worth a watch. The emphasis of this film is on how we as humans react to something intangible yet deadly. I think that the film is well written, and really starts to look into what we as humans would do faced with imminent death. Don't get me wrong, there are holes galore in this film, but it still manages to show how the most ordinary of people can rise to the occasion when pushed, and how this would not be in a Chuck Norris kind of way but a much more natural dealing with the situation in the best way they can. Wahlberg and Deschanel give good performances of two people with their own issues that they have to deal with and put aside given the situation they find themselves in. There are other reactions that are very human and as with a lot of human decisions, seem to make no sense save for the person making them. This is one of my favorite aspects of the film, how you sit and watch a person make a decision and say to yourself; ""I'd never do that"". That's the rub though, until faced with a real situation you'll never know how you would react. This film is thought provoking and will leave you with questions about yourself and how you would react. So, not great but a good solid film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Something Different,"I am a big Shymalan fan, The Sixth Sense was well done, and Unbreakable was something different all together with his take on the comic book hero. Signs was a brilliant film, sure there were some parts that were ""quirky"" but it still delivered. The Village was a buffet of great actors and proof that you can make a great movie for an hour and ten minutes. Lady and the Water was a pretty good flick, regardless of others have said, it is one of my favorite fantasy films I have watched since ""The NeverEnding Story"".Now comes The Happening, an apocalyptic film about a family that goes on the run after what is initially reported as supposed terrorist attacks in New York. The first bit of it was very intriguing, it helped build suspense for what was going to happen next. Then came in Mark Walhberg's character, a high school science teacher who starts a open conversation with his class about disappearing honey bees. While I never thought Marky Mark would fit all that well as a ordinary guy in a flick but for the first half hour or so, he pulls it off quite well. But something happened, maybe it was the time schedule, or maybe a combination of both wanting to get this film out the door and the time schedule. The acting for whatever reason seemed to slip gradually as the movie progressed, the visual presentation of the film was still top notch. Then came in the gore, people jumping off roofs or shooting themselves in the face and many others, it begged the question if it was Night's idea alone to push the film to an ""R"" rating. It just didn't seem in place for a director that exploited on showing you so little.There is no twist ending, and I don't expect to ever see another one from another sham flick again. The idea and concept of the movie as a whole was something amazingly different and unique in it's own way, but yet it still rang as another ""we need to watch out for the environment"" flick. You can argue that this film was a less action packed version of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but with better science....I suppose.But in the end, for what it's worth, I still enjoyed the movie, I feel that the message of the movie could have been picked up without the extra violence. It is by far Night's weakest film, but when the Avatar trilogy is done, you can guarantee that I will be at the theaters to watch his next film.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More like The Crappening,"Is M. Night Shyamalan, the director of this flop, the same M. Night Shyamalan who made THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE? You'd be forgiven for thinking that the director of the earlier, classy fare had been replaced by a talentless clone after watching this hugely embarrassing environmental-disaster thriller. It's a film which opens with a handful of breathtaking set-pieces involving mass human madness, before swiftly descending into the kind of silly schtick that even a Sci-Fi Channel producer would think twice before greenlighting.The blame is clearly fixed on Shyamalan's shoulders; he didn't only direct this tripe, but wrote it too. That indicates that the production was a labour of love, but what a misguided one! The script is appallingly bad, full of the kind of unreal dialogue that could only exist in a bad B-movie, and the whole film has a tired, subdued, seen-it-all-before air to it. As for the cast...well, words fail me. Mark Wahlberg is wooden and hopelessly, helplessly, miscast as a science teacher, delivering his lines with a kind of disbelief that he's been caught up in this mess. Zooey Deschanel, who I previously saw in YES MAN (and to be fair she was quite appealing in that) is abhorrently awful, her wide-eyed style of acting more suited to a pantomime than a movie. The only one who gives a decent performance is the reliable John Leguizamo, and he doesn't get a great deal of screen time at all.THE HAPPENING lurches from one minor set-piece to the next, always promising more than it delivers. The plotting is basic and obvious, never less than contrived. Some moments, like when the two boys start going crazy, are so over-the-top and badly done that they become hilarious to watch. So, in the end, that's what this becomes: a so-bad-it's-funny experience, a modern day variant on the likes of ROBOT MONSTER and PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.

Painful at best,"I cant believe I watched the whole thing.This film treats the audience like they are idiots. The plants are getting there revenge? C'mon, if you're going to do that, then remake Day of the Triffids. But you damn well better treat it with the respect it deserves. The plot was so thin I almost missed it as it evaporated in to the air.The whole movie in one sentence: Nature seeks revenge, Marky Mark and hot chick attempt to outrun, will Planet Earth learn the lesson? That's it.The only good thing about it was the Cello score.And let's not forget the token crazy old lady who lives alone in the middle of nowhere, but even she ends up walking backwards. And whats with that? What's the freakin walkin backwards got to do with it? This had rip offs from Psycho to Doctor Who... And thats sad, when you have to rip off Doctor Who.There was nothing there for any of these actors to work with, everything about this movie sucked. Hard.I'm going to watch 'Shutter' now, and i will probably give it 7 out of 10 cause of how bad 'The Happening' was.The Happening. Why not call it 'Oh, the scary Plants come get us Movie'.

"poor, misunderstood The Happening","I went into this movie knowing all the negative reviews it had received, but I watched it anyway because I find general reactions to Shyamalan's films don't always coincide with mine. I liked the Lady in the Water a good deal, and while I thought Unbreakable was overrated, the only one of his film's I would have been better off not watching was The Village.While it's certainly not his best movie (which is, and probably always will be, The Sixth Sense), I liked this from the freaky beginning scenes in which people inexplicably begin killing themselves. There's something wonderfully low key about it all, as though people are too confused to even freak out.That's one of the things some of the other people here have criticized - people not freaking out - and I think that's because people have come to believe movies are reality and if people don't act like people do in other movies then they're acting unrealistically. I wouldn't presume to predict how a situation like this would play out.Another thing that I like is the lack of certainty about what's going on. Many of the reviews here ignore that, just describing this as a man versus plant movie, but that's just one of the suggestions made during the film, and while the movie clearly has an environmental point (and regretfully sheds some ambiguity at the very end), it is not as simple- minded and clear cut as critics suggest. It would be more accurate to call this a man against wind movie, since it is something unknown in the air that is causing this, and I like the fact that the threat is unseen and unknown.The approach is clearly lifted from Hitchcock's The Birds, and it's interesting how everyone was willing to accept the vagaries and poor science of that movie yet lambastes this one.As with Lady in the Water, there is something notably non-Hollywood about the way people react in this film. No one knows what to do, no one knows what's going on, people constantly make bad decisions and there is a distinct lack of heroism. And I like that. In a way, I feel Shyamalan is an indie filmmaker who engenders Hollywood expectations. I feel that many of the film's critics want both this film and Lady in the Water to feature Tom Cruise jumping off of buildings and blowing stuff up.I also quite like the odd minor characters. It's interesting that the most helpful people in the movie are kind of disturbing. I've seen movies where the hero was helped by someone great, or helped by someone who turned out to be dangerous, but I've never the hero helped by people who were just the sort of peculiar people you would inch away from if you didn't need their help.While I don't understand the hatred of the script, I can see some point in complaints about the acting. Zooey is like someone with a piece missing, almost sleepwalking through the film, and the movie either needs her more engaged or needs to make us understand what's behind that. And while Mark seems fine in the lead role, I will admit that I was not strongly invested in the characters. But then, that was also true in The Birds.I think what keeps getting Shyamalan in trouble is people don't understand what movie he's making. Both this movie and Lady in the Water were accused of not being scary enough, and if Shyamalan was trying to make them really scary, he failed. But I don't think he was doing that. I think he is more interested in Hitchcockian suspense than in pure horror, and I think the Sixth Sense is, in a way, his curse, because everyone says, ""do that again,"" and that's clearly not his goal.This is not to say the film had no flaws. There were definitely moments that were unrealistic. The suicides were sometimes too imaginative to be likely, and at times behavior seemed designed specifically to get the characters to a particular point rather than because it made sense (i.e. the train drivers' actions).In spite of some issues though, I found this movie very entertaining, and enjoyed it seemingly for many of the aspects that others found so unlikable.My takeaway is this: I can never listen to anyone else when it comes to Shyamalan. Now that I realize that, I guess I should even go ahead and watch The Last Airbender.(FYI, Were I to order the Shyamalan movies from best to worse, I would say The Sixth Sense, The Visit, Signs, Lady in the Water, The Happening, Unbreakable, The Last Airbender, The Village.)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Are you kidding me?,"So, I looked to my friends several times during the movie and exclaimed that ""The Happening"" is a ""Godfather"" quality flick. It is destined to be the next ""Gone With The Wind"". Wahlberg surely should be compared with Brando! n OK, seriously...this movie has to be THE worst movie that has ever been made. My pick for this award has until now been ""The New Rose Hotel"", but not anymore. Really! But I'll say this...it is so bad that it is a must see! Kind of like when you smell something repulsively putrid and you take it to your friends and say, ""Hey, smell this!""I can't say anything that hasn't already been said here, and maybe not as eloquently, but I had to say it one more time.This movie has an unfathomably bad screenplay and dialog, deplorable acting, and an amazingly stupid plot. I suspect that the actors are not necessarily that bad, or miscast, just over-directed by a director that has long lost his touch and vision.We know that Hollywood is long out of new ideas, but the producer of this little gem might have put a little more thought into this endeavor.Shyamalan made really good movies in ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"" and ""Unbreakable"". What happened? He should move on and be content with being a ""one-hit-wonder"". ""The Happening"" was just offensive. I just can't say enough bad about this movie.Reminds me of the sunny afternoon we walked down a busy Boston sidewalk and spotted a guy lying in an alley pleasuring himself. It took weeks to get that image out of our minds. I hope it doesn't take as long to let go of ""The Happening""!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I Will Never Understand People,"M. Night Shyamalan has created a very original story with a lot of creative ideas, amazing tone and brilliant shock and suspense scenes that would make even Hitchcock proud. So why all the hate for such an awesome movie? The only conclusion I can come up with is that either people just love to hate on Shyamalan, as was evident with The Village, or they just wanna see more rehashing. People must love love all of the sequels(Indiana Jones 4, The Incredible Hulk), remakes and adaptations(Speed Racer, Iron Man), and the straight forward rip-offs(The Strangers, The Ruins), etc. etc. Don't get me wrong, I liked most of these movies with the exception of the rip-offs and Speed Racer but The Happening is far superior because it actually has originality. It truly, in my opinion, is the greatest movie of 2008 so far and maybe the best movie of the past few years.I loved everything about the story. The thing about Shyamalan is that people always complain about his movies being unbelievable or unrealistic and this simply makes me angry. A movie is not to be watched the intention of learning about the world, it meant to be watched to see a story. It doesn't need to be realistic, it doesn't need to follow some sort of snobbish standard. It's art for God's sake! Anyways, back to what I was saying about the story. It moves amazingly well and I was upset to see it finally end because I wanted it to keep going. There are a lot of shocking and very disturbing moments which is why I was surprised that more horror fans weren't impressed. After all of his PG-13 films, I thought this would have had very little violence and barely deserved the R rating because most of his movies have been pretty tame. I'll tell you right now that it definitely earned the R rating. It is one of the most gruesome and disturbing Hollywood releases I've seen in a long time.I also wanted to mention how people have been complaining so much about the acting in this film. It was definitely bizarre and awkward but I thought that it followed along with the story and helped the movie create its own little world in that sense. I thought the whole cast did a great job.Don't buy a ticket to this one if you want to see another rehash of something that's already been done. It is a truly different film and I think it is ahead of its time. Shyamalan is one of the only directors out there still doing original work, and he does a damn good job of it if you ask me.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Happening: Shyamalan's entertaining B-Movie,"Better than LADY IN THE WATER and THE VILLAGE, but doesn't touch the likes of THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE, and SIGNS.THE HAPPENING is indeed a minor work from the very inconsistent Shyamalan, but I found myself enjoying it more than I should have by coming to the conclusion that it was a glorified B-movie. It plays like a 90 minute episode of the Twilight zone, and it has a preachy message to match.The acting and dialogue were pretty awful throughout, but I felt this aided the B-movie feel nicely. The film also has the most moronic and uneven blend of shock and humor (yes...humor) I've seen in any film, but somehow it managed to work here (in context of course). I know moviegoers ever where are going to hate the film for these very reasons, but I admired the film for it's goofiness,, it's b-movie charm, and the fact that you never know exactly where it's going next.THE HAPPENING is proof that Mr. ''Shyamalamadingdong'' can make an entertaining picture without a twist ending; without jump-scares; and without pretension. It may not be the film he set out to make... hell it may not be the film that many people will expect to see, but in a time when most films in release are dull and by-the-books, THE HAPPENING is neither.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I was beyond disappointed,"Let me start with the fact that I love Night. I love his movies and the camera angles he uses and just his overall technique on his previous films. Signs was good, and I personally enjoyed the Village very much, and then Unbreakable was very good in my opinion. I even enjoyed Lady in the Water, though I admit it was not a very well done film. Yet note that nevertheless, I have always enjoyed a Night film.Until now. The Happening is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is terrible and over the top. Blue eyes other there made me wish for her to die just so her aggravating acting would stop. The movie is not even scary. There is one time total I jumped during the movie. Once. During a ""thriller"". Me and my girlfriend, both of us Night fans, couldn't even think of more than a handful of really excellent shots in the film (I admit that we may be wrong here and distracted by how bored we were to notice any other nice shots). The shots and camera angles that Night uses is one of the big reasons I love his movies, and I won't bother to list here some of my favorites that he has used before.Just note that if you go to see this movie hoping for something a little better than Lady, you will be disappointed. I hoped for something akin to The Village or Signs, and wished to leave the movie 30 minutes in (but I was resilient and stayed the course). It took me three days to come back to this site and write this review. I couldn't believe what I had seen and wanted to forget. But I can't. I keep thinking how he could have done a better job if he had just worked a little harder to write the script. Its a small wonder that he had trouble selling the idea. The script should have been reworked multiple times.The dialogue was awful, the shots were nothing special, and the only worthy actors didn't get enough screen time. Night, what were you thinking?",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another Great M. Night Out,Wow is M. Night Shyamalan the most misunderstood director in history. His critics seem to want him to make a certain kind of film and are really not happy when he doesn't. This is the seventh film I've seen of his and although I'll admit it's probably not up there with his best ones I still found it very enjoyable. All his films have a different quality that make them stand out and are not as predictable as most of the films that get made in that genre. I'm pretty sure this was meant as a black comedy but it was also quite disturbing and creepy. I liked Wahlberg's wide eyed performance and the way he played it for laughs a lot of the time. I hope Shyamalan is strong enough to ignore the haters and continues to make interesting and entertaining films.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Movie happens to be really refreshing...,"Whenever an M. Night movie comes out I find humor in the myriad of slamming reviews always available. While everyone certainly has the right to an opinion, I wonder sometimes if the army of movie-goers and critics get so numb by the freeze-dried processed Hollywood productions; full of unrealistically perfect characters and plots, that when a movie with some heart comes along people don't know what to do with themselves.If you based your opinion off of the reviews of these critics you would write this movie off and shelve it with an old VHS copy of ""Ape-women from mars"". Seriously people?. I don't think people actually get M. Night. I have read reviews slamming the screenplay and acting. NEWFLASH: M. Night makes his characters flawed and awkward sometimes because it creates a sense of realism. Some people are slamming the plot. NEWSFLASH: If you still think this movie is about global warming you shouldn't be writing reviews. I think some people didn't actually get the parable this beautiful movie weaves. Its a powerful message and I loved it.To be fair, M. Night demands that you watch his movies in a certain way. He does not spoon feed you. He tells stories differently than the usual.

My Mood Ring Indicates Laughter,"Some mysterious ""event"" causes people in the Northeast to start killing themselves (loved the Philadelphia Zoo scene!) and forces an unhappy couple (Mark Whalberg and Zooey Deschanel) to work on their marriage problems lest they die. The audience is put on the ground level as people react in different ways to the impending doom and the need to escape creates heightened paranoia. The half-decent set-up combined with an unintentionally funny screenplay make M. Night Shyamalan's eco-disaster flick ""The Happening"" the most entertaining bad movie you'll see all year.Shyamalan has developed into a truly unique breed of director over the past decade. He's capable of crafting a decent thriller (""The Sixth Sense"") but he's also been responsible for one the worst films ever made (""Signs"") and some of the dumbest movies I have ever seen (""Wide Awake"" and ""Lady in the Water""). Whereas his tactics in ""Signs"" made me angry, I noticed something in ""Lady in the Water"" that gave me a perverse sense of hope. That film was so bad, it was almost good. With ""The Happening"", Shyamalan has finally crossed that threshold, and he's done it without irony or camp. He takes himself dead seriously, and he's crafted the crap in ""The Happening"" beautifully. Special nods go to cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (who has become the premier photographer of trees and grass blowing in the wind) and James Newton Howard's excellent film score.In Shyamalan's ""Twilight Zone"" universe, the scenes meant to be suspenseful or scary are instead hilarious, the moments meant to be emotional become banal, and the lines meant to be funny fall completely flat. The dialog in ""The Happening"" is so bad I think the academy should go back and take away his best screenplay nomination for ""The Sixth Sense."" Watching poor Mark Whalberg (completely unbelievable as a science teacher who figures out what is happening) give what is possibly the worst performance of the last ten years makes you wonder how Shyamalan was ever able to direct Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment to Oscar nods. Shyamalan leaves his cast, like the plants in the film, to blow in the wind without giving them a single helpful direction.Despite all this, I have to admit I loved every stupid piece of this movie from Zooey Deschanel's high-as-a-kite performance to the mood ring to Mark Whalberg talking to a potted plant to the crazy old lady in the woods to the people walking backwards. Shyamalan has performed a miracle by finally crafting another film that is suspenseful, but in all the wrong ways. When I wasn't busy laughing, I was on the edge of my seat wondering when the film would finally dive off the deep end into complete idiocy, and it did in that ""rifle"" scene on the porch of the boarded-up house. Unlike an Uwe Boll who never showed a lick of talent, or a Michael Bay who has some technical skills but edits his films to the point of being unwatchable, Shyamalan has become an awful director whose films are completely watchable...and dare I say it...enjoyable.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A huge disappointment.,"As a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan and someone who thought this was going to be his best film by a long shot, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. The concept of an event occurring where people are dying and being evacuated and panicking with no one really knowing what the cause of it is certainly is an interesting one and Night manages to convey that aspect of the film very well. He gives the entire film a very ominous, eerie feel to it that few filmmakers could come close to achieving and I don't think anyone could do as well as he can. The film itself is pretty terrifying for the most part and (not to spoil anything) he somehow conjures up the ability to make the simple image of grass moving a very frightening experience.That being said, the writing is where the film ultimately starts to unravel. The dialogue is some of the most laughable and unnatural stuff I've ever heard in a film. I was shocked to see such a talented filmmaker write so poorly. And with such terrible writing, the actors don't have a whole lot to work with. It seems like they knew the dialogue wasn't real, but still tried to force it out and it all feels really artificial. Even the simple idea of trying to make Mark Wahlberg say big words in an attempt to prove that his character really is a teacher ends up making me laugh. Wahlberg himself is slightly above average and while Zooey Deschanel delivers easily the worst performance of her career (a shame since I love her to death), it's in the supporting roles that the acting truly turns disastrous. As always with Night, he tries to use some sense of humor to ease the tension of the film and it falls completely flat. The humor in most of his films is pretty terrible, but usually there is someone like Joaquin Phoenix or Paul Giamatti there to miraculously pull it off. Wahlberg and Deschanel weren't as lucky and even they couldn't make the jokes feel like anything more than an embarrassment from an incredibly talented filmmaker.A lot of scenes just appear to be jokes out of some sort of parody film...until you realize that Night is actually trying to be serious. An example: a group of five (Wahlberg, Deschanel, a friend's child and two douchebag high schoolers) are knocking on the door to a boarded up house, trying to get inside for some food for the child. After the people inside tell them to leave, the douchebag kids start trying to break the door and windows open to get in. The barrel of a gun sticks out the window and aims toward one of the kid's heads. And, I kid you not, Wahlberg moves in slow motion, screaming the kid's name, as he takes the bullet in the back of the head. It's ridiculous and a real shame knowing what it could have been.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

And I fully agree with Roger Ebert: this movie has a special charm that will be effective for some. It’s a slow thing, with very little action and less explanation of what is it exactly happening. Still I guess it's one more worst case scenario for the humanity that does have some dim point in it. «Happening» is a strange movie, not cut by the common patterns of all pictures about death-threats capable of destroying mankind. And it has its certain audience of those who will admit they’d behave just the same way as heroes do. Perhaps this movie might serve as a test of a level of one’s cynicism and flexibility of some kind. All the reactions in fact lie between two basic: “oh what a crap” and “why not, if mutant lizard Godzilla, huge ape and little aliens had their chance to decrease the population of NY why freaked out trees could not?» Also I find duet Walberg/Deschanel very charming, unexpectedly charming I should say.

I would give that 10 stars for original material, but the rest of the movie was hard to say.(""Suddenly and inexplicably, the behaviour of everyone in the park changes in a most bizarre and horrible way"") A quote from the movie storyline this part was very bizarre in every way didn't make sense to understand why this was happening.

Possibly the best film ever made.,"OK, no, not really, but I hope I grabbed your attention there.As the cloudy beginning credits rolled, my friends were already scowling at me out of boredom and frustration for having dragged them along with me to watch the film. But that glare turned to immediate fascination as the first suicide took place, satisfying their philistinian mindset. The first 5 minutes are as violent as the film gets, with about 50 on-screen suicides taking place at the same time. Already the media are blaming terrorists, or an occult revelation, or maybe this is a message aimed for the gas company to lower their uncompromising prices? Whatever it is, Mark Wahlberg does not want to partake in it, thus he, his wife, his friend, and his friend's daughter all seek refuge from the city.Unfortunately, the evil predator catches up with them while they're on a train, and decides kill them all. Their endeavor to survive overcomes them, however, and they *literally* run from the invisible threat. When one of them is separated from the cluster (fatality +1), they depend on merely their wits and endurance to survive the predicament. They attempt to seek refuge in abandoned homes, under evil trees, and in the middle of nowhere, but the compulsive predator continues to try and kill them.That's really all there is to it. And for the first hour or so, it's actually quite chilling revel. But alas, the film descends into forced elemented situations, as it eliminates characters for the sake of abolishing their unwanted existence, and characters abruptly make bizarre, inanely futile decisions, which all lead up to its overtly melodramatic climax which doesn't even hold a twist, possibly its biggest flaw.But hey, the film eventually turns to brainless drama, but for the most part it withholds a taut atmosphere, and didn't bore me to tears, and that's more than I could ask for with its horrible reputation.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
awful,"It is somewhat surprising how a talented director, Academy Award nominated Mark Wahlberg, and a relatively interesting story, make easily the worst movie in years. The acting is absolutely terrible. From the format the dialog is given, to characters' completely pathetic reactions to the horrors they face, I could not help but laugh after about 10 minutes. Later on the in the movie, the acting becomes such a joke, the story and the characters become so extremely boring that all I wished for was the end. After roughly two hours of worthless motion picture, and an great example of the least talented acting display ever on film, the entire epidemic ends when Mark Wahlberg's character simply says ""I guess it ended over night."" Not a surprising ending to the worst movie i have ever seen. 0 stars.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The weakest link,"My hunch is that ""The Happening"" will go down in the history as the worst of Shyamalan's outings (unless ""The Sixth Sense"" director decides to pull-a-rabbit-out-of-the-hat). Notably ""The Happening"" also marks the UTV's (a big production house from India) foray into the big-bad-world of Hollywood. I would be surprised if they are not left with a feeling that closely resembles a con-game.For starters the apocalyptic premise is so lame that it barely manages to hold attention. The writing and screenplay will have to shoulder the blame. On that note, perhaps Mr. Shyamalan should only hold the directorial reigns and relinquish his writing skills to the worthy. The direction has its set of crests and troughs (the latter rule the roost actually). More time should have been devoted to explain the concept on which the entire premise suspends on.Mark Wahlberg, an accomplished actor in his own right is completely miscast. Russel Crowe/ Bruce Willis would have been a better choice.John Leguizamo does puts up an honest performance (though had shades of Paul Giamatti).""The Happening"" is extremely graphic, perhaps the first from the director. Background music is engaging.Verdict: Don't watch even if its free to air on telly unless you revere Mr. Shyamlan as your personal Jesus Christ or live in misnomer that he is the next best thing that has happened to Hollywood since Spielberg.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Crafting dread from things unseen,"You've heard the saying ""the more things change, the more they stay the same""? Well, nothing better describes the critical reception surrounding M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening. For better or worse, Shyamalan has once again stuck to his artistic vision and produced yet another cerebral skin crawler, only to see vast numbers of critics go apoplectic as a result.The Happening unfolds quickly, over the span of a single day, beginning in New York City. All over town, starting in Central Park, people begin succumbing to a bizarre, trance-like state in which they engineer their own deaths in robotic fashion. The viewer, like the protagonists in the film, is left in the dark, forced to either buy into the film's various theories bantered as to why this is happening, or draw their own conclusions. Is it airborne? Has a terrorist cell spiked the water supply with a new neurotoxin? Is humanity the subject of an unexplained die-off akin to that decimating the honey bee population? Shyamalan refuses to provide pat answers. Even after high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) concludes (as best he can) that the catalyst is a mysterious heretofore unknown airborne agent released by plant life  something akin to the oceanic red tide algae blooms that kill all marine life in their path  we still never know for sure.Because of interviews Shyamalan has given as part of his pre-publicity for the movie, some critics have gone out on a limb and interpreted the film's message as an ode to Intelligent Design writ large, but doing so is really a stretch. While Shyamalan may have committed the unforgivable sin of going on record as somebody in Hollywood who actually holds to a belief system whose focus is other than Scientology or powder that can be sucked up through one's nasal cavities, so much in The Happening is left up to pure speculation that one could easily read just about anything into it. Evolution taking a nasty and rapid turn? The Great Spirit waking up on the wrong side of the bed? Mother Nature deciding it's not nice to fool her (as a margarine ad once expounded)? The honey bee syndrome? Take your pick.What is undeniable, however, is Shyamalan's ability to wring dread out of a simple gust of wind, the coming together of large groups of people, even the lonely quivering of a plastic plant. His talent is reminiscent of Hitchcock, even if his stories are a tad too high concept for a lot of folks, including himself at times.Is The Happening a perfect film? No. It suffers from uneven acting (largely by the stupendously dopey-eyed Zooey Deschanel) and moments of unnecessarily quirky and awkward dialog, but it is a significant bounce back from 2006's tepid Lady in the Water, and it most definitely is a movie that will give you cause to think about things, which, I can safely say, is more than what 99% of this summer's blockbusters will achieve.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overall...worth seeing,"Okay...so the acting isn't great, the storyline is a bit over the top, the villain may be a bit ambiguous and stupid, and the film was never resolved. However...I still enjoyed this movie. Director Shyamalan shines in every aspect of controlling the camera. The score was fantastic (as his always are), and the way the shots were done made every second of the film seems creepy and well done. All bad things considered about this film, it still brought a smile to my face. Some scenes were laughable (i.e. the iphone video shown in the diner) but I still found myself immersed in the conflict. I beg you to take directing into consideration before calling Shyamalan's latest film a failure. I am not saying that the script was written well or that there is a reasonable resolution at the end; and would agree that the film climaxes very early and continues to be flat throughout the last half of the film. Yet Shyamalan's directing was outstanding and left me with a great appreciation of his work. I would definitely see this movie again given the chance.I am so sick and tired of people expecting a revolution in film every time they enter a theater. PEOPLE: movies are made for the audience to escape from reality and immerse themselves in an unbelievable environment! This movie was made to entertain, and it did a great job.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I could have watched a Resident Evil movie and felt more satisfied.I guess this one is a must see just so you can lose all faith in where the film industry is investing its money.

better than expected: definitely give this one a chance.,"M. Night Shyamalan. this name brings fear to many different people for many different reasons. its funny, every one gets upset because he doesn't deviate from his patented pattern of surprise endings, and demolish him when he finally does. But ill tell you one thing, his movies are good. Especially this one. Mark wahlberg plays a science teacher who is trying to escape from a mysterious illness that causes the infected to kill themselves. Even though the plot revolves around wahlberg and zooey deschanel, every now and then he'll throw a news report or two to keep the audience up to date on whats going on around the east coast. as the conspiracy theories are being thrown around the outer horn, the main characters come to a shocking conclusion as to the source of this mysterious affliction. yea the plot is over the top ridiculous, but Night has a way of making the plot seem not only plausible, but his talent helps the film avoid the corn that might associate itself with this kind of film. trust me, there are a lot of haters out there that cant understand that every one of his films are different unto themselves. well this particular film is definitely one of the best thrillers of the year, Shyamalan or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"This is a terrible, terrible film","I left the theater thinking that either Shyamalan made this movie ironically, or he is terrible at every aspect of film-making. I have seen all of Shyamalan's films save Lady In The Water and if you liked all of those, you will probably like this one. That said, this film is worse than any of them. It is a terrible, terrible film. I couldn't help but wonder how Shyamalan got these actors to take part in this god-awful production. Did he change the script after they'd signed on? Did he show them fake dailies so they'd come back the next day? Were they drugged with copious amounts of Special K? Only Shyamalan knows for sure. I have read that this film was intended to be a ""fun B-movie"" and if that is the case I can see where the attempt was made, but showing a boom mic during every conversation multiple times is not clever, it is distracting and makes my brain hurt in ways I cannot explain without multiple charts with cartoon lightning bolts on them. I enjoy B-movies, but they have several traits which this movie lacks. For one, B-movies are allowed to have bad acting, obvious screw-ups and stilted dialogue because they are rushed and made for next to nothing compared to standard cinema fair. This film has all of those bad acting concessions, but while it could be argued that the shooting for this film was relatively brief, but anything over $1 million was to much spent to make something of this grade. It should also be noted that B-movies are explicitly designed to pander. They are cheesecake. They rarely have a message and if they do, it is so subtly done as to be entirely absent from spoken dialogue (take Night of The Living Dead as an example). Thsi film bookends with the message explicitly stated by characters looking directly at the screen. A final defense made for this film is that it is an original tale told subtly that acts a respite to the mountains of remakes, sequels and schlock drivel often found at theaters today. Well ignoring that this film is apparently intended to be the schlock horror that it's fans decry, this film, while of a vaguely original concept, is very much just as bad as any Dukes of Hazzard or Meet The Spartans. The sole difference being that everyone knows those films are pointless trash and no one denies that. This film tells you it's important, it's fans tell you it's important, but if you knew nothing about Shyamalan you would assume that this was a cranked-out summer placeholder, likely to be followed next summer by The Happening 2: It Happens Again. In closing this is a very bad film. Not good bad, not funny ironic bad, but poorly done bad, even mean-spirited prank played on the viewing public bad. If you're looking for a film with an original concept and powerful message, watch WALL-E at a late showing. You won't get cinephile street cred for saying you thought it was great, but you also won't spend the whole thing wishing you'd downed a bottle of Hydroxezine with a bottle of vodka before hand. Please Mr. Shyamalan, stop making movies. You're hurting me.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

M lost his 6th sense for movie-making,"Giving this a ""2"" was being kind since I really enjoyed 6th Sense and Unbreakable. I hope ""The Happening"" is M's bottom of the barrel and he begins his ascent to film making once again. Hopefully he will have shaken off his creative ghosts and gotten over his over-inflated ego before his next project debuts.I agree with the other reviews insofar as this film was badly mis-cast. Wahlberg and Deschanel looked terribly uncomfortable in their roles. They seemed to struggle to really develop their characters. As others have pointed out they seem to have forced their performances the same way Shyamalan forced the tension in an attempt to get some sort of audience reaction. The story's mis-timed suspense and the forced performances by the cast created an out-of-synch nightmare.With all due respect to the cast, they seemed to have been left out of Shyamalan's inner intent and seemed to struggle with filling in the gaps left by the story's shortcomings.An event of catastrophic proportions was ""happening"" all around the characters but they didn't seem to react appropriately. Shyamalan should have reviewed footage of 9/11, terrorist attacks in Israel and other ""happenings"" around the globe and applied those human reactions to his characters and not create some caricature of human nature.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hilarious,"If unintentional humour and bemused actors are your thing, then don't miss this one. Clearly not a comedy, but it's impossible to take seriously. Wahlberg and Deschanel play their part by maintaining straight faces in the most absurd situations, as the best roles were reserved for the grass and the trees.One can only assume everyone involved in this thought it was just too high brow for them, and rather than admit they didn't understand, decided to play along. If you've watched Punked or Candid Camera, you'll be familiar with the puzzled expressions.It is an awful film and deserves the 1 rating, but it's in the ""so bad it's good"" category - so pour yourself a pinch of salt, stick your tongue in your cheek, and sit back and enjoy.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Mark Wahlberg weak,"Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher. There is a weird science story about bees disappearing.

Night Shyamalan and judge his movies based on what's on the screen. And what's on the screen has many problems. Mark Wahlberg just can't hold the movie screen. He doesn't project a big enough presence. If he calmed down, he could actually do better than this high school drama level acting.The odd deaths are somewhat distracting. I get that it's a big selling point but it's a silly cartoon. It becomes a matter of how to make dying crazy. I like more the confusion of not knowing. If he held back in the beginning, the deaths would be more profound later in the movie. I like the apocalyptic aspect of the movie but I'm not so much into the explaining and environmental idealism.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unfortunately the worst film I have ever seen.,"I went into this film wit high hopes. M. Night Shamalyan being one of my favourite directors I assumed he wouldn't disappoint. Also, after his great performance in The Departed I was looking forward to seeing Mark Wahlberg again.I'll start with Mark Wahlberg. His acting in this film was so bad I found myself laughing in the cinema (The only other film I have ever done that in was Battlefield Earth, I tried so hard to contain myself this time but it really was that bad). His facial expression did not change throughout and his delivery of the already plain dialogue made the film sound dull, lifeless and sarcastic as if the director didn't know whether this film was a black comedy or a thriller.M. Night Shamalyan. What a shame. This guy is not short of a thriller genius, up there with the likes of Wes Craven. In his last film, Lady In The Water, he tried to play it down a bit, make a bit more of a mild thriller. Well, it still attracted audiences and made some money but the general reception was poor. The film was carried by another underrated performance by Paul Giamatti. I really don't want to say this about him but it seems like he wrote the script for The Happening in about 15 minutes, wrote the first draft and then never even read it through once. I know this didn't happen but this script was awful...AWFUL. It was one dimensional, predictable and dull. It had pointless bits that could have been missed out and bits that should have been put in to explain the story, or lack of story. The idea was there but it was delivered in such a rushed way that it was like he didn't really care what the end result was. His direction was just as bad...I could go on and on about this film. I was highly disappointed. I really did give this film a chance but in the end it really was, unfortunately, the worst film I have ever seen.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's Not Nearly as Bad as So Many Say It Is,"The Happening is a very pivotal film in M. Night's career. It has one of the most unique stories M. Night Shyamalan has ever presented. His other stories are very good as well, but most of them are based off of concepts we've seen in movies many times before, such as aliens or ghosts, yet are looked at from a slightly different point of view (i.e. Signs, The Sixth Sense). The Happening, on the other hand, is a concept I've never seen before in cinema. The entire movie has a very creepy feel to it, not in the sense of a horror movie, but in a completely different sense that I can't even describe.I try to understand why so many people loathe The Happening, and overall I think the main reason is that it could have been better. I agree with that, but at the same time, I think many people blow the movie's flaws WAY out of proportion. The biggest flaw is Mark Wahlberg's corny acting. In most of the movies I've seen Wahlberg in, he's very convincing, however, in this film, he's not. There are parts that almost seem like he's purposely trying to overact, and it's frustrating, considering that he is the main character. Although at the same time, there are some very convincing performances delivered by John Leguizamo and the lady who plays the wife, which make up for Mark's poor performance for the most part. Another flaw is the mediocre dialogue, although it's not anywhere near the worst dialogue in a movie I've ever heard, as I have definitely heard much, much, much worse (every crappy horror movie ever made comes to mind).If this film were directed by some new director nobody's ever heard of, then I really don't think it would have gotten nearly as many bad reviews as it did. However, considering that this is an M. Night Shyamalan picture, people were expecting a masterpiece. People are expecting an incline in the quality of M. Night's films, but instead, they're only seeing a decline. Storywise, I'd definitely say The Happening is an incline in Shyamalan's career, but when it comes to the dialogue and some of the acting, I would agree that it's a decline. The story, although great, is a bit of a challenging one that many people may be thrown off by, and this may be another reason why so many people have a hard time with this film. Keep in mind, however, those of you who haven't seen it yet, that the flaws of this film are really blown out of proportion by critics and are not as bad as they are made out to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"First Lady in the Water, and now this?","M.Night Shyamalan caused a lot of controversy amongst cinema goers nowadays. What started as a hugely promising career (with The Sixth Sense) has rapidly gone downhill, his last movie Lady in the Water being loathed by the majority, and loved by a very small minority. I'll confess to being unsure what to make of his movies. The Sixth Sense in my opinion was overrated, Unbreakable was a classic and his best, Signs had moments of brilliance but a bad ending, The Village was so focused on its twists it got dull quick, and then there was Lady. Lady was something I watched five times and each time changed my opinion. I hated it first time, loved it second time, was confused by it third, and the past two times I've just been left a bit blank by it. Its a misconceived movie for sure, but its very well made. And now we get onto The Happening, something that I was dreading seeing. The critics have slaughtered the movie and the early screenings were full of negativity. Still I went into the cinema two days ago, only after being turned away for seeing Wanted, and watched it. Now I expected it to be bad, I never expected it to be this bad. I did enjoy myself while watching the movie, but unfortunately it was because I was laughing at how bad it was. The Happening is simply a disaster on every level. The script, acting and directing is just terrible. The movie is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen and bare in mind I have seen Meet the Spartans. Mark Wahlberg is diabolical, Zooey Deschanel seems bored and confused by the experience, the storyline just seems confused, the ending stinks of anticlimax, and there are so many scenes that aim for serious but are stupidly funny because of it.As I previously said the acting was horrendous. But was this really the actors fault? I am unsure as of yet, the script is horrendous but I am sure the actors could have made a bit more effort. Mark Wahlberg is very lucky to have any credibility left after this movie. If he hadn't have delivered a killer of a performance in The Departed I would avoid all future movies with him in. He is just terrible. Miscast and terrible. A scene where a companion shoots themselves sees Wahleberg response being ""Oh no"". I burst out laughing there and then. A later scene where he talks to a plant, yes you are reading that correct, just left me gob smacked. Zooey Deschanel at first is even worse than Wahlberg. Her opening scene is horrendous, in fact I was worried for Deschanel as it seemed like she had forgotten completely how to act. She does get better towards the end, but the script drags her down and her final scenes just annoyed me. The always reliable John Leguizamo does a decent job in his all too few scenes and his final sequence is one of the very, very few highlights. Yet he is in the movie for about half an hour, it annoys me as if Shyamalan had sense he would have realised Leguizamo had a better character and the audience would have been more interested in watching his story. Oh and the worst person in the movie, has to be the random crazy old lady played by Betty Buckley. Had the script and storyline allowed she could have had a decent character here, but she is just absurd and has the worst scenes in the movie by far. That and her and Wahlberg have the worst scene of the year, which basically ends in Wahlberg uttering in false amazement, ""What? No.""The Happening has so many more problems than the actors though. The first problems begin when we actually see the people begin killing themselves, while on paper standing still and uttering mad things then killing yourself might sound decent. The way it is done on screen is laughable. A scene where people jump of building sites aims for horrifying, but just ends up ludicrous, I found that scene funny as did the majority of people in the cinema. The storyline itself just gets worse and worse, when we find out what the actual ""happening"" is you just roll your eyes in disappointment. Not only is the ""happening"" never properly explained, but it seems to change constantly, one moments it involves small groups of people, the next that idea is thrown out the window and we have them running away from the wind. I really had no idea what was really going on near the end, it wasn't confusing just misconceived. The movie has next to no thrills, the running away from wind sequence is laughable and the suicide scenes gradually get repetitive. And then we get to the ending. There is one scene near the end featuring Wahlberg and Deschanel walking towards each other in the wind, I won't spoil it, but that one scene actually gave me hope. Had what I though was going to happen actually happened the movie might have had a tiny bit of redemption. It looked like the movie was actually taking a risk. Alas it doesn't and we end up with an ending miles worse than Signs could ever offer. The movie is a giant anticlimax, and the very final scene just amplifies this all the more.Based on The Happening I would actually argue Shyamalan should consider another career path, or at least realise he cannot write a decent script and stop writing them. All involved in this movie should just move on quickly and pretend it never happened. This is the first true failure of the summer, and what a huge failure it is. I recommend you watch it, but only to see one of the greatest failures of recent years.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Happening Shmappening,"I really didn't feel like I got my money's worth out of The Happening. At 91 minutes including titles and credits, this film is very frugal on content. The central concepts of the film are really quite interesting and hold a lot of potential that was not really satisfactorily explored. Every promising lead seems to peter out before it carries us anywhere. I spent the whole second half of the film waiting for the 'aha' moment when the final plot turn would be revealed, only to be disappointed with a few weak pointless closing scenes and then the film just ending.The character performances were solid for the most part, but then there were many character development threads which just seemed to lead nowhere. This just adds to the ungratifying feeling one is likely to take away from The Happening. To me it felt more like a movie project than a feature film.Probably some viewers may also find some of the scenes in the film unnecessarily gratuitous and graphic, which just distracts us further from the interesting ideas around which the film is constructed.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Easily M. Night's worst,"I'm sorry, I like Night's writing; but this was awful. The story itself I won't get into for spoiler reasons, but it could have been SO much better.Actors who normally do a decent job (Zooey, John L., Wahlberg) sounded like they were guest stars on SNL reading their lines from teleprompter.I had read a while back that Night had been sent back to revise the script several times before the movie would be released - to the point that what he ended up with was a complete mangled mutation of his original story. Maybe that was the issue and he just wanted to get out of the nightmare as quickly as possible. I watched this movie with that in mind and STILL sat there with my jaw dropped at just how bad it came out.Sorry M. Night fans, but you have to admit, this is just bad bad bad. Shame to see this happen to a guy who obviously has plenty of talent, but I guess when it comes down to it, no one is above releasing a clunker.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Where MNS is Failing,"In my opinion, The Happening was not as horrible as I've read from others... it had good points and bad points. The acting leaves a little to be desired and it's hard to believe better performances couldn't be mustered up by the cast. The writing seemed a bit ""off"" at times... with moments of feeling forced. Some of it gets quite campy.The concept of the movie, and the overall story being told were decent. There are some ""signature"" MSN moments (which I won't reveal, but if you're a fan you'll recognize them). MSN does a good job with suspense and building tension, and interestingly inserted comic relief that keeps the story moving along. There's even an interesting cameo... and depending on your own interpretation, it seems to either pay homage to or flip the bird at another well-known director.I can understand that MSN may not want to have a ""twist"" at the end of every movie... but where he has failed most dramatically in this recent effort is that the build up doesn't provide the expected payoff. What has made him such a good story-teller in the past is what is missing from The Happening. His movies are usually well organized puzzles where the pieces all fit together at the end revealing the bigger picture... but with The Happening, we are left with too many missing pieces to feel fulfilled over what the bigger picture is supposed to reveal.I wanted to give this movie a higher score, but because of the things I've mentioned above, I can't. I went with a group of four other people, and in our group three of us liked it, one loved it, and one hated it. I was in the group that liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"The only thing ""happening"" was audience disappointment","I have been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's since The Sixth Sense. I've enjoyed all his films and even enjoyed - and defended! - Lady in the Water. But there's not a whole lot to defend in The Happening.The basic overarching premise of the film is a good one. But that's where it ends. It's a one-note film that goes on and on with little plot or character development. And the script is embarrassingly sophomoric, filled with unnatural comic-book style dialog. It honestly sounded more like someone's college project than a professionally written script. It was painful watching Mark Wahlberg trying to make something out of the poorly written lines he was given. The only successful moments of the film were the ones where Wahlberg injects some humor into his delivery.If Shyamalan doesn't want to hire some good writers, its time for him to find another line of work.Addendum 7/10/08: I've read other reviews since I wrote this, both on IMDb and other sources. I have taken into consideration others' views and opinions and the notion that Shyamalan was ""trying to make a B movie."" I still stand by my first review. Even if that's what he was trying to do - actually, ESPECIALLY if that's what he was ""trying"" to do - its still a poor attempt. If you want to see a successful homage to a classic genre, see ""Far From Heaven,"" (a nod to the 1950's director Douglas Sirk) or ""L.A. Confidential,"" (a tip of the hat to the film noir/detective genre). But if ""The Happening"" is supposed to be an homage to the B movies of the 50's and 60's or even Rod Serling's Twilight Zone series, it is still profoundly lacking.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
--it Happens,"I wish people would cut M. Night Shyamalan some slack, 'cause I'm going to. I've always found his films watchable and of a type that I'll call ""intelligent"" horror films. I'm perplexed--not that fans of, say, Freddy Krueger are non-plussed by Shyamalan's work, but--that those who praise films like ""Iron Man"" can point to this and say it's nonsense.It's one of the few post-9/11 films that taps into our paranoia without exploiting it. What happens is the fun in the film, so I won't betray that. But as a filmmaker there's a constancy, a visual artistry, and a dread that makes Shyamalan a modern day Hitchcock. I think his work will wear better when we have some distance from the era in which they were made.If I had a complaint, I think this screenplay could have gone through a rewrite once or twice more. Some of the ideas aren't fully developed (a subplot in which Betty Buckley returns to the genre many, many years after ""Carrie"" and she's riveting is one example) and while claustrophobia is enhanced by the intimacy of point of view, I'm trying to imagine the exodus from the train station as being so organized. I'd like to have seen something more epic in the panic to flee. And the resolution of the issues between Walhberg and Deschanel seems hasty and forced.Still, we have some fine unsettling moments only a few of which are red herrings. And the cast is quirky and nervous in their performances. It's the first time ages that John Leguizamo has delivered something worthy of his talent.I think people who find their way to this film will enjoy it. I enjoyed ""Signs"" as well as ""The Village""; ""Unbreakable"" a superior super-hero film, and while those films never matched the popularity of ""The Sixth Sense,"" I find that unfortunate. M. Night Shyamalan has brought some class back to suspense and horror films, and I hope people will applaud that.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Flawed but enjoyable escapism, if this sort of thing is your cup of tea","I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't great but I found it entertaining, especially compared the MNS's last flop, the disappointing ""Lady In The Water"". While the plot required a pretty hefty suspension of disbelief, many of the individual scenes succeeded in creating a suspenseful mood, and the director succeeds in imbuing seemingly innocuous images, such as trees blowing in the breeze, with a sense of dread. The actors, especially the likable Zooey Deschanel, do an admirable job with some occasionally corny dialogue and improbable situations.Taken as a whole, the overall effect doesn't add up to all it could have been in a more skilled writer's hands. MNS seems to be awfully fond of his own ideas, and this winds up being a one-note movie without much depth. He seems content to create tension rather than drama. But if you approach this film as pure escapism, and can suspend disbelief enough to forgive its flaws, it succeeds as an engaging and entertaining series of scenes with which to fill an hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Appalling acting, dreadful script, and a real lack of any substantive plot.It went nowhere from the original theory on what is causing 'The Happening,' to its confirmation, to the end of the film.

"Put it this way: If you like Shymalan, it's worth a look.","My Take: Bizarre and sometimes campy, but can be chillingly effective if it has to be.As I am a fan of M. Night Shymalan, my first impression of his latest film THE HAPPENING being a ""fun b-movie"" as he puts it is that it wouldn't turn out to be as bad as many critics put it. Shymalan, in an attempt to revive his success after the failure of LADY IN THE WATER (an argument that is still goes on among few defenders and haters), just wanted to make a simple B-movie genre effort in an attempt not to alienate some of his viewers from the different and misunderstood nature of his previous efforts, an effort that is still being shrugged by critics. But even a B-movie to Shyamalan is still a film that is faithful to some of the nature of his previous efforts. Most evidently, the use of suspense rather than typical scares.The opening sequence is probably the best. It opens in Central Park, where people go about their usual business when suddenly people find themselves committing suicide in the oddest of fashion. Shymalan, given the full liberties of an R-rating, devises this opening sequence in an over-the-top fashion, yet as well in such effective creepiness that it makes your skin crawl nonetheless. Unfortunately, in spite of a few other disturbing kills later, the rest of the film fails to live up to its admittedly chilling setup. I praised Shymalan before as a superior yet underrated storyteller, but it seems in THE HAPPENING, disturbing and well-crafted sequences aside, fails to live up to some of his superior works, even if, taken in its own merit, is not half bad compared to what the critics have said about it.Firstly, the narrative is rather messy, with no real beginning (after the superb opening sequence, there's hardly a character setup) and an ending with no real closure. Everything just seems to be, pardon the pun, happening. Performances are uneven, with Wahlberg alternating from frantic to campy, either way it's hard to believe him as a science professor when he starts getting silly. Zooey Deschanel is just out of place, a great actress as she is. Some actors like John Leguizamo, Spencer Breslin, Alan Ruck and others are in the cast too, but it's hard not to credit them as nothing more than cameo appearances; they're hardly there, whether or not they serve any real purpose. Finally, Betty Buckley appears later in the film in a relevant supporting role (even if she's only there for, say, 20 minutes) as the out-of-her-mind Mrs. Jones.THE HAPPENING is Shymalan's weakest film to date, not that I'm comparing it to any of his ever-varying works. But being an admirer of his works, every underrated work of his after THE SIXTH SENSE, THE HAPPENING has it's strong points and some effective moments that live up to the director's form. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto perfectly captures the shots and one-take sequences that Shyamalan demands. James Newton Howard provides yet another terrific, if often ham-fisted, score. Suffice to say: If Shymalan is your cup of tea, this one is well worth watching. I, for one, am looking forward to what he'll come up with next.Rating: *** out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why is this man still making movies?,"After the massive success of the hugely over-rated debut feature, The Sixth Sense (1999), M. Night Shyamalan could only really go one way. The series of films that he produced over the years have always been absolutely reliant on a twist, or put simply, one single idea, that the film's entire narrative is hinged upon. In his first the lead character was dead, in Unbreakable (2000), the lead was an unwitting superhero, in The Village (2004), it was the media signifiers of the war on terror. In essence the films were quite interesting. However, as films they were largely dull, pretentious drivel. I never actually saw Lady in the Water (2006), so I am unable to comment on the film he directed before this atrociously titled, The Happening.The film begins with a series of vignettes showing various New Yorker's stopping their movements, and randomly committing suicide. One scene has workmen jumping from the room of a tall building - the director sorely missing out on the opportunity to have The Weather Girls' It's Raining Men playing on a radio, or even with non-diegesis. So, what about that old Shyamalan twist that has become so ubiquitous to 21st cinema thus far? The plants did it! The plants are attacking the entire eastern seaboard of North America, and a struggling couple, Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) and Alma (Zooey Deschanel) have been given a friends child Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) to take to safety after her father, John Leguizamo, - who willingly manages to slit his wrists, successfully ejecting himself from this awful film - goes off in search of the mother.Shyamanlan proudly highlights his involvement in his films, with his credits for writing, producing and directing, and his career path would seem to indicate that he combats outside forces in their making. If this is the case, I would state that for his careers sake, he should absolutely make other peoples scripts. For me, I don't really care, having never really liked any of his films. It would appear that the gravitas of the attention he received after The Sixth Sense, (being hailed as the new Spielberg; the wunderkind status in the media) clearly have hindered his films. And as I watched Wahlberg and Deschanel, zombie-like in their delivery of some very poor ""relationship"" dialogue, and the pathetic narrative of plant spores evolving to drive humans to suicide as a defence, I wondered to myself: Why on earth is this man still making movies? We should relegate him to television reality shows: When Botany Goes Mad!www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good ideas executed poorly,"First of all, I understand this was supposed to be a B-movie homage. I get the underlying messages of the importance of love and recapturing the magic, protecting the environment or it will wipe us out, and the nature of relationships. The concepts behind the plot are well thought out and thought provoking as well. I love ""The Happening"" on a conceptual level. It's one of those movies that make you think long after the credits have rolled. However, good concepts don't always translate to good film.M. Night Shyamalan has some decent credits under his belt. ""The Sixth Sense"" was a fun ghost story with terrific acting. ""Unbreakable"" was an interesting take on the superhero genre and again had terrific acting. ""The Village"" was a wonderful and thought-provoking movie that was underrated and misinterpreted. I think the first film I noticed M. Night Shyamalan may have been slipping was ""Signs"". While ""Signs"" had an awesome atmosphere and well-acted scenes, it's logical fallacies were too much for me to take (Really? Aliens are allergic to water? How did they enter our atmosphere without dying immediately seeing as how it is largely composed of H2O? The aliens sure do seem rather dumb for an interplanetary species, and their attack seems extremely ineffective for such an advanced species....among other blatantly obvious logical fallacies). But I figured okay maybe Sci-fi just isn't his strong suit. Then I watched ""Lady in the Water"". It had good acting but the script was seriously bad and it was almost comedic conceptually.On to ""The Happening"". Like I previously mentioned, this one is definitely a thinking person's film. It's good for a conversation. Unfortunately the conversation might devolve into how bad the movie is. Mark Whalberg mentioned some of the strange ways M. Night Shyamalan attempted to pull good performances from his cast. Apparently this didn't work at all. The acting is so melodramatic and unrealistic, it really takes you out of the intended atmosphere. It doesn't help that the script is poorly written and invokes these melodramatic performances. Continuous and ridiculous close-ups really detract from any tension Shyamalan attempts to build. One scene in particular when Whalberg is yelling at his group ""Why won't someone just let me think for a second?!"" could be one of the worst scenes I've ever seen....except for maybe the following scene which concludes with ""Keep ahead of the wind!"" Horrid writing and poor choices of camera-work bring this film down a lot.The opening scene of ""The Happening"" had real promise. I was horrified and intrigued at what could happen next in M. Night Shyamalan's first R rated feature. The first 20 minutes or so is a real treat to watch. Unfortunately it all take a steady slide down the hill and eventually falls from the cliff. With ""Signs"", ""Lady in the Water"", ""The Happening"", and ""The Last Airbender"", M. Night Shyamalan has officially made more mediocre to poor movies than he has good ones. I no longer expect anything from him. ""The Happening"" has some signs of a great film. It has good concepts and a solid introduction. However, it's just not there.4.5/10",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Decent,"Happening, The (2008)** 1/2 (out of 4)Shyamalan's latest has people on the East Coast killing themselves for no apparent reason. No one knows why the suicides are taking place but rumor has it that the only way to remain safe is trying to reach a safe zone further out west. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel play a couple trying to figure out what to do. This certainly isn't a major film or a good one for that matter but I think it's a minor comeback for the director after the horrid The Village and Lady in the Water. I'm not going to ruin what is causing the ""happening"" but I'm sure some are going to be left with a major disappointment but I didn't mind it too bad. I liked the way the director handled the last days of man theory and for the most part I think he has made a quiet little film that is probably going to draw a lot of heat because it isn't loud and explosive and it doesn't contain anything large. This comes off like an old ""B"" movie from the 1950's that warns people about their actions and what could come if they don't take advice from those who know about the subject matter. With the secret of the film, it never really causes too much panic with the viewer, which I think is the film's major problem. With the last days of man theory the viewer needs to be on the edge of their seat throughout the entire film and that doesn't really happen. The suicide scenes early on are quite disturbing but they never really draw you into the film as much as they need to. Another problem with the film is the performance by Deschanel, which is downright horrible. At times I just had to laugh at some of her actions and sadly she's in the film all the time. Wahlberg comes off fairly good, although it's hard believing him in the role of a science teacher. John Leguizama has a small role as well but doesn't add too much to the film. In the end, I doubt very many are going to enjoy this film and I'm sure I'll be in the minority. It's not a great movie and it's not a good one but it is mildly entertaining and the director's handling of the material is interesting.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Those scary trees, that creepy wind.....","No doubt hoping to tap into the enviro-panic that is gripping the world, M. Night Shyamalan has created a still-born, lifeless dud with The Happening, that would have served the environmental debate a whole lot better by not imposing its footprint on the world at all.The opening scenes - all of which we've seen in the trailer - set up a jarringly compulsive premise that had the heart pounding (it earned the film all three of its stars from me). At some point the distributor Warner Bros should have realised the guy cutting the trailer should have been put in charge of the film - he gets more tension from three minutes than M. gets from 90 mins.As the character-driven narrative starts to take over, it quickly becomes clear that nobody in this film is in any way relatable - from Mark Wahlberg's gaspy, drippy school teacher to the blank-eyed gaze of Zooey Deschanel to John Leguizamo's know-it-all blatherer, all the way down through the vaguely-comical support players (a loopy, cross-eyed plant merchant; a Gomer-Pyle-esquire army private). M.'s best work - The Sixth Sense, Signs - found the balance between genre suspense and characters that engaged and enthralled. The Happening is guilty of the exact opposite - creating a menace that actually dilutes the tension as more details are revealed, threatening a group of heroes who become increasingly less interesting and believable as the film progresses.Most disappointing is the apparent dissapation of M.'s skill as a craftsman. Even those who thought his past films underwhelming bits of storytelling would concede that they were good-looking, well-composed examples of a director who knows how to frame the action and find the essence of his scene. Not so here - the colour palette is bland, the staging unimaginative and static, the sense of tension arbitrary and sporadic. It feels like he doesn't want to push himself or perhaps lacks faith in the material. Had it not been the work of a writer-director, I would've blamed the mismatching of filmmaker and material.Having been a fan, I hope Night hasn't had his day, but The Happening represents something that will trouble his supporters. This is the sort of premise that should be a walk-up start for the director of The Sixth Sense, should provide ample opportunity for thrills and chills for the director of Signs. That it fails so completely begs the question - where to from here...? Oh, and given its enviro-message, its fair to ask - was this film's production fully carbon-neutral? I'm not cynical enough to think M. would latch onto a hot-button issue like global warming just to sell a few tickets, without practicing what he preached...would he...?",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Even if it's Shyamalan's worst yet, it's still excellent.","M. Night Shyamalan. A man with a unique mind and an amazing talent for film-making. Many reviews of ""The Happening"" disagree with the aforementioned statement, so let me take a moment to attempt to solidify it.First, Shyamalan's movies are thought-provoking. The movie world in 2008 is not the same as it was when his ""The Sixth Sense"" was in theaters. Audiences have different expectations for movies, with all of the banal action-packed superhero movies being make left and right, especially in the summer. You cannot go into ""The Happening"" expecting it to be something it is not. There is no Hulk smashing buildings, nor are there high-speed car chases or tragically predictable love stories. I truly believe that mindset is the most important thing to enjoying a movie.With that said, I had extremely high expectations for this movie, especially after the disappointment of ""Lady in the Water."" In many cases, ""The Happening"" fulfilled these expectations, while in a few other ways, it did not.The script and the pace make this film outstanding. When watching ""The Happening,"" just place yourself in the role of the main characters. How would you react to the events taking place? How each of the characters reacts is extremely realistic, showing just how frightening the truth can be. The fact that this movie takes place over such a short period of time really captures its moments well. Even faced with much larger concerns, the characters do not forget about their personal lives and problems.Now what is wrong with this movie is the direction--namely its casting of Mark Wahlberg. His character shows far less emotion than he should, and his acting seems so forced it is almost pathetic. The easiest way to put this is that Wahlberg's character says the right things, but in the wrong manner. Throughout the whole movie, as I watched, I pictured Mel Gibson with his masterful and moving performance in ""Signs"" in Wahlberg's place. With Gibson, the movie definitely would have been at least an 8/10.On a final note, I would like to add that Shyamalan again manages to bring about real world concerns in a fantastical scenario, bringing at least some enlightenment and concern to those who care to listen. Do not go in expecting a gigantic twist; do not go in expecting a little boy to see dead people; ""The Happening"" is a very solid movie. People who appreciated ""Signs"" will almost definitely enjoy Shyamalan's latest installment.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Thrills, chills, people standing still...","So far, I think viewers have been a little tough on this movie, perhaps because of Shymalan's reputation. A good amount of people who went to see ""The Happening"" loved ""The Sixth Sense"" and hoped for something of that caliber. However, Shymalan may have peaked a bit early -- and you can't hold that against him.

Compare it to most horror films you'd see in theaters now. I would recommend ""The Happening"" to any horror buff or individual simply seeking a gore fix/adrenaline shot. It does have its graphic death scenes, and it does have its ""jump"" moments. They were mostly shoved into the first half of the film, but still... prepare to hold onto your popcorn.

I can almost see what probably went down when Mr. Shyamalan got the green light to make his first ever R-Rated film. It must've been on the lines of a child at a candy store, but instead of taking all the candy he could with his hands, he was finally given a bag. Now he could try some different candy, give his taste buds some variety, and even be bold by trying things no other kids would.But there's a reason why no one else does what M. Night Shyamalan does, because it doesn't work. Ever since his stunning thriller, The Sixth Sense, his touch for directing and writing has been unraveling very quickly. The Happening is not scary, and it's almost painful to notice how hard Shyamalan is trying. What Hitchcock did with The Birds was something only a master could pull off. Shyamalan attempted to mimic Hitchcock's tension of the unpredictability of the nature of birds and the rest of the wild with images of the wind blowing against the trees and making the tall grass sway. Seriously? Are we supposed to be scared of wind? Because this was his first R-Rated film, Shyamalan constructed a series of very disturbing deaths, which I assume he spent almost all of his energy in. If he wanted to make these death scenes a memorable aspect of The Happening, then he succeeded. Did he purposely make the rest of the film suck to accomplish that? Who knows. But the truth is there are only a handful of bright moments throughout this extremely dull film.One of the bright moments would be the occasional comical relief one-liners that brought out some laughter throughout the audience. But I would say that half of the time there was laughter, it was the result of horribly written dialog and completely ridiculous reactions between characters. That's an alarming sign for a bad film, when it's unintentionally hilarious. The only other bright moment I can dig up is John Leguizamo's performance. While the rest of the cast was forcing every line written in the script, Leguizamo was able to make his character jump off of the page and seem natural. Almost any film would be blessed to have the talents of Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel in their cast, but this film is a great example of how important the screenplay is. I cannot fault the actors with their choppy and two-dimensional performances, simply because of the horrendous script.Overall, there will be a minority who will find the movie entertaining at best. Popular opinion will say The Happening is boring, stupid, and a waste of an hour and a half. And even though The Happening packs a very strong environmental message, Shyamalan seems to assume his audience is unable to detect the message unless he states exactly what he's trying to tell you. Isn't that a Screen writing 101 no-no? SHOW don't TELL. Well, Shyamalan might have to go back to class. How bad is it? Let's just say the racism message in Crash was less subtle than the environmental message in The Happening. But I guess Shyamalan didn't want to risk his message going over anyone's head. So the moral of the story is: If you mess with the environment, it will retaliate and kill you. Shyamalan tried to scare people to do the right thing. In my opinion, Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth is a lot scarier than The Happening.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fool me once...,"Ah, good ol' M. Night Shyamalan. Those who have read my other reviews know that I am a fan of Shyamalan's earlier films. The Six Sense leveled me, Signs was brilliantly conceived and very well played, The Village was a work of genius. Then came Lady in the Water, a bizarre and uninteresting work of self-indulgent fluff. Fool me once.Then, I watched the Happening. Did he actually fool me twice? Well, sort of. The Happening had more interesting concept than Lady: Nature enacts its revenge on Man. And, it started out and actually ended better than Lady. While its not nearly in the same league as Signs and Six Sense,it is clearly more bearable to watch the Happening than Lady in the Water. But the similarity in regards to muddled dialog and misguided performance makes me nervous for the fate of Shyamalan's films.I actually do think the lead was miscast. I don't think Mark Wahlberg understood the role of a flawed everyman. Zooey Deschanel didn't make it easy for us viewers to sympathize for her. John Leguizamo was the only actor who brought a sense of paranoia that was absent in the other actor's performances.This won't make me very popular, but I do disagree with many of the comments on this site. This movie actually made me think. I didn't really think about how we are destroying the environment or that the trees and bushes would actually make us suicidal. But, like Signs and The Village, I thought about the point that Shyamalan pieced together. If you put aside the below-average script and poor acting, Shyamalan did cleverly tell a story that nobody else is capable of telling. The movie was undeniably flawed at times, but it was also quite intriguing at times. Not enough for a come back, but perhaps not enough to proclaim ""shame on me.""",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
B-Movie + Philosophy = this nice and entertaining movie,"The Happening is a very nice movie. Here Night M. Shyamalan did not his best (""Signs"" is my favourite and ""The Sixth Sense"" is a little masterpiece), but he did a very nice and entertaining thriller movie. Like all his other works, Shyamalan starts with one of the fundamental philosophical questions of this time and he tries to answer with a B-Movie theme. In ""Sings"" the fundamental question was ""Does God exists?"" and the B-Movie theme was an alien's invasion. In this case, the fundamental question is: ""Is man the cancer of our planet?"" and the B-Movie theme is an unstoppable pandemic deadly disease. The plot is a typical pandemic movie, but this is not a B-Movie at all: complex characters, realistic situations and shocking scenes of massive suicides give great depth to this movie. There is something wrong with acting: all actors (Zooey Deschanel, Mark Wahlberg and all the others) are always astonished, sometimes they act as alienated people. This is a characteristic of all Shyamalan's works, but in this movie it could be a bit disturbing. Shyamalan creates suspense. And he re-creates very well a desperate situation where humanity is struggling against an unknown, invisible and very powerful enemy. In this struggle there are no heroes, but only victims or lucky people, like in ordinary reality. And all this stuff is really, really entertaining! His plot is very coherent with the fundamental question ""Is man the cancer of our planet?"". He answers in the very end of the movie. Personally I don't agree with Shyamalan's answer. But I don't want to reveal it. Go to theater and watch it!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You can't always trust previews (possible spoilers),"Watching the previews for ""The Happening"" made me excited for the chance to see it. It seemed to be a return to the glory of early Shyamalan films. I promise to get back to this point but first let me say I believe M. Night Shyamalan has inadvertently branded himself as a twist ending director. After Sixth Sense and Unbreakable it seemed that would be his legacy. Signs and The Village followed the same formula, but for many the endings could be seen long before the movie was over. The Happening lacked the twist ending which isn't inherently bad... but many of the people I was with even believed it lacked even a basic plot. I won't go that far, but there were quite a few things to be were of. For those who haven't seen it I won't go into details, but please if you're planning on taking kids or those who get squeamish urge them not to go. This is not a movie for the faint of heart. The newly re-introduced red R rating means business this time around. Its surprise scary moments come from bloody, grotesque imagery that feel forced when contrasted to the fluid creepiness I found in Shyamalan's early films. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschannel's dialog felt force and I think the best actors of this film was the wind. I understand Shyamalan's inspiration was to take a page from 50's B movies, but I fear he has fallen quite hard with this one. For me at least this movie made Hostel and Dawn of the Dead (04 version) appear tame. For those of you who like it I'm glad you came out liking it, but from now on I'm waiting for Shyamalan's movies to come to cable...I think it's the last time I'll ever put faith in a trailer. It's a hard lesson isn't it.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loved it.,"I gotta say, given the average review for this film I am a bit baffled I enjoyed it as much as I did.The trick to this movie is not taking your eyes off the screen. I think most who watch this movie give it an unfair rating because they do not understand what is going on. an entirely original script, I guess most of us are not use to that. The story was magnificent, the filming, the cast (except The actress who played Mark Wahlburgs wife) all done great.Their are two very memorable movies that I have seen in my life and despite their ratings I will always be happy to watch them again.

More wooden than Pinocchio,"I have followed this film since the first copy of the script was leaked out on the internet. I had high hopes that once it went through a few rewrites it would actually be a good film. I had been disappointed by Lady in the Water and The Village, and wanted to see another quality movie by the man behind The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.To say I was disappointed by The Happening is the understatement of the year. The original script was actually better than the film. It gives the term ""B-Movie"" a bad name.The wooden acting destroyed this film. Wahlberg plays a high school teacher. His character is beyond wooden. He just recites his lines. I am surprised he took this role. He'll be lucky if it doesn't set his acting career behind eight years. Zooey Deschanel's Alma is not any better.MNS is known to work his actors hard in rehearsals prior to filming. He wants to make sure they will give the presentation he wants to see on the screen. This leads me to believe the horrible acting was done on purpose. The poor execution of the script also led me to this conclusion.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A little disappointing,"Overall this movie wasn't too bad. My problem, was it too short. There was one comment I felt I partially agreed with and that was this was rushed. It was a little under 1 hour and 45 minutes long, when it probably should of been about 2 hours, but no longer the 2 hours and 15 minutes.I'm not going to reveal what is the cause of the events in the movie, but be prepared for a disappointment. And then at the end of the movie I get the impression that this movie was a warning about global warming. I don't know if anyone else got that impression, but I did. I won't tell you not to waste your money, but I'm also not going to tell to you not to see it.Dialouge-5/10, acting 6/10, plot, 10/10, directing, 8/10, overall 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
just another disappointment - spoilers alert,"The expansive laundry list of the failures of this mind-numbingly miserable, preposterous excuse for a film, which essentially includes every conceivable aspect and component of it, have been well detailed in earlier posts. I won't waste much time reiterating those comments. I have to say that I disagree with those who, in spite of their overall distaste for the film, with which I heartily agree, found the first so many minutes to be watchable, or the score to stand out as a positive feature, or who found anything else positive to say about any part of this thing. Perhaps you're just being kind. No need. OK, Deschanel is a cutie, but that's it for this film. long story short, the happening hits the city and they move, the happening hits another city they move again until the happening stops no reason what so ever.

The Hypening...,"Let me start by saying i was super excited to see this movie. NOT because of the extensive advertising, proudly proclaiming this to be ""Shyamalans first R rated film,"" but because i hold this film maker in very high regards. From the 6th sense to the village, he wrote and directed 4 truly great films, establishing himself as the new master of suspense. The Hitchcock of our time. What made these films so effective was the way they worked on multiple levels - signs wasn't REALLY about aliens, but it was a way into a deeper story. He has a very natural ability to suck an audience in...Then came lady in the water. Even though i knew next to nothing about the movie, i saw it in theaters. Unfortunately it turned out to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen at the multiplex. However, i have been able to forgive M Night of this one self-indulgent flop. A Hollywood film for your little girls. Well, glad you got it out of your system...SO, that brings us to the Happening, M Nights return to form it seemed. Well... yes and no. As with his earlier films, its not REALLY about what it seems. One big problem I had, which isn't necessarily Mr Shyamalans fault, is SO much was given up in the previews to the movie. The first half hour has little shock value due to what we've already seen on TV, and many more events later in the film are seen a mile away, again, because of our previous knowledge from the previews. Also, the supernatural element of the movie (which actually isn't too supernatural this time around) isn't shrouded in nearly as much secrecy as his previous works, which makes it harder to build suspense.As with every one of Shyamalans efforts, you couldn't ask for a better or more appropriate cast. In a complete 360 from his roles in films like the Departed, Wahlberg plays a gentle, even goofy high school science teacher. Its nice to see a character in a horror situation keep his wits and not be reduced to over reacting (or over ACTing) or going mad. His wife is a interesting enough character, but isn't really given enough material to run with. All supporting actors fit their characters to a T, especially the scared military man and the weird plant guy.The conclusion doesn't go for the knockout, as several of Shyamalans movies do, but thats OK. The story ends gracefully, and lingers for a bit, never really being wrapped up tightly. An appropriate ending given the nature of the story. Still, it will leave some audience members upset and feeling empty.All in all, it was a satisfying experience, and the film makes good use of its R rating without using mindless gore. Still, i find myself waiting for M Night to return to top form...",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Am just astonished I've never heard anyone mention this before when other movies have been evoked (Steven Soderbergh Contagion mainly).The acting is uneven, Mark Wahlberg delivers a better performance than critics say and though Zooey Deschanel is a bit off, maybe it is part of her introverted character nature.

A no-spoilers review of The Happening and in turn Shyamalan himself,"In M. Night Shyamalan films, there is supposedly always some trademark plot twist for which he is now so well known. The credits still rolled dutifully by on the screen as I walked from the theater into the stark brightness of the lobby. That's when I had my very own twist; I believe came to really understand the drive and vision of Mr. Shyamalan.People think he's about twists, but I would suggest to you that he's not. Instead, I'd have you believe that these gimmicks are actually incidental. That in fact what he's about are realizations. ﻿The story, the characters, the plot, the theme -- these things do not matter to him at all. Rather, it's the act of his characters coming to an epiphany. Everything else is disposable.The glaring problem in all this is that those of us with even a basic measure of intelligence and the capacity for abstract thought usually have these moments of clarity about an hour in advance of the protagonists. Thus we cruise through the entire second half of the movie, which comes across to us as a total failure. ﻿The ironic thing is that in his misguided quest to show us other people's awakenings, he himself completely fails to perceive that it's not just about the protagonists. Giving away too much information at the wrong time or too little, and you lose the most important element in a story -- the audience. We are in fact the central-most thread of the story. We have to believe what the characters are experiencing, and feel some sort of pathos about it. That's why we still read Homer and Shakespeare after so many centuries. Story. Plot. Characters. These things touch us, carry us forward, bring us to a point where we care about these people and their circumstances, and we want to see their tales carried through to completion. Even relive them again and again.What we seem to have with Shyamalan is a would-be storyteller who has not even the most basic idea of what a story is or how to involve the audience once again, as he did with The Sixth Sense. Whether he got lucky with that film or has since lost his vision is debatable. In light of ""The Happening"", I would say it's most likely to be the former. In conclusion, if you want two hours of pretentious fluff with no content and no storyline, by all means, go and watch ""The Happening"". I for one will be sitting out the next movie with the words ""M. Night"" attached to the bill.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shyamalan The Schlockmeister Strikes Again!,"I don't know about you, but seeing dozens of people on the Big Screen graphically and creatively committing suicide is not my idea of having a good time! But before I go any further, I want to strongly advise people who are severely depressed, or currently have issues with suicidal ideation (thinking/fantasies ) NOT to see this movie. The violence portrayed can be summed up in one word - harsh! The Happening is also wildly inappropriate for children and young teens! Consider this warning a Public Service announcement by someone who used to work with people in crisis!Personally, it's sad to see Director Shyamalan stoop so low. His masterpiece, ""The Sixth Sense,"" is one of the greatest supernatural fantasy films of all time! He obviously likes to work in this genre, and there are plenty of stories written along these lines over the past hundred years to tap into for ideas! But no, he most follow the majority of Hollywood and dumb down his films, too! The Happening will certainly make Director Shyamalan a quick buck, but it will also damage his brand. He's slowing and steadily becoming the ""Roger Coreman"" of schlock film making. I, for one, will certainly think twice before paying my hard earned money to see another one of his films in the future!No one is denying that there's an audience for this kind of intense and graphic violence, but there's a much larger audience for intelligent story making.

If you don't get M. Night Shyamalan...,"Then stop watching his movies.M. Night Shyamalan, in my opinion, is one of the greatest and most under-appreciated directors out there today. His directing style is very distinct, understated, graceful, and all-around excellent. With ""The Happening,"" he's managed to bring out a movie that's very different from his other films, but the similarities it bears in comparison is definitely worth noting.""The Happening"" contains the understated, slow cinematography that the vast majority of his films have, and if you need action in every shot, this is definitely not a movie for you. This film is about reality, and Shyamalan incorporated a good deal of realism into the dialogue, the cinematography, and the events taking place. The thing that I loved about the R rating was that it didn't take away from the movie at all, it allowed the movie to continue in the realism vein. It wasn't unnecessary or shamelessly graphic, it merely added to the film in a way that ""the apocalypse"" (if you wish to view the events in the film as such) would ACTUALLY happen.What most people don't understand about Shyamalan's films is that they're meant to be psychological thrillers...not a thriller or a ""scary"" movie. His movies are meant to make you think, and they're meant to be understated and slow-paced. That's his style, and most people don't understand what he's trying to do there. I feel that this movie will get that kind of criticism, because people go to see it with the expectation that they'll be scared. Yes, there are parts that make you jump, but you won't get frightened.If you like M. Night Shyamalan's films, then you won't be disappointed with ""The Happening."" If you haven't seen any of his films beforehand, I highly recommend watching ""Unbreakable"" or ""Signs"" first before seeing ""The Happening,"" so that the pacing and the dialogue won't confuse you.

One last note, why on earth does M Night Shyamalan keep putting himself in his own movies? He really truly can't act at all. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bad.

Paranoia and disaster (for the audience),"'The Happening' was promising and will always be promising. But just the idea and not what it panned out into. I wish good things for Shyamalan. He made the most memorable horror movie I have seen (which seems to have become a baggage for him). But he has slipped right into the bottom. He just takes the germ of an idea which he keeps on blowing and when the end credit roll in, he is still seems to be blowing it! Someone should have told him to stop because he never finishes the film. In the end, we become a joke and in turn everyone will make sure he becomes a joke.This was his worst attempt to make a thriller, worst than 'Lady in the Water' whose core idea was flawed, 'the happening' actually had something interesting and the audience were holding on for something to answer the occurrences of self annihilation among humans. They do not happen to get anything out of this mushy-romantic creep fest (the first of such a genre!), while Shyamalan even after he ends the episode of nature-revenge without any meaning to it in north-east America; he starts another one in Paris which makes the audiences smack there head time and again. With no core theory involved to tell the story, the movie should definitely counted worst than some of the eighties slasher movie, such was the sorry state of the film. The director does show glimpses of his talent, mainly when the main protagonists along with few survivors enter a model house of an upcoming real estate property full of plastic trees and wax food and all, where his characters show great paranoia with a good hint of humor placed around the situation they are in and the place where they are present at that moment. Such sequences of paranoia are sprinkled across the movie, but nothing to explain such behavioral pattern, the audience are the one who left paranoid. And finally the most paranoid of all 'the actors', Zooey Deschanel has to be the worst actress for this year, who acted so paranoid even before anything had happened from her first scene where she gets a call which she does not intend to take! She was worse but was not alone, surprisingly Mark Wahlberg was also below or the guy just needs to stick with straight face roles.In the end, with its front leads coming up with below par scores along with a director whose career is in a free fall, the movie with its subtle messages for the citizens of the planet earth already blurred out, reaches its final conclusion, disaster and paranoia for the audience.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Made me rethink my status as an M. Night Shyamalan fan,"If you happen to be a fan of Fox's Family Guy, you may have seen the episode where they make fun of Stephen King's later works.

Ooooooo!"".The editor replies ""you're not even trying anymore are you?"" then he sighs and says ""okay, when can I have it?""""The Happening"" made me think that a scene similar to this must have played out between M Night and his production companies. This movie is to Shyamalan what Star Wars Episode 1 was to George Lucas - a sincere disappointment.It was such a shocking departure from his usually tight scripts, tense direction, and haunting atmosphere. It was a clunky, awkward movie - brimming with bad exposition dialog, confused character motivation, blatant plot holes, and seemingly first-take acting. On leaving the cinema, my wife and I commented that it seemed more like a first-draft screenplay than a polished, finished version... like something that was hacked out overnight to meet a deadline.There are a few interesting concepts, and a couple of touching scenes, and as usual in Shyamalan's works, the music was haunting. But for the most part it was simply awful. Up until now I was a big fan of Unbreakable, Signs, The Sixth Sense, and Lady in the Water. I even thought everyone's favorite M.

M. Knight  Happens!,"M. Night Shyamalan's latest suspense maze ""The Happening"" did not happen to be a box office hit; unfortunate that happened. Because I did happen to enjoy Shyamalan's apocalyptic-type spooky flick of an eerie naturist phenomenon that causes Northeasterners to behave bewildered and then commit suicide. Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot Moore, the small town Science Teacher who gets caught up in the middle of this suicidal mess with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel). The Moores want less of this catastrophic fatal occurrence by trying to escape to where the happening is not happening. I have a sixth sense that Shyamalan is back at his supreme directorial game again by expertly helming ""The Happening"" with unpredictable elements that have you stomped on what is going to happen next. Not much happening with the acting here, but this narrative is more of a director's den than an actor's playhouse. So I am not going to further comment on ""The Happening"" because I think you need it to happen by hopping on over to discover Shyamalan's ""Happening"" cinematic journey. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mr. Shyamalan or How I Learned to Start Worrying and Love the Plants.,"When mysterious force starts causing mass suicides in the cities, a school teacher and his friends flee to the country where they must fight to survive this deadly unknown phenomena.I've been a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan since Signs and I was one of maybe five people who actually liked The Village. Lady in the Water.... well that is another story. Anyhow I was still eager to see this latest work by Shyamalan and it truly did leave an impression on me. That impression was that he will likely never make another big-budgeted Hollywood film again. Sad, but true. The Happening is a very campy kind of disaster film. It has an intriguing premise but it's really muddled down by it's hammy dialog, lack of suspense, and performances that are just bizarre. Seriously, was Shyamalan's direction to Zooey Deschanel to act as if she were stoned through out the entire movie? Even the wonderful Mark Wahlberg is more awkward than anything else in this film. I know it's a poor film, yet...I found myself genuinely entertained by it. In a campy kind of way this movie did amuse me. It was funny at times, though unintentionally so, and even as the film didn't have the suspense or scares that I had hoped for it had enough action to keep it afloat. It was weird and off-beat and in the end I think it was the pure strangeness of it that saved it from being a bore.So what's my final verdict? Well, it's a tough call. I found it interesting and never dull, but I'm also the first to admit that it was pretty flawed. I say if you're a die-hard Shyamalan fan, go see it, if not I would do some internet investigating before seeing it. Either way, I think the time of M. Night Shyamalan has ended.** 1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An Honest and Calculated Review,"I am just now sitting down after returning from the 7:45 showing of The Happening at our local theater and after being asked twice what I thought about it, my immediate answer was: I...just don't know yet. I've had the drive home alone to better gather my two cents, so here goes.The movie as a whole...I don't feel got the experience and vision across that Night wanted us to have.One reason for this includes the fact that I feel some of the side actors were trying to lather up their acting chops to match that of the main characters--thus, the chemistry between the two groups was just blatantly off and the non-A listers just looked like a bunch of overactors.Then there's the spoken script. Characters in movies are all given silly lines from time to time and they just have to make it work, but in this film the lack of chemistry mentioned above often failed to resolve this and sometimes even normal lines seemed really strange when paired with the overactors.You might be wondering: any positives to mention?Well, I suppose. I think Mark W did a better job than most people here are giving him credit for. I'm not saying he's phenomenal in it, but there were a few moments where I do feel I was seeing a different side of him and where his natural standoffishness was working for the character. He and Zooey have decent chemistry, though I felt her acting was inconsistent at times. John Legiuzamo was decent; he can pull of being a father figure. The film score by James Newton Howard is nice when he's not trying to scare you, and when appropriate I felt it brought real emotion to the story and scenes where it was needed.In short, I am giving it an overall 5. I began with a 7 because I could see the kind of movie Night wanted to have which could have been great, but a 5 is representative of the product. Not horrible (i.e., not deserving of the 1's and 2's others have been putting on here..hello, we're putting this in the same league as Showgirls, The Neverending Story III, etc? I think not), but not his best film by far. I'm a huge fan and believe in him, but this was the first film where I didn't leave feeling thoughtful, inspired or ""changed"" for a moment. I just left uncertain of what to think of it all.It's not a film I will ever watch again, so perhaps the best course of action to take for the curious viewer would be to either wait until a friend rents it or wait a week until it is free to download off of the internet.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good story, average film-making, bad actors","Well, I really like Mr. Night Shyamala.. Shamyla... errr, his movies so far. I liked The Village despite its obvious plot flaws and I liked Lady in the Water as well, but this time..It is safe to say that the story itself has some potential. It could have been a really scary, entertaining, creepy movie - and it was at least sometimes, the opening sequences were actually really frightening, and Mrs. Jones really made my flesh creep.. But then, bad acting, especially Deschannel, really turned me off. She looked like a small child with wide eyes ALL the time. I felt that her acting resembled that of C-class TV-series actors.Anyway, the camera did a good job, but the editing sometimes appeared to be quite disrupting and jumped from scene to scene seemingly unmotivated, leaving me behind feeling like only taking glimpses at the story and what happened.And then there are the countless implausibilities and very ""unlikely"" events - and I'm not speaking of the story itself which was as I said not bad, better to say, promising.. No, the events as presented in the movie more than once let me think ""yeah, right...""Overall it was, despite the flaws in and the criticism on the movie-making handicraft and acting, an interesting movie, unconventionally and sometimes quite surrealistically filmed (as always with Mr. Night S. - I guess this times the unconventional and unsteady editing contributed to that feeling) and some good ideas and really good and scary scenes, but it seemed to be done in a rush, not very caring, not really a work of heart but a remittance work.BUT: I can't help but somehow I can't stop thinking about the movie..

Don't Believe The Bad Reviews - This Is An Awesome Movie Experience!,"Climate change causes the earth to reject humanity. An amazing psychological thriller/horror film.Why the bad reviews? Because republican sheep (the same sheep that have basements full of expired pre-packaged meals for ""the end times"") give bad reviews to any film project that expects them to think and to be accountable. Rush Limbaugh didn't like this movie, so middle-American talk-radio listeners don't like it, either. Therefore, an otherwise entertaining movie has to be ""liberal propaganda"" - simply because it operates on a scientific premise. (In case some of you didn't finish your 8th grade science textbook, I will fill you in on how it ends - Science doesn't vote, so it isn't conservative or liberal... it's just science.)This might qualify as a 'Family Friendly Horror' (if such a category can exist).

Nothing,"This film is nothing. There is little in character development and the characters play no role in solving a problem. Just a waste of time. It does not carry a moral, you also do not truly learn anything about the characters nor do you form a bond with the characters. Furthermore the people don't seem naturally autonomous before they are affected, thus making one indifferent to what might happen to characters. People are also needlessly, to a point that does not represent reality, which makes the film unattractive and unenjoyable. The film doesn't make you happy, nor sad...

M. Night once again does his best to not dole out cookie cutter films...,"Love him or hate him, his movies have a unique signature upon them that definitely separate him from the dozens of movies release each month from Hollywood. As a matter of fact, Hollywood apparently has run out of ideas remakes upon remakes, and now worse with movies like The Departed, Strangers, The Ring, and Bangkok Dangerous they're down to ripping off European/Asian movie directors for their ideas.This time M. Night strikes back with notable differences from all his other movies. First of, M. Night usually forgoes direct violence and gore and replaces it Hitchcock styled atmosphere/sound over gore. Looks like studios are tired of this and forced his hand. Interestingly enough, even with the added gore and violence, there was still a great deal of that ""atmosphere"" utilized to heighten everyone's awareness. A good deal of work was put in the sound fx to also put some flavor into several key moments.Like all M. Night's movies, there are SERIOUS flaws in The Happening. Bad acting across 4-5 scenes you simply cannot deny, just really dry delivered lines. A surprising number of no name actors is probably the reason for this, which leads to the music of the film. I haven't seen music this bad in a film this decade. It sure seems as if studios are cutting M. Night at the knees financially. Lastly, this blame will fall solely on the director, the pacing was a tad uneven, abrupt in some places that failed to achieve the desired effect I would say.Despite it's flaws, the plot and premise is quite interesting, even if it's a bit far-fetched. Once again I found myself smiling throughout the movie and enjoy this movie as if it were one of those old 50s B&W goofy horrors about a giant brain eating up half the planet. Shyamalan doesn't explain the plot in total detail, leaves you with several clues as to what triggered the main events and how the main characters dealt with those events. If you like weird sci-fi with dashes of brilliant horror footage, this is your movie. If you like M. Night movies not because they're full of action and violence, but because they're interesting and different.. you'll love The Happening. However if you have ADD, adrenaline junkie, or hyper-critical in your films.. you'll hate this film steer away.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An implausible but perhaps not impossible scenario,"This apocalyptic tale holds your attention and is based on an extreme extrapolation of what happens in nature. As people that follow medicine are well aware, most of the drugs, both good and bad, have their natural origin in plants. Specifically psychoactive drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and opium. It is also known that plants produce and release a variety of chemicals in response to environmental dangers.
The premise of this movie is that the plants in the United States are being subjected to a stressful environment due to human actions, so they respond by releasing a psychoactive chemical. When humans encounter the chemical, they experience an overwhelming compulsion to immediately kill themselves. Some of the suicides are horrific in nature, such as allowing themselves to be eaten by zoo lions.
The ""attack"" takes place in the New England states of the United States and the movie follows the adventures of Elliot Moore, his wife and the daughter of one of Elliot's friends as they flee the terror that is stalking them. Moore is a high school science teacher and he quickly learns that the attacks are triggered be specific circumstances.
The movie is at times very gross and explicit as people find very gory ways to kill themselves. There are moments that tensed me up and I am generally immune to screen fear. Human nature being what it is, you see the best and worst of what humans will do when in the grip of fear. There is also denial and the inevitable claim of government malfeasance before the movie ends on a pessimistic note.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There's Something Happening Here,"The Happening (2008) ***I should admit that I have a predilection for disaster flicks. My fascination with natural (or something like it)disasters on celluloid has lead me to give generally favorable reviews to otherwise not very strong films. I debated myself whether to go with a 2.5 star review or the positive 3 stars. I at first chose 2 1/2. I slept on it, and decided that I was interested enough in The Happening to kick it up half a star. This review is one of guilty pleasure, and may be against my critical judgment.This movie is preposterous, hammy, cheesy, corny and silly. Despite that, its execution is clever, and its premise is terrifying and, to me, extremely intriguing.An unknown natural disaster is affecting the North Eastern United States, beginning in New York City and spreading throughout the region. Eliott (Mark Whalberg) is a high school science teacher, who lectures his students on the disappearance of bees all over the country. He's soon after pulled out of his class room and informed that there is some kind of ""event"" happening. This event causes people to become disorientated, attacks their motor skills as they stand still or walk backwards, then triggers them to kill themselves. Suicides come en masse and no one is safe - other than animals. Eliott, his wife Alma (Deschanel), his friend Julien (Leguizamo) and his daughter hop a train to Pennsylvania in hopes that this ""event"" wont' be happening there. Of course it moves there, and they're train is stopped in the middle of nowhere after it loses contact with everyone. Stranded, they attempt to flee west, where the event is not happening. Julien, frantic over his wife who is in Princeton, heads off to find her, leaving his daughter with Eliott and Alma, who are struggling to keep their marriage afloat.The origins of the ""event"" are not really in the end officially determined - its proposed that the plants have released toxins as a self-defense mechanism; others propose its an army experiment gone awry, to which the government refuses to comment upon. The plant theory is the most precedent among the group. This of course equals trouble since they're stuck in the middle of nowhere surrounded by forestation.The Happening goes to some pretty extreme, and pretty silly lengths to get its message across. Some of the suicides are so over the top they're comical - I'm still unsure if Shyamalan was in on this little joke or not. There are other moments which seem to be added for nothing more than shock value. The movie is rated R, and it earns it with a number of moments.Shyamalan certainly has a strong talent for direction and photography - the film shows that definitely - but he is deeply lacking in the writing department. Tracing back his films, there has always been a weakness in his writing - dialogue is often contrived and expositional when its unnecessary, dating from the Sixth Sense to Signs (both films which I like very much). Poor writing hurts The Happening, and there a few cringe worth moments of foolishness. There are scenes where it sounds as if voices were dubbed in later to explain what we just saw in case we didn't pick up on it ourselves. There is a scene near the end that offers this method of clarification, where the problem isn't actually that it was explained through dialogue (it probably needed it) but the manner it was done. A shot cuts to outside of a house, and Eliott's voice cues to sum up what just happened in one exposition heavy sentence, end scene. I'm not suggesting that I necessarily have a better way to clear this up, but its done so poorly that I simply must be possible. What comes after that is also extremely clichéd and entirely tacked on for no reason other than sentimental posturing. This of course is the fault of the writing. Oh, and also get ready for people to say the word ""happening"" or some variation thereof at every chance.Nevertheless, Shyamalan's directing chops are still sharp, and there are some very effective moments throughout the film. The manner of how people are affected is not only interesting, but awesomely eery and creepy. There is something about seeing a entire park of people stop dead in their tracks and become disorientated that his a nerve. There are moments in the film where when these people stand still that it almost seems to take on the creepiness of a similar scene in a far different film. Alain Resnais's Last Year at Marienbad has a famous scene in which two people talk on balcony overlooking a garden at a hotel. The people in the garden stand entirely still as they cast shadows but plants and other fixtures cast none. I suspect that if you know this shot, it will make the scenes in The Happening that much creepier. The pacing of the movie (which has a fairly short run time) has been attacked as ""too slow"" and ""nothing happens."" I actually thought the pacing of the film was one of its strongest assets. It takes its time, and I enjoy that in a film.From what I've said here I'm really not justifying giving this a positive review, however its the premise of the film, which I think is so deeply interesting and truly scary, that keeps this afloat, but may also damn it at the same time. I will say it here and now that I am disappointed, and frankly if it came out tomorrow that The Happening was being remade, I would jump to see it get a do-over. Either way, I was still entertained by this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
absolutely horrendous,"Allow me to provide some background information on my relationship with the films of M. Night Shyamalan: I adored ""The Sixth Sense"" and still think of it as one of the best films of 1999 and one of the best supernatural thrillers in ages. ""Unbreakable"" was a fascinating take on the superhero genre. I loved parts of ""Signs"" to bits and consider the sequence in the basement towards the end of the film one of the finest examples of suspenseful build-up in recent film history. I even liked ""The Village"" and could easily dismiss ""Lady in the Water"" as a mere misfire. I was greatly anticipating ""The Happening"", especially as it seemed to be echoing one of my favorite guilty pleasures- the paranoid 70's sci-fi thriller.Let's get one thing out of the way- ""The Happening"" is unbelievably, impossibly, ridiculously, hilariously, inconceivably bad. Normally I would refuse to rate any film that had any good scenes or that was well-directed less than four out of ten, but ""The Happening"" has to have one of the worst scripts among recent big-budget Hollywood films. It's absolutely shocking how retarded the logic behind this is and how poor so much of the dialogue is. This script began as ""The Green Effect"", a tremendously poor (trust me, I read parts of it) script by Shyamalan that was soundly rejected and eventually reworked into ""The Happening"". Having seen the critical reaction to ""The Happening"" prior to going into the film I found myself pleasantly surprised by basically the first thirty, forty minutes of the film. It was nothing special but it had something going for it, Shyamalan's direction was top-notch, and Wahlberg was playing the sort of goofy science teacher I'd loved (and loved to hate on occasion) in high school.Then the descent began. The bulk of this film is some of the most hilariously awful crap produced by a talented filmmaker since Schaffner's ""Sphinx"". Shyamalan, who was using close-ups and steadicam shots to frankly brilliant effect early on, begins to use the same shots to comical effect. There is one painfully, painfully long close-up of Mark Wahlberg pleading for time to think and then calling for his group to 'keep ahead of the wind' that is up there with Nicolas Cage in ""The Wicker Man"" in terms of hilariously awful acting. That scene may very well be the turning point in the film, with Wahlberg's acting becoming more ridiculous by the second, culminating in a performance that essentially wipes from memory all his tremendous recent achievements as an actor. I don't blame Wahlberg for this, I blame Shyamalan. Wahlberg claims Shyamalan tried to force him into real paranoia so his performance would work better. What happens here (no pun intended) is that Wahlberg ends up looking amazingly uncomfortable for the last hour of this thing and struggles to deliver any reasonable line deliveries.Okay, I do have to credit Zooey Deschanel for making this movie watchable. Besides being amazingly, ridiculously gorgeous she is a fine actress and creates a sympathetic character (and a fairly well-drawn one at that- one of the few pros in Shyamalan's script). There's also the score: oh my it's gorgeous. Seriously, ignore this film and just buy the score CD by James Newton Howard- it's brilliant.""The Happening"" starts out well but ends up being an absolute embarrassment. I was prepared for a mediocre offering- perhaps a misguided effort such as ""Lady in the Water"". I was not expecting a disaster on the level of ""The Happening"". Its last forty minutes and especially its last ten minutes or so are among the worst I have seen in a long time.Have you ever wondered if it was possible for a film to go from enjoyable to absolutely horrendous in the space of ten or fifteen minutes? ""The Happening"" is proof that it can, pardon the (intentional) pun, happen. Evren Buyruk from USA",,Anonymous,Mystery

Marlborough County,"A few years ago, when I suffered from depression, I made a list of pros and cons for the purpose of ""the meaning of living on"".I said to myself, among other things that I would miss the future works of M. Night Shyamalan if I say goodbye to existence.
For me that was one of the reasons to stay alive.Today I think seriously about whether it was worth it.Shyamalan again presents us with a dubious parable, the earth with its green resembles the human lungs and their possible ""defense mechanisms"" (Marlborough greetings), but unfortunately the range is too wide.This work is also convincing with its subtle camera work and creates a feeling of closeness, but I still wonder about the cast.After Shyamalan went quite wrong when casting the children in ""unbreakable"" and also ""The Signs"", this time he shows us the adult actress Zooey Deschanel as a repeated mistake.I notice a Michael Jackson Syndrome here, which expresses itself in not abandoning a conviction, almost doggedly in the belief that the first impression cannot be the wrong one and this perspective is uncomfortably ""challenged"" from the viewer, because such a demand is haughty and therefore without any distance.These children, like Zooey, may be able to convince in real encounters with their extraordinary transparency and ""purity"", but this transparency appears to be captured on film as it is called = transparentWhat a shame ...

"Could This Movie Be Better Than We Thought...What, No?!","The Good: I, like most people, hated the Happening when it came out. This dumpster fire of a movie was reflective of how bad M Night Shyamalan had gotten, yet another glorious - and hilarious - failure of a man some dubbed ""the next Spielberg."" Let's move on.But, watching this movie with fresh eyes, I couldn't help but like it a little more. Maybe the terrible performances and dialog have been seared into my mind to such an extent that I just look past them. Maybe I better understand the silly concept in 2022, when climate change is more of an existential threat hanging over humanity. Maybe, I'm just not in the mood to keep making fun of the most prolific Indian-American director in Hollywood. Who knows.The Happening, upon rewatch nearly 10 years later, isn't as bad as I think we all made it out to be. There's an off putting, weird quality to this movie that reminds me of 1970s science fiction and horror; the lingering shots, the lack of music, the strange side characters. It's a movie with heady ideas that manages to communicate them relatively well. It's a creative film that was ahead of its time (the virus-as-monster movie is certainly popular now) and has some genuinely horrifying sequences (the scene where John Leguizamo dies is actually so good).It's not a perfect movie, but it's actually quite fun, thought provoking, and harkens back to a time when slow, plodding stories were more acceptable. I don't think it's as nearly as bad as we all agreed it was.The Bad: Okay, but that all being said, there are some unforgivable aspects to this movie. Wahlberg and Deschanel are not good choices for the protagonists of his movie; neither of them really fit the characters they're supposed to be and their line deliveries are some of the funniest moments in this film. There's also the consistent issue Shymalan has with bad dialog and stilted performances, which continue even today. I genuinely think the man knows that's what he's asking his actors to do, but sees it as his own style.It's not *good,* per se, but it is unique. And yes, there's the stupid hot dog scene, there's the ""trying to kill me in my sleep scene,"" there's the way all the extras stand around listening to one person at a time and acting super weird. There's the abrupt and nonsensical ending and logical inconsistencies (the amount of people in a group should have no impact on whether the toxins, once released into the air, affect those people).There's a lot of bad here too.The Ugly: But, all of that in mind, I can't help but appreciate this weird, stupid, unique, 70's throwback movie. Even the bad moments elevate it because I'd rather laugh than feel nothing at all. It's a movie that makes trees and wind kind of scary (I mean, seriously, we'd all be dead in this movie, stop lying to yourself).For that, I think The Happening is better than we collectively decided it was.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Story boring characters,"I think this movie has its place among those which have to be seen but surely can be forgotten very fast.The story is very similar to ""Der Schwarm"" a novel written by the German author Frank Schaetzing; veryvery recommended to read; in 2002 or something around.Creatures of the sea become dangerous and produce toxics which seem to be able to kill all mankind. But then the planctonic algae decide within their metamorphic mind to let the humans live. It was just a warning to mankind not to destroy the nature especially the marine environment.I think shyalaman stole the storyline, or maybe he bought it, and then transferred it upon the earth and into terrestral liveforms. Marc Whalberg and this woman with the big blue eyes, really acted as bad as Tom Hanks and the french actress in sacrileg.So just seven points for this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Terrible,"Ever had that bad taste in your mouth when you watch a movie? well this is one of those films. the plot caught my attention ""a virus causes people to commit suicide"" i was like hmm interesting. then the movie started and it was the worst film he has ever done. His best film was Sixth Sense in my eyes and Signs was pretty good as well except for the very end. then came the village which i knew straight away his films are really loosing its touch. then after that came Lady in the water which i thought was his worse. Then the happening. Zoey Deschanel was the only reason why i wanted to watch the movie and she in a way let me down. Directing was Amateur at best and the way it was written was terrible with stupid jokes which feel like they didn't even try.

Interesting if flawed,"An interesting film with an unusual idea. It's fairly gripping from the start and continues to attract the attention. The story line is far from brilliant and the acting and direction are indifferent but it kept me watching for its full length, which is more than I can say for most modern films. The television version that I saw was certainly cut, which left a few questions, though some scenes are pretty horrific while being well in keeping with the story line.That said, the ending makes clear that it's a film about potential ecological disaster of all sorts. Frankly, I find myself in sympathy with the film and its message although I feel that it might have been better delivered. The characters are poorly developed and seem mostly emotionless, even when confronted by a terrifying predicament; unfortunately, it seems that everyone involved was convinced that it was a 'B' movie and all they had to do was turn up and go through the motions. I get the feeling that it could have been a far better film if it had been slightly longer and treated more seriously.For the idea and approach, it could be an 8. For the acting and reality, it's probably a 5. Overall, I'd watch it again which means it has to be at least a 6; if 6.5 was allowed, that would be the mark. I'm wavering, but on balance and because I believe it has truth, I'll give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutely horrendous,"This will be a short comment I'm afraid, this has become the major letdown of this year. All these 'expectations' only to be shattered by terrible acting (((Wahlberg's acting comes to mind))), a completely ridiculous plot and a story that's just not delivering. And what about those completely hollow characters? And the weird 'framing' of the scenes? The trailer may have indeed been the best thing and left you with lots of questions but that's about it. The death scenes were also great and could stir up some emotions (hint : tree - car - ...) but to put your focus on some gory scenes? Unfortunately I went to see this movie this evening and I'm afraid that Mr Night will only remembered over here by his ""masterpiece"" (in our opinion) the 6th Sense and to a lesser degree Unbreakable/ The Village and Signs...

you never know....,"While there was some cheesy acting, disturbing death scenes, mass paranoia and hysteria, these things make up the components of a cult classic. I wouldn't be surprised if, like many of Shyalaman's features, turns into a midnight movie. Think about it. Besides what I've already mentioned, there's a doe eyed heroine played by Zooey Deschanel who stumbles around from scene to scene. Now recall all the old paranoia horrors and you'll find every nuance of The Happening as cheesy but equally frightening as any other cult classic. No matter which way you look at it, The Happening raises many questions about humanity environmentally and internally. People were afraid of Russian terrorists and aliens in the fifties and we're afraid of virtually the same things, this just happens to be a modern retelling.Additionally, I have to give a shout out to the person who wrote the review titled ""the not so happening"".

Amazing,"Without a doubt the worst acting I've seen from the notable actors in this film. I have made it through a few MNS movies and I get the impression that he directs the actors to wear a slack jawed look of confusion and incredulity.The premise had potential to be at the least a good movie with a warning to our indifference to the world we evolved from. Leguizamo has shown a range of believable acting throughout his career, but Zooey and Walberg seem best suited for the stoner brand of comedy they are known for.As for MNS, I find his films are overrated and rely on shock value to prop up his films into the suspense genre he seems eager to be a part of.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Happening wasn't as good as his first few movies, but it definitely wasn't as bad as lady in the water or the village. This movie provides a sense of fear from start to finish, as the action starts right at the first scene and doesn't stop. The plot was good, they could have taken it in a whole different direction and if planned out more this movie could have been a lot better. The acting performances were good as well, especially Mark Wahlberg. I don't know what people are saying, that he cant be a ""nice guy"" in movies.

unclear what's happening in this movie,"Elliot Moore is an innovative Philadelphia science teacher whose marriage is on the rocks. That's the least of his worries however when a mysterious endemic strikes the northeast region of the United States, causing erratic behavior, violence, and even death among the general population. Along with a group of survivors, it's a race against time to try and make it to safety before their fates are quickly sealed. M. Night Shyamalan's latest showing is interesting, startling, unusual, but also frustratingly uneven; from one point of view it's a supernatural tale of human survival, from another it's a domestic exploration of love and reconciliation, and from yet another it's a deliberately distant, ambiguous story thread designed to pull viewers along before they realize there's really no point. A miscast Wahlberg tries gallantly to pull it off with a straight face, while some of his co-stars seem to be reading off of cue cards. At times serious, at times unintentionally silly (?) it plays mostly as a mixed bag. ""Different"" would probably be the most accurate description. **",,Anonymous,Mystery
Confused? Yeah me too!,"Starting off with my review I thought the movie was most definitely a 5/10.

However, I feel like they did a good job on trying to make the story believable. In the final scene where the woman was affected by the toxin because it had spread to where they were it didn't make much sense that she got it because she was by herself.

"What's happening? A decent alternative to the summer blockbuster, that's what happening.","M. Night Shyamalan has had a rocky track record as of late. While The Sixth Sense was a huge hit both financially and critically, his films have slowly been declining in critical praise and box office performance ever since, which was apparent from Lady in the Water, which didn't manage to break even during it's run and was generally viewed as one of 2006's worst films. The Happening is his first new project since his last disaster and it's been billed as Shyamalan's first R-rated movie. Despite the heavier rating, The Happening is similar in style, theme and content to Shyamalan's other films, although it's a bounce back in the right direction after a few mishaps.The Happening chronicles an epidemic that sweeps the North-East coast of America. At first thought to be the result of a terrorist attack, large groups of people begin to become disoriented, lose their speech and commit mass suicide at random. The events occur sporadically, first in Central Park, then throughout New York City and eventually spreading throughout the whole North-East coast. Elliot Moore, a New York high school teacher, desperately tries to seek safety with his wife, Alma, and his best friend's daughter, Jess, as people begin inflicting death upon themselves all around them.While the film was billed as a visceral, gory R-rated horror, that couldn't be further from the truth. The Happening is more of a drama that focuses on a horrific event, rather than a straight-up horror movie. This will be familiar for fans of Shyamalan who have likely grown accustomed to his slow-moving, atmospheric films that focus much more on character than they do on generating scares. This isn't to say that the film is without its freaky moments. Some of the mass suicides, particularly one where construction workers begin plunging to their deaths, are incredibly eerie and unsettling. The idea of people turning on themselves is creepy in itself, as one can really only rely on themselves in life. By having people randomly commit suicide, Shyamalan taps into the fear of people turning on themselves and he's got the visual style to create some very chilling imagery revolving around the suicides. His use of long wide shots allows the audience to focus on what's happening, as opposed to using jumpy, sporadic cuts that end up detracting from the content (like most horror/action directors use these days). Shyamalan's already proved himself to be a master of suspense with The Sixth Sense, and there are a few shocking moments throughout the film which had me jumping out of my seat that hark back to his horror debut.The downside seems to be that in an attempt to get an R-rating, Shyamalan has thrown in numerous useless instances of gore. I'll admit I'm a huge fan of gore and violence, but it really feels out of place in a film like this. A scene in which lions bite a man's arm off or a scene where a man is torn apart by a lawnmower seems unnecessary and at odds with the rest of the film. Obviously it was a marketing strategy, but it detracts from the movie as a whole.Another weak point of Shyamalan's is his script, particularly the dialog. While he's a great director, especially at building up suspense, and he's skilled enough when working with the plot, storyline and the twists he has become famous for, his dialog is really weak. Often the stuff they say is rather ridiculous and unrealistic (a young soldier says ""Cheese and crackers"" as opposed to a more common expletive) and it ends up evoking laughter in the audience. The attempts at comedy are also fairly poor, with characters randomly talking about ""hot dogs"" and other things of the sort. Shyamalan's strong suit isn't comedy and while humor could be a nice contrast in a dour movie like this, it doesn't work here.The acting is also fairly bad, which is a surprise considering the cast. Mark Walberg and John Leguizamo have proved themselves to be good actors, but here they are pretty terrible, and most of the blame can be pinned on Shyamalan. They are both notorious for playing tough guys and here they're miscast, both portraying soft-spoken teachers. The issues with the dialog don't help them much either, and they're always overacting, in an attempt to appear more ""nerdy"" or things of similar nature. Zooey Deschanel is entirely wrong for her role, as Wahlberg's wife, and even the character is developed poorly. She talks like a character out of ""Juno"" (with the quips on the phone about Joey being a stalker) and she seems to quirky and unnatural for a movie like this, which stays fairly grounded in reality, at least for a horror. It's obvious that despite Shyamalan's directorial finesse behind the camera, he's not nearly as gifted when working with actors.The Happening isn't nearly as good as some of Shyamalan's other efforts, nor is it nearly as bad as some. It's a decently good eco-thriller that manages to conjure up some good scares, with a message beneath them all. It's not the best horror film, but it's one of the more original ones to come out recently. It definitely doesn't deserve the critical drubbing it has gotten, but then again, the same critics smashing this film are praising mindless drivel like The Incredible Hulk, so it's to be expected that a more thoughtful film would be trashed. If you're tired of seeing the standard cookie-cutter summer blockbusters, do yourself a favor and give The Happening a shot.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sh*t happens.,"Made in the middle of M. Night Shyamalan's fall from grace as a promising, young director, ""The Happening"" deserves its infamous reputation as a mess of a movie. However, the ridiculous premise and painfully awkward acting performances make it a contemporary classic so-bad-it's-good film.Mark Wahlberg's bargain-bin Matt Damon shtick falls flat in this film, as he's terribly miscast as a science teacher who displays symptoms of the Happening, constantly appearing confused and disoriented even when he hasn't been affected by it. It's a good thing Zooey Deschanel found success with her quirky persona, because without it, her performance makes the viewer envious of the characters who offed themselves.

This isn't what you'd expect from the trailer.,"I would like to start of by saying that this movie didn't live up to the expectations that I had for it from the buildup the last few months of waiting. I WAS looking for an all-out thriller that would scare the crap out of me throughout the entire movie. I left the theater having been entertained, but confused about how I felt.I thought about it for a while and decided that it just wasn't what I was expecting. This doesn't mean I didn't like it, doesn't mean it was better than what I was hoping for, just different. I think I want to blame this on the trailers being developed for movies these days. Lately it seems too much is being done with trailers. Anyone else agree? ""Twists"" are given away in thrillers, all the funny parts are shown for comedies, and sometimes movies are advertised as something they just aren't.Shortly after leaving the theater I decided that this movie is more like a parody than a thriller. The performances were obviously cheesy. They were great, in quite a not-so-subtle way. The thing that further impresses me is that the scary parts were truly intense and the funny parts were honestly funny. Everyone else in my packed theater seemed to think things were funny as well, as I heard them laugh. I suppose they think that the performances and humor were accidental and this is maybe a reason for their hatred of this movie. I also think it is because of the let downs everyone had for the buildup of the trailer.If you go to this movie expecting an all-out thriller, you probably will be upset. If you go expecting an M. Night Shamyalan ""Sixth Sense"" you're going to for sure be let down. Go to have fun. Go to be scared. Go to watch a parody of disaster movies. You'll have a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The behaviors of the people and the 'green effects' were by far one of the more original things I've seen in a long time which is usually the case with M. Night. I like the full blown involvement he shows to his works and it shows in this follow-up to the box office let down but not total disappoint of ""The Lady in the Water"" which I found cute and a perfect bedtime story. Disney didn't care for it, but what do they know.The story did end more abruptly than I wished and showed possible sequel elements but since I've not seen a sequel from M. Night, it won't be Happening I am sure.I see the pans of the film and I see how critical people can be if something isn't spoon fed to them by the pacifier-ridden audiences of the new generation and even older generation.Take it for what it is, what is shows, enjoy what it offers, let your imagination wander along with the story and forget about what it is SUPPOSED to be and how YOU would direct it, etc. Just enjoy it.I AM liberal in the sense that if I find worth in a movie, I will rate it accordingly to how it made me feel and how I felt after the movie and by this, I rate it as something you should view or at least rent, if not own.Depth was not involved, almost like other movies like ""Cloverfield"", where every single detail isn't defined for you but this doesn't bother me but does apparently bother others. I am a person who likes to view snippets of time, life, and imagination and doesn't need book and Hollywood endings to bring me to climax. I learned how to do that in Junior High by myself.Perhaps those that pan so vehemently should learn the same. Don't judge a movie by such intricacies but yet an overall feeling that it evokes. If none, then it is fair to raise your opinion, but to use industry jargon and motives just don't do well for most viewers.By the way, you will see that most of the comments I make are about movies I like. I WILL pan movies I don't like but seldom spend the energy to do so and leave it to the star ratings mostly. Perhaps some should do the same.Good movie. Great originality. Good presentation. Shocking. Leaves you begging for more and by the covers I've seen of DVD releases, there is an HOUR more of footage possible? Cannot wait to see if true.

"Before ""Bird Box""...","""The Happening"" is a Thriller - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch a high school science teacher, his wife and the young daughter of a friend, trying to survive from a very strange force that changes the behavior of everyone in the most strange and horrible way. They have only some theories that made by them in order to run and hide and since scientists don't know have any answers or explanations about this force they will follow their instincts.I have to admit that since I had already watched the movie ""Bird Box"" and a lot of people compared these two movies I had high expectations from this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by this movie because it didn't have an interesting plot or as some other people mentioned it didn't have a plot at all. I didn't like the direction which was made by M.

Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I expected more from Mark Wahlberg who played as Elliot Moore the high school teacher and from Zooey Deschanel who played as Alma Moore his wife.Finally, I have to say that ""The Happening"" isn't a good movie, it has a lot of plot holes that aren't covered which is combined with a very poor direction and has as a result, an average movie.

"i ""happened"" to enjoy it (snicker)","after the disappointing and obnoxious egotism of lady in the water made a mediocre m night shyamalan movie seem amazing by comparison, but for some reason i really did enjoy the happening more than the village and lady.from the opening credits i knew i was not about to be disappointed, while most people create credits with a black screen and long shot of a city shyamalan gives an eerie pattern of slow moving clouds and a discordant progressive overture, i mostly skip credits on DVD but i will watch this odd arrangement again and again.the rest of the movie holds up in a similar way, unexpected and(usually) pleasurably so. the deaths are a new type of horror for shyamalan not startle or jump out at you but more of disturbance and unsettling presences, the cinematography and imagery hold up beautifully, the screenplay, not always so. after the old English dialog the village and the awkwardness of lady in the water i forgot how skilled m night is at writing dial and crafting realistic characters and sometimes he seems to forget himself. the couples feuding over having a dinner date with a friend(played by m night shyamalan) is borderline absurd and definitely laughable, and an extended conversation with an older couple is an attempt to be funny but is an obvious blunder as comedy and a lazy and awkward way to advance the plot.overall this is a good transitional movie of m night movie away from misguided experimentation and back towards hard hitting urban horror, come with an open mind and you will enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Happening Night!,"Saw this movie yesterday... on Friday the 13th...last show which started at 2230 hrs. I was expecting a real thriller and rater R horror flick, Night didn't disappoint this time. I was very upset after watching Lady In the water... couldn't believe it was from Night. Mark Wahlberg stole the entire show. Brilliant job.. although this role was totally different from what he play in The Departed.. nonetheless, it was perfect. what i liked in this movie, is that it was very much different from a typical Night genre movie. the happening of events could be very much real. in a nutshell, it was a very good concept. i would give it a 7/10 the best part: James Newton's music & of course, Mark W. the worst & wasted part: ZoeyGo, watch it once...",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Some of those suicide scenes made me queasy...also, at the end of all his movies he leaves your mind working after it is over. At the end of The Village, you have to decide for yourself if Luscious is saved. In Lady in the Water, you have to decide if Story really did impact all the people she met.

What? No!,"... As stated by Mark Wahlberg in the 'The Happening'. This absolutely phenomenal and in depth dialogue really describes this film perfectly. It is obvious Wahlberg was breaking the fourth wall at this particular moment while referring to the film.In all honesty though, i can and will never understand how this film is directed by the same director as the masterpiece 'The Sixth Sense'. M. Night Shyamalan isn't know for his consistency, but the difference in quality between these two films is just enormous. There is probably not a single other director out there that has a greater gap in the quality of two of his films. There is just no explanation how Shyamalan turns from The Sixth Sense to this bunch of nonsense. With the knowledge that Shyamalan is in fact actually capable of producing something amazing, the fact that this film is such utter trash really supports the suggestion that this was done on purpose.Now for the substantial part... The Happening is horribly acted, lazily and poorly written & terribly framed and photographed. Now, Mark Wahlberg is an actor that in the past has proven himself to be an adequate factor in most of his films ( See his performances in either Boogie Nights or The Departed ), so his absolutely atrocious performance in this film is for the most part also thanks to Shyamalan, who also wrote the screenplay. Shyamalan's screenplay is full of illogicalities and unintentionally funny moments. There are so many scenes in The Happening where something bad happens, and never do any of the character seem to react to it. They just stand there, not moving, like a bunch of 'uninvolved observers!' as Zooey Deschanel states. This is a recurring theme throughout the film. There is for example a scene in which some people hear a gunshot from behind a hill, and they do absolutely nothing. They do not run away or run towards it. They just do nothing except stare in front of themselves. There is also a scene where two characters are blown away by shotguns from inside a house on a porch, after which two other characters sit in front of said porch for another two minutes while the shotgun guys are still in there. Wahlberg also talks to a tree, which is saying enough. There is also a lot of irrelevant newspaper exposition, which is ofcourse one of the most annoying forms of exposition because it involves characters nobody knows who talk about circumstantial things which do not tell the audience anything we did not already know. But hey, Shyamalan thinks his viewers are idiots, so why not? In short, all of these nonsensical character moments make this one of the worst screenplays ever made.As for the acting, everyone is complete garbage. Mark Wahlberg, who as stated before is definitely not a bad actor, obviously doesn't look like he wants to be in this film, perhaps due to some feeling of shame as he must have already felt how terrible this was going to be. Unfortunately for him, this performance does really make him seem like a bad joke, although Shyamalan's dialogue doesn't help either. His immortal sarcastic utterly unconvincing line delivery of 'What? No!' really emphasizes his will of being in this film. Although once again there is a lot of dialogue that no actor could have pulled off convincingly. Zooey Deschanel is nearly as bad as Wahlberg, but i think if the screentime of both characters were reversed that these roles would also be reversed, since she is too absolutely terrible. 'Just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that can be invented' is ofcourse a terrible line of dialogue by Shyamalan, but Deschanel's delivery is something else entirely.The cinematography is plain bloated and ugly, with absolutely terrible framing. There are many weird choices of close ups instead of widescreen ( Especially in a sequence that is supposed to be intense when another group is being executed behind a near hill ) which really create an awkward and unintentionally hilarious situation. This is not like a Leone film where the close ups are so immersive and involving due to it being an emotional and visual responder to when something is going to happen, but just an awkward piece of framing that becomes an unintentional hilarity. These are dumb characters with dumb dialogue standing still like a bunch of idiots while people are getting slaughtered. Close ups here do not emphasize the intensity, but only emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation. Not to mention there are many shots where certain people are simply not in frame. The rule of thirds is almost never used and it results in many unremarkable and ugly shots.The only positive about 'The Happening' is James Newton Howard's score, which was a superb emotional piece. Too bad for him it is wasted on such a terrible and forgettable film, although the unintentional hilariousness of it will still linger in a lot of minds.The Happening is a terrible film. Yet it is still a very likeable terrible film, because of its laughably unconvincing line deliveries and horrendous dialogue. Unfortunately Shyamalan was really going for the psychological terror approach here in the context of Hitchcock's The Birds and thus this does not really work out since the framing and the deliveries of these horrendous line make this more like a comedy than something that is supposed to be disturbing or scary, because both are nonexistent in this film.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A good movie, but not Shyamalan's best","After being extremely let down by Shyamalan's last film, ""Lady in the Water"", I did not know if this movie would be worth seeing. Since I enjoyed ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" so much I gave it a chance. I was pleased with this decision.The happening has been advertised as Shyamalan's first R rated movie. I believe this is due to the pure shock factor this movie has. Through out most of the movie my jaw was dropping to the floor, not because of gore, but because of shock. This movie shows excellent portrayal of what real people would do in this situation. Despite the criticism, Mark Wahlburg has a pretty good performance as Elliot Moore, the science teacher. His part could have been written better, but he does a nice job of acting it out.The reason this movie is not excellent? The plot. This movie does not have a clever way to put things together like in Shyamalan's other films. The climax in this film hardily exists. This movie has an OK idea but Syamalan did not do anything to make it more interesting. However this does not ruin the movie. The violent deaths and shocking scenes keep this movie alive. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Don't over-analyze this movie, otherwise you won't like it!!!!","I can't believe all the negative reviews this movie is having. And it baffles me when I read comments that over-analyzes the movie, saying ""this is not possible"", ""that is not likely to happen"", etc. First, it's a MOVIE, second, it's a FICTIONAL movie. If you start looking at movies that way, you're going to be left out with not much to enjoy. Doesn't anyone know how to enjoy a movie anymore? Have fun watching it? Can anyone see a deeper meaning, an image of what someone has to say anymore? Oh and why exactly a movie absolutely NEEDS a twist? Because it doesn't necessarily.Maybe people has come to expect too much of Shyamalan. I guess that happens when you make an awesome movie early in your career. And probably the fact that I wasn't expecting much of The Happening based on all the negative reviews, helped me enjoy it. But nonetheless, I enjoyed this movie. No, it's not as good as others he's made, but it's far from his worse. The acting was decent (I've seen much MUCH worse), and I really liked the few shocking sequences (unfortunately, it seems that a lot of people has become too used to seeing shocking things, and therefore did not find those sequences very shocking, unlike I did). And the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful, enchanting.So basically, if you think of watching this movie, keep in mind to not expect too much, and just sit back and enjoy it.

It's watchable, short, has a few scary moments, and a thought provoking central idea (plants actually DO release chemicals that affect animal behavior, and presumably plants have evolved this ability as a defense mechanism).

A Movie ahead of it's time,"Before watching this movie don't go on the internet and read reviews about it at all. Because if you do it this way, you will not be truly open minded to what the movie is trying accomplish. And before watching this movie really ask yourself how you feel about the state of the world today, considering all the talks of it ending in 2012.I thought Mark Walberg and Zooey Deschanel did a great job with the movie. The problem that I had with M.Night's previous work ""Lady in the Water"" was simply, the characters didn't act normal, and they all seemed to strive to be too peculiar due to the fact that this was an M.Night movie. I saw this to be the problem in the first 10 minutes of the ""Happening"", but it was quickly rescued starting with the believable acting role of John Leguizamo. In the end it was additionally all brought together by the very complicated relationship of Walberg and Deschanel(Which was great!) The reason I say this movie was ahead of it's time is because it directly deals with scaring one not by folkloric trickery, CGI, or funny shaped monsters, or super sudden and expected killing patterns, but by the scientific possibility of something that could totally happen to our planet.Of course majority of the thrill seeking youth won't be excited after having seen this one, as it doesn't have to do with a Big Bad Wolf, along with three little Piggys, or some super predictable eerie killing creature that can't be stopped until the end. Even adults who don't broaden their minds will have a hard time grasping hold of this film. People always want the norm, and things to happen in the natural order of the standard desire. After watching this movie I know that the fact that M.Night can scare me by the howl of the wind, and the crinkle of leaves and plants is a true art form in itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Good Horror, Not The Greatest Shyamalan(but NOT that bad)","M. Night Shyamalan, tries to make a summer horror movie, with no pretensions. The problem lies that pretensions are what make some artist's good, it's their ambition(insane, and annoying at times though it may be), that makes them so vital. ""Lady In ...(read more)The Water"" was ridiculous but it was interesting, it's arguable, it has ideas greater than itself. ""The Happening"" is an example of what you see is what you get. There is no twist here, just survival and some thin guess work for a plot, some very intense sequences, and an ending which has some subtle hints at environmental crisis and the woes of global self-destruction.People continuously go see Nights movies expecting ""revelations"", when at best he's made some clever twists and subversion's of standard speculative fiction conventions; ghosts, superheros, aliens, fairy tales, utopias and monster myths, etc. He stands out as much as he does because he makes interesting genre films in places other's wont tread, or tread poorly. At a time when all movies are either franchise attempts or remakes or both, it's nice to see someone(anyone), at least try and think of something new.It just feels like people expect Night to be Hitchcock, when really he's somewhere between him and Larry Cohen.So what's left is a good pop corn horror film, with some original images, good music, a few awkward bits in the dialog, but over all decent writing with some light comedic touches(very needed), for effect. I think as a director overall he's grown, while as a story teller, he may be running on steam. Even though it's not as thought provoking as his other films, it's got all the suspense and dramatic tension, audiences have been waiting for since ""Signs"". So a little disappointing, but overall still worth checking out.(Spoiler Following): There's a lot places the plot could have actually gone, there are theories that the evolution of flowers helped wipe out the dinosaurs, which I was just sure this movie would mention, but it Dian't...or maybe something more with communication between human and plants(hinted, joked at, but never done). The movie makes it clear that ""man"" is the problem, like the ending of ""Planet Of The Apes"", one can imagine M. Night Shyamalan somewhere on a beach banging his fists into the sand shouting ""You blew it up you maniacs"" at the statue of Liberty, however in 2008, pointing out that man is self destructive an enemy of the environment of the planet, is like shooting fish in a barrel. Every movie from Godzilla to Frankenstien tries to point out how were messing up the natural balance, only Night doesn't seem to see any possible end in sight, just the beginnings of crests on a terrible wave of future problems(which is fair, and if nothing else honest), and so it seems the optimist of ""Lady In The Water"" and ""Signs"" where we had hope and each other to believe in, has finally given in to modern pessimism (remember all those cars driving away from the dinner)...were all f*&ked, we are a disease...but at least we got movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Shyamalan's politics are plastered all over this movie. Al Gore probably coproduced this pitiful film. Shyamalan really went out of his way to plaster his politics all over this movie in the most unmistakable way.However, if morbidity is your style and you can't get enough of gratuitous graphic death scenes.

Half Happening,"Something the supposed contemporary auteur, M. Night Shyamalan, has never been quite good at is getting directly to the point. He usually likes to keep us guessing the whole way through and by the time the expected twist tries to catch us off guard, we are either completely floored or entirely annoyed. In his latest offering, THE HAPPENING, he finally learns how to get straight to the punch but that, as it turns out, is just as problematic as keeping us in suspense. Shyamalan seems as if he has been somewhat humbled by his recent difficulties finding an audience but from the moment his name appears ominously in the credits as the man who does everything (writing, producing and directing), his presence looms over the premise with an air of obnoxious knowing.THE HAPPENING first hits Central Park and we are given no time to breathe before the scenario turns apocalyptic. People stop in their tracks, repeat random phrases and find interesting or perhaps just easily accessible manners in which to kill themselves. No one knows what's happening, except for Shyamalan, who appears to be reveling in the delirium from the rustling trees above. The affliction spreads and the mystery is at first certainly engrossing. Whatever intensity the scenario creates though is unnervingly undone by the cast's delightfully laughable attempt at keeping it classical. Mark Wahlberg as enthusiastic hopeful, Elliot Moore, leads his wife and best friend (Zooey Deschanel and John Leguizamo) toward safety, despite having no idea where that is. His naïve optimism is cute when it should be compelling but he can hardly be blamed for what is clearly Shyamalan's overall approach.The classical style and contemporary reality ultimately clash and it becomes clear that Shyamalan's biggest obstacle is Shyamalan himself. His bigger ideas are solid but muddled by the little ideas he throws in to keep things interesting. Naturally, the tragic events are initially assessed to be terrorist attacks. Shyamalan paints America as a panic stricken populace that know who to blame when they cannot explain what is happening. They don't even question the possibility of it being a more organic threat until too much damage has been done. This is in itself heavy enough to sustain intrigue while making smooth criticism of the American government as shepherd and its people as sheep, but when you meet the people he is criticizing, they are so futile, prattling on when they should be in crisis mode, you wish they would just breathe in the bloody toxins already and die. The promise of a more satisfying film always seems just out of reach and a little help behind the scenes, primarily in the writing department, would help Shyamalan find the focus he so desperately needs.THE HAPPENING is passably suspenseful, occasionally intriguing but mostly ineffective. It feels contrived, as though Shyamalan were trying too hard to win back our graces, doing so in such a false fashion. Perched comfortably at his pulpit, he preaches about protecting the environment but without ever communicating any actual passion for it. Consequently, the pet cause feels more functional than it does pertinent. And all the while, you can feel him looking down at you, disappointed that we don't get his genius when what he really should be doing is looking inward to see that perhaps he is just not communicating as clearly as he could. Then he might be able to see that we want to love him; he's just making it too hard to do so.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unintentional,"James Newton Howard's score is the best thing about this film. That isn't to say this film totally blows as the majority seems to say. No, this isn't worse than 10,000 B.C. it's tightly directed, and Shyamalan keeps the pace quick and snappy. The progression of events is fast, we get treated to bits of information every so often, music is brooding and fitting for this type of film. So what's wrong? Unintentional or intentional ""comedy"", I can't tell which for sure, but the fact that the stupidity outweighs 'intentional' and Mark Wahlberg pulling Nic Cage in ""The Wicker Man"" tells me this film suffers from bad writing and bad acting, making my conclusion to be - unintentional.Wahlberg is a capable actor, but he's a parody here and he isn't alone. Maybe this is Shyamalan's fault, allowing this from his actors, or his overall direction of actors.The ""shocking"" moments, are not all that shocking either. However, Shyamalan's utilization of the landscape is effective, and in my mind the 'greatest' suspense occurred during the very end of the film, which felt less comical and more hard-hitting.All comedy aside, thinking back on this film, there is certainly a deeper layer that underlies the film.

Great Thriiler w/o character.,"The Happening, was chilling, effective and misfired. The Happening delivered a fine and effective thriller with intense and creepy scenes, yet the the actual characters were miscast, poorly written, and empty. It's funny that Night specifically wrote the role of Elliot for Wahlberg, which gives one of his worst performances, if not the worst. I couldn't take him seriously as a science teacher, he seemed tacked on, his lines about science seemed very contrived and fake. That was probably the biggest misfire, because the antagonist is based and validated by Elliots lines, so when we can't take the teacher seriously how are we gonna take the event seriously? That's why people were never fully intrigued about the science and interpretation of the horrific event. However, the biggest and most tragic flaw about this movies is that Night never gave this movie character. The movie was simply a thriller with no good story. In fact this is what Night has derailed in his past two movies. He has the gift of genuine suspense, but this time he writes an empty story with empty characters. If this movie had a moving story about a family on the run, and a credible main character, this would be up there with the top disaster movies. However, that won't happen.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This role was a step backwards for him. His acting was flat and the character he portrayed was absurd. I couldn't ""believe"" that Elliot was a real person. For that matter, I couldn't ""believe"" Alma was either. There was such a huge lack of emotion for both of these roles by both of the actors that portrayed the leads. That was the movie's first downfall.The second was the story line. I see -where- he was trying to go, and don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad idea. It was just horribly executed. I'll say no more than that so I don't accidentally ruin it for those of you that still want to see it.I guess that's really all I found lacking in this film, but without strong characters and a good story line, what's the point?

An excruciatingly awful film.,"Okay . . . I give ""The Village"" a lot of flack, but it had redeeming features. Some nice atmosphere, solid characterizations. ""The Lady in the Water"" . . . well, I liked the two lead actors. But Shyamalan's latest monument to himself is infinitely worse than even the weakest moments of those films. It's not a question of where it ranks on a list of Shyamalan's films. It's a question of where it ranks on the list of worst films ever made. Gory but not scary, slow but devoid of character development . . . Mark Wahlberg is DREADFUL in this film, and he has proved himself a more than capable actor in the past. I couldn't even find any enjoyment in watching the adorable Zooey Deschanel. And James Newton Howard's score is so egregiously aping Bernard Herrmann's Hitchcock scores, he should be sued.If there is anything in all of creation that you hold dear, avoid this movie like the cancerous plague on the anus of cinema that it is. This movie made me question my will to live on a planet where films this bad are made. Okay, that last line was maybe a SLIGHT exaggeration. But only slight. Seriously, I'd rather watch a marathon of ""Armageddon"", ""Batman & Robin"", ""The Avengers"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" back to back than sit through ten minutes of this again. Trust me: even you Shyamalan defenders aren't likely to enjoy this one. There's no touching human element like in ""Signs"" (or like some of you found in ""The Village""). It's just pointlessly, gory, dreary tedium. If you want to see an infinitely superior film with a similar premise, check out Frank Darabont's ""The Mist."" Better on every possible level. Shyamalan wants to be seen as a modern Hitchock, but this time, he comes closer to Ed Wood. I am seriously beginning to wondering if he plagiarized ""The Sixth Sense.""I'm only sad it opened to respectable business (if universally scathing reviews). Captain Ego needs a dose of humility and reality. And to have his kneecaps broken.And, being a softy, I went easy on this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Happening (2008) ***1/2,"I'll never understand why so many people are down on M. Night Shyamalan, who I like to call my Savior of Modern Horror. I've only seen SIGNS, THE SIXTH SENSE (both exceptional) and THE VILLAGE (decent enough) but I love the way the man relies on tension and fear, trying to make you think a bit when telling a story, without blowing it up into mind-numbing action and special effects overkill. I am especially surprised when it's purists like me, who usually prefer the older styles of the genre and science fiction stories of the Twilight Zone variety, who are first in line to pounce. I just don't get that. The man is good at what he does (though I admittedly have yet to see LADY IN THE WATER, and I have trepidations reserved for when I do get to it).In this terrifying story written by Shyamalan, a strange and unknown source is causing citizens of cities and small towns in the Northeast to begin rambling incoherently and then seeking to commit suicide, by any gruesome means readily available to them. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are a married couple swept up in the nightmare, who join up with strangers bonded together in their mad dash to try and vacate the infected areas, though the deadly plague keeps surrounding them. Is it terrorism? Something in the water? The wind? Nature gone berserk?This is a scary concept that works, though I'm a sucker for desperate end-of-the-world movies of this type which leave us no sure-footed understanding or way to escape the horror. The only things I could find mildly lacking here was that Wahlberg isn't a great actor, and he wouldn't be my prime choice for a film like this. Zooey Deschanel leaves something to be desired as well, but the events that are going on around these two are suspenseful, intriguing and frightening enough that it doesn't interfere with the intense experience. Some of the kill scenes are properly disturbing, and I liked the ominous music score. There are a few silly lines now and then (""cheese and crackers!""), but this is a quibble. I very much enjoyed Betty Buckley's eccentric old lady character, and she was also an asset to the film. John Leguizamo touched a nerve in his part as a loving father/husband, and good friend of Wahlberg's.M. Night is a master horror/sci-fi filmmaker, and we need more of him and his work, especially in this present day and age of mindless cookie cutter genre films that rely on an over-abundance of CGI and chess piece characters.

I am so Disappointed in M. Night Shyamalan!,"Can this really be the work of such an accomplished director who gave us such acclaimed works as 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable'? 'The Village' is wrongly considered by many critics as Shyamalan's weakest film, but this takes weak to a whole new level: The plot (I use the term loosely) depicts a teacher and his girlfriend's fight for survival against a natural epidemic that forces people to kill themselves. The entire North East of America is infected for a day, and then... it ends.What is even worse than the lacklustre plot is the acting - this is the first film i've seen in a long time when I literally burst out laughing during, what I believe was supposed to be a really intense scene due to horrendously bad acting. The leading man (I forget his name and, to be honest never want to hear it again) has a hard time figuring out if his character is there to increase drama or create comic relief. This obviously stems from the script which lead me to believe that Shyamalan had no idea if he wanted to make a comedy or a horror. If he was aiming for a mixture of the two it certainly isn't working - the humour is very out of place.I went into the cinema expecting a GREAT movie - what else would I expect from one of my favourite directors - but I came out having seen, what I can only fairly describe this film as a stupid movie.This mess is a complete contrast of everything that Shyamalan stands for. It beheld nothing that distinctly says 'Shyamalan' to me - the atmosphere of 'The Village' was sorely missing from this picture.My best advice to M.

And worst of all, The Happening.I will first admit that I was quite looking forward to this film, I thought from the previews that it could be Shyamalan's return to originality, quality screen writing, and inherent understanding that a shocking conclusion does not necessarily make a film great. The Happening, however, is far and away his worst effort, and easily the worst film I've seen in the last five years (although admittedly I do try to avoid those that have no chance of being good). The film actually gets off to a decent start, when people in Central Park begin to die mysteriously. The intrigue created by the first scenes lasts only momentarily, however.I would typically begin a review with a few positive words about a film before ranting about its negative elements. This film, however, lacks any redeeming qualities. The dialogue is as bad as it could possibly be. Cheesy lines, unrealistic arguments, and pointless conversations quickly erode any interest in the larger plot. The dialogue gets worse, not better, as the movie progresses. One particular scene, involving an argument between the two main characters, is particularly painful to watch. One doesn't know whether to laugh, cry, or get up and leave the theater at such moments. The director never comes close to achieving his desired emotional reactions from viewers. A general moaning and groaning could be distinctly heard at such moments from the crowd at our local theater. Never mind the plot, which is far-fetched, under-explained, and generally nonsensical. The dialogue and acting alone kills this movie quicker than you can say ""Marky Mark, what were you thinking?"" A writer/director must implore the reader to CARE about at least some of the characters in a film, allowing the viewing audience to relate to them in some sense, otherwise, the entire plot appears nothing more than a joke.While on the topic of jokes, my colleague and I assume that this entire film IS in fact a joke, a setup by Shyamalan to see how much money he can make writing, directing, and producing a worthless film with no redeeming value. My advice? Do not contribute to his funds. I feel as though someone ripped my wallet from my hand, extracted $7.50, and threw it back in my face, only this process somehow took an hour and a half to complete. Talented directors like Shyamalan should be forced to produce something of value once in awhile. For this director, it has been years. And the trend, unfortunately, is headed in the wrong direction.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worst Movie Ever,This movie was a complete waist of time and at no time should you waist a second on it. I would caution anyone that is thinking of watching this movie not too.DO NOT go see in the theaters. DO NOT rent it. DO NOT buy it. DO NOT even waist time watching it on TV.If you have any sense you will not see it at all because if you do you will regret the time lost for the rest of your life.the actors and director should be ashamed of putting a movie like this in a theater and charging people to see it.Please take my advise and go see a film that will actually keep you entertained and happy to have spent money on it.,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?,"I've watched it twice now,, and it's not great by any means,, but it's not bad.

And they say piracy is the problem,"Recently I've noticed that not only the music and video game industry has been suffering losses with the piracy but also the movies. What happens is that a movie gets out (almost always in the US first) and when it gets to the Europe and if there already is a DVD on the united states people will download this one instead of going to the cinema.But most of the time there ins't such DVD released so what they choose (instead of going to the cinema) is seeing a direct cam recorded video of the movie. As you might spouse, and it's true, the quality is offal. So why do cinema fans choose to watch movies in such bad quality? Well THIS MOVIE IS THE ANSWER.What happens is that people don't trust there ticket cost with their eyes folded anymore. Instead they prefer to have a sample of what they are going to spend the money in. You might be thinking....""There's why we have trailers""....well that's not true. THIS MOVIE PROVES IT.THE HAPPENING is one of the most offal movies I have ever seen. I consider it an insult to anyone that spends on it a ticket price. The only possible reason I think to why they have made this, if u can call it a movie, is called fraud. They LIE to people with the trailer by chowing a thriller with good actors and an pealing story. Nothing could be more fair away from the truth. THIS MOVIE SUCKS BIG AND THEY WANT US TO SPEND OUR MONEY ON IT!!!!THIS IS WHY TICKETS SALES ARE DROPPING....you just can't trust in quality anymore. If the movie is good people will see it period. IT ISN'T PIRACY FAULT...IT'S the MOVIES THAT ARE GETTING WORSE BY THE SECOND.THERE JUST CAN'T BE A SINGLE PERSON THAT SEES THIS MOVIE AND LEAVES HAPPY FOR SPENDING THERE MONEY ON IT.IT'S NOT THE INTERNET FAULT THE MOVIES AREN'T SELLING AS MUCH. IT'S Hollywood THAT THINKS IT CAN SELL ANY CRAP TO THE VIEWERS....WELL GUESS WHAT...PEOPLE DEMAND QUALITY AND IF U PROVIDE WILL BE GOING TO THE CINEMA....OTHERWISE NO THANKS.Honestly...an entire 84 minutes of pure awfulness...IF THERE IS ANYONE THAT SAIS THIS MOVIE IS GOOD THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO BE DIFFERENT AND CONTROVERSIAL. You simply can't call entertainment to a wind that comes out of plants and makes people suicide....it's purely stupidity.QUALITY SELLS NOT AN HOAX.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
great movie,"M night did it again.Do yourself a favor and go see this movie. It is creative, and nothing like you have ever seen before. The best movie i have seen all year. This movie leaves you with a feeling of.... what is really happening here. The story line is beautifully written and the actors are beyond superb. M night does a great job in making the audience feel like there is something unlike the ordinary going on. I don't want to spoil the movie with any scenes... all i can say is that it is an incredible movie. The beginning is a great starting point for the outcome in the end. M night is one of the most amazing directors of our time. He comes with incredibly creative and open minded movies that really leave the viewer guessing. I haven't had this much fun in a theater since the sixth sense.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Respectful Awe,"Following the inanity of the borderline train wreck that was 2006's ""Lady in the Water,"" writer/producer/director M. Night Shyamalan rebounded in a very big way with his next film, 2008's ""The Happening."" His contribution to the type of eco-horror film that was all the rage in the 1960s and '70s--I'm thinking of such films as 1963's ""The Birds,"" 1972's ""Frogs,"" 1977's ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" and 1978's ""Swarm""...not to mention the little-seen 1976 Spanish classic ""Who Can Kill a Child?""--the film seems to have divided his fan base and resulted in a bona fide critical flop of sorts. Indeed, the woman who I sit next to at work, a big admirer of film auteur Shyamalan, hated the film, although she professes a love for ""Lady in the Water,"" a picture that I found to be both ridiculous and downright stupid. Go figure. THIS is why there is both vanilla AND chocolate out there, folks!In the film in question, what is at first perceived to be a bioterrorist attack occurs in NYC's Central Park, where droves of people are compelled to commit suicide in horrendous fashions. We then zoom in on Philadelphia schoolteacher Elliot Moore (very well played by the hugely likable Mark Wahlberg), who, along with his wife Alma (the pretty and kooky Zooey Deschanel), best friend and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his adorable daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), leaves the city by train after a similar attack occurs in their vicinity. Eventually, Julian strikes off on his own to search for his wife in Princeton, NJ, leaving his daughter in charge of the Moores, while it soon becomes apparent that this is NOT an instance of bioterror that has been afflicting the entire Northeast after all, but rather, a bizarre case of nature gone amok. The very trees are emitting a chemical--perhaps in an instance of self-defense--that has started to compel humans to do themselves in! (This action does not strike me at this particular moment as being all that far-fetched, afflicted as I am today with allergy symptoms brought on by tree pollen!) The Moores and Jess head into the wilds of the Pennsylvania countryside to escape the widespread violence, only to fetch up at the home of an isolated woman, one Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley)...a demented biddy who, in retrospect, strikes the viewer as a warm-up for the demented oldsters in Shyamalan's 2015 film ""The Visit."" But even this isolated locale does not seem to be a safe haven against the arboreal threat that has suddenly arisen....Amazingly, ""The Happening"" was nominated for no less than four Golden Raspberry Awards--for Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Wahlberg), Worst Director and Worst Screenplay. In ""Empire"" magazine's list of the 50 Worst Films of All Time, the film came in at the #8 spot! Are these people kidding?!?! Have they never seen such films as ""Blood Freak,"" ""Dracula vs. Frankenstein,"" ""The Astro-Zombies,"" ""Horror of the Blood Monsters,"" ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" and ""The Worm Eaters""? THESE are truly horrendous and ineptly made pictures, worthy of anybody's contempt. But ""The Happening""? Really? This film is expertly made and well acted by its cast of appealing players. It also looks terrific on the screen, is loaded with any number of suspenseful moments, is laced with pleasing bits of humor (my favorite: Elliot talking in fear to what turns out to be a plastic plant), and is capable of stunning the viewer by dint of a pleasing number of shock moments (such as the sight of one man offering himself up to the giant cats in the Philadelphia zoo, a young woman casually sticking a rather long hairpin into her neck, and the truly awesome spectacle of a half dozen construction workers blithely diving off the top of a building to their doom). The film is nowhere near as bloody as the 2001 Japanese stunner ""Suicide Club"" (how could it be?) but yet manages to startle and impress, nevertheless. And if the film does not provide one of Shyamalan's patented twist endings, it yet contrives to wind up on a note of not-so-unexpected pessimism. Like the Hitchcock film referenced above, a clear-cut explanation for the bizarre events in the film is never vouchsafed, and we are left to be content with these words of wisdom from the Wahlberg character: ""There are forces at work beyond our understanding. To be a good scientist, you must have a respectful awe for the laws of Nature."" And perhaps not so coincidentally, ""respectful awe"" was the feeling that this viewer was left with by the conclusion of this hugely impressive and effective film. Very much recommended....",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"My Review of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening""","In M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" or ""The Crappening"" as I now like to call it, there's something in the air that causes people to stop whatever they're doing, slide into a trance and commit horrible suicides.I would have liked to breath some of that air too so that I would not have to endure this terrible movie! Perhaps next time, M. Knight, the cinema's P.T. Barnum can provide me with his home address so that I can just mail him the $20 that I inevitably pay each year to see his increasingly worsening pictures. Then I can spend a couple of hours doing something productive instead of staring at a movie screen in utter dismay. It's just that Shyamalan initially grabbed me with the unique story telling of ""The Sixth Sense"" and because of that, I am always hopeful that he will deliver again. So each year I eagerly watch his next offering with expectancy but in this casedisappointment! M. Night Shyamalan has had a rough streak with his past few movies ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"". I suggest M. Night relinquish some of his roles as director, writer, actor and producer and bring in some different perspectives.In ""The Happening"", Mark Wahlberg plays a soft spoken high school science teacher who evacuates Philadelphia along with his wife (Zooey Deschanel), his fellow teacher ( John Leguizamo) and his friend's daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez) due to an unexplained (actually, never explained) environmental occurrence. The bad guy in this movie is the rustling wind so the major special effect required 3 house fans.If you are expecting M. Nights trademark twist, forget it. In fact forget characterization, plot, motivation and resolution. What you do get is flat deadpan acting, unrealistic dialogue, plodding pace and silly but violent on screen deaths.""The Happening"" was pitched as a suspenseful thriller but it lacked both of those key elements. I urge you not to be fooled as I was, save your money and enjoy the June sunshine.Larry Fire The Fire Wire Blog",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What happened to Shyamalan?,"I am a huge Shyamalan fan: I am not convinced that he had anything to do with this movie. How could the maker of such classics like ""Sixth Sense"" allow microphones to be seen in at least four different scenes? How could the man capable of complex plot lines like ""The Village"" allow a script this heinously written to be produced, furthermore using actors that were confused and seemingly in the dark about this movies purpose, as was the audience. 50% of whom left the theater, the rest sat laughing and conversing as if in a coffee shop. One hour after the movies completion, the three of us are sitting here still trying to figure out what big point we missed? Has Shyamalan drank the global warming punch and this is his homage to Al Gore? Whatever it is, it does not work.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Less than mediocre,"The Happening has not a single redeeming feature that warrants a positive comment. Hampered by lame acting, an impossibly pretentious storyline, clichéd photography and some of the worst dialogue ever written for the screen,it is a perfect storm of mediocrity. If you consciously set out to write a bad movie, it is unlikely that you would create a film as poor as this sad affair.Mark Walberg is singled out for a performance that is so bad he will cringe every time he looks back on his involvement in this lemon. John Leguziamo fares slightly better only because he has less than five or six minutes screen time (all bad) in this thoroughly ridiculous outing.I feel sorry for the amateur hour cinema enthusiasts who've tried to find meaning in this drivel.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Weak acting, shallow characters & simple plot - go and watch it!","I saw this movie yesterday, at its opening day in Santiago de Chile, apparently before its release in the US! It is not a great movie, the acting is weak. Mark Wahlberg's casting seems the worst error, even though the plot doesn't leave much room for character development and the movie as a whole seems to have been shot in a rush (it was actually shot in quite a short period of time). Yet, is has Shyamalan's signature all along. It is scary, with no digital monsters, buckets of blood, sinister killers or psychos hiding in the dark... despite a simple plot, shallow characters and weak acting, the wind blowing through grass and trees may prove enough to make you shiver. This kind of achievement is reserved for just a few directors, Shyamalan being one of this few. While we are still waiting for his 2nd masterpiece, this point makes this film worth a trip to the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Waste of Money and Time,"Somebody should be responsible for the money I paid to see this movie. It appears to me that it was simply a big money grab for the Friday the 13th release.

Marky Mark is one of my favourites but, the fact he agreed to do such a horrible movie, I lost a bit of respect for him. Script was a joke, was it suppose to be a joke?

I see dead screenplays,Oh dear oh dear that was bad.M.

Night Shyamalan later films that have this effect.The theory is the cinema screens have banded together to kill all the audience who have given the director another chance. So all i can say is please don't go and see it don't even download it.It is over now just a natural occurrence and things are back to normal now and will not reoccur as a final scene rip of 28 weeks later.,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awful-save your money,"I saw this movie and was just angered by it. I can not believe I spent over 10 dollars for something that: 1) I figured out the ending ""twist"" within the first 10 minutes 2) It was a movie that set out to make a weak liberal statement on the people and the earth 3) Was flat out ridiculous.The acting was surprising dull, but I will give it credit some off beat one liners did entertain me for about 2 minutes during the hour and a half movie.I have never written any reviews of movies on this site, but feel that had someone warned me I would never have seen this movie.

"Nothing Happening here folks, move along please...","I have to agree with the previous poster that the movie had a lot of nothing happening. The characters seemed to be cut out of cardboard (one dimensional generic cutouts). The story was promising with some interesting takes on End of the World tropes. But, in the end Night didn't deliver to his potential.In The Happening, M. Night Shyamalan strengths are overshadowed by a ""message"" that is forcefully shoved down the movie audiences throat. He missed an opportunity to play to his strength of blurring the boundary between the fantastic and reality because, in my opinion, he wanted to make the message as obvious as possible.At this point in human history, the message that we are ""hurting"" nature is something best preached to the choir like Al Gore did in An Inconvenient Truth. The general public resents being force fed Eco Hysteria in what is promoted as an End of the World thriller.For a more in depth review, see my blog.

parable on love,"Director Shyamalan is the most Christian of all popular directors working in Hollywod, and the most thoughtfully Christian in Hollywod's history. Even though I'm not a Christian, I respect his thoughtfulness and faith.This not a horror film but a kind of post-modern ""Pilgrim's Progress"" parable. The difficult question of the film is not ""what is happening?"" but rather, why are the lead characters innocent enough to survive it? And the answer is rather odd and rather bold. Although recently married, they are still in the process of 'falling in love.' That's important because in a truly Christian universe, love is a practice, not a feeling. ""Feeling"" love or ""being in love"" does not redeem, only the active process of it.Is Shyamalan successful in portraying this? No; and the effort to do so actually requires considerable maturity, more than Shyamalan has right now. By the time John Ford was able it pull it off in ""the Quiet man,"" he had some 25 years film-making experience, and had lived an adventurous life.But I am willing to give Shyamalan points for effort here. Constructing a parable of this sort in this time and place took considerable nerve. Hopefully the commercial failure of this film will not deter him from continuing to take such risks. Thoughtful films are hard to come by these days.So it's an admittedly weak film - parables lend themselves to beautiful visuals, but not to great acting, and the best dialog is on the theme and not the plot. But its reputation will grow in time, as Shyamalan's reputation grows and his handling of such themes matures.Oh, a last word - on the violence depicted in the film. It actually has to be taken with a tablespoon of salt. Much of it involves a student filmmaker's conceit, indicating Shyamalan is still concerned with learning his craft. But, to put it bluntly, much of the violent acts are insiders' jokes - 'it's raining construction workers,' get it? and the guy feeding his arm to the lions is a nod back to - Monty Python. Further indication that we are dealing with a parable on a theme rather than a well-constructed plot.Hopefully in the future, Shyamalan will learn, as John Ford learned, how to marry the two.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The Happening,,,,, ""It should not have been allowed to Happen!"".","I am ""Very"" surprised at 20th Century Fox, and Spyglass, even ""Considering"" this, as a Movie release. 1 out of 10, is being generous. The beginning of the movie, gives you the ""Impression"", that you are about to be, ""Entertained"", in the usual 20th Century Fox/Spyglass, tradition. Unfortunately, after the the first five minutes or so, you start to ask yourself the question, ""What happened!"", ""Was the Movie Budget so low, that they had to drag it out until the end?"". This may have been O.K. if it would have been shown as a T.V. show, but not on Primetime T.V. You leave the Cinema thinking to yourself, ""Did I actually pay, to see that?"". The Acting was about on par, with what you would expect, on a T.V. soap opera. As far as trying to compare this to any other Movie, that I have seen, I just cannot. I can usually say that I enjoyed that movie, and would recommend it to other people. Unfortunately, this is a Movie not to go out of your way to see.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dialouge, poorly written, but it worked fantastically. Would you really be coming up with quotes everyone is going to repeat if you're facing an international crisis? Of course people are going to say lame things because that's what they really do. Very well delivered and thought out, and at points in the film, soooooooo hard to watch. In conclusion.....M.

Whether you do or don't like where it's going, you'll feel compelled to watch to the end.If you haven't seen the trailer, the movie is essentially about a mysterious occurrence that ""happens"" in the northeast section of the US: masses of people are going into a dazed stupor ... and then killing themselves.Since it's a typical M. Night movie, the above story is what's going on in the background. In the foreground, the story is about a couple struggling through marital problems. Mark Wahlberg and Zoey Deschanel do a great job of portraying the husband and wife characters who have very different personalities.Again, if you watch the film on TV, I don't see how you can really go wrong.

"This is a good movie, don't listen to the haters","That M. Night Shyamalan is perhaps the most hated and slammed film-maker of the present day is a fact beyond any debate. I have to admit that I was very disappointed at the movies he made after ""The sixth sense"", and that I didn't like any of them. However, I can't understand why so many critics and anonymous viewers of all kinds seem to have this negative prejudice against him. Perhaps it's because he doesn't send out an especially likable vibe, and because his former work sometimes came across as too pretentious. It's true that with every one of his movies, he always tries to deliver some deeper message and that he constructs his movies as parables, with the focus usually set on some universal situation or crisis rather than on the more particular conflicts that most dramas, thrillers or mysteries have us accustomed to. I can't say I think he's been very successful at delivering these messages in a viewer-friendly, non-pretentious way, but I respect the fact that he has never given up on his personal view of movie-making, and that he stays true to himself, much critic and -in my opinion, unjustified and too harsh- bashing this might have fostered. Having said this, like I stated at the beginning, I think his career has been objectively quite erratic.Well, having said that, I think that ""The happening"" is, simply put, a good and entertaining movie. I have to admit I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, precisely because I regrettably chose to listen to all the many holier-than-thou critics who state their opinions as scientific fact, and also, dare I say it, to my own prejudice. I was proved wrong, and I am happy to say that I'm now looking forward to watching Shyamalan's next movies.The movie is not perfect by any means, but it is thoroughly enjoyable, and it's based on a basic idea and a script that are just as smart as anything reasonably smart that you get to see on the big screen any of these days. The acting is also good. I honestly believe that, had this movie been made by any other household name or ""promising"" new director, it wouldn't have been slammed as relentlessly and sometimes scornfully as it did. This movie isn't at all the disaster that it has been described as by many critics. You might like it or not, but I would recommend watching it if you like dramas with a supernatural element, decent character development, and thrillers.Another thing that I enjoyed about ""The happening"" is the modesty and, might I add, the lack of self-consciousness from which it was made. Especially at some sequences (and you will know which ones they are), you can tell that Shyamalan was probably not taking himself all that seriously, and that he was perhaps even making fun of the reputation that he's earned throughout most of his career, as a very intellectual, serious, and sometimes cold movie-maker. The movie has some tongue-in-cheek bits that I appreciated very much.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't show this movie to EMOs.,"I went to see this movie with my friend (we are both stereotyped as Emo, even though we aren't!)and we had a great time. This is coming from 2 teenage girls though, so it probably won't be YOUR opinion. I am a massive movie fan, and although I cant say this is one of my favourite movies, I honestly don't think its one of the worst I've seen. The characters are all rather boring, apart from Mrs Jones, who I think was one of the only interesting characters to watch and one of the only characters that kept the audience guessing. I found some of the scenes scary. Afterall, it is supposed to be a frightening movie. Its at least disturbing. My advice though is, please don't show this movie to emos. It will give them too many ideas. :) ROFLCOPTER XD",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Contender For The Best Comedy Of The Year,"the fact i went into this film knowing only it was an m night shaylaman film and a very brief understanding of the plot i was quite excited to see it. It starts off promising with an interesting idea but begins to heavily decline after about 10 minutes, there is not one single decent performance in it,it seems as if mark whalberg has forgotten how to act, most actors seem as if they either cant remember their lines or have any faith in them mind you i wouldn't blame them if it was the latter as this flick contains some of theworst dialouge i have ever heard (""im packing hotdogs"" being a prime example) i actually found myself laughing out loud for some amount of time during this film, besides the shoddy acting and terrible screenplay the ending is as vague and disappointing as the whole movie itself, unfortunately it seems as if m night has given up making decent films and is on a path to cinema self destruction, go see this film if only to laugh at the numerous ludicrous incidents within it with your friends afterwards.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Did it actually happened?,"I watched ""the happening"" yesterday at a cinema in Athens (Greece) along with four (4) others.First of all i have to confess that i am deeply sad of the damage pirate downloading from the internet does to the movie industry.I am a horror/thriller movie fan.I have watched hundreds of movies in the past and in my opinion this one was atmospherically scaring enough.There were moments i even spoke out loud (oh no, and things like that) and trust me i am not used to express my anxiety,fear or terror with the rest of the viewers. There is one thing that i hate in movies in general that i consider to be the worst thing to happen that descends me in reality and reminds me that this is just a movie i watch and these characters are just actors pretending their script.Do you imagine what is this that turns me down in a movie? ? Whenever i see a microphone hanging from the top of the screen in the middle of the plot i feel completely stupid.I would excuse it in a b-movie or in one of a low budget.But not in an M. Night Shyamalan movie.I wonder don't these guys watch the movie closely in the montage to cut off mistakes? Watch carefully the dinner scene at the old house with the old lady and you will notice a microphone hanging in the top middle. Except of this 'The happening' i think is a good movie not a masterpiece, i would say 'THE MIST' was much better in acting and in plot.If you want to spend an interesting evening i would suggest it with no remorse.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If you watch this movie, you will be poorer in both mind and wallet for it.To say that this movie is garbage doesn't even begin to do the word justice.

I've sifted through some of the comments and there are some Shyamalan apologists. Do not fall for it. There is no message (not one that couldn't have been written on the back of a business card anyway). There is no twist. There is nothing clever about this movie.""It's the wind! Run!"" I swear. It must be intentional on Shyamalan's part to get a laugh at what people are willing to consume, and then spend time justifying the fact that they watched it, acting as though the movie had anything worthwhile to say. It has to be a joke...a horrendous, multi-million dollar producing joke. It has to be.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A return to form somewhat for Shyamalan.,"Poor Shyamalan hasn't had a break in a long time. The novelty in his quirky scriptwriting/direction skills wore off many moons ago and his career took a direct hit with Lady in the Water. But The Happening isn't Lady in the Water. Heck, it's not even The Village, thankfully. Shyamalan has taken this movie straight back to when his films worked. But two consecutive critically panned movies later, would Shyamalan go for the home run? The trailer would have you think that.Like Signs, we find out what's ""Happening"" pretty quick throughout the north-eastern U.S. as another doomsday scenario is dealt with. And continuing off of Signs, the science fiction is mostly brushed aside to deal with characters and conflict. But these batch of characters are mostly lame ducks, with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel not at their best by a long shot. The script is questionable at best and the overall premise for drama and tension (""Run from the wind!"") for the film is, again, lame. The film is not bad, but it's not great either. I think the novelty of Shyamalan films have worn off as a whole, but at least if this film is an indication, he has returned to form somewhat.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the stupidest movies ever made,Firstly i am glad that i didn't waste a dime on this stupid movie - caught on TV. However I watched from start to finish hoping that maybe Mark's character was having a really bad dream and we all get to watch him get up but no - this drivel was actually real (in the movie) Seriously from a director who gave us Sixth Sense and hasn't had the ability to repeat his success should call it quits. I have watched some pretty pathetic movies (like the Leatherheads ) but this one wins hands down. I pity the fool who watches this. I will never get those hours of my life back and believe you me when I say that I would rather have been sleeping. DO NOT WATCH THIS DRIVEL - ITS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Happening is a mixed bag,"The Happening is the latest from director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense). I've enjoyed most of his past work (including Lady in the Water). I wanted to see this without knowing too much about the film. So on Thursday afternoon I turned off my RSS feeder and pretty much avoided the Internet like a plague. Armed only with the knowledge of the previews, I watched The Happening Saturday afternoon.The story follows Elliot and Alma Moore (played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel), a couple living in Philadelphia, the setting of most of Shyamalan's films. A catastrophe strikes in New York, causing large numbers of people to commit suicide. Fearing the growing threat, Elliot and Alma flee Philadelphia in an attempt to escape the attack.The Happening has a peculiar balance between humor, seriousness, and the morbid. The film was advertised as M. Night Shyamalan's first film with an R-rating (""for violent and disturbing images""), which I think ended up being a problem for the film. Many people have compared him to Alfred Hitchcock (""the master of suspense""), and rightly so. In previous films, Shyamalan has worked well in the PG-13-rating. He's great at introducing suspense and startling the audience. Think of the sprinklers in Lady in the Water. With his latest film, however, the horror is justthere. There were suspenseful moments that I liked (the trees, he tracking shot with the policeman and the cars, etc.), but a good deal of it seemed there just to justify the rating than advance the story.The acting in the film didn't do it for me, either. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, two good actors I might add (Think The Depareted and All the Real Girls), just didn't seem to fit. Should we blame the acting or the script? I don't know. Coupled with that is the on-the-nose dialgue.I liked the relationship between their characters. The change in Zooey's character from the beginning to the end is especially intriguing to me. I would have loved to see more development between their characters.Now I loved the concept of the film. The idea behind the film. It's so fantastic, but it's also somewhat believable, which is a feat in itself. As far as the story is concerned, I also loved the way it ended. A really nice touch.I guess it boils down to how much M. Night Shyamalan was trying to make The Happening feel like a classic ""B"" disaster flick and how much of it just didn't work. Maybe I need to watch more movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What is with these reviews?,"So I'm only giving this a 10 because these abysmally low reviews aren't accurate. In actuality I'd give this movie a solid 7. 8-9 if you're really into disaster movies where things start out normal but quickly descend into chaos. If you like movies like bird box, day after tm, quiet place, etc then you'll like this. But these reviews make it seem like this is as bad as cats or the last Airbender. It's not. It's actually a decent movie worth a watch and I personally really enjoyed it. Granted, this movie isn't on the same level as something like sixth sense, so if you're expecting this to be a masterpiece, you might be disappointed.

School buses run on schedule, traffic is back to normal and no one seems affected in anyway what so ever.

"""Oh no! There are people dying!""

All the lead actors are awful, and it doesn't help that they haven't meaningful things to say.And though this may sound like ""bashing"", unfortunately it is not.

His subtle, slow film that allows one to think about what we have done, what we are doing, and what the possible consequences are will not be a big hit with the viewers that are looking for transformers or zombies, or ass-kicking action, but it is a message that deserves to be heeded.Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel were perfect for this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

ain't much happening here,"End-of-the-world scenarios have become such a cottage industry in recent years that M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" can't help but feel like a straggler to a party that's already begun winding down. In this case, the apocalyptic horseman comes in the form of a strange natural phenomenon which causes people to engage in mass suicides. The usually reliable - but here way too over-earnest - Mark Wahlberg plays a high school science teacher who flees with his wife and the daughter of a friend from their home in New York City (where the plague begins) to a remote area of western Pennsylvania.As always, Shyamalan relies on subtlety and indirection rather than explicit violence and over-the-top special effects to achieve his thrills. Yet, while there is a certain undeniable creepiness to some of the film, ""The Happening"" ultimately comes a cropper through annoying performances, lackluster storytelling, dopey dialogue and more laugh-out-loud moments than any ostensibly serious horror film should ever have to put up with. It also doesn't help that ""The Happening"" feels like so many other recent movies that have come before it (""War of the Worlds,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""Cloverfield,"" the ""28 Day"" series etc.) or that it pales in comparison to the much livelier, intentionally funny ""The Signal"" (albeit, in that film, the afflicted individuals were killing other people rather than themselves, making them a bit more of an actual threat).As seems to be the case with Shyamalan's most recent output, one winds up admiring ""The Happening"" much more than one likes it.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This is Not Good.,"The budgets are starting to get a little small for M. Night Shyalaman, once briefly Hollywood's blue-eyed boy, and the casts are now plucked from the B-list instead of the top shelf. Judging by this incredibly daft mess, it's my guess that those budgets are going to keep getting thinner and that even the B-listers will stop returning his calls before long.The plot concerns a mysterious virus that strikes New York's Central Park one morning. The virus strikes suddenly, making its victim's disorientated and incapable of speech before eventually developing suicidal tendencies. The opening scene , in which construction workers rain from the sky, is probably the best of the film because, as the reasons for the virus are slowly explained the film grows increasingly silly.Mark Wahlberg plays one of the frightened city dwellers evacuating the city for the countryside - which proves to be a big mistake; they should have headed for a city centre Starbucks - with his wife and best friend plus daughter. John Lequizamo plays the friend, and he's almost completely wasted as well as miscast. The refugees find themselves stranded in a small town after the train they are travelling on is halted when it loses communications. All the passengers wind up in the town's diner and, when the TV informs them that they have actually ventured into the virus's epicentre, climb into convenient cars to make their second escape. Only Wahlberg and his gang failed to have the foresight to ensure they had a car waiting at the diner for when the unforeseen train stop occurredIt's this kind of sloppy writing that really winds me up. It smacks of a 'that'll do' attitude on the part of the writer that is an insult to the film's audience. Either Shyamalan figures we're not bright enough to spot glaring flaws like this or he just doesn't care whether we notice or not. It's only a small moment, but flaws like that rankle for the duration of the film.The film grows increasingly silly - with some ill-advised and ham-fisted efforts at humour along the way - so that, despite the brief running time, the audience stops caring what happens - or why it happens - long before the end credits finally roll.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Finally Plants attack , and are found smarter than Teachers","I watched this almost unwatchable flick this afternoon, and on the positive side, I did watch it all way through.

The end states to heck with science, somethings are just too natural to ever understand.You have heard of dumber than a beech tree or a fence post? These people are dumber than that.In any event some of the cinematic motifs used in the flick would have worked if the script were not so lame. By the way plants existed before animals and have a reverse metabolism. That is animals exhale carbon dioxide and plants reprocess this by product giving off oxygen. Oh, that was not an attack of the grass, was it?Well, we have plenty of people ending their sorry lives by various ingenious means, including being run over by a lawn mower. We have a cheating wife and a wide eyed really dumb looking biology teacher who attempts much like the scarecrow in the Wizard Of Oz, to put on his thinking cap. But, under the cap there is only straw so what could we expect.No truly profound acting here and a script so bad, well, it could make you laugh if your IQ is a bit over the boiling point of water, Celsius.I would say, this is a must not see for any child struggling with science in school.

The Happening Starts Off Good But Is A Major Disappointment,"The Happening is another thriller if you want to call it that from M Night Shymalan who rose to fame with The Sixth Sense. His career hasn't been doing so well with flops like The Village, Unbreakable, and Lady in The Water. Which at least to me weren't that bad but weren't the greatest either. The Happening continues that trend unfortunately but the first forty five minutes or so are promising but things go bad quickly after that. The movie was a big disappointment compared to The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008, Iron Man, Wall-E, The Incredible Hulk, and even Indiana Jones. The Happening starts off strong with people randomly killing themselves in horrific ways. The cast for the most part did what they could with their roles. Mark Whalberg, Zoeey Deschnael, and John Leguizamo in a brief cameo bring a lot to their characters but unfortunately the rest of the film isn't as good. M Night Shymalan is a gifted writer and director but this movie doesn't even come close to the Sixth Sense. The ending of the film wasn't that great either. It was predictable leaving me feeling sort of cheated. The music by James Newton Howard was fitting and seemed to sync very well with the mood of the movie. But the bad outweighs the good and this could've been a far better apocalyptic thriller than it was. M. Night had stated this was his scariest film yet but unfortunately it wasn't very scary to me. The only thing startling about it were the deaths by the people who were offing themselves in gruesome ways. If you're a fan of M. Nights films than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. If you're not then don't see it because you would've wasted 90 minutes of your life that you can't get back.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Happened One Night. . .,"As a writer, I enjoyed The Happening because I recognized it immediately as M. Night's tribute to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.He pulls out headlines from the news--the disappearance of bees, the mysterious red tide, a lethal prehistoric bacteria discovered in Australia--and uses the real or perceived threats from these as the backdrop to develop fear. In fact, the three fears are shared and spaced evenly in the beginning, middle and near the end of the film.Instead of killer birds, there are killer plants. Well, actually the plants emit the neurotoxin that induces people into a state of creative suicide. Instead of the caged peace-loving lovebirds in Hitchcock's film, there are small houseplants--like cactus and succulents present in the homes they seek refuge in. True, there is no icy blonde like Tippi Hendron to save, but Zooey emits a blue-eyed vacant look and she's emotionally detached. Instead of crossing over by motorboat to the sleepy community of Bodega Bay, the main characters enter the small town of Filbert, which coincidentally, is the name for a small nut. The action moves to smaller and smaller groups and locations until it centers on three main characters--the husband, wife and their friends' 8-year old daughter.There are horrific and violent scenes implied in the movie. We see the calm movement of people intent on offing themselves via lions, lawnmowers, guns, ropes, broken glass, etc. Sort of reminded me of the Suicidal Bunnies book.Most fans of Night are used to tidy endings wrapped up with a bow--endings filled with heightened emotion and resolution. But he left this film open-ended, much like The Birds. The first attack was a warning to mankind. The plants are mad, menacing and malicious. Are they out to rid the planet of mankind, because man has not been kind to the planet? Maybe. We kill plants, don't we? And eat them! Not me though. Really, if any plants are listening, I've never liked salad.At the conclusion, the happy family is filled with the promise of life back to a semi-state of normal except with a lot less people on the streets. Also the promise of a positive pregnancy test. Life goes on, right? The conflict is over. Things are back to normal. . .or are they?",,Anonymous,Mystery

Good Old horror movie,"M. Night Shyamalan has come a long way since the Sixth Sense. After I finished watching the film the ""one"" thing that impressed me was the way he presented it. I sincerely felt that it was the depth and reality of each scene that was impressive and not the scariness.Now the answer for the question ""why only 6 if I liked the movie? "". M Night Shyamalan is famous for showing off the Microphones used in his production, and this is what he does in this movie as well. The Mic can be clearly seen on the top of the screen in one of the scenes where Mark Wahlberg is sitting and talking in the Model House. Doesn't anybody review the final print!!. Even after all these criticisms (Even in one of the Scary movies) if he continues to do this , it will point to his inefficiency as a director.The music is really haunting. James Newton Howard has succeeded in creating a Hitchcockian atmosphere with his music all through the movie. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is impressive and blends well with the directors way of storytelling. The cast easily fits into their characters but none impressed me.Overall I liked the picture , and I would prescribe it for people who like classic and realistic horror and not the zombie or creature horror.As a fan , I look forward to seeing more work from M Night Shyamalan which is equally brilliant as this and his previous works.The "" AVATAR "" written on Jesse's school bag , is that a sign of things to come?? :)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I couldn't believe how retarded the directing was and it just kept on delivering in that sense. Non-stop retarded directing.I stumbled onto this movie while flipping through channels and the plot summary made it sound interesting enough. After it ended and I saw Shyamalan in the credits, it all made perfect sense.I give it a 2 for the main actors, but it boggles my mind why they would take roles in one of Shyamalan's movies.

I liked the Actors in it, and the thought of the Plants/grass and Tree being the cause was a pretty good thought.

B movie? Yea right.,"I have just lost all respect for M. Night Shyamalan. For him to set out and make ""the greatest b movie ever"" is just insulting. So you're telling me that a rich, successful writer/director/producer used their $50 million production budget to create a movie that in the 50s was a result of young, struggling, inexperienced filmmakers who were stuck with low budgets, mediocre actors, and second rate equipment? ANYONE can do that with $50 million. So rather than take in a cheap actor, you pay people big bucks to suck? A studio payed this douche millions of dollars to make a movie that is as ""good"" as something that was made for as little as a few hundred dollars? Really, what a load of crap. This isn't a b movie, this is a cop out from a downhill filmmaker. And for all of you who are going to point out movies like Grindhouse, that was NOT a b-movie either. It was made in homage to be movies, but isn't a b movie itself. It was a spoof. However, 'The Happening' pays no homage to b movies. It is disrespecting filmmakers everywhere.

The cinematography is good, the concept is okay and even the acting is reasonable. However, the script is possibly the worst I've ever been unfortunate enough to witness.

Wonderful Movie.,"Who ever says this movie is bad has some type of lack of creativity and mind. This movie is amazing. Not only is it incredibly suspenseful and entertaining, it has an important moral, as does all of shyamalans movies. He is an incredible director and story teller. Anyone who says otherwise is sadly mistaken. He creates a sense of worry and makes you feel very unsafe. That is what he does in this movie. Makes you feel like nothing is safe. The beginning is amazing. The ending is amazing. I don't want to give anything away but the acting is superb and the story line is nothing short of amazing and creative. This man is without a doubt one of the best filmmakers of our time. Every movie he does is done with such care, class, and creativity that I feel like i owe him more for these movies he comes out with. Shyamalan is incredible and this movie along with all his others proves so.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
M. Night's first R-rated flick falls flat,"I'm not going to start out my review by sighting my enjoyment of Mr. Shyamalan's first three cinematic ventures, as trying to compare any film with a director/writer's previous endeavors is an exercise in futility. I declare that a movie must rest upon its' own laurels as an entertaining and worthwhile theater experience, regardless of whomever is at the helm. That being said, I can not remember a more dreadfully slopped together, poorly acted and painfully wretched attempt at a film that has come along in some time.For a movie that was hyped up to be M. Night Shyamalan's grand entrance into the R-rated genre, I found myself nearly in tears at the total lack of a cohesive storyline, character development or sensible dialogue. I didn't know whether to laugh, to cry or to simply shake my head in disbelief, yet I found myself performing all three for an hour and thirty minutes. Some have posted that those who criticized this film ""didn't get the deeper message"" and were being ""overly-negative."" Well, I GOT the message, it was just put into the clumsiest, least-thought-through wrapper possible.Let me put it this way: If you were making a point to someone, two predominant choices would be presented. Either A: You could take a ball-peen hammer and bludgeon them to death. Or B: Take a while, maybe a few hours, and come up with a well-developed, sensible argument to explain your stance.The second option will undoubtedly take some time, but a clear and concise point would be made, leaving both parties feeling relatively better concerning the matter. The former, while more to the point, leaves the recipient(s) irrevocably damaged, along with a terrible mess to clean up.I came into this movie leaving my expectations at the door, hoping that despite the mixed bag of tricks Mr. Shyamalan has presented audiences, I would finish having watched at least an entertaining film, if not perhaps a quality one. Instead, what I ended up getting was a bad case of ""Viewer's Remorse"" and a subtraction of time that could have been spent re-watching ""Iron Man."" If you enjoy movies that make sense or even campy B-movies that keep you entertained, DO NOT watch this waste of celluloid.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Happening is not,"I am giving this a 4 based on the 4 scenes that I thought were truly affective or ""shocking"" but that is stretching it. Those scenes could be in any other movie and still cause that reaction. Perhaps the plot of this movie did affect me like the characters in it because I also wanted to kill myself halfway through. Poor acting and a poor script by MNS. It's a one-note song and it really goes nowhere. I would advise people to avoid this movie and go see The Strangers if you want a good thrill (much scarier and more intense and better acting).Of course I don't want to give away the secret of what is ""The Happening"" but I would rather watch re-runs of ""What's Happening"" before subjecting myself to this garbage again.

STINKER!!!!!!!! - Do NOT waste your time or your money!!!,"Oh my! I saw this while traveling and just before I walked in my wife told me she had heard from a friend of hers it was bad. I dismissed her warning because I don't normally agree with her friend -- on anything! Also, earlier in the evening my wife sarcastically asked me if I wanted her to record Unbreakable because it was coming on television tonight. I laughed because prior to this evening, Unbreakable, was at the top of my list of one of the ALL-TIME worst movies ever. The producers of Unbreakable should send thank you gifts/cards to M. Night for ""The Happening"" for making a more idiotic movie! I wish I could have asked for my money back. I generally think Mark Wahlberg is a good actor and I have really enjoyed his movies. I'm not sure what he was thinking or if it was the crappy direction but his portrayal of a science teacher was absolutely ridiculous. He uses a wimpy voice and countenance which contradicts the hero, in charge attitude he tries to convey once ""The Happening"" happens. The dialog was tired and at times, just plain silly. The plot, a joke. The ending leaves you with a feeling of who cares. In fact, I didn't give a rat's rear-end about any of the characters, nor was I inspired by the story at all.

A movie worth watching again and again.,"I think this movie did not get the respect it deserves. The story was original and fresh in a movie universe full of sequels and remakes. The acting was superb. Some people criticize the acting of Marky Mark and Zooey so it is apparent that they missed the intellect of the movie. The movie starts out strong when the viewer is instantly hooked by what is happening on the screen. Anyone would be hooked by the opening. As our little band seeks safety elsewhere we see the genius of Mr. M Night unfold before our eyes. As I stated before, if you are clever enough to understand what is happening, you will completely understand why Marky Mark and Zooey behaved like they did. Check out the movie. As it says in the title, you may pick things up with each new viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"So many elements of this film annoyed me, but I was thoroughly entertained throughout.","M. Night Shyamalan seems to be having trouble keeping his writing and direction fresh. The Lady in the Water was his worst attempt at originality with not only a strange, boring incoherent plot, but with stupid flat characters and boring dialogue. In my opinion, this is his second worst film, and this was not bad...well, maybe it was, but it was still pretty entertaining.Strange events begin to happen, starting in Central Park. Everyone in the park stops, walks back a few steps, says some pointless drivel, and then kills themselves, in many various gruesome ways. The mass suicides begin to spread, and people begin to leave their homes to find a place not contaminated by whatever is causing this strange reactions in humans. Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher, and with his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), and his co-worker's daughter Jess, they travel to avoid this strange plague.The main problem with this movie is the terrible dialogue. Some lines had me cringing and wondering what Mr. Shyamalan was thinking when he wrote these clunky words on paper. Had he been watching corny romantic comedies and bad sit-coms and figured he'd make a science fiction/drama with the same bad lines? My least favorite line in the movie, and possibly one of my least favorite lines I've ever heard is where John Leguizamo's character dumps his daughter off on Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. When Zooey reaches for her hand, Leguizamo says ""Don't hold her hand unless you mean it!"" What the heck does that even mean? He's dumping his daughter off on them, and he tells her not to hold his daughter's hand unless she means it...means what? Means that she wants to hold her hand? What an awful line and delivery, and there are many of these little ""gem"" lines throughout. The writing for each character is the same, making even the little 8 year old girl seem like an adult, and I would rather hear diversity in the characters instead of hearing a movie full of M. Night Shyamalans. The actors seemed to even change for their roles. Mark Wahlberg gives an odd performance as a normal person who isn't a jerk or a tough guy. It's hard to tell if his performance is bad or good, it's still weird to me, but his character was likable, so I guess it was effective.The direction artistically is good. It looks nice, and the camera work looks just fine. But, when the characters talk is when Shyamalan's weaknesses in direction show. Instead of making individual characters, he has them all act the same. They all whisper for dramatic effect a lot, and they cry a lot, no matter the situation. It just gets annoying. It's similar to the writing in that it gets repetitive. This is one of the few movies where more establishing shots might have actually helped it, just to give the audience a break from unrelenting sameness.Now, this movie has some very bad qualities, but it is not a bad movie. From the very beginning I was interested and entertained, and even some of the awful writing caused an uncomfortable laugh in me and some others in the audience. The plot is pretty original and unique, and though it could have been handled a little better, the plot was developed nicely. There were also a few jump scenes, which is hard to produce when nothing really jumps out at you, and each scene takes place in the daytime, but the jump scenes are still thrown in there. The suicides are gruesome and fans of the violent and morbid will love the blood and gore, even though Shyamalan didn't go overboard with the violence. He wisely used it sparingly, but enough for us to get how horrible these events truly are.So M. Night Shyamalan has come a long way from The Sixth Sense...a long way down. The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece, and it seems his techniques are getting old, but aren't totally useless. He made a suspenseful movie, despite the silliness of everything. Don't expect a classic going in, because you won't get one. Put your standards lower than they would be for ""Lady in the Water"" and you might find you can squeeze some goodness even out of the bad.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 85 mins. R for gruesome violence.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"With such hype I expected disappointment, but not this much...","Considering M Night's initial track record of favorable critical reception and consumer interest, expectations were considerably high for this film. His first two films, Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, were refreshingly unique and were considered the start of a promising, and long, career in film creation, with some critics and industry notables dubbing him the next Hitchcock and even Spielberg. But now we can see with his diminishing box office success, and really rapidly declining favor with critics, beginning with Signs and gradually plummeting with The Village, Lady In The Water, and now this atrocity, that his comparison to those directors couldn't have been more far off.The Happening is basically The Emperor's New Clothes of films. I honestly don't understand how anyone could have approved this script for a production when it is so poorly written. The critics who have come down on this movie have come down on it extremely harshly and deservedly as well.This movie has so many shortcomings it's almost tough to list all of them: bad acting, plot-holes, defies laws of nature and physics, poor direction, anticlimactic, extremely preachy and obnoxiously politically loud, ultra-boring subplots, ridiculously cliché and contrived characters, awful attempts at humor at several points, etc.The only thing that was 'Happening' during the movie was many loud laughs and boos. During many of the scenes due to ridiculously poorly written dialog, people in the audience burst into laughter. I found it hard to laugh considering I was physically sick with disappointment. At the end of the film the entire theater erupted into boos sadly, and three people in front of me walked out about sixty-minutes into the film. The only reason I didn't walk out was because I was in a group of several people.M Night has lost it clearly, and he shown no signs of getting it back either. Sixth Sense, I always thought it was a ripoff of the book 'A Stir Of Echoes' (written in 1958, later made into a movie Stir of Echoes starring Kevin Bacon) by Richard Matheson (legendary writer responsible for I Am Legend novel amongst others). M Night was accused of plagiarizing elements of 'Lost Boys' by Orson Scott Card as well for parts of Sixth Sense. With yet another movie under his belt that has tanked enormously and been slagged by critics, a movie that is seemingly all his own production, writing, and directing, I unfortunately have to come to the conclusion that unless he's heavily plagiarizing superior writing, he's up the creek without a paddle as far as making a decent film goes.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Huge Disappointment, Roger Ebert, What Were You Thinking?","Like another commentator, I too was hoping for an M. Night return to excellence. The poor reviews lowered my expectations a lot, but those were still not met. The acting was atrocious...and I mean camp classic bad. Zoey's eyes, Mark's befuddlement, John's...well, John's...OK, John did nothing.Half way through the film, the thought occurred that maybe this was intended to be a spoof. At least that would have conceivably salvaged the experience. I never walk out of films, but the only thing that kept me in my seat was my hope against hope that something would happen to save this mess.Of course, it did not.It was astonishing walking out of a theater and hearing the patrons around me uniformly panning the previous hour and half as a total waste of time and money.And unlike Roger Ebert, my fellow patrons were right.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Encapsulating,"This was a great movie from a man that has delivered us so many in the past (we'll have to forget Lady in the Water!) Like another reviewer has said, don't go to see this expecting to be blown away because very simply you won't! It is one of those wonderful films that make you think, has beautiful imagery and a very good cast.There are moments in the film when I, a 25 yr old man, was reclining in fear in my cinema chair as I was frightened!!! That, I feel, can only be done in these situations by Shyamalan and maybe at this given time Danny Boyle! Another reviewer mentioned that there seemed to be no chemistry between the two leads, Wahlberg and Deschanel. Well without giving the plot away we are told that they are a couple that are going through problems and are distant - personally I thought the casting for the entire film was well and truly spot on, especially John Leguizamo.The film still has it's Shyamalan's ""touches"" with the shock value. I'm not going to give anything away by telling you that some scenes are truly shocking and it some cases quite disturbing yet superbly shot.I gave this film a 9 very simply because once more people see it and give it time then reflect back. Personally I feel The Village is his best, Signs is great, Unbreakable is a good film (again, once it has been given time) and the Sixth Sense awoke a genre once more that people are trying to re-encapsulate! The Happening is going to be up there with Signs and the Village.Go and see (or simply just see) this film - ignore the science behind it if needs be.

What No!,"It's time to review The Happening (2008) and I'm just going to get to the point, this movie is awful. However, this is one of those movies that cross the line of being so bad, it's good territory.Positives for The Happening (2008):
I was laughing my butt off at all of the unintentional comedy in this movie. Every line of dialogue in this movie that is being said by Mark Wahlberg, Zoey Deschannel, John Legiuzamo, the Hot Dog Guy and the rest of the cast are so hilarious. All of the kills in this movie are also hilarious to look at.Negatives for The Happening (2008):
If you watch this movie as a thriller, you will hate it and ask yourself how this movie was made by the same guy who made The Sixth Sense (1999), Unbreakable (2000) and Signs (2002). The acting from the entire cast is absolutely dreadful from beginning to end. The plot twist in this movie is by far the worst plot twist in any of M. Night Shyamalan's movies.Overall, The Happening (2008) is one of the most unintentionally hilarious and entertaining movies that I've seen in my life and Loved every minute of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why is it so hard for Americans to find a good movie these days?,"Because we're looking in all the wrong places.Don't get me wrong, Shyamalans new flick is not perfect in any sense of the word. The dialogue is chunky and awkward, the acting follows accordingly into sometimes seemingly mild absurdity. The R rating is completely wasted, especially since it was hyped by the media. And worst of all, Walberg is miscast in his role as the leading protagonist.But the message and theme remains and it is clear as a bright blue morning.To say that this movie is a walking ""green"" advertisement would be to oversimplify. This movie is about the power of fear, the complexity of human relationships which are at the same time beautifully simple in moments of extreme duress, and most of all, a nod towards the overall discourse of our modern world towards trying to find ""simple"" answers in regards to unexplainable phenomena. For those critics that slam this movie because it leaves us with a hanging string would be to prove Shyamalans very point: that as a society, we have become unfamiliar and yes, uncomfortable with whatever does not hand us answers in percentage, mathematical, or clear cut formulas. This movie is not supposed to provide any clear formulaic answers, merely present us with an exaggerated situation and then allow us to come to our own epiphany.How do I know this to be true? For the reviewers that have actually seen this movie, then you know that there were those moments of complete quiet on screen. Where only the wind breathed life and the grass swayed ominously and Walberg and Deschanel ceased their constant running and looked fearfully out into the open green fields. What were they looking for...what were they running from? They didn't know, not for sure...only that something was after them, something they could not stop, something that they could not see, touch, taste, or hear. Only something that they could feel. If not clear enough, these intense moments of human frailty are then reiterated in the form of a child running limply beside Deschanel's character. In those moments, Shyamalan's brilliance takes center stage, allowing us as viewers to pause and consider and finally realize, along with Walberg and Deschanel, that the glory of being human is our ability to choose love over fear, that within our most frail moments we have only two things: our fellow humans and the beauty of the physical world that surrounds us. Everything else fades into obscurity. This was meant to be the only answer and ironically, within our modern age, it was the one answer that most viewers could not seem to grasp.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Or on the other hand you can still writing, but please let the directing job for people who can really do it! In fact, Shyamalan writing in its essence is not bad because he can create arguments with some originality and alternative issues but, aside from movies like THE SIX SENSE or UNBREAKABLE, he just sucks as a director!In this movie, the only good issue is the plot's main topic: the idea of the plants create a toxic substance which make people commit suicide, protecting themselves against the most aggressive race on Earth, the Human race! This background idea is the only good thing of THE HAPPENING. All the rest is just pathetic. The film is too slow paced, and almost nothing really happens, as it is totally non-suspenseful and really boring. And what about the sub-plot concerning to the main characters' affections?

A Fine SciFi Movie,"Having read all the bad reviews I just had to see this movie for myself. After viewing it, I can't understand why so many people are bashing this movie. In fact, those giving this movie a bad review are probably among the same egg-head crowd that gave good reviews to real stinkers like ""No Country for Old Men"" or the real snooze-fest ""There will be Blood.""First of all, it's true that there were some unbelievable parts/premises in this movie, but that's why it's called ""Science Fiction"", emphasis on the word fiction. For the SciFi genre the acting was fine and realistic, as were the events and circumstances. The movie flowed in a fine coherent manner, and while not a spectacular flick, I would say it falls somewhere in the middle of the road. At the very least, it's certainly entertaining and makes you think. Lastly, the movie was just what I thought it would be from my impression by the coming attractions.I can only surmise that those that didn't like this movie were expecting something spectacular from MKS. However, I never really thought MKS was such a great writer/director in the first place. So I've taken this movie at face value as another SciFi flick. If you're expecting ""The Sixth Sense"" then don't see this movie, because you'll be disappointed.

Creepy and Chilling!,"I bet this review is going to receive plenty of backlash, but I happened to be one of those people who enjoyed the Happening in some capacity. While there were some flaws to be had, I was kept on edge for the entire film and I was given the creeps more often than not. The premise is also scary enough as this film is more of an environmental thriller that poses the question, ""What would happen if trees and plants decide to protect themselves after years of global warming?""M.Night Shymalan's film is about this invisible toxin produced by the trees and those who come into contact with it commits suicide. A science teacher named Elliot and his wife, Alma must stay ahead of the wind in order to stay alive and figure out why this is happening.Now the weakest part of the film may have to do with the acting. Like many others, I agree that Mark Wahlberg was pretty bad thanks to his forced overacting. He is generally a great actor, but this performance was laughable. However, Zooey Deschanel was a good presence as always and she did a rather solid job.Overall, The Happening may not be the greatest thriller ever made, but it was often chilling and always kept me asking what is going to happen next. The screenplay is decent, but some of the dialog seems clammy. But on the whole, the film does have an excellent premise.

The Happening (look past the media),Despite all the bad media surrounding this film I still went to see it. And I was pleased with what I saw. In previous work M. Night Shyamalan shows that he is a writer/producer/director like none other. He doesn't worry about how glamorous the film is. Instead he paints the picture as if you were there. His use of mainly one camera in all his movies make you feel like you are witnessing the events. For movies now-a-days we want the special effects and the gorgeous style of shooting along with a happy ending. M. Night Shymalan changes this. As I stated above his style is different. But in his previous writing he doesn't give us the happy ending we crave. (I will not say how The Happening ends) And the lack of closure in his previous work make the viewer think. The viewer can't just walk out of the theater and discard the story just witnessed. Instead they think about the film and forever remember the story. Overall I think you should look past the media and listen to how you feel. Don't be afraid of the unknown.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Is Entertaining.,"Lets face it. Anyone who can get in front of a monitor can be an armchair critic. You can go on any movie site and listen to a bunch of people discuss dialogue, acting, etc. But who still goes to movies to go actually see a movie? M. Night is not going to be tossing out Oscar winning performances in a movie advertised in this manner. I liked the movie, and disliked the movie, and this is why.First off, the movie get your brain moving a bit. There was some laughter at scenes that I don't really feel like spoiling although when/if you do see it, you will see. It seems that people, when they see a horror movie, they go and try to do the macho thing and nitpick at EVERYTHING just to deter themselves from the actual movie. The movie had some jumping parts, and some chilling parts, and some laughing parts. However if you watch closely and try to avoid some kind of corny dialogue (yes I contradicted myself but hear me out), you might leave the theater trying to comprehend what exactly went on. It's a thinking movie. Also, as seen in the previews, the construction site scene is just beyond unsettling. You'll love the sounds of corpses hitting pavement.The bad thing? The ending. Another contradiction that I just made is that the ending leaves you thinking, but it also leaves you kind of empty. It lacked a good punch to put away some answers. It could have been played out better, but then again Im just an armchair critic, Im not getting paid to tell the director how to end it.Would I recommend this movie to you? Only under two conditions. If you haven't been thwarted away by people/critics saying it was garbage or if you'd like to just go see a movie that kind of makes sense and kind of doesn't.It is really up to you.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

...what the hell was that.,"Look. I can't begin to give an accurate summary of what I just saw.Mark Walberg who gave what I considered an Oscar worth performance in ""The Departed"" was just awful.Let me put it like this. It was in my opinion, the worst big budget American film in at least the last ten years.We've seen M. Night go from ""The next Spielberg"" to someone who should perhaps take up an entirely new profession. I'm not kidding when I say that it was laugh out loud bad...no, don't tell me what you think are the redeeming qualities. This film had two scenes of note. I'll not explain them. But two scenes taking up about two minutes of screen time. The other hour and 38 minutes.*GAH*",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the biggest bombs I have ever seen!,"Okay, so I am giving this a 1. It was absolutely horrendous. Would I recommend this movie to people? Absolutely. Why? Because it was probably the most entertaining bomb-of-a-movie I've ever seen. Trust me, you will laugh-out-loud.It was so bad that I am still waiting for Mark Wahlberg and M. Night Shamalyan to say, ""just joking, guys!"" But no. I've seen interviews with both the actor and director - on separate occasions, and it turns out that what the movie was marketed as and from what these two discuss in interviews, we can gather that ""The Happening"" was and is an earnest attempt at making a thriller. Both Wahlberg and Shamalyan talk about the premise and the seriousness of the story, and so on. But I kid you not, a thriller is not what you get. It's a comedy because we recognize how earnest this attempt was at making a thriller. And our realization of this while watching the absurd film makes it all the more entertaining and funny. Oh I definitely smell Razzies.The premise isn't even that bad, I have to say. Plants/nature turning on humans because of our destruction/lack-of-respect, etc. But the delivery... oh my! The acting is something to behold. It will have you believing that these actors may have in fact been lobotomized or invaded by kindergarten students during the filming. Particularly Mark Wahlberg. Okay, now some people might say that he is supposed to be a an innocent/naive-type character. Umm, no. His delivery of lines is on par with Keanu Reeves on a bad day. Is this the same actor that did 'The Departed'? Might not be Mark Wahlberg's fault. Perhaps it was the writing, directing, or editing: which, when combined, leaves the audience on several occasions in absolute hysterics. And I'm specifically talking about the parts that were supposed to be scary or suspenseful. So what gives? My guess is that M. Night lost his mojo a bit. He couldn't step up to the plate or knock down a three when called upon. If he was trying to make a comedy, however, I give him full credit. My uncontrollable laughter throughout was worth the full price of admission.Now, I have to say that I've been a fan of M Night Shamalyan for quite a while now. Obviously the ""Sixth Sense"" was genius. By industry standards M. Night was pulling off an Orson Welles for the most part when he brought it out. By word-of-mouth, that movie made a mint. And for good reason. It featured multi-layered writing and flawless directing and people took notice. Then he followed it up with ""Unbreakable"", an even better film in my opinion. Sheer genius actually. His take on the ""superhero/comic-book"" genre was of the highest quality; it was original, sharp, and he got the best out of his actors. The problem is, his writing and directing at times is so ridiculously good that you think he can do no wrong. ""Signs"" was a bit of a letdown. I felt he was relying on the special effects and the alien a bit too much in the third act. ""The Village"" was unbelievably good. He took a slice of the time (post 9/11 world) and created an allegory of American society. I know I'm in the minority here with regard to that movie, but I felt he nailed it. So he is highly gifted in his craft, no doubt. Again it's the expectations. This happens with all great directors. ""Lady in the Water"" was an embarrassment to say the least. I don't know what happened there, it was just plain boring and nothing seemed to happen. The editing, the acting, the writing, all bad. Was he, perhaps, a bit too self-involved? I think so. Now we get ""The Happening"", which is the strangest movie of the bunch because it doesn't know what it is or what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a thriller? What is it?Do watch the movie, though. I am telling you, it is the best ""worse"" movie you will ever see. Heck, I may give it a 10 after my next viewing. If I can just figure out what the hell I watched.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intelligent people think they are cheated - the movie is a FRAUD!,"Manoj Night Shyamalan (MNS) evokes a weird feeling inside me. I always expect something unusual and something very different from him. With every movie he presents a concept, that is well thought and presented. I was looking forward to this movie. I saw it today -The movie is about unusual things happening  people loosing thinking, direction and fatally committing suicide - in US, starting from big city (New York) and approaching remote areas of North East US. The indication of something fatal approaching is the direction of wind  the trees shaking and the grass quavering. Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher, and he is on a run - from these unusual events - with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and his friend's girl child Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). To avoid death, Elliot tries scientific methodology of analysis, study, interpretation etc. but fails to understand the ways of these happenings. As mysteriously the happenings starts, they end also without any logic, science or reason.In the beginning of the movie MNS brags about science, intelligence etc. and I was thinking what the hell  why is he showing off? Also MNS is upfront  in the beginning he presents the concept of the movie  Not all things can be understood by science and reason. That is the concept and the core of the movie.Most people expect some cause and effect relationship. That is how our minds are trained. MNS presents the concept very casually in the beginning but follows it up diligently till the end. Did he fool the audience? NO. Only that audience who thought they were intelligent  but actually who are not intelligent enough to respect nature and natural events and happenings  did not get it.The movie holds your attention from the beginning till the end. MNS has a great style of presenting his narrative  that engages, builds, and challenges the audiences. Great stuff! He is a master of the medium and his concepts.In an interview he told that this movie is simple  it does not have a twist in the ending. And there is none. Fools mights consider this movie a fraud, but it is brilliant.Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel and Ashlyn Sanchez have played their part as per the role. The narrative is simple, but edge of the sit.Full marks to MNS! If you have not liked the movie, you must be the one who is falsely considering him/herself intelligent  a scientific person, who requires answers for everything. Let me tell you  there are no answers for many things in life and nature. Earlier learned the better for your intelligence! (Stars 7 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Happening never happened,"How is it that a man, who has so many fans, can so blatantly insult everyone's intelligence and hope to get away with it? I never made an attempt to become a fan of Shyamalan's and now I never will. The only thing I saw of his that I liked was Sixth Sense. It was fun and interesting even though I remember figuring it out before it was half over. I could explain why I failed to like The Village and Lady In the Water but I don't want to bore anyone, including myself. Although I can tell you why I was excited by Lady In the Water. Simply, the first trailer with Josh Groban singing beautifully and the look of a dark, wonderful fairy tale sucked me in only to lead me to a futile, fatal attraction.For me, seeing The Happening was a weak moment and an effort to forgive.I cannot blame poor acting because I think the actors all did as they were told. What some may blame on poor acting was instead, in my opinion, a matter of poor, deceitful directing, leading the performers into a belief that they were a part of a great film which would deliver with fantastic editing - and their shallow characters would fit into a grand plan of the great master's philosophy and plan. I feel sorry for all the performers whom I really do admire. It is because of one man's self servitude and shallow vision that many others may suffer. Hopefully I am wrong.This is not a movie. I went to see a movie and all I got was this stupid philosophy lesson. I get my lessons from life Shammy and I get my kicks from movies. When you decide to get back into the entertainment business, you're going to have to fight real hard to get me into the theater.The Sham-fan will get their fill but I will not understand why. But the movie fan will find that there is no artistic value to this sham of a flick. In my mind, the reason for this film was lost in the wind. This makes it easier to believe that he gives himself far too much credit for artistic value, which, in fact, in my opinion, has indeed been blown away by the winds which we all know affect us if we let them remove from reach the real reason why we are here.1/10 if not 0/10",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awesome Premise Botched,"Firstly, this is not a HORRIBLE movie.That said, it doesn't live up to the expectations of people who are fans of Shyamalan's better movies. My wife brought to my attention that people are overly critical of Shyamalan's works, and I agree. Had this movie been written, produced and directed by some guy we've never heard of, critics would herald ample praise for this movie.Frankly, it was good and bad, so I'm giving it a ""more-on-the-plus-side"" 6 out of 10 stars. The movie has an astoundingly good premise. The more I heard about this movie, the more eagerly I awaited its debut. Even for the first half of the movie, the anticipation of action kept me from blinking for nearly an hour, despite the fact that the dialogue felt forced and unnatural. The suspense was nauseating. Ultimately, it got irritating. The suspense became pretentious and wholly unnecessary, not to mention redundant and predictably well-timed. From the middle of the movie to the end, the flick was completely devoid of surprise. The climax was completely not necessitated, making you feel like the protagonists deserve whatever they get! The ending itself was a waste of film. I could have walked out of the theater 7-8 minutes early and I'd be writing the exact same comment here.I disagree with most of the ""The Happening's declivitous crappies typifies Shyamalan's directorial career"" comments I'm hearing.If there's one good thing I would say about this movie, it's that it mystified you initially and frightened you by making you feel so isolated.If there was something bad I would say, it's that this movie had SO MUCH POTENTIAL to be a really scary, crazy, unbelievable-but-tangible masterpiece, but it is what it is - a decent movie, but a real SNAFU when you look at what it could've been.Final word: Props to Shyamalan for making a high-budget blockbuster movie that contained about 10 minutes of shots of trees and grass swaying in the wind. I hope you didn't pay too much for those ""special"" effects.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The art of film-making is back with a vengeance.,"There have been few movies this year that I have wanted to see in the theatres. ""Don't Mess with the Zohan"" just didn't seem worthy of my $10.50 (the price of a movie in Wenatchee now. Absurd.) However, I have seen all of M. Night Shyamalan films in a theatre first, and I always intend to.I owe M. Night so very much.I would pay exactly ten times my admission price to see his work. Here is why: Every MNS movie is stylized in different ways. I never know what to expect when I go see a film of his. The Happening is no different. Initially I thought ""why is Markie Mark over-acting so much??"", but it quickly became clear to me that he was directed to do so, as was the rest of the cast through the whole movie. It works. It works magic. Zooey Deschanel is lovely and lovable, despite mistakes and foibles that any human dislikes in themselves, and so often despise fictional characters for possessing. Ashlyn Sanchez, the 8-year-old in the film, has a tough time grasping the style that MNS was aiming for, and it can be a little distracting, but I plead with you to give her a chance. She was attempting very difficult things, and not all kids are Haley Joels. In fact, all of the actors in the movie were ever so slightly off target regarding the style MNS was encouraging, all except John ""I'm freaking amazing"" Leguizamo. He was simply perfect. He clearly understood exactly what was expected of him, and he delivered a performance so sincere that it was haunting. The man is severely under-rated.Every M. Night movie combines genres. The Happening was no different. He deftly combines sci-fi and horror (granted, that's not difficult) with a smattering of romance, comedy, mystery, and disaster. The one thing you will NOT see in The Happening is action. It is calm, collected, realistic, and quiet. And my heart was pounding the whole time. There were times I felt I could not breathe, times I felt I should remain perfectly still, and at times I wanted to run. I was fully engrossed in the universe of the characters, because it was very realistically set in a universe I might occupy.Every Shyamalan movie deeply changes me in some way. The Happening was no different. The ""what if""s brought about by this movie are endless for me. The mental and spiritual preparation I have spiraled into in order to handle these ""what if""s has already effected me positively. You can laugh at me if you want, but to deny yourself the gifts that art has to offer is tragic and a detestable waste.There are many people who are going to hate this movie. Those people should go see ""Zohan"". Or ""The Incredible Hulk"". The Happening passed up Iron Man as my favorite movie of the year so far. It was a tough call, Iron Man was expertly done. It simply did not change me in the way that only a film like The Happening can.I HIGHLY recommend seeing this movie if you can appreciate an unconventional style, and a premise so scary that it makes me want to purchase all manner of military survival gear.I do NOT recommend seeing this movie if you need to see things smashed and blown up. Or if you need dialogue that doesn't seem like it's out of a radio play. Or if you are expecting any kind of terrifying plot twist. There is none. It is what it is.Really, really good.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Whew! Not Good. Really, Not Good.","The Happening can only be described by me as the willful destruction of an established BRAND. And that is a rather reluctant but honest commentary on this latest awful movie by M. Night Shyamalan. On one hand I am perplexed by the seemingly unfinished effort. On the other I am insulted that we (a loyal audience) may be taken for granted with this offering because he dared to unveil this tripe to us. M. Night did not do his homework nor his due diligence with this film, and it is painfully obvious from the poor dialog, the stupidly illogical story line and the grossly mischaracterized biology and ecology. This one may signal the end of the ride. Speaking as a fan of Mike Tyson who kept looking for a return to the brilliance of old ""Iron Mike"", I think that M. Night may have no fight left. Still, and thankfully so, the fleeting physical attributes of prize fighting are not needed for film-making. But you must have a similar passion to want to be your very best. Well, do you still have the passion M. Night? Or will you become as big a joke to the film-making arena as Mr. Tyson became to the prize fighting arena? Simply unbelievable!And for those who contend that this is a solid effort that has been misunderstood, you must be more discriminating. You do M. Night's previous very good works a great injustice to say that this one is good. Stop it and drop the Kool Aid!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

He has lost all the credibility as a director and as a person...Please don't say ""If you don't like it don't see it"", because it's a fraud asking for a penny to see this movie.

A movie that takes its audience seriously and offers a lot of food for thought,"Shyamalan might be one of the most unstable contemporary directors in terms of quality. There are some of his movies which I disliked completely like ''The Village'' being wrongfully advertised as a horror movie even though it's a slow-paced drama. Other movies are quite overrated like ''The Sixth Sense'' that has its moments but isn't that compelling once you have figured out the predictable twist. Then again, Shyamalan has also directed some films that are close to perfection like the intense ''Split'' with its claustrophobic atmosphere. And then there are some of his movies that I like quite a lot but which are extremely underrated. ''The Happening'' is exactly this kind of movie.What I liked about the movie is that it didn't include a twist like most of Shyamalan's other movies and that it doesn't really answer all the questions. Some theories are spread throughout the film and the movie has a strong environmental message but it's never getting too educational or pretentious. The film indirectly criticizes the media that are jumping to conclusions about terrorist attacks and toxic gases which end up influencing some tragic events in the movie. This film offers a lot of food for thought without exaggerating things and lets the viewers think by themselves.The acting blends in perfectly. The actors are showing emotions of care and fear but we don't get the usual stereotypes of crying and yelling people like in so many other disaster movies. I liked Mark Wahlberg's performance as goofy but resilient science teacher that perfectly complemented Zooey Deschanel's character which was rather insecure and stressful. The two characters felt charming and realistic with their genuine flaws and strengths where an optimist had to deal with a realist. The side characters weren't particularly compelling but diversified enough to keep the movie entertaining from start to finish. We get introduced to aggressive survivalists, nervous soldiers and paranoid recluses among others.I liked the fact that the movie didn't have any lengths. It takes less than five minutes for the introduction and the conclusion and focuses on the body of the movie. Shyamalan takes us on an epic survival journey developing a gloomy and slightly surrealist atmosphere that gives the movie a very unique mood. It neither focuses on special effects nor on a dystopian atmosphere like so many other films of its kind and opts for a mysterious approach instead.Overall, the acting, mood and script are compelling because they are creative, entertaining and unique. Most people criticized the movie because their expectations of a spectacular disaster movie with a surprising twist weren't met or simply because they didn't fully understand the movie and tried to interpret the origins and reasons behind the happening. As the movie mentions itself, some things cannot be explained and should just be taken the way they are. If you accept this rule and don't have any specific expectations, ''The Happening'' will surprise you positively. This movie might not be a masterpiece but it clearly is one of the most distinctive disaster films of the new millennium.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What happened to the happening?,"I think it is safe to say that like many film goers I was impressed with M. Night Shyamalan's debut movie ""the sixth sense"". It was a relief to find that a new director had created a refreshing style of story telling which established his signature in that craft. Unfortunately like many others, I have noticed that there has been an increasing lack of quality in the movies that were released one after another following his debut movie. The happening was no exception, for the most part it was reduced to the very bare minimum of film cinema if not less.The very first thirty minutes did a decent job with establishing what the premise of the story was and as the movie progressed, unfortunately the story, characters and turning points did not.I was watching the movie anticipating that the main characters would undergo a more devastating scenario in each new environment they had come across on as well as seeing their personal struggle to survive the epidemic. The movie instead just continued to drag on inviting new characters that died moments later and had no relevance to the story. The cause of the epidemic was even less logical by hiding it with theories that made no sense and eventually had no explanation by the time the movie ended. It pretty much just happened.So what happened to the happening....absolutely NOTHING.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"THE HAPPENING (M. Night Shyamalan, 2008) **1/2","One of my pet peeves has always been when movies have identical names but absolutely nothing else in common with each other; this is just such a case since, back in 1967, Elliot Silverstein had already directed Anthony Quinn and Faye Dunaway in a now-forgotten hippie kidnappers comedy which, incidentally, I’ve caught on Italian TV ages ago.Typically for M. Night Shyamalan’s recent movies, his latest offering was coolly received by both critics and audiences but I actually thought that, at least for the first hour, it was pretty good. Hell, even Mark Wahlberg gets better with each successive film I see him in – or at least seems more tolerable as a leading man here than in that deplorable PLANET OF THE APES remake from 2001! Like the director’s previous films THE VILLAGE (2004) and, to a lesser extent SIGNS (2002), this one also has an intriguing premise which is, however, marred by an unsatisfying denouement. In any case, the film’s would-be apocalyptic feel and the eventual discovery of its natural aggressor bring to mind equally modest (but vintage and decidedly superior) sci-fi outings like PANIC IN YEAR ZERO and THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (both 1962).The belatedly introduced ‘redneck granny’ character was hard to take at times and, besides, as often happens to me while watching disaster movies, I break out in giggles every time there is depicted an event of mass hysteria (which come in droves here). One does wonder at this point, though, where Shyamalan’s career might possibly be headed since he has basically been stuck in the same allegorical/apocalyptic fantasy rut for far too long now…",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

What's it all about?,M. Night Shyamalan's newest Movie The Happening is poking fun of our society. Each day people kill themselves and we don't care to know why! The moment someone is about to kill themselves their whole world stops. Seeing all the suicides focused in a general area experts don't know the cause and guess. The movie depicts suicide as wave of wind that we cannot control. Since all the suicides in the movie are spontaneous without reason the movie highlights the worst of the problem. The characters confusion when confronted by dead suicide victims is to run away from the problem and isolate themselves from others who might have the suicide sickness.

The Idea Isn't Executed Too Well,"I always like the way M. Night Shyamalan-ding-dong thinks outside the box with his storytelling. This film has epic death scenes with great FX and it's filmed really well, except some of those closeups get to be a bit too much. The film loses momentum during the second act and some of this is due to the cheesy acting, which I believe the director is mostly to blame.

M. Night? What The {bleep!} Happened?!,"I have to shamefully admit something here: I'm an M. Night junkie. I love just about everything he's done. Yes, even LADY IN THE WATER, which had a heartfelt message at its core and a great actor (Paul Giamatti) leading the way. And there were at least some creepy creatures in it. Lots of things were ""happening."" Unfortunately, you can't say the same thing for THE HAPPENING (I've given it the unfortunate new title of ""The Unhappening"").Let's see where to begin I guess the story is as bad a place as any First off, if you're going to make a thriller, it needs to be scary. The Happening isn't. The story has an enemy that we never see. And although unseen enemies can be psychologically frightening if done right (a bit caveat), they can be hard to pull off. The simple fact that not only was The Happening's main antagonist(s) not in the least frightening, it was seriously lame and completely unbelievable as to how the main protagonist comes to understand how it's ""chasing them."" Second problem Acting. Although I'm no die-hard fan of Mark Wahlberg (THE DEPARTED), I have enjoyed previous films with him as a main character. But here he pulls in a very wooden and careless performance. Perhaps the script stymied him, perhaps not. But I think the bad script/story is definitely to blame, because also in the cast were John Leguizamo (ICE AGE) and Zooey Deschanel (FAILURE TO LAUNCH), both of which I consider high prizes in Hollywood and often underused. Their stilted line deliveries (""Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it!"") and equally wooden performances seem to point toward story problems of epic proportions.The final stone...I'll cast the final stone and mention the complete lack of anything approaching a character we can sympathize or identify with. Again, pretty much a script/story problem. People die. They fall off buildings, stab themselves with hair pins, allow themselves to be run over by a riding mower, hang themselves, crash their cars, and die in fairly gruesome fashion (earning the film it's first R rating for M. Night). And I think this is where he screwed up. He must've equated gruesomeness with theatrical tension, but that wasn't the case. There needs to be a human element to the story and up until now, M. Night has been able to deliver it.But here, it just ain't ""happening.""",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I mean, when you have the main character actually talking to a rubber plant, you have to ask yourself if the writer was under the influence alcohol when writing the script (a.k.a well and truly sloshed).Me and my friends found ourselves laughing at bits that we should have been scared of, and at times, it's hard to tell whether the film is trying to be serious or funny. The film tends to raise many questions, but fails to answer any. You wait and wait for answers, but there's none, and the ending is just pathetic. And don't even get me started on the acting! I didn't find the film boring, it's watchable, but it could have been a lot better if more logical thinking went into the whole thing.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Beautiful Romance in One Heck of a Scary Setting...,"I knew right away when I saw the movie that there was going to be a cute little romantic subplot. And I think this was what truly drives this great movie. Yes, I loved it, and you can't make me not like it. Elliot and Alma's relationship is the best thing this movie has. All their moments together are so wonderfully executed, thanks to the two leads and their acting (Wahlberg is loose and comfortable, Deschanel is charming and my now my favorite actress). I particularly like the scene with the cough syrup and the scene with the ""who's chasing who"": you know what I'm talking about. The end stuff with the conversation between the houses was so beautiful, and the walking towards each other was the most beautiful thing Night has done (the music... wow. Kudos to James Newton Howard). The ending I thought was perfect... people didn't seem to like it. I thought it was fitting and appropriate. So basically, the love plot was the driving force, and the scene at the very end before the ending ending... with their hug and Zooey's antics... wow, that was so lovely. So I loved the movie really because of these moments. The chemistry between Mark and Zooey was pretty darn good.But don't get me wrong. The movie is pretty damn scary. The opening suicides are really well done and some of them just shocked me, even though I saw the trailers. The parts where everyone stands still, the loss of orientation, were very chilling. My favorite plot in the whole movie is the Julian subplot with his child. That is just so moving. And my favorite scene is the one at Princeton. It is the saddest thing I have ever seen, ever.And the humor is still up there. Very funny stuff interspersed throughout. The pacing is good. But what really drives this movie, again, is the romance and the relationship between Elliot and Alma. I would watch it just for that.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incredibly poorly done,"The movie is filled with red herrings, poor acting, and excels in incoherence. It is as if the Shyamalan himself was a victim of the plant kingdom's 'virus' and gone into self-destruct mode.I don't think any of the actor's performance could be faulted. The storyline was in shambles. But Shyamalan's produced great stuff before and an apologetic rebuttal is that it was all intentional and that the storyline was mean to be irrelevant. It's stretching it, but too often when watching 'The Happening', you feel the need to defend and explain the movie.That said, the movie, while frustrating keeps you interested in the sadistic sense: it's intriguing seeing people kill themselves for no apparent reason.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fall from grace,"There was real genius in M Night Shyamalan's first films Unbreakable & The Sixth Sense & Signs. These were all good films. They were entertaining, meaningful, and sometimes scary as hell, most importantly they explored the emotions & psyche of the characters. Then there came The Village which was a such disappointment to me, and Lady in the water which continued the downward fall. Those two films is where we see the chinks in the armor. Now we have The Happening, which looks like Shyamalan's biggest dud yet.I at least understand what Shyamalan was getting at here. Like all his films there is a great Twilight Zone feel & tone which is both mysterious & eerie. He's also trying to make a meaningful statement about Global warming, Pollution, the green house effect, and society's overwhelming anxiety mass fear & paranoia in a post 9/11 world. Then the shock effect of seeing mass suicides, people seem to degrade mentally into mindless zombies then killing themselves. He does try to explain the phenomena, he does have a few points that this is an act of nature and science can only give theories about THE HAPPENING, there for the event may never truly be explained.But really the film's attempts to be scary and comical are just so vain, and for a few stretches of the movie we borderline boredom. Problem was that the film started out with a bang and the suspense wasn't built up like in many of Shyamalan's films. The suspense wasn't there, when the Happening arrives we feel nothing, we aren't even sure what the hell's going on. The film was more confusing then it was scary. There isn't any reasonable nor scientific logic to why these people would kill themselves in such elaborate ways, as shocking as they are they don't make sense, why are they finding such clever ways of killing themselves? The suicides range from chilling to just over the top & funny. I mean some of the suicides were just comical. I think the idea he tried to put out was clever and somewhat original, but the execution is terrible. Don't get me started with the acting. Mark Wahlberg for most of the film has this ""Deer caught in the headlights"" look in his eyes, and his delivery of some of his lines made you wanna sigh. Zooey Daschel was equally misguided, there wasn't much chemistry between her & Whalberg in fact she was kinda annoying. When ever they say something meant to be funny we laugh at them not with them, just because of how stupid an awkward their lines were. Everyone in this film just seemed awkward, misguided and really just over the top.In conclusion this wasn't entirely a bad idea but really the execution is the main problem. Bad acting, Poor dialouge, poorly developed story, lack of suspense, this movie was plain boring. I don't think this is the end for Mr. Shyamalan, but he really needs to get his head together, and remember what he did that originally got him where he is.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
There is nothing going on there...,"There is nothing happening in that movie. It is not intriguing, it is fascinating, it is not even scary. It is kind of interesting at the beginning when that thing start happening but when it just go on and on without a clear explanation of what is happening and why is happening well...you just go brain-dead.There are few guesses and theories but nothing concrete so the audience has to guess for themselves what the hell is going on. And the scenes where they are running from the wind on the field are more bizarre than scary. The suspense is ridiculous and does not deliver at all.As of the actors, don't even get me started. I have always loved Mark Walhberg, but the last time I saw him in a good performance was in Invincible. Here he is as sweet as he could be as a high school teacher but not truthful at all, his performance seems a bit exhausted and his character way undeveloped. His wife in the movie Zooye Deschanel is such a beautiful big blue eyed girl that looks more like the students he is teaching than his wife. She was acting weird from the get going so when that happening happened she just looked like a scared animal out of place. I think that the only reasonable character was John Loguisamo's one, who actually managed to breathe some substance into it.Anyway all in all I cannot say I enjoyed the movie. I think the idea is actually pretty good one but the execution of it very poor. May be it would have worked better if there was some kind of reason for this to happen or a pattern or any kind of logic that could answer all the questions this movie has raised. M. Night Shyamalan though has the habit of just asking them and leaving us empty-handed as in The Signs and The Village. Actually this movie is like a poorer version of The Signs, with the best bits cut out.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Signs meets War of the Worlds, but no match","It was an interesting idea and interpretation, but it was a too long a movie to present a single idea. At least Day of the Trifids has had some action.Short plot line: the plants are upset and are starting to kill people off. They panic, run, talk nonsense and scream a lot. Then they kill themselves. I really like Mark Wahlberg, but I think his performance was mediocre, something I would say about most other actors as well. What happened to John Leguizamo to get such a marginal role?Bottom line: if Mel Brooks would have entrusted his daughter to Tom Cruise, while aliens would have chemically bombed the US as punishment from God for desecrating planet Earth, it would have been The Happening with a slightly larger budget, but without Tom Cruise's excellent acting from War of the Worlds.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Crappening,"So this is M Night's first R rated film and it's much ado about nothing. I normally like his films, The Sixth Sense, Signs, and even Unbreakable, but for me, his last three movies (The Village, Lady in Water and now the Happening) have been HUGE disappointments. In this film you follow along with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel as an unknown virus is striking the US. No one knows what it is and after awhile, you will not care what it is. This movie is so slow and boring and all it does is pose. I swear I thought I was in a staring contest and lost after 2 hours. A whole lot of nothing happens in this film. M Night doesn't bring the audience in along for the ride. It feels as if its one of those movie that we are suppose to marvel in his brilliant use of subtlety, but its all subtleness. You sit through it and it just feels so pretentious that you feel like eating your own arms just for something to do. It is a one note film. It is the bad karaoke of film making and for his first ""R"" rated film, it is completely devoid of danger, excitement, of fear. He basically told a story that has no beginning, no end, just a middle and when you find out the possible cause of The Crappening.. I mean the Happening you will roll your eyes and question it... i mean really? really? thats it, really? M Night next film better knock it out of the park or people will not go see his films anymore. A suggestion to M Night. How about trying you hand of just directing and leaving the writing to someone else. You are not Alfred Hitchcock because you can't just have suspense without the threat. With going to a film costing more and so many good films this year that DID knock it out of the park, the Happening is such a big let down. And, if you all are like me, you really are pulling for M. Night. But you have to call it like you see it. Nothing happens in the Happening. Sorry.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Messy,"The casting was horrible. Figuring out which character each actor was playing was made worst by the director.The plot was shallow. Basically, the producers/directors were given an idea of a disaster and asked to make it into a movie.Mark Wahlberg acting was stiff as usual, and his girlfriend really looked like his daughter thanks to the casting team, and the little girl wasn't put through acting lessons.With no proper start or ending to the movie, and boring scenes, this movie has made it to the bottom of my list of movies screened in my country taking over Indiana Jones..",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just roll with it,"To make the most out of The Happening, lose all expectations and watch it with easily spooked friends for maximum enjoyment.M. Night Shyamalan's latest effort has him going back to basics, seemingly inspired by Hitchcockian produce. With the clunky dialogue and strange acting by Zooey Deschanel, however, even the ever reliable Mark Wahlberg and the sadly short screen time of John Leguizamo couldn't make audiences take this seriously as a remotely intelligent thriller.The Happening gives a flavor of being unintentionally funny though, so once you decide to just roll with it, then you will enjoy the build-up to the freaky climaxes and just laugh yourself silly.At least it wasn't as bad as Lady in the Water.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Scary Movie 5: The Happening - Funniest Yet!,"M. Night Shymalan has made the funniest entry in the Scary Movie series by keeping the visual gags to a minimum and ramping up the situational and verbal comedy aspects that the past four have left out. Scary Movie 5: The Happening has everything a great parody movie needs a wonderful opening scene that sets us up for what will surely be the funniest 90 minutes of Summer '08. The reaction shots from the cast rival Jason Bateman and Micahel Cera's best work on ""Arrested Development."" The whole production looks stunning and Night's eye for composition are still some of his strongest points, but it's the way he handles his actors that really caught me. In a bit of inspired comedic casting Mark Wahlberg is our hero through this canon of classic Hitchcock motifs and like Charlie Sheen before him, Wahlberg turns in some of his best work since Boogie Nights. You can see and hear the joy in the actor's voice as he spits out comedy gold at every turn. The ""You should care more about science"" exchange may go down as one of the great moments in comedy history right next to 'Who's on first?' and the drop off scene in ""The Big Lebowski."" The death scenes are some of the best in the series even topping the stabbing of Carmen Electra's implants. The 'follow the gun scene' has some great moments from the extra blood spurting that is obviously a nod to ""Ichii the Killer"" and ""Kill Bill"" even the sound effect is different for each successive shot from the same gun, possibly an 'in' joke referencing the grindhouse horror of old. Making the villain 'wind' is Mr. Night Shymalan's finest bit of writing since Sam Jackson's reveal as the mastermind in 'Unbreakable.' I had thought Night had run out of ideas after his last two efforts but in the comedy/ satire genre Shymalan has found his true calling and one can only hope he chooses to continue on this path. I loved Scary Movie 5: The Happening and would recommend it to anyone looking to laugh and cry tears of joy as you watch a cinematic masterpiece that I will be proud to place on my DVD shelf.

Watching the last hour was pretty much useless.It had way too many red herrings. The mood ring, thee bees, the dogs, all of those things lead nowhere.Also, inappropriate use of comedy.

Best Shyamalan's movie since Unbreakable. Totally underrated.,"This film is Shyamalan's rebirth for me as film creator. I'm big fan of his movies, and tried not to see the decline of his recent works - 6th Sense and Unbreakable was masterpieces, Signs and The Village - had great ideas and suspense but was just good overall, while Lady in the Water had great atmosphere but lacked something. And then - The Happening...I was watching this - after I already knew 5,4 rating - and honestly was expecting a disaster. But... this movie hold me in the edge of chair from the beginning till the end, and I just was wondering - ""hey, when this 'collapse' will start? Which moment will be error or false?"" And then - while the final scene in Philadelphia, I said to my friend - ""body, - if this movie ends here - it's nearly perfect..."" And it was... I can't understand reaction of people.Bad acting? No, Wahlberg was great, and support - too. Directing? and script? If you prefer CGI of Emmerich's movies, or actions of Bay - hm... maybe it's not yours, but otherwise - just watch it, and try not to digress, not listen to other ""laughing from the beginning to the end"" - and you will be paid in full.Vow.

M.

We have been teased for months with trailers hinting at an incredibly creepy film where people are dying/killing themselves because of some unknown disease or force, but guess what, the trailers are the best part of the whole film. OK thats being a bit unfair, the first 10 minutes is pretty cool but after that its total crap. Mark Wahlberg? puleaaaase he is awful as our leading man, and as for Zoe Deschanel, if they had auditions for her part she must have been the only person that showed up.I am trying to say something nice about this film because I started out hoping Shyamalan would be back to his best, I loved ""The sixth sense"", and although it was widely thrashed I really enjoyed ""Signs"", this film isn't as bad as Lady in the water, but its on par with the craptastic The village.

Could have done with a bit more happening,"Upon its release, The Happening received many negative reviews and was nominated for four Razzie awards including worst film but having viewed the film for the first time, I discovered that while it was far from being a great film, it was certainly not as bad as people say.Made with the intention of being like a B-Movie, the story focuses on a married couple who discover that America has gone under some sort of attack where people are killing themselves. While not perfectly executed, the story does sink the viewer into what is happening and the plot does move at a swift pace for the majority of the film.What really hinders the film from being good is the dialogue given to actors who can do so much more. Like the remake of The Wickerman, The Happening has now become a comedy in many people's eyes and if you search on the Internet, you will find spoofs and reedits. Some of the scenes are so bad, that you wonder what was going through the director's head. I would usually say that they could have been taken out and left on the cutting room floor but with a running time of 1hour and 20 minutes, they needed all the footage they could find.On a technical level the film is good; the photography is good but there are some bad reaction shots which when up-close on an actors face, feel strange and out of place. The music by James Newton-Howard is very good and there are a few gruesome moments that will make the audience cringe. However there are not enough scenes that really emphasise how much danger they are in. We get the impression that the threat is deadly but as the audience, we need to see more as there are no scenes where we really doubt if the lead characters are in danger. This is after all a horror film.While there are a few laughable scenes due to the dialogue or the acting, The Happening is not a terrible film but it is certainly not perfect. As a viewer, I never became bored or lost interest in the story. A good idea that could have been so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Ignoring the dumb characters and the weird script, this movie isn't too bad.","This movie is to my opinion just another movie in the line of those that base their horror on the events of 9/11 and other terrorist attacks, just like ""Cloverfield"" (for example). M. Night Shyamalan did his share of good-ideas-gone-bad, and yet this one seems to be not so bad after all. If you could just ignore the dumb characters, the horrible script and the entire point of view this film is taken from, you might just end up watching an excellent thriller where you're scared even before something terrifying really happened. Also, the suicide scenes are done in my opinion in a very professional way. One can always turn this movie into a gore movie with a click, and yet Shyamalan decided to not use his R rating to that point, making this movie not about ""OMG THIS IS SO %#$%#$^$ING GROUSE!"".So, in conclusion, this movie is actually a really descent one: only with the right expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So very close to a return to form for Shyamalan,"I had such a good vibe going during this film. I couldn't work out why all the hate toward it. M. Night Shyamalan appeared to be back to his best so I began trying to work out which brilliant ending he was going to lay on us this time. There seemed to be little hints here and there that I figured would leave me saying after wards, ""ofcourse, why didn't I see that coming?"" Instead I was left feeling absolutely robbed at the brain power I had spent on this movie.Shyamalan was back near his best in terms of building quiet suspense, even though we aren't entirely sure of what the disturbing occurrence we are in for is, which makes it all the better. The premise he's developed makes it easy for him to throw horrific images at us, but he does it with his own sense of style and creativity none the less. He's certainly nowhere near top form but it's definitely a step up from the awful Lady in the Water.One of the reasons this movie fails in a lot of peoples eyes is that it lends itself to being over-analyzed. We know what Shyamalan is capable of in comparison to what he's providing us with lately and so we naturally see little faults in all aspects of the film much more clearly. A lot of the dialog is awkward and unnatural and some of the character decisions are questionable at best. The ending however must go down as the big one when we consider this is the man's specialty. The Sixth Sense, The Village and my personal favorite Unbreakable all had endings that left us both shook up and satisfied for days, even weeks. The Happening doesn't even come close to having either effect on us.Not one to be proud of on Shyamalan's part and he's been let know this by his many razzie nominations. But it's not all bad and it's certainly not unwatchable. The man does have other traits beside delivering us with an incredible ending, despite what a few may think.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Such great potential, such a weak story","and um...well... where to start? many people are considering this as M Night Shama-lama-ding-dong's worst movie yet... i'll stick up for the failing director and say that this was Definitely better than Lafy in the Water.over all, i personally enjoyed watching this movie. the concept was very interesting. its an idea that i myself wouldn't mind writing a script for and possibly making a new movie on. its an idea that has extreme potential, potential for infinite possibilities for an audience to see in a movie. but possibilities that M Night refused to give us... and it just leaves the viewer asking themself, ""Why not?"" many people say this movie is simply full of terrible acting. i disagree. i wont deny that i spotted several parts throughout the film where the acting was weak.. but i believe that M Night was trying to achieve the reality of how ordinary people would act in a situation such as 'the happening'. but in my opinion, i think some of the acting was certainly in need of better directing.and i couldn't help myself... i had to laugh when they ran from the villain of the movie... the wind, HAHAHA!!! but there's one fatal error that M Night made in this movie. its too simple. although hes known for being a simplistic director, shamalan went way overboard with the idea of trying to create a movie as simply as possible. in return, he ended up creating a movie where nothing actually... 'happend' (no pun intended). it seemed too simple.. so simple, that it looked like the entire film was pulled off with less than a million dollar budget! and with most of the budget going to the two big name stars of the flick; Mark Walberg and John Leguizamo and M Night's first R rated film????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? that was PG-13 all the way! unless if the version i saw was edited, (which i saw via internet sources from japan) but this movie was just... OK. i give props for an interesting idea to mass human suicide, but the movie loses points for such a WEAK story.with all due respect, M Night Shamalan needs to stop writing movies. not directing, but writing. hes an incredible director, and comes up with amazing ideas to films, but he should make like steven Spielberg and hire somebody to wirte his scripts for him.The Happening (where nothing happened) 5.9 out of 10 stars",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

'The Heppening' isn't happening,"I decided to give 'The Happening' a chance this past weekend, despite my reservations that the director M. Night Shyamalan has made a career out of making movies from seemingly Twilight Zone episodes. All we need to complete the effort is Rod Serling's voice narrating with a clear, halting voice to guide the audience through.But what really intrigued me before I went to go see it was reading somewhere that the film had a $58 million dollar budget and was a co-production between Hollywood and an Indian telecom company; they were essentially splitting their costs on this anticipated turkey. You can tell it had low rent production values as well at that low dollar amount. Barely any special effects and everything was outdoors, giving it that two dimensional (read: boring 1950s t.v. effect) feel.Boy, was I ever right, and to be honest, I should have stuck to my earlier assessment that this director is a one-trick pony. Because his last outing 'Lady In The Water' was such a piece of dreck, he knew he had to seek financing money elsewhere, hence the Indian funding.This is where 'The Happening's' director and John Singleton diverge, as a comparison/contrast. Where John hit a grand slam with his first film, as did M. Night with 'The Sixth Sense', John too has seen his films decrease in popularity from his Oscar-winning 'Boyz In The Hood.' But John has chosen a divergent path by becoming a producer and allowing others to direct their own films. Though John's films are still gritty, urban-theme, African-American dramas, he is saying something, and he does not make the same movie twice.Witness all of M. Night's efforts. He says nothing other than he tries to set a mood to encompass the whole screenplay. The studios have wised up to his failing abilities and he may have to rethink of how he can position his next effort because Hollywood is out to make money, not give it away. And not to go down a rat hole, but why do all his movies take place in Pennsylvania? I realize M. Night grew up in Philly but there are other parts of the nation and the world he can film in.Because I am a movie junky geek, maybe you'll take my words with a grain of salt. Get a life, instead of writing blogs! But if you don't believe me, then believe my colleague who sits next to me during the day. She actually walked out of 'The Happening' this past weekend, and the theatre management gave her a movie pass for a different show because she also thought this lame celluloid effort tried to qualify as entertainment.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I watched the happening,"I had a pretty bid decision to make on June 13th, The Incredible Hulk or The Happening I chose The Happening BIG MISTAKE(don't worry I saw the Hulk three days later)THE GOOD: - The line ""Are those people clawing at their faces!?"" Just the way the chick said it I had to bite my tongue to stop laughing.The dialog was funny I laughed at the funny stuff.Some of the parts were ""scary"" not like Dear good God I'm gonna have nightmares because of this, scary. I don't know what it is about people walking backwards but IT FREAKS ME OUT.-When they have the Montague of the people watching the news, and the dude with the aviator shades and the crew cut stocking' up on ammo in his garage, yes he looks just like my grandfather but not as fat.-I proved my theory that math is evil Ex:John L.(I can't spell his name) gives that girl in the jeep a math problem to solve 10 seconds later their dead. And later when that woman is talking to her daughter over the phone and the daughter says ""I see in calculus."" 10 seconds later she kills herself. I think I proved my point.The Bad: -The movie had so much potential to be really frightening but nothing happened for me. It was wasted.-If there had been close ups on some of the suicide instead of doing the wide angle thing. One shot of some girl stabbing herself in the neck is not going to make me freak out.-The acting could have been one hundred times better then what it was, the secondary characters did better then the main character.-Mark Wahlberg, amazing actor and incredibly hot to but he could do so much better then what he did in this movie.The movie for me was a better comedy then a suspense.I didn't like the ending at all. If Mark Whalberg had started to walk backwards and then the credits started to roll. That ending would have made up for the whole thing.-As it turns out the movie is some sort of don't F*@k with nature type movie. Like I don't get enough of that in my daily life I also get in my movies, super.When I got to the theater I saw teenagers and there's nothing I hate more then seeing with teenagers around( I probably shouldn't because I'm a seventeen year old girl, but I didn't hear a peep out of them)and to think I thought that would have been the worst part of my evening.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's a good puzzle,"This movie isn't as bad as some reviews claim to be. But I can see why some audience are so disappointed. This movie would be a huge disappointment when you watch it in theatre, because you want some exciting climax events at the end, but this movie has very silent ending.I like it because the mystery wasn't completely solved by the end and It's called act of nature.It leaves you with a puzzle. Not everything can be explained in this world.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
M. Night Shyamalan does it again?!,"Just when you think this guy cant get any worse, he goes and surprises you.I thought M. Night Shyamalan was going to be the next best thing when I saw sixth sense and was expecting to see a lot of good things after, but it seems fame got to his head and ever since he is incapable of making a decent film. It seems like he feels that there is no need to explain anything in his films anymore..and if there is an explanation its something a that a 5 year old would write, not an acclaimed director of the sixth sense.From this point on I don't go watching M. Night Shyamalan's film expecting to see something good, I just go to find out just how bad it can get.As far as the movie is concerned the acting is just plain silly. It makes you feel like you are watching a less funny scary movie (if thats even possible). Instead of building up the suspense and fear factor, there are moments which you laugh at how ridiculous the lines and the acting are.As mentioned before, explanations are not required any more with this director. The story makes no sense and the reason behind everything will make you come out wishing you had seen anything else playing and I mean anything.Save your money and if you really have to watch this wait till you can rent it on DVD...or even better till its playing on TV so you don't regret paying for that either!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Weird Movie,This is a B movie with a strange story and bad acting but it's also somehow fascinating. And the main actress is really cute :),6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A masterpiece that very little people can understand,"More than a movie, the happening is putting voice to a victim. A planet sick of human overpopulation. You cannot expect most people to understand this kind of art, nor the attitude, and Eco responsibility behind it. All it can be said about Night and the actors, is that you must be really brave to deal with this, be very smart to know how to do it, and really strong to put any critic fruit of misunderstanding on the place it deserves. A deaf place.Excellent movie from excellent director, and actors, and from even better humans.If you are a carpe diem guy or gal, who would burn the planet to have fun, and dislike people standing between you and nature you will lose your useless time trying to understand inner horrors of this piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ok,"Not as bad as the Internet makes you believe. Stupid, yes. Corny, at times but intentional and with a good pace and fun to watch.Very good first act. Creepy and scary.Very strange last 40 minutes. I'm sure a lot of the humor was intentional and it works at times, but sometimes interferes with the pace and with our emotional involvement.Even during that final act, there are some very strong moments and scenes that work.I'm not a fan of the very ending, but I can see how it makes sense for what the film is trying to tell us about our relations w/ nature.Wahlberg and Deschanel should sell us these characters better.Great score.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Oh my god!!!,"Is it just me or do the trailers for MNS's movies advertise them as something they're not. The village comes to mind as well as the happening. Correct me if Im wrong but on one of the trailers for the Happening isn't there a ghost floating towards the camera? I feel ripped off, I went to the village expecting one thing and got another. I liked the village but felt betrayed by the way it was advertised. This movie disturbs me in the same manner. Anyone with any taste for movies cant even give this show an average rating. What was good about it, the idea, maybe. The acting was poor, chemistry was absent between the main characters and specific ""Happenings"" in the movie just didn't make sense. It started off OK but fell quickly and hard. This movie will make millions and that really saddens me. I wasn't expecting a movie worthy of an Oscar but I was expecting to be entertained. One movie that comes to mind was Death Sentence with Kevin Bacon. Definitely not Oscar worthy but at least it was entertaining. This movie will make me think twice before spending my money before reading reviews. I will now download MNS's movies as they are not worth my hard earned money.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bottom of the heap,"MNS- incredible actor, director, writer. The premise of the movie was derived from good intentions.Why would MNS even want to release such a disappointing film. The film took only 44 days to make, and it shows.Many have applauded the cinematography- you have to be kidding. A few rural shots and the wind blowing the grass and trees, and poorly shot city scenes.The acting! If this were Mark Walberg's first film, his career would have ended with this movie. Zooey Dechanel seems to be this bubble head walking around like a zombie through most of her scenes. The only plausible acting was by Betty Buckley, though her reclusive character is not believable.There are a lot of good directors/writers, but, like many as their careers started off heading in the right direction they ultimately fail along the way.One of the all time worst films ever experienced.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Oh, no! This is not happening!","Well folks,I don't know exactly how to start talking about The Happening. In fact, I don't even know if I should start writing about something so BAD. However, I guess I'm gonna do it, just to let you know how wrong I was when I thought I'd enjoy it.I really don't know what is HAPPENING with director M. Night Shayamalan these last years, but he definitely seems to be messing around with audiences or, if not, proving us all how urgently he needs to improve his writing/directing skills. I can recall ""THE VILLAGE"" and ""THE LADY OF THE WATER"" which, in my opinion, were ENTIRELY GARBAGE. And now comes another rubbish masterpiece, with a new ""label"" and nice presentation, but with the same hollow plot as the past ones.In the beginning, The Happening seemed somehow promising, but in the very next minutes I noticed something wrong about it. The characters were empty, boring, unstyled and raw. Actings were unnatural, theatrical and very, very poor. Filming sequences were also too bad, giving me a perfect feeling of a low budget movie done just to bring easy money from all those out there who normally love a little bit of nonsense mystery or suspense.Finally, in regards to the story, I think that The Happening is also pretty bad. In fact, I risk myself to say that this movie has no story at all. Shayamalan has just lead us (and probably himself too) to a promising story with no end or pre-thought sequences, resulting in a very random plot with stupid scenes, characters and inconsistencies.If I had to describe this movie in a very short sentence, I'd say it is BAD, AMATEUR-LIKE and BORING. During the play time I was always hoping to see the credits part, but the movie kept going on to massacre me.
Anyway, now one thing is certain from now on: I won't see another Shayamalan's movie for the next 100 years! That's for sure!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Whats Happening,"For a movie to start so promising and then develop into a story any middle schooler could predict is not what I have come to expect from this director. Anyone can see the potential for this story but as it was delivered it came off a bit flat. I did however like the acting by the 2 main characters, and the child was another good find for M. Night Shyamalan. I am torn here a bit between the point the film was making, and the way the film was made.....In the end was it worth the ticket price? Yes but not by much, Mark Wahlberg was the bright spot here.oh yeah don't forget to tell your plants you love them.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The worst film ever made,"This is the funniest (unintentional) film I have seen for years. The acting is the worst I've ever seen. The audience was laughing particularly at the performance of Zooey Deschanel. Her acting was laugh out loud awful. But then so was the acting of everyone else in the film. The script provided lots of laughs too. Surely this will be a career ending film for everyone involved, particularly Shyamalan, whose career has been on a sharp downward spiral ever since the Sixth Sense. People were walking out whilst I was watching it, but I was laughing too much to want to leave. Go and see this film & revel in how truly awful it is in every respect.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
M Night killed my inner-movie child,"I'm going to start off with the good points of this movie: There have been worse movies made. After watching The Happening, though, i cannot name any of those movies off the top of my head.Now the bad points: The plot was horrible. It tried so hard to be creative, so hard to spookily realistic, so hard to be so unique that it was just plain stupid. Plan 9 From Outer Space had a better plot than the Happening. The acting was horrible. I've seen better acting in a school play. The ONLY acting in this movie that could be considered decent was when Whalberg's character was being a dick and joking around.The movie didn't even have strong characters to back up the horrible acting. The only character that I liked was the psycho-plant hippy guy. Elliott was a pansy, and not the good kind like shaggy and scooby. His was wife spent the whole time dragging everyone else down with her bad attitude. The little girl never spoke, was rarely in camera shot, and had no real character to begin with.The Happening is by far not the worst I've ever seen, but I would never recommend it to anyone. I give the acting a 1 out of 10, the plot a 1, the dialog a 1, the cinematography a 4, and the music a 3.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
