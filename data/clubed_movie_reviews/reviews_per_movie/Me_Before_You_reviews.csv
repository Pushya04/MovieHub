Amazing,"I loved this movie. It stayed very true to the book and I love the book. I think Emilia Clarke was born to play her. I feel like she was just playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real life. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes, the way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved every single outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me very emotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born to play Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and the rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some parts from the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was still amazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is amazing as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thoroughly enjoyed the movie,"All movies can be scrutinized for faults, as some reviewers have done, but if the movie makes a mark, then those faults really don't matter, do they? I found the ""angry"" Will Traynor not completely believable, not like the anti-social Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets, but Sam Clafin did well with his transformation. Emilia Clarke was absolutely wonderful and I will be on the lookout for other roles she has taken and will undertake in the future. Kudos also to the characters who played Will's parents, Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. Two thumbs up for the movie. Am seriously considering whether the movie ought to bump another movie off my favorite 50 relationship movie list.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Live Boldly,"I wouldn't consider myself the target audience for these romantic dramas. In fact, I'm usually turned off by the overabundance of forced clichés and unnecessary plot devices. While Me Before You definitely falls victim to some of those unfortunate young adult tropes, there's far more charm than harm here.The film stars Emilia Clarke (Lou) and Sam Claflin (Will) from Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games respectively. I've enjoyed both of their works in the past and they both make the most of the script that was given to them. Their budding charisma on screen is by far the highlight of the film. It's nice to see Clarke take on a lighter and more exuberant role than she has played in the past as it mirrors her off-screen personality as well.Clarke's likability as Lou is put a test as she has to deal with the stern and far less cheerful, Will, who became paralyzed after a motorcycle accident. If you didn't guess it already, yes they do grow to live with each other's quirks and inconveniences and maybe even share some affection for each other. It's pretty much the basis for all of these romantic novels adapted for film, but if you're film has enough likable qualities to it, the overused plot points and clichés can be forgiven.The main qualm for these characters are Will's questionable wishes about his future living as a quadriplegic and Lou's inability to fulfill her potential and aspirations due to her commitment as the breadwinner for her family. The way Lou effortlessly deals with these issues is what makes her so likable. It's also why you root for her and Will to become romantically involved as the film gives us compelling enough reasons to desire it. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with how the romance is depicted. Everything is earned and not forced.I think my only real complaints with the film involve its tendency to veer into clichéd territory. I'm not a fan of when romantic films play popular songs that tell you exactly how to feel as an audience member. Or when a certain character is written specifically to give us someone to dislike and is used a plot device more than anything else. On more than one occasion, Me Before You does that. But it's when the film attempts to take an original and realistic spin on the romance that the film really shines. It's because of the ladder that I think Me Before You is definitely worth a look.+Clarke's undeniable likability+Charm and chemistry with the Lou and Will dynamic+Romance is earned not forced-Popular songs tend to ruin the big moments-A few clichéd characters and plot devices7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gets me crying Everytime,"Cried the first time I watched it. Now it's the 6th time I've seen it ,and I noticed that the more times I watch it, the earlier into the film I cry. Lou's character is so beautiful and so is their relationship, which makes me cry because I know how it ends.Would recommend if you want a good cry, and if you're a fan of Emilia Clarke. She's so cute in this.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic Romantic Movie,"Absolutely brilliant film. Those who criticise it for dealing with the subject of disabilty should look past the fact Will is disabled and look at the film in the light of what it aims to be, a touching, romance film.

Clarke is adorable and the critics get it wrong,"How can so many people get this this movie wrong, especially the critics? The high point of the film is the performance by Emelia Clarke. She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable and wonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to none.Lou (Emilia Clarke) gets a job as a carer to a man (William) who is paralyzed more or less from the neck down. A budding friendship/romance develops; and this is 90% a feel good movie.The criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profound disability as almost worthless is completely mistaken. The movie depicts William's life as worthwhile and precious. It is William's own judgment that his life cannot go on as it is, and that he would prefer to die.With regard to this, the movie does tend to downplay the pain and suffering that William experiences. Instead it focuses on the good times and precious moments he spends will Lou. And as already stated, the character of Lou is completely adorable. I am in love.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was a pretty cute,"Felt very derivative of Intouchables I did however really enjoy the romance that was in this film.Emilia Clark has the most expressive face I have ever seen on camera.Watch her eyebrows! That's all I have to say. You could almost watch this entire movie just staring at her eyebrows I had a hard time not doing that.I really enjoyed her character. She is a silly, eccentric, perpetually happy girl. With a pretty eclectic sense of style.Emilia Clarke was perfectly cast for this role.She ventures far from her intense power house character the Mother of Dragons from Game of Thrones.At times it was hard to tell if Emilia Clarke the actress is just extremely expressive with her face, or if it was something she was doing for the role which I suppose speaks to how well she did.Because I'm thinking she was exaggerating it, therefore she played the part marvellously.The male lead is Sam Claflin, who you will more than likely recognize but not be able to place. His largest role as of late is the water proficient fighter from the Hunger Games.I also feel he played the part very well. No complaints, He has a great smile, or smirk, that he does through out, which allows us to empathize with him a little more when he seeming unlikable.There are a lot of light moments, actually the whole movie has a very light tone to it it's a serious topic, but with Clarke's character it's hard for anything to be too serious or solemn. There are those sombre moments, which is, I'm sure, why I was given a tissue box at the advance screening.There were only a few editing aspects I didn't enjoy. There were far too many cuts in certain scenes Emilia walking up to the mansion for the first time and her conversation on the bench with her boyfriend. They were distracting. This was sprinkled throughout the film to greater or lesser degrees.I think the film looked pretty, great locations. And a wonderful set, really. The house Claflin's character lives in looks very nice. I loved all the walls that opened when pushed on. Very modern, and expensive I'm sure.There is a little treat for any Harry Potter fans! Neville Longbottom, all grown up and looking fit, he plays the part of Emilia Clarke's boyfriend. I hope to see him in more roles, maybe even a lead one day.As for family friendliness, this movie is a G, it is good to go. In the opening scene Claflin is presumably being intimate with his girlfriend, they are obviously naked, but nothing is shown, they are under sheets.There is no cursing or obscenities in this movie worth mentioning.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adorable!,"The movie really was adorable! I knew exactly what to expect since I read the book, but I loved the adaptation.What helps the movie most is that the novelist, Jojo Moyees, wrote her own screenplay. She did a great job transitioning the story from paper to screen. Little things that were left out of the novel weren't really needed to move the story along.Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafin were excellent. Her facial expressions were amazing and her insane eyebrows deserve some type of award all on their own.I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as well.Don't listen to critics and go see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I don't like sappy movies, but I really liked this sappy movie. Clarke wins again.","Emelia Clarke's work on Game of Thrones is the only reason I watched this movie in the first place. She is occasionally transcendent in that role, where she must keep her eyebrows restrained, and I wanted to see what would happen if her amazingly mobile brows were set free ... free as her dragons.There are a lot of solid things about this movie. The story (of a young woman who cares for a quadriplegic young man) is strong, the direction and cinematography good though not exceptional, the screen writing also good-not-exceptional, the supporting cast (especially Janet McTeer and Charles Dance)and leading man (Sam C.) quite good, and the emotional notes it hits, though all predictable and often a bit overwrought (cue swelling, heartwarming music...), ring true enough for an unabashed romance.So, not really my type of movie. But I am happy to say that I was (almost) completely taken by Clarke's performance. Her character here is nothing like her GoT role, but is in many ways an equally fantasy-based role (but with clumsy shyness and striped leggings instead of fireproof skin and dragons) -- and Clarke manages to pull this character out of romantic fantasy into believability as effectively as she brings to life her role as Mother of Dragons. She has the combination of charisma, physical beauty, character-acting chops, and inner luminosity to pull a fairly nice, 7-of-10 heartwarmer up to a 9-of-10 charmer.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The right to death with dignity?,"We all have the right to a life of dignity... but what about the right to death with dignity?Financial wizard, Will Traynor is a quadriplegic (paralysis from the shoulders down) who's living at home with his parents in a castle that lies on the edge of a small English village. He's been paralyzed for 2 years and despite all his efforts at physical therapy only has movement in his thumb plus facial muscles. His parents have created a safe environment for him: a conversion of their large castle's stables into a comfortable home, a male nurse to feed, clean, bathe and change him and now a friendly, quirky companion in Lou Clarke. Unspoken is Traynor's mother's prayer: Clarke will dissuade Traynor from his self-made appointment with death in six months.Director Thea Sharrock (The Hollow Crown, As You Like It) effectively handles the introduction of this heated, controversial subject in this light romance by giving us the perspective of one life... a life that could go on into the distant future with heavy medical involvement, a life that could continue to contribute to society, a life that could perhaps find satisfaction in this ""lesser"" state. The mostly new-to-feature film director, writer and young leading cast, are well-supported by a cinematographer with decades of experience, Remi Adefarasin OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) (Match Point, About a Boy, Elizabeth).Sam Claflin (Snow White and the Huntsman, The Hunger Games) plays the quadriplegic Traynor, the romance male-lead, with Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones) his companion. They both have faces that are great for screen closeups, important when bodies can't move. Clarke, famously known for playing Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, has a face so mobile her eyebrows seem to do acrobatics far removed from her stoic face in Game of Thrones. She also has a lot more to say in a candid, quirky manner, which soon brings out the mischievous side of Traynor, always up for a dare and adventure. The movie is carried by the two and they do a good job interacting.Me Before You could have been set anywhere in the world, but the castle-village setting suits-if you have a Lord of the Manor character, why not give him one, with the young, naïve love interest played by a village girl. Also to emphasize the wealthy lifestyle is the private jet they use to go on holiday-very fairytale, Mills & Boon romance, a formula that has worked for decades.Dialogue does flow and is well matched to the accompanying actions, not surprising as author Jojo Moyes also wrote the screenplay. The challenge of showing the life extreme-sports-devotee Traynor had before becoming a quadriplegic is easily and effectively solved when Clarke finds a short video (set to James Bond music) of Traynor doing many athletic feats-diving off cliffs into the sea, water skiing, bungy/sky jumping-narrated by a group of his admiring friends. Traynor definitely craved and loved physical adventure and his body was very toned and fit. Cut to his life now, immobile, needing assistance even to lift his head off his pillow or sitting, staring fixedly out of the window at the flat, colourless countryside, the only thing still agile being his mind and slowly recovering sense of humour.The right to a dignified life for all is cemented in most constitutions across the globe. To choose when to die is something only provided for in some places, and only for those who have reached the hospice state of care when the doctor certifies that the patient only has a short period of time left to live, that death is inevitable from illness, disease, or injury, and that there are no medical interventions that can change this. At such a time the patient can choose death assisted by medical staff. But what if one is stuck in between: a diminished physical life that cannot improve but continues with high medical care and cost and still an acute mental ability. If such a person decides against living, are there ethical, social, moral, religious, spiritual, personal rights to be observed? Protected? Should that person too be allowed to choose death, or is it ""murder"" as one of the support actors states.This is one of several books, movies and documentaries I've seen recently on the right to choose death, something many with the means have been doing for a time now. Well worth a watch, the viewer can take from it what they choose: the light-hearted fare of a chick-flick or the deeper philosophical discussion.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Claflin and Clarke where to perfect,"This film is getting mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. A very bittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. I never read the book that which this film is based on. But sometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are based on.A beautifully well made story, it about Louisa(Emilia Clarke) a 26 year old who finds a job taking care of Will(Sam Claflin) a young billionaire who is permanently confined to wheel chair after an accident two years earlier, the use of his arms and legs are gone. At first Will does not want Louisia there, and she does her best to put up with him. But soon the form quite a friendship, she teaches him to enjoy life again, and he shows her to be adventurous in life. But the question is will this last?I like the chemistry between Claflin and Clarke, at no point it feels forced. I really bought the affection they feel for one another. At times Clarkes performance feels overly cartoonish, but still good in most of it. Claflin is believable, and the question is how would you feel if you where in his shoes. I don't care what the critics say, this was a perfectly well made bittersweet film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""You are scored on my heart Clark""","""Me Before You"" is a bit of a queer fish of a movie. It never quite decides whether it wants to be a romantic weepy, a drama, or a rom- com and as such ends up rather falling between all three stools.Emelia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"", ""Terminator: Genesys"") plays Lou Clark, an 'invisible' plain girl ""with potential"" who is trapped – due to unemployment-led poverty - living with her parents in a provincial castle town (a picturesque Pembroke, though notably hardly a Welsh accent in earshot). Her boyfriend Patrick (""Harry Potter""'s Matthew Lewis) is a running nut that doesn't play to her romantic needs in any way. Circumstances lead her into the job of a carer for a quadriplegic, Will Traynor (Sam Claflin, from ""The Hunger Games"" sequels) who also happens to be the son of the local millionaire couple (played by Charles Dance and Janet McTeer). They own the castle, a large mansion and most of the surrounding countryside too.Will – previously a sports jock - is paralyzed from the neck down after an accident and is a frustrated and suicidal mind in a useless body. Can the quirky and vivacious Lou bring him out of his morbid shell and find him a life worth living again?From this outline, you might think the story almost writes itself, and for most of the film it does. But the writers have a number of twists and turns in store which – depending on your sentiments – might entertain or appall.As her first leading actress role in a non-action feature it's a bit difficult to sum up Emilia Clarke's performance. At face value it could be described as an advanced case of over-acting, with an extensive array of kooky looks and gurning facial expressions. On the other hand, she does it all with such vivacity and charm - and notably in a manner so in keeping with the character she portrays - that it is hard not to be enchanted by her: I certainly was.Claflin plays the brooding and resentful Traynor well and Matthew Lewis shows he is growing into a really professional jobbing actor as he enters his mid-20's.Also radiant (she always is sorry to break it to the wife like this... but I am basically in love with her!!) is the ever-gorgeous Jenna Coleman (""Dr Who"", ""Victoria"") in what is to date a rare outing for her onto the big screen (she previously has only had a small role in the first ""Captain America"" film). Coleman and Clarke make a very credible pair of sisters, with the ""bed"" discussion scene being very touching.Elsewhere a number of other well-known faces crop up including Brendan Coyle (""Downton Abbey"") as Lou's father and Joanna Lumley as a wedding guest with a handy line in references.The soundtrack by Craig (""Love Actually"") Armstrong is top notch with pleasing songs from Ed Sheeran, Imagine Dragons, Cloves and We The Kings.The production quality is as professional as you would expect from a British-made movie, although the Mallorca and Paris locations are not particularly well exploited, since for a large chunk of these scenes I was convinced they hadn't left Pinewood!So, a bit of a mixed bag, but enjoyable nonetheless. A guilty pleasure. If you like a romantic piece of escapism this is one for a wet Sunday afternoon, provided you have a box of tissues handy.(For the graphical version of this review, or to comment on it, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

A sad but meaningful story!,"One of the best Romantic movies lately.. I am very taken with Emilia Clark's performance and smile. She was amazing and breathtaking. The music is well chosen and the acting is good and there were some very touching moments that will make the audience who didn't watch yet cry. Lou is a funny young woman who wants to live a simple life, who wants to wear clothes and be fashionable in her own way. The paralyzed man is a damaged cause looking for hope. Both these characters are very different, yes they pick things from each other and they put smiles on each others faces. A couple that wouldn't get bored giving and taking to their souls.. Maybe, when it comes to believing in love unconditionally, Faith is hope then. Live the life as it faces you then. In health and sickness. In the sweetest moments and bitterest ones. Just live your life No matter what happens to you. Always get back and fight to survive and be alive. That is what this movie is all about...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

My heart broke where it needed to break, and it laughed where it needed to laugh.For those who need help working on their empathy, or the opening of the mind, this is a very good movie to see!It's very thought provoking and I would even suggest to professors (philosophy,english,cultural perspectives in science, sociology) that they have their students write a paper on this. There are so many issues involved here. Great for discussion!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A nice little 3 hanky tear jerker with a very abominable message,"If the director of a movie has stirred an emotion in a viewer does that make it a good movie? I think 'yes' because the viewer has been touched within and the story connected with that person, on some level. Unfortunately for Director: Thea Sharrock and Writer: Jojo Moyes the emotional connection for this viewer (me) was negative and borderline angry. But the movie is a good 6 or 7 stars worth to me because I found it well scripted, acted and photographed.The plot is so British class oriented I was gritting my teeth. We have Will Traynor an upper crust society rich boy who is able to afford any indulgence he so desires. He lives in a mansion and owns an ancestral castle. Has had top line education and was a multi-talented sportsman and is exceptionally handsome. Mr upper crust Will is arrogant, self centered, and oh so superior. Then there is Lou Clark a working class former shop girl living in a small bungalow with her family. Her father is currently unemployed and cannot find a job. The family depends on Lou's income to make ends meet. She looses her shop job and applies as a companion aide to the now disabled (quadriplegic) Will Traynor. His mother is so charmed by Miss shop girl Lou's cheerful and quirky attitude she hires her. So there's the first problem - a working class person having to survive by being 'in service' to an upper society family. What a good little Brit she is! And of course the Traynor's feel it's their duty to provide for the lower classes so they hire Lou's father as a 'castle facility technician' - read 'grounds keeper for the castle'! Then there is the ever available Nathan who supplies the muscle to move Will from bed to chair and back, plus keep account of Will's borderline health. It's never explained how Nathan is always - on call! Can't keep the 'superiors of society' waiting!The title ""Me Before You"" is also an issue with this viewer! We are never given a definition of this title. Which of the two main characters is 'Me' and which is 'You'! Think about it ... as the relationship between Will & Lou warms up the easy answer is Will as the 'Me' because of his death wish and to hell with the now close emotional bond between Will & Lou. (by-the-way if Will so wanted to die why didn't he give in to his lung infection when hospitalized? It surely would have easily killed a quadriplegic)On the other hand it's not too difficult to take Lou as the 'Me' because she has dedicated her efforts to 'change Will' and bring him out of his self imposed reclusiveness and bitterness toward life. Lou is determined to make him change his mind on being euthanized. So there's the conflict - neither one actually respects the emotional bond & love that has developed between them. Will hates his physical existence and wants death as a release. Lou can only focus on how happy she is being with him. Both are not thinking about how the other one feels.My other problem with this story is very simple to grasp. Will has everything a person could want and the intelligence to create a new life for himself but chooses death because he cannot live as he did before his disability. The producers of this story are implying a disabled person is less of a human due to a disability, is permanently unhappy, and not capable of contributing to society thus death is their best option! If Will was fine physically but emotionally depressed and wanted to be euthanized would the viewing public be as enthusiastic about this movie? Definitely not!The subconscious messages in this story are shameful but go completely unnoticed because they are wrapped up and hidden in a sweet & tearful tragic love story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"As a caretaker, I hate this movie","I found myself in a very similar situation to the protagonist, accidentally stumbling into the position of someone's personal caretaker and becoming extremely close with that person. I am best friends with my patient now, and we even live together. I liked this part of the movie because I related to it strongly. The job is very intimate and personal, and the relationships you build with both the person you care for and their other caretakers is invaluable. Don't get me wrong, this is a cute movie. But the entire premise is awful.Unfortunately the messaging about physical disabilities in this movie disturbs me. My friend is more disadvantaged than the character in this movie and suffers a great amount of pain. People with disabilities are much more likely to suffer from suicidal thoughts, and I think this movie touched on this distastefully and even glorified suicide. It seems to display being able-bodied as a reality much better than being disabled, and that being disabled makes all the joys of life unfulfilling. Disabled people can be wonderful and feel wonderful, and they should be given the same mental health resources as any other person. I don't think anyone would try to justify an able-bodied person seeking euthanasia. Anyone can suffer from mental illness, and I just hate this movie. It disgusts me, and I hope my best friend never watches this because this would only be harmful to her. This movie is dangerous.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
'You are pretty much the only thing that makes me wanna get up in the morning.',"This film is one of those rare instances where a novel (by JoJo Moyes) is adapted for the screen by the novelist and finds a sensitive director such as Thea Sharrock and the result is a story that could have been sanguine but instead is an enriching emotional journey. To discover this film among all the crime and killing and morbid vampire or other undead creatures stories and overblown CGI comic book/fairy tale adventures is a breath of fresh air.The story takes place in England and in a very subtle way shares an insight between the wealthy and the poor – emphasizing that richness is truly in the spirit rather than the bank account. Lou Clark (Emilia Clarke) knows lots of things. She knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home. She knows she likes working in The Buttered Bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her long-term boyfriend Patrick (Matthew Lewis). Her family (Brendan Coyle, Jenna Coleman, Samantha Spiro and Alan Breck) needs money and insist Lou seek employment when Lou loses her job: it is out of pure fortitude that she finds one - as caretaker of a young wealthy quadriplegic – a job that ultimately keeps her sane. Will Traynor (excellent Sam Claflin) knows his motorcycle accident took away his desire to live. He is supported by his male nurse Nathan (the superb Stephen Peacocke) as well as his loving parents (Janet McTeer and Charles Dance). He knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how he's going to put a stop to that – a planned death after fulfilling his parent's plea for a six month reprise. What Will doesn't know is that Lou is about to burst into his world in a riot of color. And neither of them knows they're going to change each other for all time until Lou concocts a bucket list of events that brings light into her life as well as joy into Will's final days.Without becoming morbid, the interplay between Lou and Will is a transformation and due to the splendid script and sensitive direction and a cast of superb actors in every part this little film makes a lasting impression, restoring our faith in what friendship and love can achieve. In short, this is a brilliant little film worthy of at least one watching- if not multiple! Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Mostly Manipulative, But Tears are Earned","It would be hard to hold back the tears, once 'Me Before You' moves along the emotionally-charged course of its unevenly laid-out entirety. Imbued with charismatic flair and some ravishing sentiments, the Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafflin starrer, is every hopeless romantic dream. It is bound to recreate the familiar 'heaven and earth' trope, with all its utter predictabilities and tiring cheesy clichés, but here, the tears are mostly rightfully earned.Clarke's Lou, emerges as the brightest asset of this manipulative drama, her buoyant demeanor creates an affectionate atmosphere for this whole fairytale-ish attempt whose often leaning towards emotional tragedy is ever screaming at every turn of the proceedings. Her sprightly charm makes an indispensible compensation for the largely stale performance pulled by Clafflin who plays here, a quadriplegic near real-life prince, who enlisted the service of Clarke's caregiver character. But together they conjure magic, enough to sprinkle their often predictable storyline with heart-crippling charm.The biggest flaw of this film, perhaps, is how it seemed written to manipulate. That is not to say it isn't effective, because in fact it often works, but you would still think, and wonder, how more beautiful it would have become, had it been written with pure authenticity. Be that as it may, you've got to give it to those at its helm for molding an extremely poignant drama, that even if its often undermined by its easily recognizable motives, isn't devoid of wit, humor, and charm, and jaw-dropping glamor from two of the most beautiful faces to ever star in such romantic tragedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful,"I have already read the book, so I decided to most definitely see the movie. I think that they did very well on a book to movie adaptation, because they didn't change too much from the book. The movie was beautifully made, and fit just what I and others who have read it in my city had pictured for the movie.The casting was brilliant, as with the portrayal of Louisa and Will. Both characters were charismatic, and enjoyable, and matched the dialogue of the book, which I thought was great.The movie itself was heartbreaking, hilarious at points, and just and lovable. The story itself is well thought out and great. One of the best things about this, is it is not just your usual love story. The real love doesn't take over the whole plot. It isn't fully made to feel intimate, but just to feel real.So I say: Go see it. If you are a boy or girl, it doesn't matter. This movie is memorable for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romantic Dramas are often a hit or miss,"But this movie brought a very solemn smile and tear to my face when I watched it. I genuinely loved this movie. I had two reasons to go watch it in theaters when it came out. 1.) I love Emilia's performance in GOT and wanted to check this out. 2.) I have been needing to drag my boyfriend out to watch it with me.In the end , Clarke and Claflin have great chemistry, and my heart truly broke when the movie was coming to an end. Most people who hated this movie have told me ""Oh, it promotes the suicide of the disabled,"" but that isn't true. I have a friend who is disabled. Paraplegic, and she basically lives in her wheelchair except when she needs assistance to get to other places. I wanted to get her view on it, so I took her to watch the movie 2 weeks later. When the movie finished she was in tears. She gave me a pat on my lap and asked for a hug and whispered ""Thank you"" into my ears. She is a huge sap for romance movies, she explained how it was touching that a movie was touching on the idea of people on life support who find it a struggle to survive. She said that yes, it was unfortunate that William wanted to end his life, it made her happy to see that he was cared for by person who loved him and he didn't die in vain, but with a sense of fulfillment.Maybe it might send mixed messages, but hearing firsthand from a friend who basically told she knows what its like to be William that this movie wasn't insulting to her made me happy and brought a tear to my eye. Humanity is failing to know what love truly means. People tend to go the looks, wealth and lust in relationship at first, but we forget the friendship, the bond and company that love brings, which is why so many relationships fail nowadays. And this movie shows that everyone is deserving of a chance to love. Even the more challenged people are deserving of love. This movie sends a lovely sentiment, and I am glad I saw this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Really, really scaryUndoubtedly, the movie is mawkish, though there exists a clear line between soppy drama and sweet girlish melodrama. Of course, there are lots of ridiculous moments and stupid dialogues, strange behavior, but everything is so harmonious that you may forgive all the flaws.Sam Claflin was brilliant. He coped with role easily. The actor managed to convey all the difficulties faced by the paralyzed people. Both moral and physical. Emilia Clarke was too eccentric. I realize that it was so according to the script in order to show her the immediacy and ease. However, as for me she looks far too sweet.In general, the movie turned out bright and pleasant. I think I will reconsider this story more than once and get a maximum of emotion the same I had in the dark cinema hall.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Best romance from 2016 so far,"Me before you stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin and its the story of a woman (Emilia Clarke) and her story of how she falls in love with a man that cannot move either his legs and his arms. Emilia Clarke is amazing as her character, she completely became her character. I cannot think of another actress that will portray her character, well Daisy Ridley can because Emilia Clarke's performance did remained me of her. Sam Claflin was serviceable, he can easily be replaced. The story is really what drives this movie to the top. The relationship between Lou and Will is great, you really believe that they are in love. The music is used appropriately, only one time it annoyed me but it was once and it did not take me out of the film. The cinematography was great as well as the production design. The biggest problem i have with this film its is 3 act. It is really cheesy and makes the cliché that one person gets mad with one another, and you know they're gonna get back together and its just lazy writing. Its not awful but it ain't good either. Also since Emilia Clarke is so fantastic as her character, its really distracting when she is not in a scene, and you kind off get lost in the story. Other than that, I found that Me Before You was a great film about love, relationships and letting go. Beautiful visuals and an unique script made this film the best love story of 2016 (so far). 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A surprisingly good film,"I don't watch 'Game of Thrones' - I know that in itself is a crime - so I hadn't really seen anything Emilia Clarke had been in prior to watching this film. However, she's so good in this it's ridiculous. Warm, funny, engaging, it's not to say that she carries the film, because of course Sam Caflin (who I only knew from the horrible 'Love Rosie' does his fair share, but she shines in her role.The film itself is much better than I thought it would be. It's heartfelt without ever being sentimental, it's full of engaging moments. I don't know why the critics weren't more positive about it.I didn't start watching this film with high hopes, but I was very pleased to be proved wrong.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I loved the film,"I thought it was beautifully produced and it was an excellent film.I cannot help, but think that we all of us see things differently.

Moving In Spite of Itself,"""Me Before You"" was made to appeal to the lowest common denominator. In spite of myself, though, I was moved by and I enjoyed this film.""Me Before You"" is a romance between a perky, poor, not spectacularly beautiful girl and a rich, suicidal, model-handsome quadriplegic. You may have begun gagging already. I understand, and believe me, everything that you fear may be wrong with such a film is wrong with this film. It talks down to its audience. Its play with dangerous ideas is a child playing with matches. And yet, I cried.I think two things save ""Me Before You"" in spite of all that's wrong with it.Sam Claflin plays the part of Will Traynor, the rich, handsome, suicidal quadriplegic. Claflin is young, ripped, and handsome enough to be in a toothpaste commercial. He is really good. I believed everything he did. I was right there with him. I felt his pain and desperation.Janet McTeer, a multiple-award-winning actress, is the soul of the film. She plays Will's mother. She is given very little to do, but she pops in and out regularly. There is an infinite sadness and terror in her eyes. I'm a former nurse's aide and I'm very familiar with dealing with family members of afflicted people. Janet McTeer is superb. She shows the exact strength, vulnerability, and hoping- against-hope of the loved ones of the wounded and doomed.""Me Before You""'s plot doesn't do anything you wouldn't expect it to. If you go to the movies to be surprised or intrigued, stop right now. But you already knew that when you saw the movie poster of the perky girl sitting on the lap of the very handsome man in a wheelchair, as they gaze lovingly into each other's eyes.""Me Before You"" takes place in the England that exists only in the imagination of fans of Masterpiece Theater, Jane Austen adaptations, and Merchant Ivory films. This is very much not the England of Sadiq Khan and Brexit or even of royal family scandals.There are very rich people who also have good taste. There are poor people who are warm, simple-minded, and humble, not at all resentful or bitter about their place. Sort of like Hobbits. There is sweeping, green countryside defined by rambling stone walls and trout streams. There is a big, fat castle – yes, really – overlooking everything.Weather? It's either blue skies, burgeoning lilacs and hydrangeas, or gently drifting snow outlining the castle battlements, or perfectly formed autumn leaves. Thomas Kinkade is the meteorologist.Louisa ""Lou"" Clark is a cutie pie poor girl. Emilia Clarke, who plays Louisa, telegraphs how adorable Lou is in every scene. She is constantly dimpling her cheeks and wriggling her eyebrows as if they were migrating caterpillars looking for a leaf to pupate on. Look, if you wanted to smack Emilia Clarke during every scene of ""Me Before You,"" could you please send me a Facebook friend request? Does the word ""subtlety"" appear in Emilia Clarke's dictionary? Or ""teamwork""? In every scene she demands attention. Actors should never work with babies, animals, or Emilia Clarke.Lou is supposed to be really poor. Lou never wears the same item of clothing twice. Her clothes are unique designer finds. Her shoes alone would go for a few hundred bucks. Oh, but she's this noble poor girl. Yeah, right.The filmmakers here keyed their film to teenage girls who love clothes more than life itself and who have short attention spans. My utterly subjective estimate: no scene in the film lasts for more than ninety seconds. You think there's going to be a serious discussion, or even three consecutive lines of dialogue, about the issues at play here: can afflicted people live worthwhile lives? Is suicide ethical? Will this film encourage the handicapped to off themselves? But that never happens.It's safe to guess that Will's quadriplegia is, to the filmmakers, merely a plot device. Tweener girls find guys attractive, but are anxious about real physical intimacy and all it entails. Also, tweener girls don't want to be obliterated by masculinity. They want to exist in a world where they are the center. And, tweener girls are anxious that they aren't pretty enough.Thus, ""Me Before You"" gives tweener girls a very handsome, ripped hero who couldn't engage in physical intimacy even if he wanted to. And he is so needy and so isolated that the tweener girl's cuteness and spunkiness and fashion choices become the center of his world. And she doesn't have to be beautiful to be the center of the universe to this handsome guy who, if he were not a quadriplegic, would be the hottest date in town.Yes, it is all pretty awful, right down to Lou's boyfriend, who is an endurance athlete obsessed with his physical performance, but insensitive to Lou's emotional needs – he is meant to contrast with the lovable quadriplegic. One man can run but can't feel. One man can feel but can't walk. Oh good grief.And yet I cried while watching this film. In spite of everything, Claflin's and McTeer's performances opened my heart.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Fine Romance Film,"ME BEFORE YOU is a pretty good take on the romance film. It's not a romantic comedy by any stretch, but more of a sort of drama that has something to say. And whichever way you feel about the issues presented here (even the main characters share conflicting and ambiguous views about them) you will certainly enjoy this.What makes it good is that it's not too cheesy, like so many other films of its kind. Admittedly, it feels a little cheesy toward the start, but it never crosses the line. There are some good laughs and you may even cry too. The acting is great, as is the script and the directing. I feel like the roles were perfectly cast. It's hard to imagine another group of actors would do as good of a job. Recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I cried until I laughed...how does that happen,"First time I have written a review but just too say a movie has never made me cry so much that I started to laugh and every time I kept looking at the screen I would start balling again,I'm a 47 year old male who loves action movies and yet this film hit me like a grenade. I gave the film a 10 purely on how the movie made me feel. Emilia Clark was a joy to watch throughout the film,you were so believable to the point that when you cried I couldn't stop myself...if a movie can make someone react in this way,the film has done its job with entertaining an audience.

Me Before You works mostly because of Emilia Clark's charming screen presence and few moments but its climax is shocking.,"Me Before You (2016): When I read plot line of Me Before You,I was surprised to find it exactly similar to the french classic Intouchables (which was remade in Telugu as Oopiri),only in the other way around.The only difference is they have given a female lead in the caretaker role and as usually love blossoms between them even with such physical differences.But the only reason I watched this movie is for my Princess Khaleesi aka Daenerys Targaryen aka her off screen real name Emilia Clarke.Plot: Louisa Clark (Emilia Clark) is a small town girl who knows a lot about the people around her. Will (Sam Claflin) a quadriplegic man who hates everyone around him. Louisa is hired by Will's mum to take care of him for six months. Although they have a rocky start, their relationship grows over time, going for hate, to like, to love.What I felt: With exactly the same plot and almost same type of scenes like Intouchables ,Me Before You mostly works on Emilia Clarke's charming performance.Other than that,this movie has very few feel good moments but mostly the screenplay is totally predictable.These movies would only work if it has lot of feel good moments which can bring tears but this movie has none literally.The dinner ate Clark's home and the scene where Clark and Will dances and the scene where they watch a movie are the scenes which are the highlight of the movie.As said earlier,Emilia Clark's charming screen presence helped the movie a lot.But her expressions with eyebrows are weird.It felt like she can even move her eyebrows downwards to ;-o.So apart from that she really is charming and I never even imagined Khaleesi being cute like this.Sam Claflin,whom I have seen earlier in Love,Rosie is very good in his role of a quadriplegic man.Music also helped the movie in lot of scenes.But the major surprise in this film is its daring climax.Most of them would not accept this ending (Including me to an extent),but as a fiction we cannot blame the director/writer.But he could have tried other options because this may affect lot of such disabled persons ideology.So,Me Before You works mostly because of Emilia Clark's charming screen presence and few moments but its climax is shocking.My rating 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why tf do I watch this stuff?,"I usually DON'T watch these kinds of movies, but I tuned in because of Emilia Clarke, Brendon Coyle, and Matthew Lewis. It still made me friggin cry, though.It really is a very good movie. The cast do a fantastic job of getting you invested in the characters, especially Emilia Clarke, she's so damn charming! Sam Claflin does a remarkable job in his role as well, especially when it comes to portraying the kind of depression that doubtless hits people in situations like his character's.As for the whiners crying about how this movie glorifies assisted suicide, or that it's trying to say that quadriplegic people should off themselves because they're a burden, go get on a hot dog bun since you wanna be a wiener. What it's showing is someone for whom there IS no future, at least in his own mind. He's gone so deep down the depression pits that even finding love with someone isn't enough to 'rescue' him. And that happens. It's sad, and in fact utterly heart-breaking, but it happens.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
100% would recommend!! EVERYTHING was FANTASTIC!!!,"As an aspiring movie producer/director, I was amazed by this film! Yes, 10/10 is very presumptuous of me and may be a slight exaggeration, but personally I loved every second of the movie and was anxiously dying to watch it all over again the second it ended! This movie makes you think in different ways and to think in their shoes, which I LOVE. I also might love this so much because I can relate due to my brother having a born disease where he cannot walk. When people see this film, some of Will's ways of thinking are very unorthodox to some and viewers may think the character is crazy, but understanding the life that handicapped people live, I thought it was perfectly executed. This film was a fantastic movie! The location, the actors, the music scorer, etc. It all blew me away and I loved it!!!!! 10/10 would recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Will she lift his spirit?""Me Before You"" is an adorable dramatic romance in the directorial debut of director Thea Sharrock.

"Surprisingly Bittersweet, Surprisingly Better Than Expected","Pros:
1. Emilia Clarke (Lou Clark) gives a really warm and cheerful performance which helps to imbue the film with much needed light and brevity. Sam Claflin (Will Traynor) delivers a solidly emotive performance which is especially impressive as he could only use his face and voice.2. The film handles the subject matter of sudden disability and all of the aftermath with tenderness and thoughtfulness.3. The ending is surprisingly bittersweet which usurps the traditional cheesy and happy endings to romantic-dramas. It feels a lot more real and grounded than most of the others.4. Both Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke have amazingly subtle, but soft and intimate, chemistry together.Cons:
1. Patrick (Matthew Lewis) only exists to create a false love triangle as he's constantly portrayed as clueless to his girlfriend's wants and needs.2. The score is annoyingly continuous as it tries to force emotion.3. The editing is far too overzealous at times with constant cutting which is massive eyesore.4. Emilia Clarke's crying scene is unintentionally hilarious; it's the only bad bit of acting from her.5. Jenna Coleman (Katrina ""Treena"" Clark) is wasted as she's barely in it. When she is, she lights up the scene whilst providing more depth to Lou Clark. She gets given a half-baked sub-plot about her being a single mother thus prompting her to get back into education, but all of that comes across as an excuse to get her out the picture to just focus on Lou Clark.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie,"i have watched very little of the movies which were based on any ROMANTIC BOOKS like ""The Fault in Our Stars"", but this movie is and will be one of the Greatest and one of the Best Romantic Movie I would have ever watched.I have watched Emilia Clarke, playing the role of Lou Clark, in some great movies and of course Game of Thrones, it was good to see change in the type of Role she played in this Movie. I and many audience has made an image of Emilia Clarke as a strong and Bold Character playing actress( well according to me only) as she had the recent movie of Terminator: Genisys, and the famous Khaleesi/ Mother of Dragons.Sam Claffin on the other hand did a tremendous job, he did his Homework very well, according to me he painted the perfect portrait of Will Traynor as a person who was full of life and how his life suddenly changes because of the Accident. He also acted well as we can certainly see how a person gets Cranky when something he had lost in his life which he cherished and loved.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Me Before You"" is totally predictable, but manages to maintain an aura of romanticism that will always exist in cinema, conquering those who want to fall in love","Despite following an extremely predictable plot, the maxim here is that the important thing is not knowing the end, but the journey that leads to it. As the script was written by Moyes, his control over the characters and the story as a whole allows everything to be consistent with how it is presented throughout the projection. The characters have the necessary depth, consistent with their size in the story, in addition to well-developed arcs. Unfortunately, some stereotypes and repetitive devices are present, such as: the inexperienced and clearly incompetent person who is hired for a job with high responsibility or the prejudiced view that rich people are always cold and bad-tempered, or the fact that Lou starts to be respected after she begins to retaliate against the rudeness she hears. However, after overcoming these mishaps, the rest of the film goes on smoothly and with several positive aspects.Among these, what draws the most attention are the visual requirements that must always be in harmony: photography, production design and costumes. Will's quarters truly reflect the state of mind of someone about to surrender to such a fate. It is a place taken by neutral and lifeless tones, which are replicated in the boy's costume, helping Claflin in his performance full of indifference. Which, at least, has some visual logic when compared to the apartment he lived in, seen in the opening scene, taken by an aseptic white only interrupted by occasional yellow objects, indicating his professional and modern nature, but also happy. A color that completely disappeared when we found him again in the wheelchair, being present only in Louisa's clothes. So much so that we first see her through her socks, which are bright yellow.The contrast between Lou and Traynor's feelings and way of looking at life stands out, while he is always wearing and surrounded by dark and cold colors, while she wears always colorful clothes, different and daring hairstyles. This contrast is also present in the environments they frequent. As Lou's house is small, a little messy and slightly cramped for so many people, the viewer is left with a feeling of closeness and warmth. On the other hand, despite the luxury, huge environments, with high ceilings and everything perfectly organized, make the loneliness and depressive atmosphere that permeates the Traynor family more evident. In a slightly more philosophical analysis, it can be said that Lou really brought life to that family, since after his entry into that home, colors and smiles become something more commonplace. In addition to the visuals, the film also excels in its incidental soundtrack, which ranges from Ed Sheeran to Imagine Dragons, with each song accurately complementing the emotions that play out on screen.However, despite so many positive aspects, nothing beats the protagonist couple, Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Clarke completely disengages herself from the role that made her famous, Daenerys Targaryen, from the series ""Game of Thrones"". She manages to demonstrate much more talent, charisma and resourcefulness in the development of her character, after all, here she exposes more than two facial and body expressions. She is able to make people laugh with her clumsy manner and her tendency to speak at the wrong time or when she tries to keep up with her athlete boyfriend, just as she is able to bring the audience to tears (hitting her target audience squarely) in more difficult moments. Dramatic, like heavier arguments in the third act. Sam Claflin, on the other hand, has a great performance as the young quadriplegic. He manages to build his character in such a way that his depression, his attitudes and his decisions become believable. Therefore, Lou's impact on his life from the beginning of their relationship is even greater, thanks to the talent of the protagonists.Just like the book, ""As I Was Before You"" is a walking success formula, and to believe that this is a mere detail would be very naive. From the sugary songs of Ed Sheeran to the beautiful locations of the English countryside, passing through the plot, the persona of the actors and their involvement, everything works. The film goes from comedy to drama, always keeping its romance tone, which will please all its audience. If the feature is able to trap its viewer in the story of a simple young woman who starts working as a caregiver for a rich and handsome young man who had just become quadriplegic, it sometimes commits a series of compromising slips, but it also manages to create moments that recall the best of its kind, in a result that is first of all quite irregular.Betting on an incredibly agile first act, the film by newcomer Thea Sharrock, scripted by Moyes herself, seems to be in a hurry to place its characters in the central conflict, this generates a somewhat weak construction of characters, which reinforces stereotypes a little. At certain times, the character of Lou (Emilia Clarke) is represented as a woman of almost childlike naivety, often being described as the girl who compensates for her lack of intelligence with her kindness. If that sounds troubling enough, Will (Clafin) is at first such a thoroughly miserable character that it's hard to have any identification with him or his pain. After the involvement of the two, things start to get more interesting, and much for their haste, As I Was Before You works only after this clash of personalities, and the involvement even strengthens the characters that until then did not show a good construction. It is interesting to note how, at this moment when the film still does not deliver such a structured relationship between Will and Lou, it bets on a more comic vein, often converging in a flashy humor that often borders on slapstick, far from the subtle British humor. In that sense, it's funny how the film thinks it's above some names in comedy and the novel itself, by satirizing some examples of the genre.At one point, Lou goes to the cinema with her boyfriend and she would like to see a film by Almodóvar, since Will introduced the girl to European cinema, but her boyfriend prefers to see a film with Will Ferrell, with a whole scenic intonation that that's a joke. In another moment, Lou, also jokingly, reads a book by Irish writer Marian Keyes, known for her romantic comedies for women. Me Before You doesn't seem to realize that it's much closer to those two copies than anything else. And if the comedy is not the strong point of the feature, the romance is what draws the most attention, applying a certain innocence in relation to the feeling throughout the plot, remembering the best of the genre. And that doesn't mean that the film excludes physical attraction, or sex itself, but these are themes treated in a simple and natural way by ""As I Was Before You"", in this case, innocence should not be confused with naivety.Thus, the feature film finds romanticism in the small details, such as Lou's act of shaving Will, or even just seeing the other sleeping, or a simple kiss that you almost don't see the lips touching, the romance of the film is found in the little things and that is a big feature. And in this context, unlike its comedy, the film understands its place and is not afraid to assume the conventions of the genre - the feature dives into sentimentality and, incredible as it may seem, it works for ""Me Before You"", in the images already seen in several other films causes an even closer approximation to that story, opening up the possibility for the spectator to live that romance together with the couple on the screen.Sequences such as the dance on top of the wheel chair filmed in a circular tracking shot, or the farewell after a party in which Will asks the girl to stay with him a little longer and a crane goes up while they are alone at that moment, remembering the best of the romantic cinema. As much as these are more than predictable scenes, they help to set the right tone for the plot and romance is the strength of ""Me Before You"". For all its irregularities, ""Me Before You"" is far from being an unpleasant film. Although it is not a great film, the feature manages to maintain an aura of romanticism that will always exist in cinema, conquering those who want to fall in love. A film that fails in its comedy, but succeeds in its romance. Even without big news, it should please its target audience for having most of the elements that were successful in the genre. It has a good pace, attractive characters with a lot of chemistry, a soundtrack made up of songs that were successful at the time of release, and moments that will make many cry in the cinema session.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN,"YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS. If you're into romance just as much as I am, then this would definitely be a priority to watch this movie before you die. Maybe an overstatement but I am SO glad that I watched this. It's one of those good girl tried to save the ""broken"" guy type of plots but this one by far, has to be one of the most well directed and heartwarming movies out there in the movie industry. Titanic is my favorite movie and this definitely comes a close second. Not many romance movies make me tear up but this one had me sobbing into my blankets. Overall, just watch the darn movie. It's amazing for all the right reasons.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beautiful romantic film,"One of the most romantic films I have seen for some time. Of course its a weepy, and how I blubbed, though I have previous in this regard, but it also swells the heart and leaves you with a beautiful warm glow. This should make real stars of the two main players with Claffin excellent as someone who's life has been destroyed by an accident leaving him not just paralysed, but also without the will to carry on. But the true stand out is Clarke, who's unquenchable cheerfulness and sunny outlook on life in the face of his depressed hostility has to be seen to be believed and maybe starts to turn him around? A lovely film with a beautiful ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not an emotional tearjerker, but surprisingly enjoyable nonetheless","To be honest, I went into this film expecting a wannabe version of The Notebook that would frustrate me with cheesy and cringeworthy characters and romance. And, at least for the first half hour, that's exactly what I got, however the great thing about Me Before You is that it gets a hell of a lot better with every scene, ending up as a very enjoyable, if not generic, romantic drama.However, before I get into the best parts of this film, I'm going to start with the first act, roughly half an hour wrought with problems that I expected to continue on through the whole movie. First off, this film is a textbook example of a bad first impression, in the form of Louisa, played by Emilia Clarke. With the benefit of hindsight and her character arc, I can see that Clarke's performance at the beginning wasn't her own bad acting, but rather a symptom of simply poor writing and directing.As the film begins, Louisa is presented as a nice but pretty clumsy and dim young woman, who lucks into a job caring for the rich Will Traynor. However, despite all the smiles and brightly-coloured outfits, her ridiculous luck in the first act meant that she just wasn't a particularly lovable character for me, leaving me continually frustrated for the best part of half an hour.That, combined with all the inevitably cheesy and insanely generic chick flick tropes, meant that I had no hope going into the second act of the film. However, as the story develops, we get some great character development for both the leads, and, thanks to Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin's excellent chemistry, the film becomes very charming, pleasant and simply enjoyable.I'm not going to ignore the fact that the story follows an very formulaic route from start to finish, but what I really enjoyed about the film was watching Louisa and Will's relationship develop, simply because the two lead actors worked so well together, and gave very convincing performances that, especially in the case of Emilia Clarke, got less and less cringeworthy as the film moved along.Put simply, I eventually came round to really enjoy Me Before You. Despite an awful start, the film's pleasant and positive atmosphere, combined with Clarke and Claflin's fantastic chemistry, had me smiling and enjoying myself by the end. It's by no means the emotional roller-coaster of a love story it aims to be, but as a simply enjoyable and pleasant watch, Me Before You does the job pretty well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not horrible, but not great either","I am sorry to say this but either Emilia Clarke is not a good actress, or the director sucks at directing. Her performance was a little too exaggerated and almost comical. I don't think this was meant to be a comedy, but maybe it was...? Possibly so, at least Lou and Patrick seemed like they were supposed to be funny.The storyline was okay but not believable.
Maybe it's better to read the book; it could well be that they edited out too much information?? but I wasn't convinced that Will absolutely had to make that awful decision.I did love Lou's fashion - it kind of reminded me of ""Amélie"" - colorful and corky. I also loved to see Tywin from Game of Thrones and lovely Mr. Bates from ""Downton Abbey."" Hence one extra star.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Movie Vs. Book: Me Before You,"A girl in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of.It's easy to be cold and cynical these days, but we should never lose sight of the simple, cathartic pleasure of a good cry at the movies. At first, I didn't want to review this novel – nor the movie – because I knew I would want to re-read it. Which might seem perverse if you know that for most of the last hundred pages I was dissolved in tears? Based on the best-selling 2012 novel by Jojo Moyes who also penned the screenplay. This story will feel familiar to anyone who sniffed through Love Story or The Fault in Our Stars. Surprisingly it's better than both. Me Before You is a love story, a family story and above all, it's a story of the bravery and sustained the effort needed to redirect the path of a life once it's been pushed off course. This is also a story that is eloquent not so much in its delivery as in its humanity. The set up is the same as many of classic (and non-classic) romance: a poor but cheerful young girl meets a rich, grumpy gentleman and begins working for him. But what makes Me Before You different and quite interesting in principle is that Will Traynor is physically broken as well as emotionally.You'll forgive the movie's clichés because of its surprisingly winning performances. As the film goes on and the frost between both protagonists melts, both actors give their stock roles unexpected emotional layers. On a basic level, it is engaging watching Lou enter this new world for which she is entirely unprepared. Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke stars as Louisa, she's like Love Actually-era Keira Knightley, crossed with a Hello Kitty doll. Clarke's sincerity doesn't just win Will's heart, it wins ours too. Will Traynor since he's played by Sam Claflin, whose Finnick Odair was one of the best things in the Hunger Games series, isn't just killer handsome or impossibly good- looking even if his condition has left him bitterly depressed and cuttingly sarcastic in a wheelchair. The actor is good as Will, working well with the physical demands of the role and even bringing a gentle flirtatiousness to his character, as he develops his relationship with Lou. In fact, his grin, with its slight touch of a smirk – creates an unmistakable echo of a young Hugh Grant. Sam Claflin makes Will a broken man with a powerful life inside him. Plus, Will's character makes me think of Mr. Rochester in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre; with his rudeness and temper. While Louisa is so Jane Eyre: ""One of the invisible"". Lou has never lived; Will has, but no longer can. You don't have to be Nicholas Sparks to know where this is heading – that these two opposites will end up attracting, and that love, at least for a while, will prove stronger than death. Lou is not heroic and her male counterpart may be nobody's idea of a leading man or Prince Charming, and yet with both of them, Jojo Moyes created an affair I will always remember.Me Before You is a heartbreaker in the best sense. Employing emotional truth to bring the reader to tears. And yet, unlike other novels, tears are not gratuitous. Some situations, the author forces the reader to recognize, really are worth crying over. Furthermore, people can take an awful lot of sadness if you can be funny about it. Jojo Moyes is a literary stylist. Just a storyteller. And a really good one. She manages to draw on the skills she owned as a journalist to create a clear, candid picture of the practicalities of Will's situation. While the novelist's mind casts an illuminating light on her character's reactions. Moyes makes them coming together extremely tender, both sweet and real. But there's a deadline. One that haunts their love story haunts the novel. The author is masterful, in not shying from the complexities or shading the agony of choosing between life and death. It's achingly hard to read at moments and yet such a joy.Screenwriters choose to lose the ""Maze"" scene when Lou recalls a sexual assault when she was younger. Often when you read about rape in fiction, it's the defining event of a story. And cutting it from the movie, I think, was a good thing because the scene is very opaque in the book, and putting it on film would have given it far more weight than it has in the book. Plus, it would have eventually change the mood of the story. However the ""Birthday Dinner"" scene, at Louisa's home, hits a particularly high note, offering the most poignant moment both in the book and the movie – its soul, really – as well as a pitch-perfect hilarious one. Finally, my favorite part of both the film and the book is when Will and Lou go out on a ""date"" to a concert. She wears a dress of sexiest scarlet, and as they are in the car ready to go home, he confesses in a very Hugh Gratian manner: ""I don't want to go in yet. I just want to be a man who's been to a concert with a girl in a red dress."" I know a good British rom-com reference when I see one.Overall, Me Before You doesn't try to reinvent the genre. We've all seen some version of this movie before, but that doesn't make it any less effective. It knows what it is and embraces it. ""Tell me something good,"" Will says to Louisa at two transformative junctures of the book. This story at its heart is about two people who properly listen to each other, it is something good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have something in my eye. It's allergies, I swear.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet, sorrowful film, beautifully presented; some viewers will not feel comfortable with the ethical issues","In the South of Britain, near Wales, a young businessman, Will (Sam Claflin) has just kissed his girlfriend goodbye on a rainy morning. He tries to hail a taxi but, unhappily, he is struck by a motorcycle. Meanwhile, Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) has been a waitress in a nearby café for six years, where she proved to be a friendly asset. Unexpectedly, she is given a pink slip and a month's wages. At home, the Clarks hear this news with dismay, for Papa Clark has been laid off and Lou's salary has been supporting them all. Undaunted, the fetching, zany-dressed young gal goes to the job center for new leads. There's one promising one. It seems a mother, Camilla (Janet McTeer) is searching for a nurse's aide to help her paralyzed son. Yes, its Will, from the movie's beginning, who is now confined to a wheelchair with little motion below his neck. Will's family, the Trainers, are the richest folk in the area and live in a modified castle. In short order, Louisa gets the position, for she is chatty and gregarious, despite her lack of nursing experience. But, wait, Will greets his new caretaker with undisguised rudeness, asking her to ""not talk"" to him and stay out of his way as much as possible. A roving nurse, Nathan, though, tells Louisa he is delighted she is there and assures her that Will is rude because his situation is so bleak. In time, things change. Will does become more communicative and is cheered by Lou's weird clothes and infectious manner. When his former girlfriend comes to break the news that she is engaged to a man who was once W's best friend, Louisa is there to help Will from falling to pieces. In fact, Lou and the nurse decide to put forth a list of outings which will, hopefully, change his view toward life. This involves going to the horse races and a symphony concert. Indeed, Will does seem cheerier. But, oh no, Lou overhears Will state he agreed to give himself six months of living for his mother's sake, at which end he hopes to go a euthanasia clinic in Switzerland. Can this really be, when Lou has started to love Will and he seems to being feeling the same way about her? This sweet, sorrowful movie will have its viewers in waterfalls of tears. Yes, there are moments of humor and fun, but, the tale is always a story of a wheelchair bound man, formerly very active. who struggles to accept his new reality. The cast is great, with Claflin, Clarke, McTeer, Charles Dance, and all of the others doing fine work. Mr. Claflin, who also appeared in Love, Rosie, will hopefully not be confined to roles in love stories, although his handsome face is swoon worthy. Then, the setting is superb, a lovely glimpse at a little known part of Britain. Louisa's costumes are ""sublimely ridiculous"" amid a well clad cast and the script, from a novel by JoJo Moyes, is carefully, poignantly written. Finally, the direction is somewhat slow, at times, but hits all the right marks for its presentation. As stated above, some viewers will not like the film's stance on euthanasia, as it strongly supports personal choice. Therefore, listen to this caution. However, most viewers, especially fans of romantic drama, will welcome the opportunity for a sweet, sad cry.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great and very moving story,"So at first I thought it was going to be another pretty predictable movie and I was only watching it because I love Emilia Clarke. But I was actually pleasantly surprised. The movie was not predictable at all and really was special for a lot of reasons.Also the acting performances were very good. Emilia Clarke did a great job at playing an adorable, clumsy, sweet girl and Sam Claflin too did a great performance as a disabled young man.The movie did really hit me right in the feels cause it could really take you away and the actors had a great chemistry on screen. The music was good but not the best soundtrack I've heard and would personally have made a completely original soundtrack for a movie like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Me Before You is just amazing with one of the worls best actresses.,"I went for an unplanned movie in the cinema's yesterday and chose Me Before You because the trailer looked good and I wanted to see Emilia Clarke star a whole different role at least once. Since everyone, including me, knows her from the Game of Thrones series on TV, playing a real war-chick, it's hard to imagine her playing something so delicate. In the first 30 minutes of the movie, I already saw this was going to be great. Emilia can show so many emotions in her face without even trying, which makes it clear why they chose her. The way she lived Lou in the movie was just amazing, real and definitely sincere.This is a must-see movie, not only today, but tomorrow, next year and in 10 years as well.Rating : 10/10 for sure!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Me Before You - Review,"As a disabled person with CP, I kept putting off watching this film due to the backlash from the disabled community. However, I felt that given that the content of the film reflects my everyday experiences working with personal assistants (and also that I have a keen interest in the topic of euthanasia) I had spent too much time avoiding the issues that are explored in Me Before You.Before watching this film, I was already aware of the fact that the character of Will was being played by able-bodied actor Sam Claflin. I can see why others have taken issue with this, for me it felt like it sent out the wrong message. I found it uncomfortable to see an able-bodied actor portraying a disabled character, because it would have been more genuine and relatable had they chosen one of the many talented disabled actors out there. For a start, it would have been beneficial for the disabled community to be put in the media spotlight in a positive sense. In addition to this, the content of the film would have been less negative because we ultimately watch Will choose to end his life. Whereas, if Will were played by someone with a disability, then we would benefit by celebrating disability through a successful public figure who has managed to overcome social barriers and has built a career as an actor. Sam Claflin in the role of Will reinforced the sad message of the film; that disabled lives aren't worth living.I strongly disagree with the premise that living life with a disability is less valuable. It is a different way of a life, but not a meaningless one. Will's perspective was warped as he failed to embrace an alternative way of life and instead lived in the past. He focused upon the things that he could no longer do because of his quadriplegia. He wanted to live like he did prior to his accident, and therefore could not accept himself as a wheelchair user. This negative view reflects how society too often views people with disabilities; as incapable or a burden. Will's unchanging decision to go to Dignatas reinforces the incorrect view that the prospects are bleak if you become less physically able. I myself would dispute this narrow-minded outlook.Despite my reservations about the overall impact of this film, I did enjoy watching the relationship between Will and Lou develop. In the beginning they were unable to relate to each other, as Will was uncooperative in allowing Lou to become a part of his daily life. Preventing Lou from becoming a real part of his routine was a form of denial, because allowing her in would make his current situation real. It seemed he was afraid of becoming co-dependant on anyone and wanted her to be merely an extension of his limited physical capabilities. The breakdown in communication was portrayed well by both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, as the awkwardness was evident on screen. The dynamic changed when they started connecting with one another and understanding each other's lives in more depth. What was evident from the outset is that both characters had something that the other perceived as important in living a good life. For Will that was freedom, but for Lou this meant the financial stability that Will took for granted. Unfortunately there was nothing that convinced Will to choose his new life over euthanasia, not even now having Lou in his life. However I would suggest that spending so much time with her was in fact counter-productive, because she represented everything he could no longer do. Perhaps if Will had spent more time with other wheelchair users who had accepted and embraced their lifestyles, he could have achieved a more positive state of mind.Ultimately, I would still recommend this film because it provides an insight (albeit exaggerated) into the motivations behind euthanasia, and opens the debate in popular culture. The are parts of Me Before You that I found inspiring and uplifting, which is more than I expected.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Heartfelt Romance Avoids Mediocrity,"One of this Summer's biggest romances ""Me Before You"" stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin as two people who come together despite having very different backgrounds. Thea Sharrock directs this film based on a book of the same name written by Jojo Moyes who also provides the screenplay. While this movie isn't a breakthrough in any way and is host to many flaws, its leading characters chemistry and sincere tone carry it past mediocrity.The premise here is quite simple: Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) a young man with an amazing life and everything he had ever wanted is tragically injured and left as a shell of his former self. Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke) a young woman who has recently been fired from her job and is struggling to support her family is hired as his caregiver. This incredibly simple premise is nothing new, and does little to break the formula. Thankfully, Emilia Clark and Sam Claflin are great. They have amazing chemistry that ultimately carries this movie. Claflin's Traynor steals every scene he is in and his performance as a quadriplegic is believable while at the same time not overbearing. Clarke's Lou performs admirably, but at times she comes off as a little too odd and outlandish. Nothing bad enough to take away from the movie, yet at times distracting. Both of these actors come together to form a pair that is addicting to watch on screen and the best parts of the film are when these two actors come together to form a sincere bond.Other characters including Lou's boyfriend (Matthew Lewis) and Traynor's caregiver (Stephen Peacocke) are quite likable and provide some great humor despite being criminally underdeveloped. Lou's Boyfriend is a lovable buffoon, yet their strained relationship felt unnecessary in the film. The caregiver provides some comic relief but fails to provide more than an unnecessary third wheel to the overall story. The relationship between Lou and her sister (Jenna Coleman) tries to be heartfelt but ends up feeling completely unnecessary. In fact, the relationship could be cut out of the movie completely and viewers would never know the difference.The story here is incredibly cliché yet there are some surprising elements. Other than a few surprises the plot here plays out exactly like any other romance movie. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing due to the fact that most viewers are not going to see this movie for its groundbreaking storytelling. Rather audiences will flock to it looking for a heartfelt and passionate romance film, and that is exactly what they'll get. The soundtrack of the film fits the film quite well and some big moments are only amplified by some impressive music choices. Subtle yet sometimes quirky tones and pacing in this film work fine. In most instances though, the film feels rather sincere in the way it presents its story. Though people who have seen the trailers (which unsurprisingly shows far too much of the story) can pretty much tell how the movie is going to unfold, there are some surprises waiting. The biggest surprise of the film lies within its ending, which tackles a real life issue in today's world. Amazingly ""Me Before You"" does a fantastic job of presenting this issue with respect, while at the same time not shoving it down audience's throats. The film does such a good job presenting this subject that viewers will have ""Me Before You"" fresh in their minds for a long time.Despite running into a myriad of Romantic film clichés, ""Me Before You"" does an admirable job of telling its story. Claflin and Clarke's performances and chemistry are undeniably what carry this movie, despite being surrounded by weak supporting characters. The way it tackles a real world issue with grace and class are quite impressive and leave a satisfying impression. Ultimately, ""Me Before You"" is a simple film that achieves what it originally set out to accomplish. It is a sappy yet cliché romance that provides an interesting look at a real world problem. Score: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Wonderful Movie.,"A truly loving and endearing feature, with a talented cast in good use and very well meaning intentions.I enjoyed this film, greatly, most upon which lay in the interesting premise and wonderful performances. One immediately points to Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, for their chemistry truly drives this film, and scenes where they are separated have great weight as one can genuinely feel the disconnect and worriment felt by the characters, which is a great achievement on the part of the actors, screenplay and director.The films screenplay is worthy of praise, however is also the root of some of the films flaws. The motion picture is an adaptation a novel, both were written by the same individual (Jojo Moyes). The screenplay builds upon the characters highly successfully in the first two acts of the picture, and delivers the dilemma with clarity and respect.However the third act, I thought to be weaker, for I believe for Will's motives to not have been explored as deeply as could have been, for it was told and not necessarily shown, and what was shown didn't hit the emotive mark as well as it could have. Therefore when he chooses his final choice, and Lou's subsequent decision: it feels a little premature, a bit too out of the blue, the twist isn't as convincing as could have been. Thus this weakens the third act, although by the final scenes between the two is of great emotional impact, and rectifies many of the problems by the narratives end.The supporting cast was of particular importance to how the story unfolded, I felt that some were stronger than others. I felt that Charles Dance and Vanessa Kirby were the most impactful upon the story and delivered as such in their performances. However I felt that Will's mother, played by Janet McTeer could have been stronger and had a greater part to play in the narrative, although the performances from the actress and the aforementioned actors were all splendid.On the other hand, I believe for the doctor called Nathan to be a very telling character to the film, in that he spoke and delivered what he had to say and then left, as a expositionary source. That his impact was minimal and could of had a much more emotive arc and relationship with Will and Lou.However, I must not forget the wonderful use of colour in this film; with particular praise for the costume design and cinematography. The costume designers for this film did a splendid piece of work, in endressing Emilia Clarke in all the happy, striped and multicoloured costumes, without ever coming across as silly, but as loving, friendly and caring. The cinematography further highlighted this interesting colour palette, and helped to compliment it, without the film descending into looking like madness or a fairy world. Apart from that, the angles are clear and fairly standard, but yet deliver upon the dramatic function to a fair and adequate quality, overall the cinematography aids and enhances from the film and doesn't detract from it, as it could have very easily fallen into more silly territory.In the end, I did very much enjoy this film. I particularly liked the performances and the very loving and jolly atmosphere sustained thought the feature, which brings a fun and entertaining film. Though the screenplay at times hindered certain aspects of the film and some characters, it played to great strengths in other areas. Thus I give the film a healthy 7/10. I would recommend this film, particularly to people looking for something romantic or for quiet evenings and slow days.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Worth a Watch,"I definitely consider this movie part of the chic flick genre which I usually avoid, but I could not stop myself from watching Emilia Clarke. It was so refreshing to see her doing something besides the mother of dragons. Don't get me wrong -- I love the Khaleesi as much as every other strong woman and Game of Thrones fan, but in this movie, I found her personality, likability and sometimes playful quirkiness delightful. It was mesmerizing and enough to make me glad I had watched the movie. Of course Sam Claflin is brilliantly handsome so there was no hardship there, either.I found the movie somewhat reminiscent of The Fault in our Stars but without the waterworks that movie elicited. I would have preferred a different ending, but we don't always get what we want.I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with a boyfriend but if you have a free night or want a slow night with a gal pal and a glass of wine, this movie might be worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Romance well done,"Me Before You is a romantic drama film directed by Thea Sharrock based on the novel by Jojo Moyes with the same name. The film stars Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Jenna Coleman, Charles Dance, Matthew Lewis, Ben Lloyd-Hughes and Janet McTeer. The movie is about a girl named Lou Clark who is desperate for a job and so the goes on to take care of a recently paralyzed man from a rich family, who she slowly creates a bond with. This is a well made movie with amazing performances all around, especially by the amazing Emilia Clarke who gives a wonderful performance on the leading role. By her side is Sam Claflin who plays Will Traynor, and he does a very good job too. It is a movie filled with heart breaking emotional scenes, very good cinematography and a brilliant score by Craig Armstrong that makes Me Before You as a whole one of the best romances there are.

Main Character Puts His Own Wishes Above All Else,"Sorry but this movie has several problems. Story is about a paralyzed man who falls in love with a young local woman hired to be his companion/help mate. However he wants to commit suicide because of the pain and inability to live normally. The Trainers are supposedly the most prominent and wealthy local gentry family and yet they appear to have no servants at the manor house. Really? I mean people like them would have at least a few flunkies doing chores. It was laughable that Mrs. Trainor would answer the door herself to let the ""shop girl"" in to interview for the companion to her disabled son job. Normally when people are interviewing for a job like this with well to do people, a maid would let them in and allow them to be seated in the hallway and go in and tell the lady of the house she had a ""person"" to interview for the job. The local upper class upon calling would be shown into a sitting room and then the lady of the house informed of their presence. Also in a small village, the Trainers would likely have found someone by ""word of mouth"" and not gone through the employment office at all. Furthermore it was mentioned in passing that the disabled son had been a corporate raider in London prior to his accident and yet he shows no compassion nor remorse for the jobs he has cost working stiffs nor companies looted and destroyed.It is hard to feel sympathy for such an unrepentant sleaze ball. One last point: Was it really necessary to jet off to Switzerland for ""voluntary euthanasia""? In real life a hefty overdose of morphine or bottle of sleeping tablets and whiskey together would have done the job with much less fuss and trouble and trauma and upset for the parents. Apparently the handicapped young man really did put himself before and above everyone else.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
absolutely heart wrenching in the best way possible,"I read the book (twice) four months before the movie was release- loved it. Highly recommend it.

Right from the start, just from seeing the title of the movie on the screen I began crying with excitement .loved every bloody minute of it. This movie will make you laugh, cry, lose your self in the room, and most of all- pray for a goddamn sequel movie (there is a following book named ""after you""- highly recommend it). I cried like someone (god forbid) died or something! Trust me, some will say it's a classic chick flick, but I say screw it. ""Me Before You"" is the best romantic movie ever to exist.

Enjoyable manipulative,"The weepy ""Me Before You"" stars Sam Clafin, an actor so photogenic had movies not been invented before his birth, they surely would have developed once he hit puberty just so he had some way of sharing how handsome he is. Thewestchestarian wonders how he didn't get the ""50 Shades of Grey"" lead ahead of dead-on-the-inside Jamie Dornan. Sam also brings a delightful ""English-ness"" to the role overshadowing the Campbell Scott original ""Dying Young"". Despite her London upbringing Emilia Clarke (please consider that final ""e"" when pronouncing her surname Americans) doesn't bring that same underlying seriousness and gravitas that English actors contribute. The two work well together although you can see Clafin dictating the relationship and Clarke reacting to him more than acting. The story they act in is a bit what you would expect. Will's life basically went from the top of human experience to some area below average although he remains very wealthy and can afford every accommodation a quadriplegic could ask for. He deals with justifiable anger and suicidal thoughts which ""Lou"" holds eases but ultimately doesn't relieve. Any interesting aspect of the story is the personal growth Lou undergoes through her association with Will and, perhaps to a greater degree, his upper crust wealthy family. The movie doesn't shy away from the obvious class differences in English society. In short, you largely know where the story is headed and much of the direction is aimed at jerking forth tears but it is worth the ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lovely, Humorous, Touching, Romantic Story","I watched the movie first, then read the novel and watched the movie again as I was about to finish reading the novel. I really love the author, Jojo Moyes. I love her writings and it is a great combination of humor, romance and life lessons. There are many scenes that would just make me burst into laughter. I love the casts! Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke is a wonderful match. They look so great in this film. I think one important part in the novel that shouldn't be left out in the movie is when Lou decided to move in with Patrick. I think that's quite a big point where we could see Will wasn't able to hide his feelings anymore. I think it can build more tensions b/w the characters. And the tattoo part probably should be in the film as well. It's really adorable. Anyway, really enjoy the movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Me before You: Pembroke Castle.,"When you start watching the film you can't help but let this beautiful castle and its greener than green lawn get into your eyes. It's an iconic image of Wales, as legendary as the man who made it build: William Marshal, 'the best knight that ever lived' (if you are not familiar with UK history I strongly suggest you go and check on him because I'm sure you won't be disappointed).Besides that, the movie was for kids but nice, with many gentle feminine touches: Lou's clothes, Lou's feelings, Mrs Traynor's maternal love, Mrs Clark's maternal wisdom, Clark family's attitude towards jobs, luxury and unemploymentDirector Thea Sharrock and screenwriter Jojo Moyes (a female Author: not the Jojo from Tucson, Arizona...) did a good job: they walked too close to the edge of self hedonism for my tastes, but they didn't plummet down and I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's time to live boldly with Will & Louisa in this terrific feel-good love story,"It's really hard for me to not spoil the surprises of a movie like ""Me Before You"". For general moviegoers, they'll be expecting another love story about two people who fall in love until one of the characters has a dark secret that could tear them apart. For fans of the book, they will love the fact that it's incredibly faithful to the Jojo Moyes novel (See ""The Fault in Our Stars"", ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and other true-to-the-book movies for details), but they will also get so much more out of it. I recently read the novel last month before the film came out and I found the book affectionate, funny and surprisingly uplifting. I think the key to any book-based movie is to find the right actors to have not only good chemistry, but to make sure that audiences will remember the characters in their hearts. Boy, have they lucked out with two immensely charming actors in this terrific film. ""Me Before You"" tells the story of Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke), a 26-year-old happy-go-lucky woman who has been trying to find the right job to support her working-class family. That is until she unexpectedly finds one by working as a caregiver to Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). Will was ""The Man"", that guy who had everything at the palm of his hands until an motorcycle accident left him an quadriplegic. Now he's sarcastic, bitter, moody and thinking of really dark thoughts. How did his heart turn to ice? Anyway, Lou refuses to be put off by a man who lost everything and gave his friends and everybody, as Lou calls it, ""the (crappy) treatment"". Suddenly, it starts off being an antagonistic relationship to a rather healthy one as Lou, with the help of her sister, Treena (Jenna Coleman), tries to help Will understand that life is definitely worth living for. And, yes, they do start to fall for one another, until Will has that secret that could end it all. I like the movie, but I do have a couple of minor problems: The first one is that the movie is not exactly as deep and sometimes dark as the book was. However, I give it points for letting the book and the movie asks the two questions: ""Can you fall in love with a person but disagree on what their opinion of life is?"" and ""Can that same person change your life, even when it's least expected?"" The second one is that first-time feature film director Thea Sharrock moves the film a little too fast without giving us a moment to understand Will's plight and Lou's cheerful earnestness while trying to get to the best parts of the story. But those problems did wash away with the help of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Clarke, best known as the Mother of Dragons on ""Game of Thrones"", should've been a breakout movie star with that last Terminator movie. Here, that title suits Clarke well as the character of the quick-witted but sometimes vulnerable Lou. Claflin, in his first movie outside of ""The Hunger Games"" series, has the most challenging role, so far. But he is remarkable as the stubborn but sincere Will. Their chemistry together is amazing. The supporting cast is also good too, with Janet McTeer and Charles Dance (also from ""Game of Thrones"") as Will's parents who are constantly worried about him and his safety, Stephen Peacocke as Will's nurse, Nathan, Matthew Lewis (Hello, Neville Longbottom) as Lou's boyfriend who is completely uncomfortable about Lou's job, Brendan Coyle and Samantha Spiro as Lou's parents and there's also a really funny cameo from the ""absolutely fabulous"" Joanna Lumley. Credit must be given to Jojo Moyes, who adapted her terrific book to the screen (she also wrote the sequel book ""After You"") with some witty dialogue, tender emotion and sometimes dealing with real themes, although it's not as deep as the book. ""Me Before You"" is a simple story, sure. But while it probably won't be in my top 5 of the best love stories ever, I still found it to be in the same old tradition of tearjerkers, the one where you laugh, you cry and you'll come out feeling good. By the way, it's a lot better than ""The Choice"".",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good enough to recommend it,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Me Before You"" (2016) was a nice mix between romantic room-com and some comedy. But on its core its a bit formulaic romantic movie, one you have seen before even watching ""Me Before You"". Yet actors are so good looking that this movie does its job for one evening - it keeps you entertained. Yet the story here is a bit less predictable this time despite the storytelling being predictable - hope this make sense. Emilia Clarke gives that ""hard to take your eyes off"" kind of performances. Its not that it great - it is not, yet there is a charming sense of inosence that keeps you involved into this character.Overall, ""Me Before You"" has descent enough story and great looking actors to keep you entertained for 1 h 40 min.

Misrepresentation of spinal cord injury - review has spoilers,I urge anyone who has or knows someone who has suffered spinal cord injury to not watch this movie. It is accurate maybe 30 years ago but not today. Though true that spinal cord injury does not have a cure it is NOT a death sentence for everyone and would not have been for a man of WillTraynors injury or income. The one factual thing in the movie was made a joke and that is Clarks boyfriend recommending exercise and rehab. It's not funny I'm worried folks with injuries will see this and relate to his negative attitude and that's unfortunate. It's hard but not impossible or even boring to live with spinal cord injury. And you can have a family the movie doesn't rule this out directly but hints at its impossibilities which is wrong wrong wrong.,,Anonymous,Romance
Realistic,"I did not read the book. When I saw the trailer, I thought the movie was going to be boring, but I was wrong. To regard it as ""one of the best romantic films of its time"" is a mistake, but to say that it is bad is not exactly right either. While there isn't something breathtakingly new about the film, I could, however, easily recommend it to someone who's tired of watching films with endings which only aim to satisfy most of the audience's desire.One quirk of Emilia Clarke that kind of distracted me with her acting is her overly expressive eyebrows. She is beautiful and lovely, no doubt about that. But her eyebrows stole the show in some scenes from time to time. I'm not entirely sure either if it was meant to be that way, but the wardrobe they had for Lou (Emilia Clarke) was terrible. I mean I get that her choice of clothes was supposed to make a statement about her personality, yet I was hoping for them to achieve that without making the character look silly.With regard to the ending, others find it ironic that Will (Sam Claflin) is instructing Lou to do something that he himself intends to defy. But what I think these people fail to realize is that Will and Lou's life conditions are not the same. The challenge Lou faces in her life is not on par with the difficulty being suffered by Will. I believe the lesson to be learned from Me Before You* is to do something significant with your life. And if you pay close attention to what happened in the ending, you will see that both characters were able to accomplish just that.*Better than ""The Fault in Our Stars""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful, Heartbreaking, Amazing","This story shows us what love truly is and makes us want to me more like the characters in the story. It shows us that to love someone is more than their appearance and more than what their ""disabilities"" are. It shows that love is when we care about someone so much that when we have to let go it takes makes every single part of us hurt, but we still let them go because we love them. Jojo Moyes is also known for the trilogy to this book, the movie ""Head Full of Honey"", and coming out with her new movie, ""Last Letter from Your Lover"". This movie is sort of similar to ""The Notebook"" or ""The Fault in Our Stars"". It is also sort of similar to the new movie ""The Upside"", however, this story is its own. I think that older teenagers to adults should watch this movie. It has a great story line that sometimes requires a little bit of reading between the lines and having a little bit of background information. I also would recommend reading the book and then watching the movie because the book adds a little more information that sometimes isn't explained in the movie so then by the time you do watch the movie it makes more sense.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

So many other similar films just do not come off with the level of care this one does. It's only 110 minutes long but plays longer, but none of it seems forced or protracted.

In addition, Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin give us a moving performance during the whole film. The plot is something that I had never seen before and it's something very serious.

Really? It was completely the opposite! Everyone wanted Will to live, but he didn't want to. The movie really made me think about how I would feel in the same situation. I totally understand how Will feels. I can't imagine living like that. But at the same time, I'm not sure I would want to die either. The point is, this is Will's decision. What will he decide? How will the other's react to his decision? Can they change his mind or can they live with it if he doesn't?What really irks me is the whole ""politically correct"" aspect of folks these days. What? A movie isn't allowed to show a disabled person who doesn't want to live? All movies showing severely disabled people must show them 'happy"" at the end with their predicament? This isn't a commentary on what makes a life worthwhile. This is a movie about one particular man who can't imagine living like that.

Not so cliche after all,"There were a series of romantic stories where I came from called three-room dramas, i.e. storylines following living, bedroom and dinning rooms. So I intentionally avoid watching such movies. However, this one stroked different tunes. I am not against it and actually enjoy it.It is a Cinderella story which undoubtedly inhabits minds of young girls since the dawn of civilization but in a unconventional way. It typically starts with the wealthy, handsome young male meeting with a simple-minded, fairly good looking struggling female coincidentally. Of course, this white knight with shinning armors had to rescue the supposing Cinderella eventually. This one is no difference. Nevertheless, this white knight was not with her physically but spiritually in the end. Also, Cinderella indeed tried to rescue him instead but failed to prevail. The writer did so unorthodoxly instead the version of them getting married and living happily ever after which might be preferred by some audience. In my opinion, it indeed kept the integrity of Cinderella story cleverly . The white knight even in the wheel chair in this movie had to rescue the girl. That is the essence of Cinderella tale.It's a warm and enjoyable movie. It also slightly touched the base of assistance suicide. I am not totally on board with it.

Amazing film,"Recently released out , Me before you , film adaptation by Thea Sharrock of Jojo Moyes book became really popular these last few months. At first sight, the cast seemed interesting, and the trailer looked like a typical dramatic love story we are all used to see. Hopefully, I was wrong about that because it was really different and I recommend you to go watch it if you haven't done it yet.The story takes place in England in a small and peaceful town. Louisa Clarke, 26 years old, works at the coffee shop to help her parents financially but when she looses her job, she needs to find a new one as soon as possible. After going to the job center, she is proposed to work for the Traynor's quadriplegic son, William Traynor. A job she struggles with because of his bad temper. The situation gets better when they learn to know each other, and the colorful Louisa becomes the only thing he lives for. But...a big decision changes everything.Sam Claffin and Emilia Clarke, both well know for big roles have been well chosen to embody the mains characters. I seriously couldn't imagine it could be someone else instead of them. They convey so much emotion I couldn't stop watching and I felt like if I was with them in the film. During the whole film, they made me laugh, because it's not only a drama like I thought, they have a really funny relationship.The landscapes and decors in the film are really impressing. I particularly liked the scenery around the castle and also the island where they spent their holidays.If you like romance and funny movies, I recommend you to watch the film.

The Mother of Dragon's goofiness save the day,"Romantic dramedies of this sort rise or fall depending on the chemistry of the couple. It is a foregone conclusion they would fall in love but they will have to earn the right to fall into each other's arms. There is no need to give me new twists to the familiar turns; just sell the couple to me and hopefully make me tear up at the end. On that note, Me Before You scores beautifully.I love watching Emilia Clarke, the Mother of Dragons. Her goofiness, all-out spunk, total honesty, awkward behavior and gaudy sense of fashion lift the chick flick slightly higher than it deserves. It took me 10 seconds and suddenly I don't see the Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Breaker of Chains and the Mother of Dragons. I couldn't take my eyes off her twitching eyebrows which have a life of their own. Sam Calflin plays his character with the right amount of sarcasm and levity; he is believable as a quadriplegic, a man who knows he couldn't ever be the same man again. Both of them turned in authentic performances.The story goes through the usual paces and there really weren't any surprises, but who cares. The theme of euthanasia wasn't handled with a searing depth, but the theme of living life to the best of your ability rings true. Yeah...

Vile.,"As a guy with a disability, this movie genuinely appalled me with its tone deaf portrayals, considering the basic premise reads as ""bitter disabled guy is extremely bitter about being disabled because now his life is worthless & no longer worth living... Until he finds an able bodied saviour to rely upon in order to make him happy.""Like, you know what... Can we please cut the crap & desist depicting individuals with disabilities as dependent? We're not broken & we don't require fixing, both emotionally or physically. We should be allowed to exist without out of touch celebrities sensationalising our lives in some voyeuristic, perverse feature length project that was CLEARLY created by people who didn't bother to do any research. Thus, they carelessly play in to harmful stereotypes, passing off blatant discrimination / offensive lines of dialogue as ""harmless banter"".Maybe it is to them but other men & women in the real world have to live with the consequences of this shambolic, shamelessly ill informed, ableist propaganda... So the fact that they're evidently unbothered only reaffirms the observable conclusion that they're very privileged & thus, since they don't personally experience the ramifications caused by inadequate representation, they're manifestly ill suited to the task of tackling it properly.I'd go in to further detail but quite frankly, other contributors have already articulated the problems far more coherently than I ever could & the film's not worth my time, nor the investment of energy.Shame on Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Jenna Coleman, Charles Dance, Dianne Morgan, Joanna Lumley etc. For partaking in this crap-fest of infuriating ignorance. Disappointed to see them endorse such an insulting message with their involvement. Do better, because this is disgustingly negative representation.P. S.

"Wow, how different from Game of Thrones!","Emilia Clarke is cute and totally lovable in this film, portraying a quirky character who is all heart.And I can understand why girls might swoon over Sam Claflin, even when (SPOILER ALERTS) wheelchair bound.Despite the tragic background, this is a delightful film that, while raising very serious issues, focuses on the personalities and how they interact. The result is often very funny, but also very moving.Consequently, I am saddened by the reaction of some people, but it also helps me to understand the Trumpist backlash against the 'thought police' in American society. Because unfortunately there are some people who are not content to allow others to watch a film and form their own opinions about the issues portrayed. They want to tell them how to feel and how to think and it is heretical if the film allows the viewers to come to conclusions that may differ from their own. If the film does not specifically embrace their own views and values then they will try to harm it at the box office by driving people away through their rabid criticism.Fortunately, this film is way above that putrid level and can be enjoyed both as entertainment (comedy, drama & romance) and for the meaningful questions about life that it raises. I found it comparable to ""Whose Life Is It Anyway"" and even better than ""The Intouchables"".",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Deserves to be seen,"I have not read the best-selling romantic novel ""Me Before You"" by English author Jojo Moyes but I have to assume that the film adaptation of the same name is faithful to the original story since the script was written by the author herself. Some might regard it as a female movie since, as well as a woman scriptwriter, we have Thea Sharrock in her debut role as a film director. Certainly there are elements of ""Bridget's Jones' Diary"" and ""Love Actually"", but ""Me Before You"" has a harder edge and a tearful ending.It is a very British story in that in it is shot in some quintessentially British locations (most notably Pembroke Castle in Wales) and it involves class - Lou Clark (played by ""Games Of Thrones"" star Emilia Clark) is a young woman from a distinctly working class home with limited knowledge and experience, while Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) is from an upper middle class background and has had a stellar business career. But unusually it is a story about disability, since Will is a quadriplegic following a traffic accident and Lou is his carer. She is reluctant to take on a role for which she has no relevant experience and he is even more reluctant to have someone hired essentially to bath him in her huge smile.The film has been criticised by disability campaign groups for what is claimed to be an unfair and unhelpful position on disability, but really Moyes is not presenting a moral stance on severe disability in general, but one possible outcome in one particular fictional story. The stars are very engaging (especially Clarke in Manic Pixie Dream Girl mode) and there is humour as well as sadness in a work that I feel deserves to be seen.",,Anonymous,Romance
Taking control,"I haven't read the novel this is based on, but as with anyone else, I could also tell where this was heading. It's not really hard to tell, so it's not about the finish line itself, rather than how we get there. And it's a pretty entertaining (while also sad) movie experience. If you let yourself into the romantic world, that is cliché ridden to quite some extent.Also some paper thin characters and two people who desperately needed each other, even without knowing that (we knew, but you know I'm talking about). So while one has a partner, that does not seem to be a big obstacle. Especially when that person isn't the one. Ah, the simple structures hidden in very tragic events and personal stories. But this has a certain suave to it, because of the main actors who really do carry this, although it doesn't have too much to ride on. If you are into these kinds of movies, you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll have a movie watching experience you were yearning for.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Me Before You occasionally paralyses itself with romantic clichés but bravely tackles a controversial subject.,"As someone who does not actively seek out soppy romances (mostly because I like to live in solitude), I found this quirky British love story to be sweet and endearing. It frequently immobilises itself with eye rolling moments, however once the prickly subject of euthanasia takes hold of the script, it drives itself to the finish line (with a tear or two maybe...). Louisa, a young woman desperately looking for a job, becomes the carer of a stubborn quadriplegic. Initially a salty meanie who relishes in his own self-pity, her eccentric personality soon starts to win him over.So, if you've ever seen 'The Untouchables', you'll notice this film plays out almost identically to start with. Two strangers from different backgrounds forming a close bond after spending plenty of time together. It's a rather predictable affair, with this script struggling to inject any sense of heart during the first half. Clarke was wobbly as she forces this eccentric personality by wearing odd fashion choices, constantly babbling and trying her hardest to come across as awkward. The consistent use of Ed Sheehan songs and other romantic pop tracks made the film feel cheap and disposable, appealing to the demographic of radio-listening mums.But then something happened. About halfway through, it dawned on me that this may not have the happy ending I predicted. Euthanasia makes it way to the forefront and surprisingly packs an emotional punch. Clarke and Claflin begin to exhume believable chemistry and I found myself falling in love with them. Don't get me wrong, the script still has many stumbling blocks and overextends it's sentimentality, consequently leading to melodrama. However the film remains sweet throughout, and I appreciate the direction it took whilst adhering to its source material. You understand both Louisa and Will's perspectives on life, without the film forcing this upon you. Also shout out to Lumley who literally only has one minute of screen time (worth it!).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I dare anyone to give me any other reason why they chose to see the movie. Either it was Khaleesi or maybe Dr. Who's companion that drew you to watch it. It certainly weren't the 5 seconds of screen time that Charles Dance had and it wasn't the age old story of the poor girl that falls in love with the quadriplegic prince.While the film ends on a bitter sweet note, I didn't find it terribly entertaining, while the characters had an infantile morality that made me unable to relate to any of them.

for the hanky-loving crowd,"Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't enjoy a good cry in a dark movie theatre? The first feature film from director Thea Sharrock is taken directly from the tear-jerker novel by Jojo Meyes (who also wrote the screenplay). Although I try to avoid using the term very often, it's very much a by-the-numbers chick flick  complete with the heart-of-gold working class girl trying her best to ""save"" the handsome rich guy to whom life has dealt a tough hand. For fans of the book and the genre, it should deliver the desired effect  the studio even provided movie logo tissues for the screening.For most of us, the effectiveness of this type of movie comes down to the characters. Luisa is the effervescent working class girl hired as a personal assistant to the extremely wealthy quadriplegic Will Traynor. Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") does everything in her power to make us (and Will Traynor) like Luisa. To describe her as optimistic is like saying Eric Clapton can play guitar. Calling her perky would be like saying Donald Trump has hair. Both statements are true, but hardly capture the totality of reality. In stark contrast, Sam Claflin (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay) purposefully underplays Will  the one time cliff-diving, James Bond birthday video type now confined to a wheelchair.Lu is a constant toothy smile complemented by expressive and active eyebrows that somehow overshadow her chatty bedside manner, and kaleidoscopic and geometric clothes and shoes  all encompassed with an ever-bouncy step that would make Tigger envious. Lu mostly shares the screen with Will and the personal nurse and therapist Nathan, played by Stephen Peacocke. The camera certainly loves all three of these faces, and director Sharrock wisely adds Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents. They bring a regal presence to what otherwise could have played a bit too cutesy.Despite the heavy dose of ""awww"", the story deserves credit for touching on the ""right to die"" or ""dying with dignity"" debate. While those closest to Will selfishly proclaim they don't understand his plan to head to Switzerland, it's Nathan who says it best  'who am I to judge'. While a full on discussion of the topic would be out of place here, the film does a nice job of not shying away from the process.Other recognizable faces in the cast include Jenna Coleman (""Doctor Who"") as Lu's sister and confidante, and Matthew Lewis (Harry Potter series) as Lu's fitness freak boyfriend who isn't very understanding  of either Lu or her job. There's also an odd but welcome wedding cameo from Joanna Lumley. My biggest issue with the story is that I just never understood how or when Lu fell so deeply in love with Will. Sure, I get the appeal of the castle, the concertos, and the tropical vacations, but where was the real personal connection? Was it simply that she thought she could charm Will into changing his mind on the big decision? That's not really love. Another piece that's difficult to take  the numerous musical interludes seemingly designed to make sure viewers are in the proper state of melancholy. There was another segment that I found not just ironic, but actually annoying; however, discussion of the ""Live boldly"" advice would give away the film's ending  something I'm not sure even matters since it's made pretty clear throughout, but it still goes against my movie code.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great landscapes, but typical story","Having read the book before knowing there was a movie coming out about it, I knew the whole plot. And knowing the whole plot made this film unexciting to watch for me. I just didn't feel like it was anything special. It might also be because of the story itself. I've outgrown romantic comedies, and though this does have a ending that isn't usually in romantic comedies, it still progressed as one.The characters are typical and not that interesting. Though having said that, Clarke as Louisa does a good job of bringing out her character's quirky and bubbly personality. Clafin's character on the other hand, is your typical rich boy with lots of baggage, and it's up to the girl to make the boy whole again. Not my cup of tea. Also, movies like these perpetuate the idea that boys and girls cannot remain in a platonic relationship if they are in close proximity to each other.While the characters are typical, the acting did the film justice enough. The characters were brought to life, and there is good chemistry between Clarke and Clafin, although it was somewhat awkward.The cinematography is well done, as it does a good job of showing the landscapes in the area. The sweeping and aerial shots of the castle gives audiences the impression of how big the space actually is. Also, wide shots of cities like Paris, is nicely done. However, I did not like the many close-up shots of the characters. I felt too close and intrusive.I'm not sure why people cried while watching this. OK, I mean I am quite detached from emotion when watching things, but I did not feel that there was much emotional buildup. Could have just been me. Overall, this is a well made film, but was a little boring to me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Thankfully Unafraid to be Tragic,"Me Before You was quite a surprise. Going in, I expected that familiar romantic comedy where cute folks fall in & out of love, until the eventual happy ending. With author Jojo Moyes' screenplay however, the film delivers a mature storyline with enough emotional depth to hold interest. Jojo achieves this by staying true to the source material that focuses on one character's veritable reaction to disability, & the affectionate resistance of those around him. The result is then a somewhat a beautiful tragedy, & it was both moving & thought-provoking.On the acting piece, Sam Claflin leads with a convincing performance. He conveys inner conflict & struggle, even in the film's brightest moments, justifying his harrowing decision. Emilia Clarke on the hand, drew my ire. Despite having alluring chemistry with Claflin, her cinematic facial expressions was an annoyance. Happily, the supporting cast of Janet McTeer, Charles Dance & Neville Longbottom drowns out this nuisance, with amusing to stellar portrayals.Me Before You then, deserves praise for two things: a strong cast & a premise that touches on a sensitive matter, told with a great deal of authenticity & truth, discomforting as it may be.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

But this movie left out a huge and very important information, that gives a whole new level to the relationship of Lou and Will. Now the movie's lesson is that if you have money, you can leave your comfort zone - While the book showed, how a young and healthy woman can be more ""paralyzed"" (by her fear) than a man with quadriplegia.

A tearful film about how we choose to live,"Emilia Clarke (Louisa ""Lou"" Clark) and Sam Claflin (Will Traynor) star together in a romantic drama about a bright and cheery woman who takes care of a quadriplegic former business man. The film investigates the topic of quality of life, and how we choose to live... not just from the perspective of Will's failing body, but also from the self imposed limitations Lou has placed on her worldview.The film quickly becomes a story about the choice of a young person in severely failing health to legally end his own life. Promising his parents 6 months of life after they initially refuse to help him, Will meets Lou. After discovering his plan, Lou tries everything to try to convince him to live.This film provides no answers. Rather it shows terrible impact of illness on quality of life, and the terrible impact a choice like euthanasia has on one's loved ones. As Will's body is failing, he is also helping Lou to understand what the ""quality of her life"" can be, helping her to explore her potential outside of the small town where she has lived somewhat limited by fear of new experiences.A moving investigation of what it means to live. I think it helps us all to ask the question of ourselves: ""How do I want to live?"" ... or perhaps if our life is naturally very close to it's conclusion: ""How do I want to die?""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
As syrupy and watchable as they can get but I still have problems with the underlying message,"No disclosure of the ending/spoiler, but just to say I think some people (like me) will probably have problems with what is the essential underlying message of this film (which is what brings my rating down from a 7 or 8). These ratings would be justified purely on the basis of the acting (particularly the female lead who easily 'steals the show') (while the other main roles are also occupied well too) and the gorgeous location filming plus great sound track. If you want to enjoy these aspects and view a classic modern 'weepie' (without going too much into what the ending of the film seems to me really to imply), then this is definitely one you will enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I watched this movie for the first time soon after it released. And I don't remember how many times I have seen this movie since then. In my brightest and in my saddest moment of my life this movie kept me going. It gave me hope, hope to live, hope to dream, hope to love. When I am watching this today for the millionth of time, I am still crying just like the first time I cried watching this.
This movie taught me how love should be and taught me to not expect impossible things from love, life.
Remember the dancing scene at Alicia's wedding where Lou and Will talk and laugh about how if things were different there wasn't any chance for them knowing each other and being friends. That is the most beautiful scene I have ever watched. That taught me love is honesty. Love is accepting people in their truest self and doing every possible thing to make them happy. Love is believing in time when they might not be together but everything will still be going beautifully for the other person.
Every scene in this movie is a pleasure to my eye. Every dialogue is more beautiful than the previous one. And @emilia_clarke is so phenomenal it's hard to not laugh when she laughs and cry when she cries. And.... Sam Claflin!

An adorable rom-com,"In the very light romantic comedy, young and quirky Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke) moves from one job to the next to help her family make ends meet. Her cheerful attitude is put to the test when she becomes a caregiver for Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), a wealthy young banker left paralyzed from an accident two years earlier. Will's cynical outlook starts to change when Louisa shows him that life is worth living. As their bond deepens, their lives and hearts change in ways neither one could have imagined.The idea of the movie is pretty traditional and has been made many times all around the world. Just another basic ""falling in love with a hopelessly sick person and trying to make what's left of their life worth living"" kind of movie. It doesn't really stand out between other movies of the same kind, but a people who love romantic/emotional movies would definitely enjoy. I really liked the visuals especially the color grading. Emilia Clarke (who plays Louisa Clarke) is a really great actress, but personally, I dont quite like her. However, she does a really good job in her role in this movie.The build up in their relationship was more than perfect although it was a bit rushed. The movie focused on Will's bitter character more than his love story with Lou, so it does get emotional but it doesn't last long to let the viewer feel emotionally attached to what is happening. Even though the ending might have been expected to some, it was very emotional and sheds the light on the struggles of handicapped people and the people around them. The movie was a little monotonous in some parts. The transitions between scenes seemed like the scene was just cut. Also, the music should have been a bit more special considering it's an emotional romance movie.Score:7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of my favorite movies,"I loved this movie — so much so, that I've watched it five times so far!I am usually very critical of movies, but not this one. It is a bit formulaic at times, but I think the director also shows a great deal of restraint. For example, Will Traynor's mother and father (Janet McTeer and Charles Dance) start out as caricatures of British aristocrats — stuffy, aloof, unfeeling, even a bit mean. But as the movie progresses, you see them more and more as human beings with deep feelings, and you see that they love each other and their son very much, and that they struggle to do the right thing by their son. They are also very kind to Louisa, and despite the class difference, they never betray the kind of snobbery you might expect to see in a less sophisticated treatment.There seems to be some criticism of Louisa Clarke (Emilia Clarke) as a Bridget Jones-type character — kind of silly, offbeat, ""chatty,"" and so on. I find her utterly charming. (But then I also find Bridget Jones utterly charming.) Louisa is a believable character and not one dimensional.I love the chemistry between Lou and Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). Will's transformation is not sudden. He actually is intrigued by Louisa from the get-go but doesn't realize it — he's too busy putting on his act and being sullen and angry and self-absorbed — so it's only when she snaps at him, that he begins to be pulled outside of his emotional bubble. It's actually shocking for him to see this other side of Lou — that she's not rigidly upbeat but is capable of anger — and so this moment triggers the start of a deeper connection.I think all the characters are well done, and the only character I found a bit cartoonish is the boyfriend, Patrick (Matthew Lewis).It's a beautiful movie, and I highly recommend it.

"A simple, adorable and colorful movie","Such an adorable movie. This movie gives a bittersweet emotion to all those who see it. Of course, Jojo Moyes penned an incredible story, and Thea Sharrock certainly did a great job in bringing that story to the screen. In my opinion, criticism of this film seems unnecessary. It features superb performances by talented actors and actresses, making it a remarkable movie. And a special focus and appreciation should be given to Emilia Clark for her amazing work with the eyebrows. And let's not even dive into her absolutely stunning smile. That smile. That damn smile.

Her broad smile and her coulourful clothes totally complicated each other.In the end I would just like to say that please don't listen to the critics and go watch the film. It's not like any other romantic story. Its more than that. It's fresh, colourful, exciting, heartwarming and full of love and laughter.

An emotional ride taking a serious subject a little too lightly,"I Went to the movies recently and saw Me Before You, the film based on the novel with the same name by the author Jojo Moyes. It is about the eccentric girl Louisa Clark who lives in an English village with her working class family. After getting fired from the small café she works in, she desperately accepts employment as a caretaker of the paralyzed young man Will Traynor. He is a wealthy ex business man who got paralyzed when he got hit by a motorcycle. Will is bitter and unpleasant towards everything and everyone around him. Me Before You is directed by the relatively unknown Thea Sharrock and this is her first feature film. Emilia Clarke, known from Game of Thrones plays Louisa and Sam Claflin, mostly known from The Hunger Games series, portrays the paralyzed Will.First I want to say that Me Before You is really a British film. Working class meet upper class, they clash and break down social barriers. I also think that Louisa is a pretty typical British ""film girl"". She wears extremely colorful clothes, is constantly happy, a bit weird and often quite oblivious to the serious situations around her. When she meets Will it is at first very tense, he mostly ignores her and she desperately wants to get out of there. They of course soon become attracted to each other because they really are each other's opposites. She is fascinated by his world, his personally and also in my opinion a bit by his disability. She in turn for him becomes a happy, clumsy and carefree girl like no one he ever met before in his organized and sterile world.The director Thea Sharrock relies very much on close-ups and reaction shots. This is good, and sometimes not so good. Too much close-ups on a face can easily remove the body language and also make us interpret every single facial expression as something very important. Sometimes we stay to long on Louisa's face. Her smile and her tilted gaze always seems to want to say something and I wonder if that really is what they were aiming for. However they succeed very well in a certain face shaving scene I consider as one of the best ones in the film.Me Before You is a very heavy film and touches a very sensitive subject that shall remain unknown because it is a major spoiler. I do think that the filmmakers take this too lightly and offer a very simple answer that in reality should be a lot more complicated. Also, the film doesn't go all the way and actually chicken out during what I believe was a very defining moment. A bit weak actually. But the film and especially the author should have credit for daring to speak about it. The overall impression is that they actually manage to finish the film in the way they planned. Our entire emotional register is played out during these barely two hours. We laugh, we get angry, confused and we cry. Not a dry eye in the theater. But for me to become more involved and drawn to the story, it would require more focus on the sensitive subject. Offer no direct answers, ask us the audience questions and let us sit by the end of the film with our heads filled with thoughts. That would according to me have given the film more depth. Also the clichés and the music would have to be toned down. The music was at times very bombastic and tiresome.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moyes & Sharrock Expel Romanticism In A Hard-Hitting Love Story,"Big expectations waited of the best-selling book adaptation of Jojo Moyes on the big screen, attributing it the label of dramatic film of the date, after the emotional ""The Fault in Our Stars"" broke hearts around the world; surely, you will require a box of tissues, nevertheless, the film does not provoke enough tears for utilize more than one.

Striking, cloying and sentimental plot, dispenser of laughs, tears and doctrines do not focused.""Me Before You"" does not get away of the habitual absurdities of a romance novel, perfect for lovers of the genre, but tedious and repetitive for the general public. Despite the exhausted use of romantic elements, Moyes, Neustadter and Weber know to place and represent every triviality harmoniously, the first kiss, Clark shaving to Will, a powerful storm behind the female lead role and even avoid some recurrences to innovate with own circumstances and phrases (Bumblebee Tights). Repeatedly, we have seen impossible loves owing the difference of social classes, and although the difference of status is present, the film is focused in another type of differences. The script fulfills the demands of any woman in love with chocolate and popcorn, nevertheless, objectively, it violates the real context with impossibilities and events of tales of fairy, hiding the suffering with the beauty, the reality with pink unicorns e hippopotamus, and until certain point is refreshing and requested for the genre, nevertheless, it is its sensitive subject in the ending, which be really affected by the strategy , and therefore, it affects the film in general.Thea Sharrock - writer and film and English theater director - follows the story of the book to the letter, neglecting necessary and original ideas. Who do you wish to listen to Ed Sheeran, while you are on the verge of tears? Pop music atmosphere is profound and even memorable (Not Today by Imagine Dragons), unfortunately, these are located in incorrect times, destabilising the balance and the process of the scene. Furthermore of its youthful soundtrack, the performances hold firm progress of the story, Clarke does not exaggerate her character, and if she does, it has satisfactory effects and thanks to her beautiful and infectious laughter, development gets a decent progress. Caflin is a bit more discreet and without Clarke as Lou, it would have been a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, it is the swift development of a controversial issue which absorbs the negative criticisms. In the plot, Will is decided to die with dignity, (Spoiler: and he did it), the film portrays the life of disabled people as ""different"" and in certain part it is, nevertheless, the lightness with that they deal the ending is as necessary as negative. Necessary, because they do not turn to the romantic drama of the path towards death, but negative, because they insinuates that the days of a disabled person are useless and the best solution is suicide. ""Me Before You"" has the function of telling a love story, the film did not want to meddle in dangerous waters, but, unfortunately, it did it.""Me Before You"" benefits from the chemistry of its protagonists, the idealized environments and some lines worthy of Spark, but the futility of euthanasia in the film, destroys the built and paves the way for finding some errors more.

The movie has heartwarming moments and is touching, but it didn't resonate with me on a deeper level.The supporting cast does a good job, especially Sam Claflin, who brings a quiet intensity to his role.

Me Bore You,"Is it just me, or are we all sick of the rich, handsome guy always wooing the girl with his wily charms, his full head of hair and an allowance that exceeds most people's rent? Granted in the case of Me Before You, the man in question is Will Traynor (Claflin), a quadriplegic with a death wish. If the movie was in the hands of people who actually knew a thing or two beyond weepy romantic tropes and clichés, they could have come up with something worthwhile. Unfortunately makers of this film seem to think that simply replacing Hugh Grant with a younger faster model and reciting the hackneyed romantic dramedy formula for the umpteenth time, makes for a unique experience; umm...nope.The film takes place in a quaint little country town in England and concerns the life Louisa Clark (Clarke). She's a bit of a flake but amiable enough to follow around for two hours, thus when she's left unemployed we feel her exhilaration when she manages to stumble into a job as a professional caretaker. She then meets Will, the local blue-blood who after a tragic accident is in no mood for friends and family, let alone a person who's pretty much hired to be his friend. Oh yeah, Will also has a nurse (Peacocke) thus guaranteeing that the messy realities of having to take care of a severely handicapped person is left off screen. After the first half-hour to forty-five minutes the pair grow acquainted all while the audience sits patiently, waiting for the actual plot to kick in.When it finally does kick in, the story devolves from being harmlessly, predictably enjoyable to being a contrived travelogue/bucket list that feels less tethered to the story than an attempt by director Thea Sharrock to visit exotic locales. The message of the film: ""live boldly"" and ""follow your dreams"" are laudable ideas, thus the film repeats them either visually or comes right out and says them again and again just in case you missed them. Personally I found such lofty ambitions a little hard to swallow coming from a man who inherited a private jet. Meanwhile the personification of those same ideas; the obligatory rival played by Matthew Lewis is the dimwitted pack animal to the story's muleskinner.For their efforts both Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke do a good job filling their roles as Lovebird #1 and Lovebird #2. Clarke especially has a certain way about her that can emit pure giddiness without trying too hard. Too bad her character is stripped for parts by the story and deprived of her very agency and character growth by virtue of an expense account. If anything, Me Before You is confirmation that the young ingénue can have a successful career beyond Game of Thrones (2011-Present).For the sake of filling seats Claflin does well based solely on the power of his chiseled cleft chin and naturally toned physique. He's the dreamboat genre fans have been clamoring for ever since Dylan McDermott and Patrick Dempsey became too old to play leading men. But lest you think his casting decision is a shallow attempt to placate fans while undercutting the character's handicap, he does sport a beard and a nasty flop sweat on more than one occasion to insure he doesn't always look like Superman.No matter how you slice it, Me Before You is a predictable and boring film that wears its cutesiness like a badge of honor in the hopes that no one notices our leading lady doesn't evolve and our leading man doesn't know how good he's got it. It adheres to an old formula with little regard for changing tastes and it's one attempt at uniqueness is treated more like a plot device than a genuine attempt at characterization. If that's what you're looking for in a movie, take a stab at Me Before You. Frankly I think it should have been titled Me Bore You.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Smart Emilia taking care of a guy or touching love in difficult conditions,"Melodrama. A film adaptation of the novel of the same name by the famous English writer Giorgio Moyes, known for her love affairs, she also made the script here, which pleases. I am sure that there are differences from the book, but I will have no desire to familiarize myself with the original source, therefore I will consider the picture as an independent work. So, Emilia, for the sake of you, I decided to watch - and it was definitely worth it. And here is my brief opinion - touching love in difficult conditions. I want to note that I did not find any minuses in the picture, although I watched it very carefully, trying to notice every detail, therefore I intend to dwell on the advantages of this film adaptation and at one serious point that it raises.
So here they are:
1. Outfits of Emilia - this was told to me by a person who advised me on this picture (well, because of Emilia), so I was ready for anything - but the picture could surprise me. I thought that a red dress would be the height of the creators' ingenuity, but it was only a seed before the parade of dresses, swimwear, blouses and other things that awaited me when watching. Costumers really tried their best. The craziest ideas came to life on the screen - and that's good! I literally enjoyed every outfit of Emilia. However, what can a nearly thirty-year-old Russian guy living in the provinces know about fashion!
2. Love line - here it is the center around which history is formed. It would seem that everything is simple - a provincial girl becomes a servant of a young disabled person chained to a wheelchair. At first, there is antipathy between them, gradually turning into love, and the real one. I saw many love lines on the big screen, and in this regard it is very difficult to surprise me. This line was not surprising, but the actors really tried. Emilia and Sam did not portray love, but loved each other for real. There is no falsity between them. The actors did not care, and this is the most important thing! Viewers appreciated this, and a picture with a twenty-million budget was able to raise almost two hundred and ten million dollars worldwide. People cannot be fooled.
3. Music - it is calm, creates the right mood, namely, romantic, a little serene, but gradually it changes to hopeless, oppressive and sometimes desperate. There are no catchy melodies, but I will praise the composer for his good work.
4. Camera work - a castle, a small town, a luxurious house of a rich man, resorts and so on are shot at a high level. Sometimes I caught myself thinking that I admire the views more than I read the dialogues (I watched a picture in English with Russian subtitles in order to appreciate the original voices, which I'm very happy about).
5. Euthanasia - the picture raises this difficult topic and answers it herself. I do not pretend to be the ""chief moralist of All Russia"", but simply express my position on this matter. I perfectly understand both the supporters of this practice and its opponents. But, starting from my worldview and education, I believe that life is a gift from the Lord, and we have no right to interrupt it on our own, no matter how hard it is for us. The Lord knows when our time will come, but how we manage the time allotted to us is already on our conscience. The hero of the picture decided so, but it is his choice. By the way, it was precisely because of this that the picture was criticized at the time, saying that it was ""propaganda"" and everything that came out of here, both here and in the West. Let everyone determine their position on this issue independently. And yes, I judge the question from a philistine point of view, but I witnessed several heartbreaking events, which I will not discuss, for the memories are still very fresh.
A little about the main characters:
1. Louise Clark performed by Emilia Clark (sorry for the tautology, but I'm not to blame) - a simple modest girl, in view of the difficult financial situation, is a servant of a young disabled person chained to a stroller, not yet knowing how this will turn her life upside down. The difficulties that Louise is faced with are more relevant than ever, even now in Russia, apparently in the West, the situation is similar, therefore the heroine immediately attracts attention. Her modesty and decency are truly captivating, and her recklessness and sometimes easy pretense - fall in love. I already talked about outfits, but I repeat that they're not simply lovely! The acting is at a high level. I was glad that she didn't laugh wildly in the picture, otherwise I would just finish watching right at this moment. Emilia knows how to show off talent when she wants. Amy's whole pen!
2. William Trainor, played by Sam Klaflin, is a young man, the son of wealthy parents, whose life was suddenly overturned by a terrible catastrophe, as a result of which he became a wheelchair invalid, his former optimism and confidence disappeared somewhere, his taste for life lost its meaning until he Louise met, which made him feel alive again. Sam really pleased me, he showed a controversial hero fighting on the verge of life and death, love and despair, grief and happiness. I have not seen Sam in any picture, but he played just fine. Well done!
I was glad to see the powerful Charles Dance as the father of William.
As for the tearful moments, they exist, but they didn't make such a deep emotional impression on me as the picture ""Christmas for Two"" did. I can't do anything about it. I was open to this picture, there was no skepticism (unlike ""Voices from the stone"", where it turned out to be true) - but there is no effect. Of all three paintings, only ""Christmas for Two"" could knock out tears (and already three times in a row). Many wrote that the heroines of Emilia in both paintings are similar, I agree, but only half. ""See you"" I liked it, but I'm unlikely to review it. But I understand the audience, who simply adore her and love her - that's great.
As a result, we have an excellent melodrama about touching love in difficult conditions with wonderful acting by Emilia Clark and Sam Klaflin, atmospheric music and a raised, far ambiguous theme.

Emily Clarke over did it,"Don't get me wrong, this was a lovely film and I think for the most part did justice to Moyes' novel. That being said, although I thought Emily Clarke was a perfect fit for Louisa's character, she was just way too smiley and zealous it was often annoying. Also, I thought Vanessa Kirby was not the right pick to play the role of William's ex-girlfriend.

No. This was real love and pain.One of the most beautiful things about the movie is how they kind of hated each other in the beginning and their relationship developed by time. Became close friends and then things turned into love. Didn't just started out as lovers.And I love that they were never boyfriend-girlfriend because it wasn't necessary. They loved each other deeply. It's the way they love each other for me. They loved each other not because the other one was attractive, beautiful, smart, chatty, funny...

Well, JOJO MOYES, the author, beautifully writes the answer.
ME BEFORE YOU is one of my favourite movie. The number of times I saw this movie, I had tears in my eyes. Literally, it's a must watch. Let's move on to the review.LOU CLARK; the bumblebee leggings lover girl, knows many things. The footsteps between the bus stop to her home, the feeling of love, and all the sweet feelings she has. But what she doesn't know is that she might not love her boyfriend who is just self-concerned, and she lost her job and don't know what is coming to her in the near future. Where her life is taking her.
She is a determined, strong and caring girl with big dreams. When she lost her job, she saw an advertisement for nursing a patient who is paralyzed. LOU took this chance and made a funky entry in WILL's life. <3
What if the person in front of you was the person full of life, full of colours, full of joys? But the accident makes him a colourless, selfless person who is dependent on his Parents, and nurse. That is not the life he wanted. He did not want the life without his legs, he walks with. He LOVED his life. WILL Loved his life.Will suffers a traffic accident that leaves him paralyzed in a wheelchair. Will has given up on ever living a fulfilling life again and wants his parents, Camilla and Steven Traynor, to allow him to go through with assisted suicide.WILL is the character without hope, the accident made him so. His girlfriend left him and married his friend. But After LOU, life was not the same. not as before but better.LOU, this character made me feel that one person can change your life and has the ability to make you realise that life is a gift. You have to celebrate each and every moment of life.
Life is not given to you to live like a normal person. I guess it demands some craziness, love, celebration, taking care, adventures & Thrill. To compete with your problem is it really courageous and brave and it is the real LIFE is all about.I am going to add the last part of the letter, WILL wrote to LOU. And seriously, this letter has my heart and these words have given me hope and courage.""You're going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too.

"""Me Before You: A Love Story with Familiar Tropes""","""Me Before You,"" while touching on poignant themes of love and life-altering decisions, falls short in delivering a truly remarkable cinematic experience. Emilia Clarke's portrayal of Louisa is endearing, injecting warmth into the narrative, yet the overall execution struggles to transcend the formulaic boundaries of the romantic drama genre. The chemistry between Clarke and Sam Claflin as Will is palpable, but the predictable plot trajectory dilutes the potential for genuine emotional resonance.The film's exploration of disability and its impact on relationships is commendable, shedding light on important societal issues. However, it occasionally veers into oversimplified depictions, missing opportunities for more nuanced storytelling. The pacing is uneven, with moments of genuine connection overshadowed by melodramatic sequences that feel contrived.Director Thea Sharrock's visual approach captures the picturesque landscapes effectively, but the cinematography lacks a distinct style that could elevate the film beyond its conventional narrative. The soundtrack, while pleasant, tends to rely on familiar emotional cues rather than enhancing the narrative depth.""Me Before You"" manages to elicit moments of genuine emotion, largely due to its charismatic leads, but its adherence to genre conventions prevents it from achieving greatness. While it may resonate with fans of romance, those seeking a more innovative and layered storytelling experience may find the film falling short of its potential.

"Will Traynor definitely has the wrong outlook on life,","'ME BEFORE YOU': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A rom-com/drama about a paralyzed former banker, that's planning to kill himself, who falls for his new caregiver. The movie stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin (as the two leads), and it costars Charles Dance, Janet McTeer, Steve Peacocke, Matthew Lewis, Brendan Coyle and Jenna Coleman. It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Thea Sharrock, and it was written by Jojo Moyes; adapted from her 2012 novel, of the same name. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, and some negative backlash from the disability rights movement (over what they perceive to be a very negative message about people with disabilities). Despite the negative controversy, the movie was a huge hit at the Box Office (making over $200 million worldwide). I do understand how some people could be offended by this film, but I also think it's a well made, and sometimes very touching, movie.Louisa Clark (Clarke) had worked for a local café, for six years, when she's unexpectedly laid off from it. Desperate to find work, she responds to a caregiver job opening; working for a wealthy family named the Traynors. Will Traynor (Claflin) was a successful banker, before he was paralyzed (two years earlier) in a motorcycle accident. He's now very cynical, and he's not very welcoming of Louisa's assistance. After some time though, the two begin to get along quite well; despite the fact that Louisa has a boyfriend (Lewis). When Louisa learns that Will is planning to kill himself, she tries to come up with a list of things for him to do; in order to make him love life again. Will feels like he's too much of a burden on others though, to keep on living, despite his strong feelings for Louisa.I definitely think that the Will Traynor character (in this film) has the wrong outlook on life; and his views definitely shouldn't be encouraged, or promoted (and it does seem like that's what the movie is kind of doing). So I understand why people are offended by this film; but if you look at it just as being the way that this specific character sees life though, than I think it's something that could possibly be overlooked. Despite this major flaw, the movie is very well made; the main characters (despite their flaws) are very likable, and the film is quite moving (at times). The two lead performances are both good, and it's great to see another strong female empowering role, like the one that Clarke plays, as the central character in a big movie like this. It's also nice to see both a talented woman director, as well as a gifted female screenwriter, behind a major film like this. It's just a shame that the movie has that one major flaw to it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautifully portrayed Human Love, Emotions & Values","First I start with Emilia Clark she is fantastic superb and funny in this whole movie. I think she did justice to this role and I am super glad that I watched this movie now this is my best movie ever. I feel good about this movie this is heartwarming. Yeah, the ending is not good but sometimes movies with sad endings are a good thing, I think so. Emilia Clark stands alone throughout the whole movie after the biggest and most popular show in the world Game of Thrones. I recommend this movie to people who love romantic drama movies and those who love Emilia Clark in The Game of Thrones as Daenerys Targaryen (the mother of dragons) her performance is outstanding and top-notch.Also, this movie's music is very calm and heart-melting When the music plays in the background the scene's impact doubles and it feels like something totally different feeling in this world that you can't explain.My Final Word: I love this movie Everything in this movie I love, I hope you love it too, Good Luck.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Changing one's fixed mind is not an easy task.,"Based on the novel of the same name, directed by a new lady filmmaker. This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.After a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.Anyway, the film avoids the usual cliché. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.On the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Gives important lessons of life.,"Me before you is an enchanting story of a maiden, bright and funny, and prince on a silver horse (pun intended).The characters are fleshed out pretty well and the chemistry between the protagonist is just at the spot and that what sells it. The plot uses comedic routines pretty flawlessly to carve out the chemistry. And one cannot complain about Emilie Clarke .Though the genre being of doomed romance, it lacked the depth. But, understandably adapting from book is never simple. Though i might be reciprocative to the idea the lack of consequence and impact of of her in his life is being hollowed out.However, the idea of moving the plot so fast and leaving the transitional six months seems bit unproductive.

"Polished, but misleading","I knew what this was about and how it was going to end. But I ill wanted to give it a try. I hoped that there could be showed different opinions, but instead I just watched movie based on emotions and egos.
The main thought of the story is that people need to repect other's decisions and just show love and support. And this idea isn't that bad. But the topic of illness is more serious than just a matter of choice.
I believe that every story gives viewers/readers ideas. Personally I like motivational stories that show road to success. While this story is quite depressing. I could compare ""Me before you"" with ""Million Dollar Baby"". Viewers remember how hard Hilary Swank tried her best that's why the ending was strong and touching. In ""Me before you"" I see no strength, only depression.
Because of that depresed main character it was also impossible for me to see romantic story here. He seems to be too deep inside his own world to show interest in others.
I think he wanted to return ""perfect"" himself. WHy do I think that there is no perfect life?
So, in the end, it's all a fiction story. Moreover, there is a sequal book. Just like 50 shades, right?
I read book based on REAL life.I recommend you to read Nich Vujicic books. No fiction there. Or watch Lorenzo's Oil

Moving yet light hearted in places,"23 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Me Before You. When quirky Lou Clark loses her job in a tea shop she is left desperate to get a new one to help support her family. Along comes the Traynor family. Will Traynor, a quadriplegic needs a carer although he doesn't think he wants one, at this point Lou comes into his world and turns it upside down. Will is set on ending his life, Lou discovers this and embarks on a scheme to make him change his mind. Adapted from a book (which I haven't read yet) we are introduced to two very different kinds of people, Will who yearns for the old life he lost and sees every day as an empty glass, and Lou who's bubbly personality and infectious smile lead her glass to not only be full, but positively overflowing. This is a story of hardship, and of hope and also introduces us to the ethical and very personal struggles of people not only considering assisted suicide but also the family and friends who have no say in the matter but want very much to get involved. It was a very emotional journey, there were many light hearted moments and a very fitting soundtrack.

"Sensitive, uplifting and funny, but also heart-breaking","This romantic film pulls all the heart-strings, and it is impossible not to respond enthusiastically to the overwhelming charm of the young actress Emilia Clarke, who infuses the entire film with her warmth, humour, and quirkiness. Apparently she is well known from GAME OF THRONES, but that kind of thing is 'not my scene' and I would never watch it. So for me this girl is one big delightful surprise. The film is a triumphant first feature film by director Thea Sharrock, best known for her affiliations with William Shakespeare and the wonderful Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London. She certainly has a big cinematic career ahead of her, because she has made a film which is so finely directed, sensitive, and well-balanced that any producer with a grain of sense must be chasing her now. The film is also the first written by, as well as based on a novel by, a woman quaintly named Jojo Moyes. It is difficult to imagine a man either writing or directing a film like this, so we are fortunate that women took over and made the movie. Even the producers were women. Well done, gals! Actress Janet McTeer is also excellent, as usual, having now become very much a 'national treasure'. And then there is Sam Claflin (his surname Claflin being a truncated form of the original McLaughlin, abbreviated by a forebear in America, where everything gets shortened). I have already praised Sam Claflin before, for his brilliant performance as the young Logan in the wonderful TV series ANY HUMAN HEART (2010, see my review). Here he is once again brilliant. All that talent in someone who can barely move! Yes, Claflin plays a man who is paralyzed in all his limbs after he is struck by a motorbike in the street. Since this is based on a romantic novel, it is necessary for Claflin to live in a huge castle, which he obligingly does. And it is equally necessary for Emilia Clarke to being a Cinderella figure, which she certainly is, with gusto. She is hired by Claflin's mother, Janet McTeer, to look after Claflin and try to cheer him up, as he sits daily in his electric wheelchair which he can operate with his one hand which has some capability of movement. Meanwhile he has resolved to go to Dignitas in Switzerland and end his life by monitored suicide, and the question arises as to whether Emilia Clarke can stop this, for she eventually falls in love with him. This is where things get difficult for me, because a very dear friend of mine went to Dignitas and allowed his suicide to be filmed for television. He only had two weeks left before his motor neurone disease would render him unable to make the trip, having delayed as long as he dared. His wife sat beside him while he drank the poison. I made a speech at his memorial service. These events are very painful, and tragedies of this kind are nothing to treat lightly. In this film, the matter is handled with great sensitivity, which was not an easy thing to do. I shall not reveal what happens about this in the story because one is not supposed to for IMDb. Also appearing in the film as Claflin's father is Charles Dance, who is very good as usual. I can rarely watch him without wincing slightly at my recollections of his ex-wife at Crickleaze trying to knock me out during her boxing practise in the middle of their drawing room. One takes risks sometimes visiting people and trying to be an obliging guest. This film too involves some risk for viewers, who may need a 'safe space', because of its 'beautiful sadness'. But it is a marvellous success, and a very fine film indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Worst Movie Ever,"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever watched. I don't know if I'm being overly critical due to having recently read the book, but I genuinely feel that this movie has got to be the worst book to movie adaptation.I thought that nearly every scene was over dramatized. Too much emotion where it is not needed.The relationships between several key characters were awkward, there was no chemistry between them. In particular the relationship between Lou and Will was terrible, I partially thought that maybe it was the actors that created the poor chemistry. Although I thought that individually their acting was brilliant and I love Emilia Clarke, but together they did just not work! In fact I was kind of embarrassed for them. Lou and Treena's relationship was also all wrong! Poor casting of Jenna Coleman as Treena.I was absolutely appalled by the errors in the story line. There were too many changes that effected the way that the characters are portrayed. Key ideas and events were often squeezed into the same sentence where in the book the same ideas were spread throughout. Some events were left out entirely. Multiple events were merged into one. Things that were done or said by a certain character were then said by a different character. And, there were characters missing all together!! Will's sister Georgie?? I appreciate that it is probably difficult to fit a whole book into the time of a movie but I feel that in this case it has been poorly done. Vital information is missing that would have been critical to character development and would have helped refine the whole movie!I had high hope for this movie after reading what turned out to be an absolute page turner of a book, but I have been left miserably disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

a beautifully sugar-coated but tragic story with a deep message that increasingly demands a societal response,"In movies, as in life, appearances can be deceptive. The trailer for Me Before You (2016) promises a sweet romantic comedy but the film is an emotionally challenging confrontation with the moral dilemmas of assisted dying. It is a beautifully sugar-coated but tragic story with a deep message that increasingly demands a societal response. Full of fairy-tale allusions, including a castle with a fallen prince and a poor girl in strange clothes, together with brilliant casting and tear-inducing imagery, the film is one of a growing number that address euthanasia themes.The storyline is simple. Working class girl Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) takes a six-month contract to be a carer for quadriplegic Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). He is under the guardianship of his wealthy parents who want a fresh bright face for Will, and Louisa is delightfully quirky, chatty and absolutely zany in her dress sense. Despite a fractious beginning, they soon become deeply attached as she learns of his plan to end his life in a Swiss euthanasia clinic within six months. In the time they have left and within the constraints of his condition, they do many of the things that young lovers do, including a tropical island holiday. The most painful part of this film is the absolutely finite nature of its impending finale and the respectful resolution shown in particular by Will's parents and the transformative effect this has on Louisa.Emilia Clarke's performance is the beating heart of this film. As Louisa, she is simply beyond gorgeous. Her face can speak volumes without opening her mouth while her eyebrows alone have a vocabulary spanning all human emotion. Will is her perfect match, with an expressiveness that glides seamlessly from brooding stoicism to irascible charm. No doubt many audiences will be happy to enjoy a bitter sweet love story told well, without dwelling on the deeper message of assisted dying. Others, however, will be struck by the force of three words that are repeated several times in the film, ""it's his choice"". They will grapple with how a person can reach such an unbearable point in their existence where they find absolutely no reason to live. As a tear-jerker rom-com, this film is right up there with the best of them but it is so much more than that. Sure, the narrative arc is laid bare right from the start, but sometimes you just have to let a movie have its way with you, as this one did with me.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved the book and the movie too!!!,"I had braced myself to expect the movie not to live up to the book. I was pleasantly surprised! The casting of the main characters was the best I have experienced in a film in many, many years. The screenplay is a seamless adaptation of the novel, keeping the focus on Lou and Will. The minor characters get enough exposure in the film to tell the story so that it all makes sense. Lou's quirky style of dress and personality was superb. While the performance may not receive a major acting award, it is nonetheless engaging and moving.The interplay between Will and Lou is balanced and nuanced. The ending will haunt me for sometime to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Real and fairy tale at the same time,"This was one of these movies that you find yourself trying to constantly remember that this is just a movie and that this is not happening in real life. Although this story is revolving around the serious injury of a person, it's really ""light"" in the beginning and it actually gets more than some laughs out of you.And I think that when everything climaxes towards the end, this is the reason why you feel even sadder. Clarke was awesome as was her co-protagonist. All the cast was brilliant if you ask me. The questions set forth by the movie and the morals that are ""promoted"" are irrelevant if you ask me. OK, it's always about living your life etc in movies like that. Doing things while you still can, not wasting time etc.But the thing that stuck with me in the end, is the feeling of this otherwise energetic young man, when he wakes every single day, having dreamed his life as it was before, just to realize that he's still in his bed, not able to walk, or take care of himself. I think that for me, that was the punch in the stomach. And with all this going on, to fall in love with a girl that embodies life itself, in such a unique way. His attitude and how he held together till the end, was the most touching part of the movie for me.The movie was brilliant.

I was a very very beautiful love story,"It's a very beautiful love story about the connections that people make over their lives. It's actually funny how the movie's premise is about how short life can be and that it should be lived to the fullest, yet it tells a story about how certain people can have an effect on you that can stay with you forever.And what I love especially about this movie is that it's not a traditional formulated love story that usually is spoon fed to the mainstream.I'll take a guess that a lot of that has to do with the star power of Emily Clarke in the lead role. I heard some people did not like the idea of her doing the role. I can see that. After all, she plays a strong female character on Game of Thrones. The movie gives more of a stereotype of what a strong female character is, especially for a Romance film, but Clarke is so good in it. She's just so cute and it's wonderful to see the energy she brings to the role on screen. Plus she had good chemistry with the guy from the Hunger Games films, so you can't beat that.I tell people I'm not a fan of Romantic films, but I did like what was going on here.

The film was an adaptation of a book written by Jojo Moyes with the exact same name, but i learned about the book after watching the movie.It´s a story about love of a two different people from English countryside. Louisa Clark ( Emilia Clarke) works in a local bistro and dated with Patrick, whom she probably doesn´t love. After losing her job at a local cafe, she got a job in the household of Traynors. She was supposed to be a companion and a caretaker of Will Traynor. Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) is a successful, young man who loved his life, but it quickly changed after a heavy traffic accident. He becomes paralyzed. Will´s mother was desperate, because will got depressed, and she couldn´t do anything on her own, so she tried to find caretakers who would help him and persuade him that life is worth living. After a few months full of crazy activities, they became good friends until love arose.Lou is funny, optimistic, kind and she wears crazy clothes. On the other side, Will´s character changed during the film. At the beginning of this story Will was depressed, cynical, but over time his character grow and he became really funny and sweet yet still calm and mysterious.They were like sun and moon, different, but they were meant to be together. In my opinion, this film is very romantic, funny and dramatic. I really liked it and I recommend it to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

How I feel about this movie,"I saw ""Me before You"" a few days ago and it was just amazing !! I adore watching love stories,with people who fall in love but their love is impossible... Emilia Clarke,in the movie : Louise or Lou is a young,beautiful woman and really scatty ! And then there is Will,he has been disabled since his last holidays.He don't laugh,smile but thanks to Lou,he discover what's love. I really love this movie,I'm really scatty too so I can see myself in the story as the main character Lou. I won't say the end of the movie but if you don't like crying don't watch..!Everyone want a wonderful and amazing love story with a good husband,flowers,sparkles in the eyes, butterflies in the stomach.When I was watching this movie I had a lot of emotions. It's incredible how movies can affect people. I love a lot of movies especially horror movie but ""Me Before You"" made me feel sad and happy at the same time !",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sad ending,"I watched it more than 6 times. Don't you believe it? The reason why I watch this movie because of the song of Ed- sheeran. I didn't think I'd love it so much. The movie has one ending but I try to find out another one by watching it many times. I think Im so stupid. I think you will buy the book when watching it or something crazy that you will search for the bumblebee tights.Clark,A few weeks will have passed by the time you read this (even given your newfound organizational skills, I doubt you will have made it to Paris before early September). I hope the coffee is good and strong and the croissants fresh and that the weather is still sunny enough to sit outside on one of those metallic chairs that never sit quite level on the pavement. It's not bad, the Marquis. The steak is also good, if you fancy coming back for lunch. And if you look down the road to your left you will hopefully see L'Artisan Parfumeur where, after you read this, you should go and try the scent called something like Papillons Extrême (can't quite remember). I always did think it would smell great on you.Okay, instructions over. There are a few things I wanted to say and would have told you in person, but a) you would have got all emotional and b) you wouldn't have let me say all this out loud. You always did talk too much.So here it is: the cheque you got in the initial envelope from Michael Lawler was not the full amount, but just a small gift, to help you through your first weeks of unemployment, and to get you to Paris.When you get back to England, take this letter to Michael in his London office and he will give you the relevant documents so you can access an account he has set up for me in your name. This account contains enough for you to buy somewhere nice to live and to pay for your degree course and your living expenses while you are in full- time education.My parents will have been told all about it. I hope that this, and Michael Lawler's legal work, will ensure there is as little fuss as possible.Clark, I can practically hear you starting to hyperventilate from here. Don't start panicking, or trying to give it away – it's not enough for you to sit on your arse for the rest of your life. But it should buy you your freedom, both from that claustrophobic little town we both call home, and from the kind of choices you have so far felt you had to make.I'm not giving the money to you because I want you to feel wistful, or indebted to me, or to feel that it's some kind of bloody memorial.I'm giving you this because there is not much that makes me happy any more, but you do.I am conscious that knowing me has caused you pain, and grief, and I hope that one day when you are less angry with me and less upset you will see not just that I could only have done the thing that I did, but also that this will help you live a really good life, a better life, than if you hadn't met me.You're going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. It always does feel strange to be knocked out of your comfort zone. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too. Your face when you came back from diving that time told me everything; there is a hunger in you, Clark. A fearlessness. You just buried it, like most people do.I'm not really telling you to jump off tall buildings, or swim with whales or anything (although I would secretly love to think you were), but to live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle. Wear those stripy legs with pride. And if you insist on settling down with some ridiculous bloke, make sure some of this is squirrelled away somewhere. Knowing you still have possibilities is a luxury. Knowing I might have given them to you has alleviated something for me.So this is it. You are scored on my heart, Clark. You were from the first day you walked in, with your ridiculous clothes and your bad jokes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing you felt. You changed my life so much more than this money will ever change yours.Don't think of me too often. I don't want to think of you getting all maudlin. Just live well.Justlive.Love,Will",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
unrealistic cotton candy,"For people who read the book, please ignore the movie. I definitely should have, but I was too curious. To the rest of you, ignore it as well. Read the book.First of all, this is a beautiful film. Beautiful people, beautiful scenery, Beautiful beautiful beautiful! There's just one problem, Will's life isn't so effing beautiful. Neither is Lou's. Where Jojo Moyes uses humor to lighten up the dark of Will's accident, the movie tries to gloss over everything! It made me sick. Lou is so cute, but annoyingly so. And I understand that Will is supposed to be handsome, but the character-developing is flat compared to the book, and the whole point of their acquaintance is lost!A major point in the book is excluded completely! It's one of the things that makes sense to Lou's character. Jojo Moyes books are quite realistic, in a sense, because of her character's flaws. It makes you relate. Unfortunately, this does not come across in the movie, and there goes the humor, as well. I had to force myself to finish this one, as it felt like the movie was strangling me with cotton candy.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Amazing and Fresh... Almost passed up this heart tugger.,"Emilia Clarke; WOW. In fact, the small but amazing cast was all the right fit.Not sure where or what the critics are barking about, the sweet, fresh story saddled up with the right cast, issues, plot, and what's going to happen next, is literally a perfect composure. The musical score is not just spot on, it's quite impressive! The film takes the stance of being in two difficult places, one from a quadriplegic and two, an endearing young British lady who just needs a job - but is as bubbly, cute, color and inexperienced as you could possibly be!The story here makes great sincerity and now, I really wonder if the book could be as good as what was depicted, shot and showed. Clarke's facial expressions are spot on and you clearly see the vastness of such a bright actress. She shows more in this film than in GOT and obviously in Terminator. In fact, she slimmed down so much and looks amazing that in this physical form, she fits the youthful and vibrant stance of the character to perfection with her bright smile.'Will Traynor' is played perfectly and you believe he is - a quad. His attitude is spot on not to mention it feels realistic no matter what your background may have been. Eloquently, the two become interested in each other and this is where the story becomes even richer as you wish for a certain outcome... Very well written if not one of THE best films I clearly was going to overlook. The critics are shamingly very wrong on this one. It'll darn near tear on your heart and the scenes and locations were the right fit. I'm struggling to find negatives to identify, but honestly, if there are, they're very far and in between as your mind stays with the plot and keeps you moving. Loved it. Completely loved it and I do NOT like 'endearing love' style of movies.There is a plot twist that shows itself midway and for a unique step, it challenges the writing. Well done; I praise the script and those that approved it. It'll leave you in a torn spot among movies in the past, for it truly moves the soul here. Simply, loved it. Cheers!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Something's off in this wannabe tear-jerker,"Featuring the strange proposition of The Mother of Dragons living a life where she cares for the tragically paralysed son of Tywin Lannister, Me Before You is 2016's attempt at becoming ""the big romantic hit"" as debut director Thea Sharrock adapts Jojo Moyes well liked book of the same name, which is in turn a rejigged version of the 2011 hit The Intouchables into a totally over the top and highly overdone romantic drama.In what's her highest profile gig outside of the 6 seasons of playing Game of Thrones beloved dragon mother, Brit star Emilia Clarke goes next level of loving life as the seemingly carefree and unflappable stocking loving Lou Clark who takes up the job of becoming a friend to The Hunger Games Sam Claflin's quadriplegic Will Traynor, that will in turn see the two fall tragically in love as Will contemplates ending his now unfortunately paralysed life.It's an intriguing idea, if not totally original and there's potential here for many tears, laughs and smiles but everything within Sharroack's film feels either forced, full of fakery or misjudged emotional manipulations as Clarke in particular suffers from her role in the film that allows her to go completely wild with her unfortunately annoying and coy Lou and it really does beg the question of how much of a career she may have outside of the GOT universe if she continues on in this fashion.Lou Clark may just be last year's most intolerable creation, as while we all love someone that sees the brighter side of life, this is something else entirely as Clarke and her eyebrows, over extended smile and genuine ADHD tendencies trample the films chances as Lou and Will's relationship turns from forced friendship to genuine love.Clarke needed to dial back her role especially as Claflin gives his all as Will (even if you've never seen a quadriplegics body looked quite this toned before) and while the film clearly connected with its ready-made target audience as evidenced by its respectable world-wide box office and audience ratings, it's unlikely that many will be remembering the hard fought romance of Lou Clark and Will Traynor as we'd remember the Noah and Allie's or Edward Lewis and Vivian Wards of the movie universe.A refreshingly kind spirited movie that just never connects emotionally or engages thanks to a so-so structure and a completely misguided female centrepiece, Me Before You will be a favourite to those that loved the movie before they even saw it but for the rest of us, this sappy, cringe-worthy and forgettable romance just doesn't cut the romantic mustard.2 fit Neville Longbottom's out of 5",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

I saw this movie on a rainy Tuesday with my good friend, and I was expecting to see any other ""chick flick"" but Me Before You took my breath away.

I could not tear my eyes away from the screen (okay maybe I did once to wipe the tears that were streaming down my face like a waterfall). The actors did an amazing job with their characters and the producers and director did an amazing job with the film. I think everyone should see this movie because it makes you not only appreciate life but it also makes you feel like you are apart of an even bigger world and makes you see things in a different light.

I loved it and hated it,"Me Before You tells the story of Lou Clark and Will Traynor. Lou has just gotten laid off from her job in a local coffee shop and is looking for a new job. She finds one as a caretaker for a disabled man, Will, at a local castle. Will has next to no movement or feeling from roughly the chest down after an accident that affected his spinal column and is rude, cynical and dismissive. Slowly Clark's slightly crazy nature and view on life melts Will's cynical heart and after a trip they are well and truly in love. I will stop my description of the plot here for fear of spoiling how it all ends, but I understand why it went the way it did and I wish I didn't and it didn't. It touches on something I have personal experience with and I believe that is why it affected me as it did. Even so I figure people can puzzle out what happens (it's not THAT surprising) by me saying that, but at least I'm not saying anything outright. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin play their parts both convincingly and beautifully and the story feels very much believable.

Great movie worth watching and finding life lessons within,"This is a movie that made me cry almost at the beginning when the protagonists have met. The girl is so kind that it makes me think of an angel. But there is nothing wrong with it since a movie is supposed to teach us the way we should be and what we dream of instead of who we really are... The movies and art in general teach us the best of who we were meant to be in the first place. It is a sad movie if we take it from the perspective we are used to look at life. But, if we are able to get beyond all the ""happy ever after"" and understand that life is just a passage in the most truthful way it is supposed to be seen we understand that the very concept of the movie is showing us the best we can do with our lives. Everything is meant to last just for a while and we should do the best with what we have... That's all life is about. If there is something after it it's just an unexpected prize or incentive.

But the biggest respect goes out to Sam Claflin, who seemed to effortlessly portrait the role of Will Traynor. Moving your arms around, or poses in general are quite a big thing when it comes to acting, but he could only move his head and still had to make sure that it was clear what he meant, using only his face. He deserves a lot more credit for that than he is getting. With this golden duo the movie can't be anything other than great. The only thing I would change is the ending.

And as someone who has recently struggled with severe depression I connected to it. I connected to that strange feeling of enjoying some of your time, laughing, enjoying a person you love and at the same time feel horrible. I saw my boyfriends reactions and pain in Clarkes reactions to his pain. I felt this movie. On the other hand, Sams performance was a revelation. I vaguely remember him from The Hunger Games, found him very boring and bland in it. But here, he shined. I believed him in his blank stares, happiness, pain. Not many actors pull that off for me. And of course Emilia's and Sam's relationship is great, they worked wonderfully together.It has problems of typical romance films, but the story that looms behind it, and pops out is very strong, and well done.

"Not my type of film, but moved mountains in me.","I don't usually go for this type of film, I'm a superhero film type of guy. But because the beautiful Emilia Clarke starred in it, I forced it onto my screen and boy I'm glad I did! Some people say bad things about Emilia Clarke and her acting, but yet again, unsurprisingly she was perfect. Through my heightened sense of empathy, I could imagine how a paralysed man would feel, and Sam Clafin performed the role to perfection. For a soppy romance movie, this was great. 8/10, it's missing two for the silly reason that it is a romance film, I rated The Flash a 10, so rating this 10 would go against my core values. In conclusion, even is this movie is not something you'd usually watch because of its genre, I'd give it a chance anyway, because...Emilia Clarke, even in her dorky dresses was absolutely sublime, and it's worth watching just because of her, well, it was my reason anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

When Love Isn't Enough : A Review of Me Before You,"The most heartbreaking movie of our time, Me Before You takes you to the saddest moments of your life. The film is set in the beautiful, quaint, and verdant town of Pembroke, United Kingdom. In this movie we follow Louisa ""Lou"" Clarke (played by Emelia Clarke), and William Traynor (played by Sam Claflin) on a journey of self discovery, love, and gut wrenching heartbreak. William, once a lively and very active man,was left a quadrapalegic after a terrible accident. Louisa, dealing with personal traumas of her own, takes a job as his caretaker; little do they both know they would become so much more to each other than either of them imagined.
The film's narrative touches on many tough areas, some of which spread throughout current and public social issues/debates, including the moral ambiguity of assisted suicide, a choice made by Will in the beginning of the film. The film also explores one's capacity for empathy and growth, and shows us that it is more important and impacting to fall in love with people's personalities and actions versus their physical abilities or attributes. The journey the audience takes with this charming couple as the film proceeds encourages laughter, wonderment, tears, and forces us to face and question ourselves when it comes to the heart of the film; ""what would you do for the ones you love?""
We follow Louisa on her journey to employment, after losing her job at a cafe, while encountering obstacles including her engaging but quirky choice in style, as well as her at times infuriating choice in romantic relationships, such as her boyfriend in the beginning of the film, Patrick (played by Matthew Lewis)who cares more about running and triathlons then his own girlfriend, leading to her introduction to Will Traynor, the handsome, witty, and at times cruel minded young man Louisa is employed to accompany as an in home nurse. While it quickly becomes apparent that Will's parents had a different idea of the role Louisa would fulfill for Will, Will and Louisa still manage to engage each other in ways that force them each to open themselves up to exploring both each other and the darker parts of themselves.
The audience begins to fall in love with the couple in much the same manner as they are falling in love with each other. Will Louisa's love be enough to change Will's mind? The audience may be thrown into a tear engaging heartbroken moment right along with Louisa. Being forced to explore this avenue makes us question within ourselves; whether we would be willing to do the same for someone we loved, someone who had already deemed themselves too far removed from this world and someone whom we would selfishly wish to stay even knowing there may be something better for them. Would I be able to watch a loved one go, and by their own choice/accord? And why is this option only available within certain countries while following certain parameters? Is love enough to save a life or is there more to life than that? The questions posed within this film and it's heart wrenching conclusion are ones that stay with us long after the film ends.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Me Before You,"I recently saw 《Me before you》by Thea Sharrock is a romantic drama film which was produced by New line Cinema/Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer/Sunswept Entertainment,and lasted 110 minutes. This movie is set in 2016 in the US.It tells the story of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin,played by Steve Peacocke/Jenna Coleman/Janet Mcteer/Charles Dance/Mathew Lewis/Emilia Clarke/Sam Claflin.The Story begins of Will Traynor, an energetic young man from the U.K. Will is a man who lives to the extreme, going off to exotic places, climbing Mounts. However, one day he suffered an accident when a motorcycle hits him before he got into a taxi. The accident left him quadriplegic; for two years, Will had to endure countless doctors appointments and suffers from constant pain. The accident cost him his girlfriend, his home (since it was not wheelchair accessible), and his old life. Tired of the pain he's going through, Will tells his parents that he would like an appointment with a doctor in Switzerland that would ensure the end of his pain. At first their parents are horrified and against the decision their son has decided on, but when he decides to take his own life, they ultimately agreed, if he gave them six more months. He accepted. Later, his mother hires a second caregiver to take care of Will when their primary caregiver is unavailable. Louisa Clark, a recently unemployed twenty-six-year old interviews for this job. Louisa had no experience in the care giving field, but she is a pleasant quirky human being and Camilla Traynor hopes that she would change Will's mind.Louisa was never informed that her job was to make sure that Will didn't kill himself, but she finds out after overhearing a conversation. She was devastated and decided to quit her job, but Camilla begs Louisa to return. She accepts on the one condition that if she's going to change Will's mind that it would affect his own health. Louisa later began thinking of ways to help Will have a great life in the world considering that he's a quadriplegic. She began by taking Will off on short outings and they also went on vacation to Mauritius. During their vacation, Louisa confessed that she was in love with Will and that they could have a life together. He said no and he assured her that he wasn't changing his mind about visiting the doctor in Switzerland. Devistated, Louisa left Will by himself on the beach. Louisa went back home and spent days locked in her room, days later she decides to go to Switzerland before Will kills himself. There Will tells Louisa that the past six months were the best in his life, but it wouldn't change his mind. Louisa kisses him and later Will Traynor is dead. Sometime later, Louisa sits at a table in Paris, where she reads a letter from her sister and then she holds on a letter written by Will. The letter had instructions that she had to visit a Parfumeur and that he left her some money in which she could use to make her life better. He hopes that she lives well; Louisa cries and gets up to fulfill Will's final wish. I Personally think it's very poignant film and very good casting . I Would recommend it because the acting is fascinating",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Emotional Masterpiece,"After losing her job at a local restaurant, Lou desperately seeks a job in order to support her family. Thus, she accepts to take care of a fully crippled young man who seems to have lost hope in life. Much sooner than expected, her job will be taken to the next level as she gets emotionally involved, but will it actually be enough to make a difference?It's a movie which left a big impression on me and I have to say this from the beginning. Its plot managed through its apparent simplicity to generate so much emotion that I was left breathless many times. It's so dramatic and romantic that it can fill you with you joy but also make your eyes water. It has such unique and charismatic characters that you simply cannot avoid caring for them. Everything they do and feel gets sent straight to you as you were part of the action, thus the emotion it generates is simply breathtaking. It manages to alternate drama, laughter and romance in such a way that I honestly haven't seen since ""The Fault in Our Stars"", another similar movie which I adore. You might find it a bit predictable from time to time, except its finale which is everything but predictable, but I can easily forgive this small flaw after seeing it as a whole.The actors it has are simply marvelous. They are able to impersonate their characters in such a way that they make you believe it's reality. Their charisma plays a very important role here, making themselves likeable and also making everything credible and as a result, more emotional and dramatic. The dialog is another plus as its complexity helps a lot, especially when facing a more difficult situation which simply implies it. Their British accent is also worth mentioning as it brings some sort of flair to this film.I cannot emphasize enough how much I like this movie. Its plot, its characters, its actors and especially its atmosphere are so good, but the way it makes you feel is simply one of a kind. It starts slowly but it builds up pace and ends up in style. You can see by far that these people truly know how to make a movie of this genre and the final result is simply great. It's simply a wonderful achievement!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Guys can trade this with their girl for an action flick,"This is not a guy friendly movie but it's not so sappy that it can't be tolerated. Emilia Clarke is in fine form but miles from her role as Mother of Dragons in Game of Thrones. You can barely recognize her. But she's effective as the always cheerful companion to a rich but paralyzed young man played by Sam Claflin.It was actually Claflin's performance that I found the most interesting. This guy starts out briefly as a young stud, enjoying his lively life. But then he is paralyzed very convincingly; he even seems slightly thinner as if he hasn't gotten out of bed for months. As a guy I tended to sympathize more with him while my wife was more taken with Emilia's role.Anyway, it's all fairly entertaining. And next time it's my choice what we see.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beautiful,"Recommended by a friend, I initially approached this film with a certain degree of skepticism as it was outside my preferred genre; however this notion was quickly put to bed as me before you proved to be an immensely moving and entertaining watch. One particular aspect that stood out for me was how the two main characters had such contrasting outlooks on life and how both perspectives eventually rub off each character as the story progresses. As well as being an incredibly heartwarming film (the scenic English countryside did play a role here), it is ridiculously hilarious and a real tear-jerker at times as well; a real emotional roller-coaster, as movies should be. Definitely worth a watch....or two....or however many times you need to rewatch it because I honestly can't seem to get over it anytime soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Such an emotional, beautiful, and tragic film.","Me Before You is such a touching romantic film that left me crying on the couch not sure what to feel. The actors chemistry together really is something, and the performances were all so powerful and moving. Their characters are so beautifully complex and elaborate, with different and unique perspectives and personalities. Lou and Will are really so perfect together. I loved the plot, it kept me hooked and engaged throughout the entire film. The script and their dialogue feels so natural. Towards the end, though, it's so darkly sad that it made me feel so empty inside. I cried so much at the end. It was hard to deal with that emotional baggage. It was so raw and painful I have no idea how they were able to convey this all into a film. If you can't deal with that, you won't enjoy this movie. In the end, I really loved this movie. Me Before You is a tearjerker that will leave you happy, sad, and confused all at the same time. I recommend. Definitely one of the best romance movies I've ever watched.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Someone with no qualifications in nursing, let alone CPR? Without the means to carry out a clever conversation with their son, who clearly comes from a very different world and background? So they hired her for her pretty face? Hoping he'd fall for her? What about his family, they never seem to keep him company, even though they begged him to stay with them.

Emotional movie,"""Me Before You"" is a 2016 romantic drama directed by Thea Sharrock. The film star Emilia Clarke as Louisa Clark goes on an emotional journey while caring for the wealthy, but disabled Will Traynor played by Sam Claflin, discovering the power of love and the importance of truly living life.Firstly, I found the story of ""Me Before You"" very engaging and emotional. It beautifully mixes romance with important social themes. While some parts of the plot can be a bit predictable, the strong character development keeps it interesting. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin give great performances, making their roles feel real and retable. Their chemistry brings a special depth to the story, making the audience genuinely care about their journey.On the other hand, the film has a beautiful visual style that adds to the story's emotions. The way the settings are captured adds to the overall experience and helps convey the characters' feelings. The main message about love, choice and independece really makes you think about personal and social issues. Encouraging viewers to reflect on their own lives and the choices they make. Overall, the atmosphere fits the romantic drama genre well, creating a touching and memorable experience. In conclusion, I really enjoyed watching the film ""Me Before You"". The story touched my heart and made me think about love and choice. I would definitely recommend it to others, especially those who appreciate romantic dramas with emotional depth. Fans of stories that challenge societal norms will enjoy in this film the most. I would give it a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I decided to see it based on the good scores and reviews it had here plus hearing someone saying that ""it wasn't the typical Hollywood chick flick"" let me tell you that is not only the typical chick flick is just a compilation of corny fake clichés, the script is awful, the actors are terrible and Emily Clark's acting it's the most obnoxious thing I have seen in years on the screen. Her ""acting skills"" are moving her eyebrows with this annoying stupid face which is a mix between ""I want to cry and I want to go to the toilet"".

Wonderful realistic romance. Worth watching again and again!,"It's different than most of the romantic movies that you would see nowadays with its considerably more realistic approach and yet it successfully demonstrates the feelings of two young lovers, it shows how pure love can be and it also makes the feelings of someone who gets a disability after living life in a healthy body very understandable for the audience.The script is written very well and the movie offers strong character development for the main characters with both main characters having unique, lovable qualities and also strong personalities in their own ways. It makes it much more interesting than a basic romance movie in which the focus would usually rather be on the initial chemical attraction than actual love being built up between people. In this movie, you get to know the characters very well, you get to connect with them, and you get to watch their love develop. The actors have just done an amazing job and the entire movie is very beautiful, I would not change a thing in this production.It's very real in many ways and I believe it's one of the best romance movies that has ever been made.

"A lovely ode to a feeling of emotional connect , a few term which as LOVE.","Hi , I m pretty sure you wil be going to fall in love with the Louisa clarke n the movie too if you have ever loved !!I mam compelled to write this review after a long long time . And Emilia Clarke 's sweet , chirpy look and cute act will just make you swoon for her ..
She is the lifeline of this movie which in irony is about euthanasia. She herself is filled of so much life , kindness n love ..
As she herself says"" I do not hate anyone"" . Even the lead character will sums it up by uttering "" You are the pretty much everything that makes me wake up every morning"" .Be it her creepy dresses or weird hairstyle making her look a school kid sometimes. Or her walk with a bend in her waist .. she just is so much into the character as possibly no one could be! .Initially she gets pissed off by will for consistently ignoring her any requests for assistance but soon she starts trying to live for her ,infact placing "" Me b4 you"" .. Watching her shave his face or just sit on his wheelchair and having a witty dialog with him is indeed a pleasure to behold .. Or when she is unable to come to terms with his unwavering urge to go about signing for euthanasia, she is just a sight to behold. Her expressions, eyes , eyebrows, everything just conveys so much to one as an audience!!.A truly Oscar worthy performance ..Yes , the movie is indeed predictable but ain't love is !.I can bet one would be both feeling overjoyed and emotional as the young lady reads the letter out in the climax and just wish each one of us who had been in true love , gets his/her love in both physical and spiritual form !As pointed out by her character, true love doesn't need to have based upon having physical relationship.. it is much more than this , it's the spiritual emotional connect between two people..
Sam claffin handsomely supports her in a good role .. good heavy voice must say . ..
