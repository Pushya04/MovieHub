A love story with a twist.,"Sally Hawkins puts in a lovely, sweet, almost sympathetic performance as the central character, it's her delicacy balanced against the harshness of the amphibious man that makes it so interesting.It's not a film I'd sit through several times over, but I have seen it twice, and was as impressed with my second viewing as the first. It is a beautiful film, with the most glorious soundtrack, a feast for the eyes and ears alike.I'm sure there was a social message here, it was perhaps over my head, what I saw was a good old fashioned love story, one with a difference, and a load of eggs.It's sad, moving, funny, it's definitely very, very weird, but if you've seen any of his other movies, then you'll realise the inevitability of that.It's a unique watch, and a rewarding one, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Maybe not Oscar worthy, but a unique and captivating film","I must admit that I was surprised to learn that this film won 4 Oscars, though I'm just as surprised by the many negative 1 and 2 star reviews that it has received. In terms of ideas and creativity, 'The Shape of Water' is as good as any film I've seen in the last few years. With a storyline as inventive and unique as this one, it makes for a fascinating couple of hours of viewing and, if you like films that take risks and dare to be different, there is a lot to enjoy about it.For all its ideas and creativity, however, 'The Shape of Water' is lacking in some areas and can make for frustrating viewing at times. The storyline is underdeveloped in areas, particularly towards the end where there are many unanswered questions and the ending itself is a little underwhelming. That said, 'The Shape of Water' deserves credit for injecting fresh ideas into the fantasy romance genre. It might not be worth 4 Oscars, but 'The Shape of Water' is a unique and captivating film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unsettlement at its most beautiful,"So much appealed to me about 'The Shape of Water'. The trailer and story captivated me, Guillermo Del Toro has done some great work prior (especially one of my favourite films 'Pan's Labyrinth'), the critical acclaim and numerous wins and nominations (including a whopping thirteen Oscar nominations as we speak) promised so much as did the talented cast and having Alexandre Desplat on board.Luckily, 'The Shape of Water' didn't disappoint me at all. For me, it's one of Del Toro's best and his best since 'Pan's Labyrinth'. It's a beautifully transfixing adult fairy tale with elements of 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Amelie' and 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', while showing a real sense of unsettlement and affectionate nostalgia from film and music from the golden age.Everything here absorbs, right from the visually gorgeous, musically hauntingly beautiful and really quite wondrous opening to the genuinely unnervingly tense and powerful, in emotion and violent action, climax. The love story is very touching and has a lot of heart, the conflict provided by the as ice cold monster a villain as one can get brings chills up the spine, Elisa and Zelda's friendship has warmth and that between Elisa and Giles has charm and poignancy.'The Shape of Water' is one of the best-looking films of the year bar none. There is a real fairy-tale, in both sheer other-worldly beauty and sometimes unsettlingly nightmarish, look to the cinematography. The production and costume design are meticulously detailed, evocative (one really is taken back to the Cold War's look and atmosphere) and atmospheric, while the creature design clearly looked like a lot of care and effort went into it and the editing has a natural and cohesive flow.Alexandre Desplat's music score is ethereal and hauntingly beautiful, especially so in the opening scene, one of the best scored opening scenes of the year. The vivid sound mixing and editing helps it a lot, and the pre-existing music also makes a positive impression with the rendition of ""You Never Know"" touching the soul and haunting the mind. 'The Shape of Water' is one of the best examples of Del Toro's mastery of story-telling when the material is particularly good, like it is here and in 'Pan's Labyrinth', with all the different elements ideally balanced and just as strong individually.Regarding the script, it's tightly structured, poetic, poignant, nostalgic, thought-provoking and with nothing inconsequential. What is done with the monster is a revelation, not just because the design is so rich in detail, expressive and real but Doug Jones masterfully brings nuances, chills and heartfelt emotion and makes the monster much more than a creature design that looks good but with no soul.Can't fault the acting either. Sally Hawkins is one of the finest recent examples of conveying so many different emotions and nuances without saying a word, my personal favourite as of now of the nominees for this year's Best Actress Oscar category (yes even more so than Frances McDormand for 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri').Octavia Spencer is humorously earthy and sympathetic and warmth and sincerity shines through every aspect of Richard Jenkins' performance. Michael Shannon has rarely been creepier than he is here and Michael Stuhlbarg is also fine.In summary, unsettling and truly beautiful, one of the year's must sees. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Okay, but hardly Oscar-worthy","It is the mid-1960s. Elisa is mute, and a cleaner at a US government experiment facility. Her life is quite mundane and unfulfilled. Then the facility starts on a new project: the US government has captured a man-fish hybrid in South America and now they are seeing if the creature's unique physiology could have some uses for humans, especially for astronauts. Elisa becomes attached to the creature.The winner of Best Picture at the 2018 Oscars, though difficult to see why. A pretty basic movie - a linear romantic drama with one-dimensional characters, cartoonish, badness-laid-on-so-thick-it's-laughable villains, conventional plot development and a fairly predictable ending. It's not that profound or original in its themes or development (unless the viewer has only seen a handful of movies in their life) - quite dumbed-down (though that might be more a reflection of modern audiences than anything else). If it wasn't for the excellent CGI, the sentimentality, the slickness of the plot development and some of the performances it would be just another B-grade creature feature.Part of the problem is that director Guillermo del Toro tries to steer a path between fairy tale and gritty drama, and thus ends up with something that is tonally jarring and inconsistent. The movie from the start has a light, airy feel, the ideal set up for a sweet, all-ages drama. There's even some funny moments to help this along. Yet, interspersed with the lightness are several adult-orientated scenes. Even as the movie becomes darker, bloodier and grittier, del Toro still tries to cling to the fairy tale side.Made as a plain fairy tale-like drama, suitable for all ages, this would have worked a whole lot better.Not that it's that bad though. The movie moves at a decent pace and is quite entertaining. There is a decent level of intrigue and tension and Sally Hawkins puts in a great performance as Elisa.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Lagoon of Longing & Love...,"It's a time when being different was discouraged, by how you looked, by how you hooked, by how you foraged, in a world of prejudice, the overwhelming emphasis, was to align, to toe the line, to be acknowledged. Elisa's mute, but she still has things to say, using Zelda as a surrogate airway, together they both clean, where there's things that go unseen, behind one doorway there's a place she likes to stay. In this place something's imprisoned and interned, Elisa shows it love, the tides begin to turn, a connection has been made, it's time to escape and evade, logistically that causes some concern.Sally Hawkins is as spectacular as ever in an imaginative tale that reflects a world of the past, but not forgotten or disappeared (sadly).",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The hype of water,"The film starts with an interesting premise: during the Cold War era, a US government research center has captured a strange amphibious creature and the protagonist is a mute cleaning lady. From the beginning the story overflows with symbols if intolerance: towards women, towards handicapped people, black people, amphibious people, immigrants, gays, old people, and so on and so on. It's like it's trying to check all the boxes, see how many it gets in a single row. But while it does this, the story itself just stalls. This is a two hour long movie in which nothing much happens. It shows intolerance, but doesn't go anywhere with it. Yes, we know people are assholes and that during that era, they were slightly worse than now. It does nothing for the plot, which is predictable and boring.The bad man is reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth villain and the main character a girl with an active imagination, but it is way slower and more poorly executed than Pan's. It is clearly a worse movie than that was. To put it mildly, I am at a loss for why this film won Best Picture. It was visually interesting, but you couldn't take it seriously. It went from metaphor to reality with no regard to the previous context. A villain that seemed to not have a purpose other than being obtuse and evil, a woman who after learning that the creature has bit two fingers off a man's hand goes near it and offers it food from her own hand, a black best friend who's only role is to gossip about her irrelevant husband, some Russian spies that seem more interested in food than in spying, the list goes on and on. It's not like the actors didn't do a good job, it's not that the direction or the sets were faulty, but the story itself was nothing more than a long slow cliche.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mesmerizing,"Typical for a beautiful movie to be underrated by most people. The difference in meta and user score was to be expected.In my experience, this movie was captivating from the first scene and ended on a high note, with a simple frame, music and quote. Del Toro takes you on a journey, that never goes full-blown fantasy. The minor details in both film and music are sublime. It really brings the story to life. In my opinion, this is one of those movies that don't need any questions. You have to experience is.Perhaps it is a story that is only enjoyable for people that daydream. The ambiance and message are set up in a way, a hopeless romantic could feast on for days. Seeing as most Hollywood movies are complete rubbish, this one really shows what a movie is capable of. Bringing the love of a celebrated director on screen. Go see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A fairy tale for troubled times...,"The Shape of Water, the Oscar winning film about an unlikely love between a humanoid amphibian and a mute woman set in the early 1960's. The movie was greatly directed by director and screenwriter Guillermo Del Toro and acted by award winning actress Sally Hawkins with supporting actress Octavia Spencer. The movie is full of hope and desire as the lead characters explore love in a unique way that is different and unnatural. The movie will have you shed tears, in suspense, and thrilled by shocking twists and events.""Unable to perceive the shape of you, I find you all around me / Your presence fills my eyes with your love, It humbles my heart, For you are everywhere.""

above all it is a film about feelings,"By subverting and paying homage to all sorts of styles and genres, Del Toro creates his own style and his own genre in The Shape of Water, a film that will hopefully live on for generations and be considered a masterful classic by future filmgoers. Many people will hate it (there are already plenty of reviews on this very site that are unreasonably negative, which is always bound to happen when someone creates a work of art that is genuinely beautiful and creative and is also willing to take people out of their comfort zones and be totally weird and have serious moral questions and thought provoking statements to make), but many people will, and should, love it until the end of time. It is a moving, touching, thrilling, frightening, funny, and romantic hybrid of the whimsical fairy tale, the classic Universal monster flick, the Old Hollywood melodrama, the surrealist film, the fantastically foreign art house masterpiece, and probably tons of other things to. The characters are well developed, Del Toro's lens has a profound understanding of human emotion that makes me want to cry as I reflect upon this simply flat out majorly f*cking brilliant movie...that's enough of my talking, just see it!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Beautifully Visual-Driven Film from Guillermo del Toro,"One of the most impressive parts of The Shape of Water will probably go unstated by many, because it is easy to overlook. It is stunning how much chemistry a woman who never talks and a fish monster can have. The energy between them radiates, and I had to keep stopping myself to consciously think about what a feat that truly is. As a direct result to how great the writing, directing, and performances are, this relationship between a woman and a monster never feels strange. If done by lesser talent, this could have come across as very weird or wrong. But del Toro crafts this film in such a way that it never comes across in this manner. In fact, in feels only natural, and that is applause-worthy on his part. That is the single biggest thing that Del Toro needed to pull off flawlessly, and he rises to meet the challenge. As with every Guillermo del Toro movie, the production elements are all spectacular. Del Toro really has a great understanding of mise-en-scène, something I'm continuously taken aback by every time I watch a movie of his. His cinematography isn't usually something that lunges out at you and calls attention to itself; rather, it works to very subtly draw you into the film. I do very much like cinematography that stands out and pops, but there is also something to be said for more the subtle kind of shooting a film. Del Toro has a strong hold on his production design. From the set design to the costume design to the color palette, every del Toro movie has a clear direction that is unique to its own story, and this film is no exception...",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A part fantasy romance, part monster thriller that could only come from the mind of Guillermo Del Toro.","A mute janitor falls in love with a fish man during the Cold War 1950's. That's about as simple as you can describe the plot of Guillermo Del Toro's new film The Shape of Water. Del Toro has always had in interest in monsters for his films. No matter how scary or deformed they look, they always have human traits that connect us with them. In this film, Del Toro has crafted his most likeable monster yet and tells a totally original story (trust me) that is part romance, part thriller.We follow the life of a janitor without a voice, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins). She works in an underground facility alongside her co-worker, Zelda (Octavia Spencer), who talks enough to make up for Elisa's silence. One day a secret test subject is brought into the facility by the psychotic Strickland (Michael Shannon). The subject happens to be an amphibious-human hybrid creature that was found in the Amazon and has been brought back to America in order to be dissected and studied. After interacting together a few times, Elisa and the creature begin to form a special bond of love. Elisa recruits her neighbor (Richard Jenkins) and a sympathetic Russian spy (Michael Stuhlbarg) for a plan to break the creature from his chains and allow him to return home.The plot carries both a whimsical and serious tone to it. They mostly go together well as we get a fairytale that isn't afraid to embrace a childish feel with adult actions. However, GDT goes overboard once with a song and dance number that comes close to throwing the whole film off during its most poignant time.This is one of GDT's most mainstream films (apart from Pacific Rim) and is a great way for people unfamiliar with his work to be introduced. He expertly uses his monster experience to make a film that carries a realistic and fantasy tone.He also makes a very brave film that doesn't shy away from unconventional material. We get to see Michael Shannon having sex after his fingers get severed, political assassinations, and a self-pleasuring scene involving an egg timer. Oh, Elisa and the Amphibian Man also experience, let's just say, a special physical connection.The most impressive aspects of the film come from the behind the scenes work. The camera is brilliantly manned by Dan Lausten. It flows freely between the sets to give the film a romantic fantasy feel, but he also uses constant rain, dark colors, and confined spaces to make it feel like a cold war noir.The production design is also outstanding as each set piece is designed with care and precision. It's astonishing that this film was made for only $19.5 million because it looks like it cost more than triple that amount.The actors create one of the best ensembles of the year. They all carry their weight when matched together and make their characters interesting to watch. Hawkins is perfectly cast and leads the show with her signature shy look. She gives the most compelling and passionate performance of the year, all without saying a word.Richard Jenkins also gives an award-worthy supporting performance as Elisa's neighbor, Giles, who is going through a midlife crisis in terms of his career and sexuality. His scenes with Hawkins are astounding, but the ones with him alone aren't as great and take away from the important story.While not breaking any new ground, both Michael Shannon and Octavia Spencer do what they do best. Shannon gives his trademark evil, unhinged authority performance. Spencer does well in a performance very similar to her role in The Help.Michael Stuhlbarg also continues his amazing 2017 (also in Call Me by Your Name, The Post, and on TV with Fargo) by giving a great performance in the little time he has. Shoutout to Doug Jones as well for playing the Amphibian Man. He gives an endearing performance that brings warmth to his naturally cold-blooded character.The Shape of Water is easily one of 2017's best films and deserves all the Oscar nominations it will get. Every person in the cast and crew do their job exceptionally and create a breathtaking cinematic experience that makes you feel like a kid again while also giving you the stuff your adult mind wants to see.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful film,"This film was extremely imaginative and gorgeously shot. At the heart of it, the film is about a girl who falls in love with a fish.

Watch This!,"While I'm not into 'creature from the deep' type movies, this is not really one of those. It is more of a love story like I've never seen before...There really wasn't any room for 'spectacular' acting, though the whole cast did their job delivering the character they were assigned.The wardrobe and props departments also did a great job giving the film a 1950s type of look and feel. The same should also be said of the film crew.But, back to the story...There were a couple of times I expected a completely different reaction from characters (no spoilers). However the reactions were delivered smoothly, so smoothly, in fact, that they didn't bother me, or make me 'dwell' for longer than a moment.Like I said near the beginning, it is a love story, of sorts, with a sci-fi / creature from the deep sort of twist to it, and, once again, no spoilers, there is a betrayal that goes on, but a betrayal that has no pain...There is no reason this film should get less than a 7 out of ten.A film truly worth watching, no matter what you prefer. It has a story that it delivers, and a story that is easily enjoyed.And, probably best watched by mature audiences :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Of My Favorite Movies Of The Year,"""The Shape Of Water"" is the new project from writer/director Guillermo Del Toro who brought us Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, The Hellboy Movies and to an extent The Hobbit trilogy (which gets to much hate). I wasn't a huge fan of Crimson peak, but the Shape Of Water really looked intriguing from the trailers. I sat there blown away by what I was seeing. This is one of my favorite films of 2017. It is unique, original, interesting, intriguing, and weird all at the same time.Sally Hawkins gives a really great performance in one of the most inspirational performances I have ever seen. her character is mute and has no lines of dialogue aside from a dream sequence, but man does she play this character with confidence. The supporting cast also does a really great job, Michael Shannon of course being the next standout, and no one phone sin a performance at all.This film has that old school vibe to it. There is a use of a lot of practical effects, and the makeup and hairstyling is some of the best I've seen on film this year. The amphibian creature, if it is motion captured, is seamlessly integrated into the movie that the use of practical effects looks so appealing.The set designs are also really great. Lots of little details that you have to pay attention to that you wouldn't normally pay attention to. The lighting in these scenes also adds a lot of depth to the movie. There are scenes that are dim for a reason, and some with more lighting for a reason. It is really a great way to use lighting to convey the details of the environment.This is a story that grabbed me from the beginning. Not once was I bored watching this movie. It kept me engaged and there is so much character development that it ended up making me care at the end. Out of all of the characters that you root for, there is not one single character that you end up not liking.And if my memory serves me correctly, there is not one scene of exposition in this film. Not one. There are some ""hints"" here and there as to what is going on in the background, but from what I remember it's not explicitly stated. It leaves it up to you to put together all of the clues and I really like that about this film.I'm happy we got something original in Hollywood. Everyone craves for something original, and then everyone hates it when something original comes out. It was a nice breath to just see something so refreshing instead of plot threads being retreaded and following clichés that we see in movies nowadays. This is one of my favorite films of the year.I am going to give ""The Shape Of Water"" an A+.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Solid, beautiful movie with good script and acting","Another very satisfying GDT movie, very reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth. Lots of the technical aspects, such as score, makeup of Doug Jones, scene shooting and cuts, and acting performances of Hawkins and Jenkins, were really impressive and help explain why it's got a good chance at Best Picture. I really like the themes they touch on, with the Cold War, love and understanding, loyalty and hierarchy, and very clearly defined and developed characters. However, I didn't find these themes to be extremely deeply or consistently explored, as none of them are especially vivid, emphasized, or concluded in a way that makes you reconsider the idea - they were smaller pieces to a beautiful movie about the main character finding love and understanding. Nothing wrong with that, and it was well done, but nothing that makes it especially memorable or emotionally intense. Very solid, well-directed, and good peripherals, but nothing that puts it over the top.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Shape of Your Limitations,"The latest beautiful film by the dark fairy tale fantasy director Guillermo del Toro reminds me of hearing 40 year olds talk about what they got out of going to college . It seems that you get what you put into it. I'd claim the same goes for this collective homage film that will certainly open your eyes through many theatrical portals. I found an immediate thought of the French movie ""Amelie"" due to the quiet nature of our protagonist and the smart and artful use of color. It's a romantic viewing for those who appreciate such things and yearn for a better nature in ourselves. This 1960's period piece, set in Baltimore, Maryland, certainly doesn't look like any John Waters film I ever saw, but the small city with a chip on it's shoulder is carried well by the outsider and monster of the movie played by Michael Shannon. Yes, his characters' depth won't go past wading levels, but the fim isn't about character depth, and the story is the star. The movie has a collective voice of characters who, although silenced by the social indignities of that time, rose above themselves for the greater good. Octavia Spencer is understated but is our eyes as an outsider and our conscience as a friend. The only person who this doesn't hold true is Elisa, our protagonist, part mousey mute and part ""quite female"" to say the least. She's daring on a number of issues, but it feels as for personal gain, despite the pure heart angle. I will watch this again to see if I come away with that same sentiment.The ""asset"" is more reminicent of the Watchmans' Dr. Manhattan in it's perfect masculine form, allowing the romance to be ""somewhat"" believable, but it does appear one-sided for the majority of the film, so not sure how to handle the folks grabbing their pitchforks about their time with the film. If you love film beauty and are willing to spend time away from your everyday troubles, this flick works in it's own way. Predictable, sure, but vividly engaging!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love: the Universal Language,"We all crave for love and care. The exchange of those emotions with our world around keeps us going. The humanity finds new outlets when the existing ones don't give way to release and expression. In right circumstances, love finds new faces and, in some other, it subtly devolves into a disease. Guillermo del Toro preens those faces up beautifully in his novel imagination, The Shape of Water.The movie is set up in the cold world era, with visible contempt for certain skin colour and race à la hierarchical structure and caste divide in India of the same period. Evidently, getting ahead at all cost was starting to get common at that time in the US-even at the cost of values and human relationship. In such an environment what chance does a mute janitor has other than to be grateful for the small mercies of the world? She sure has a company with an old man, Giles, her neighbour, whose services are no more needed by his employer. His paintings don't find a place in a rapidly moving world that values usefulness over subtlety. Guillermo aptly portrays two people living with compatible loneliness. Even more apt for 2010s than 1970s!Despite of all this darkness, love and care floats like a cuckoo's constant humming in the story. Elisa's care for her cats, movie theatre owner's compassionate behaviour towards his protagonist tenants, Zelda holding the line for Elisa and finally Elisa's care for humanoid amphibious creature are like many threads that weave a beautiful colour across a piece of muslin. The story isn't a first of its kind. There are many movies depicting an animal falling in love with a human (King Kong, Shrek, etc.). Considering many may not prefer to watch such a love story, treading that path and keeping the audience hooked and to make them appreciate the evolution of emotions is not easy, but Guillermo does it with conviction.Most of the characters round up well as the story progresses. Being a female, an orphan and a janitor with not many around having the time and patience to 'listen' to her gestures, she tends to herself. Her sexuality woven into her daily routine is shown in a bland yet beautiful way and highlight her lonely world. Guillermo must be appreciated for picturising that non-judgementally. Her coming to find an expression in the creature appears natural. Now, juxtapose Giles' refusing to understand Elisa's anxiously exaggerated gestures against the creature using the same gestures to express its love for her. That's the movie's high point.Zelda with her skin colour and Giles with his sexual orientation similarly crave for a caring company. As an oddity, Colonel Richard Strickland's character does not evolve as the story advances. His motive to win at all cost is not well explained except that a threat to his survival finally made him even darker.The way the scientist Robert Hoffstetle (a soviet spy in disguise who is constantly threatened by the ruthlessness of both Colonel Richard Strickland and Hoffstetle's soviet handlers) helps to save the amphibian shows how an attempt to understand can bring compassion and love. In contrast, Colonel Strickland's desire to win at all cost harbours ruthless pragmatism at the cost of those emotions.The movie's climax is a bit routine and thus disappointing. It develops suddenly ending in a bland win of good over evil.Even if one doesn't relate to a lady falling for an animal, the true appreciation of the subtlety of human emotions and values is what makes the movie watchable. A commendable piece of art.~ Himanshu Trivedi",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

True love knows no bounds,"12/24/17. Saw this in the theater today and it was worth the price of admission. For those who remember the Creature from the Black Lagoon, then this one's for you. It's a sequel that was well worth the wait. Well, it's not exactly a sequel, it's more like a theme in variation. It's a love story of strange proportions, that is worthy of del Toro's imagination. Hawkins is a sad woman of a certain age, who does janitorial duty at an oceanic research facility. She does not speak, but she can hear. She falls in love with a creature dragged in my Shannon's character. And, typical of sci-fi/creature features of the '50s, anything that is not human deserves to die. Hawkins makes it her mission to save the creature while falling in love with it. Implausible? Sure. Romantic? Absolutely. Catch it for Hawkins's star turn.

Fantastical but gritty romance,"The Shape of Water is a new take on a very old story as a lowly cleaning woman falls in love with an unusual creature and must protect it from the authorities who wish to destroy it. While the story is not original, harking to films as diverse as Beauty and the Beast, ET and Free Willy, the film is still a delight to watch. Written and directed by Guillermo DelToro, the film is similar in style to much of his work, combining his usual magical fantasy with gritty, sometimes violent social realism.Sally Hawkins is delightful as the mute cleaner working in a secret government facility where the water creature is held. Her performance is wonderfully expressive and there is great interplay between her and co-stars Richard Jenkins as her neighbour and Octavia Spencer as her colleague.
Michael Shannon growls and bites devilishly as the villain out to kill the creature and anyone who gets in his way.The film wears its 1960's setting well with frequent references to cold war politics, the space race and contemporary culture. While the film also pays adoring homage to older cinema including a lovely dance scene evocative of early musicals.Alexandre Desplat's soaring score beautifully underlines the film.Overall, despite the weak story, the film is a joy to watch. Well acted by a fantastic cast and visually sumptuous, the film is one of Del Toro's best.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amelie x The Fly,"I was not prepared for this movie. I mean I knew there was something out of the ordinary in it but I was just not ready for it. It's like Amelie x The Fly, that's the best way I can put it so at least you kinda know what you're getting into.Elisa is a mute that works as a cleaner for a US government facility that has recently come into possession an ""asset"" that might prove useful in pushing the US forward against USSR in the Space Race. In time she develops an understanding with the creature and moves heaven and earth in order to save it from experimentation and possible extermination.Bringing this extraordinary story to life is a mix of kooky characters led by Elisa played by Sally Hawkins, who was able to communicate more than those who had speaking lines attesting to her well-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Actress. The relatable Giles (he has a cat! he loves showbusiness! he has a crush on the pie guy!) is Richard Jenkins (who you might remember from HBO's Six Feet Under), Dmitri the Soviet spy you'll root for portrayed by the talented Michael Stuhlberg (if you thought Timothee Chalamet will have a problem choosing where to sit at the Oscars, at the Call Me By Your Name or Lady Bird section, Michael has CMBYN, the Post and then this movie). Also worth mentioning is Michael Shannon as Strickland who's a menacing presence to behold more so even than the creature in his possession.What I like about the movie is it celebrates the outcasts of society: a Spanish mute, a lonely old gay man, an African-American woman who lives for her husband, and the captured creature itself. We often see through the eyes of gorgeous leading men and women, but what it's like to be among the loneliest of the lonely? This movie answers it and it's not as sad as one would think. There's a certain beauty in the way they live their lives.After watching, I didn't know how to feel or am quite unable to put into words what my thoughts are of it. I feel like I was assaulted, but not really, you know? Maybe it's one of the movies that you either get it or you don't and I'm glad this was one of those times that I did.Favorite Quote: ""Unable to perceive the shape of You, I find You all around me.

Seeks it's Own Level,"I like a good story and here we have a good story being told. It helps if you are a fan of the Creature From the Black Lagoon and the sequels. Hey, the guy only wanted some company and was willing to do what it takes to get some. In this movie, we are introduced to a sort of fairy tale telling of the world of what if and what could be which exceeds our thoughts but feeds the imaginations. There were a couple of sex scenes that I thought were not necessary at all and one wonders why they are in this? With them gone, this could have taken its place with Beauty and the Beast and brought the lessons to children more. It also ran a little long but for those that like a good build-up they wont' be disappointed. When watching this movie, if one believes there are no accidents, that the heart can prevail by its own rules and not giving up allows it to do so then a treat awaits. The bad guy in this movie was a little over the top and the premise of what to do with the ""creature"" doesn't pass common sense but it doesn't have to either. The movie still prevails.

"She falls in love with a fish, the end.","I usually love Del Toro's movies, his weird gothic fantasy style usually impresses me. But i dont see the hype around this movie, not only is it a boring love story, i cant seem to escape the fact that she falls in love with a fish man, forget that she is a weird confused sad little girl who lives a mundane life, i doubt thats reason enough to fall in love with a fish that communicates like a family pet, i thought it was silly and most definitely out there, the fact it won oscars baffles me, these critics giving their artistic veiws to us mere mortals, its like those pompous art goers who try to justify paying millions for something that looks like a 4 year old doodled while painting at nursery.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love can find many shapes and forms,If you like movies about love than this is the movie for you while it's dark and dipictes a lonely women Elisa {Sally Hawkins} who finds a creature that lives in the water and is a Amphibian {Doug Jones} and they form a special bond which is unlike anyhing that we have seen before and it will surprise you and make you laugh and make you cry. Sally Hawkins is Elisa Esposito a mute who is really sweet and loving nature the Amphibian Man is played by Doug Jones who played the role of a creature who falls in love with a women. these are by far my two favorite charecters of the movie and they sure made me feel that there love was real and passionate. my second favorite character and the comic relief is Zelda Fuller and she is played by Octavia Spencer and what she says is so funny and i love her she is just so funny and she makes this serious and often romantical movie feel like a comedy and she was the best secondary character. the older man and neighbour is Giles he is the moral support of Elisa and he has some comedic moments but not as many as Zelda. The big bad guy of the movie is Richard Strickland played by Michael Shannon and he goes from creepy to strait up crazy by the end and thats what i love. what can i say about The shape of water it's dark and it's sexual and it's romatic the moral of the story is that love can be found anywhere and you just have to wait to find that perfect match it is up for winning best picture at the oscars in 2018 it has a lot of competion and i think that Guillermo del Toro has created something that will surely leave a impression in cinema for many years to come and it's a must watch film for 2017.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Guillermo del Toro remembers what ART is,"There are all sorts of different movies going on in cinemas: documentaries, true stories, thrillers, detectives, dramas, fairytales, animation, etc.. What genre would you characterize The Shape of Water to be? I would say it's a work of art.Most of the things we watch lately are ""based on a true story"" and as helpful and educational as it is, it defeats the purpose of art. Art is about expanding your imagination, going above your limits. Exploring ideas that are unreal but yet create real emotions and reactions.I have seen decent amount of movies and one thing that will make me always appreciate the work is the artistic side of it. How innovative was the technique director used? How were the scenes shot? What angle did the camera men take?The story itself plays certain role - it's the main idea that the whole movie is circled around, but HOW you tell a story is equally if not more important for a storyteller. Think about it in a conventional way - we all have friends who can tell the most boring story with enthusiasm and make people laugh, while others can bore you even while talking about intriguing concepts. Same happens with cinematography - talent to tell a story is what cinematography is about, if we look at it at it's very origin.For that, I have to say that Guillermo del Toro remembers what is ART, it's purpose and tricks of great storytelling.I don't want to go into a deep analyse of the movie as it was not made to be thought through million times. It was made to be watched and enjoyed as you watch it. If I were to judge HOW it's made I'd give it a firm 10. The story itself is where I lost 3 points. The story is not original, ""Beauty and the Beast"" variation with more hardcore characters and grimy dark turns along the way that give this green movie a beautiful red contrast (the movie is shot in green-ish tones with a lot of blood in scenes)It definitely triggers some questions about our tolerance to each other. Where do we really draw the line between human and inhuman. How and WHY do we get to decide what lives and what dies?So if you really want some food for your brain, you can find it as well. But I wouldn't recommend taking this movie too deep. Guillermo did an incredible job on creating this beautiful world, that you can watch 2 or 3 times and still don't catch all the details of, so, for the art's sake, dive in with open eyes and ears, take in the whole experience and breath out when you leave the theater. It's quite a magical journey.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What life is about: It is more than just a romance.,"First of all ""The Shape of Water"" is beautiful and magical, a fairytale that is easy to enjoy and fall in love with. That much does not need you to look any further - an enchanting lovestory if ever I saw one, plain as day.On second glance however it's small, humble scenery, this intimate dream we are invited to share, aims at something much, much more important. Something that may not even be about romance.We all have, or at least had, ideals. Until we give up, or realize them. Thereby lofty ideals become firmly rooted in reality. Alas! more often than not high ideals become nothing but a facade in the process, a rallying banner used to pretend we'd still know what is what, how to be good, how to do the right thing, or why we became who we are to begin with.For some the banner is ""christianity"", others advocate ""tolerance"" or one of a million other names we've given. What does that even mean? Perhaps we shouldn't swear? Perhaps it requires great strength? Perhaps there's the book telling right from wrong? Almost everybody genuinely tries to do the right thing, and so do this film's characters. Down to the overdrawn bad guy, each in his own fashion.If you are open to it I am sure you'll feel what it is, what allows this wonderful film's protagonist to humbly walk that path. A path that all others use so much more power, knowledge and discipline to find and follow, yet fail.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A tour-de-force of Guillermo's del Toro's world-building ability,"The Shape of Water stands out for the way Guillermo del Toro is able to give this fantasy-laden film such a distinct time and place, in this case a military research facility set in the 1960's, which highlights del Toro's masterful screenwriting ability. The writing is further gilded by its intellectual depth, with characters remarking about the origin of certain words and names, or drawing on biblical references to better frame the predicaments they're in. And if del Toro only wrote the screenplay, he'd still be receiving acclaim, yet this entire production is his. All told, he's credited as the writer, director, and producer.The film exhibits an alluring, Amelie-like color profile, with water motifs throughout, featuring a career-making performance by Sally Hawkins. The selective use of nudity and sexuality adds a real sense of depth and fullness to her role, making the character seem that much more lifelike, and Hawkins certainly makes the most of it.Her performance is quite simply magnanimous. She's outwardly tender and sweet, with an inner strength and resolve that manifests itself whenever the occasion calls. It's a combination of perfect casting and the actress rising to the occasion that, in my estimation, places her as the odds on favorite to win the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an actress in a drama, for which she's currently nominated, and the Academy Award in the same category, for which she most certainly will be nominated.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A plethora of old themes and movies updated and put in an adult, creative and nostalgic form.","The movie is a surrealistic, romantic and sometime satirical film which takes the old grade Z ""creature from the black lagoon"" flicks of the 50s and brings them into modern concerns (albeit in a 1962 setting) and adult themes. A Cold War setting, a picture of early 60s racism and the struggles of loneliness are sub-themes that actually blend well.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Shape of Garbage,"Is this what passes for ""Best Picture"" these days?Yes, the cinematography is wonderful, casting is perfect, acting is on point, and the soundtrack is quite nice. Even the story is creative and unique, albeit goofy to the point of idiotic. And that's the main issue with this film, the screenplay.There are a few nice sentiments concerning alienation and finding your voice via love, but everything decent and good is trapped within a story that feels like a bad episode of the X-Files. For those who enjoy reading deeply into incredibly shallow art, this film will probably seem like Shakespeare.Don't get me wrong, I've certainly enjoyed my share of bad movies - but I always recognize them for what they are. It irks me when a poorly constructed mess is touted as a masterpiece. The Shape of Water is at times entertaining, but it's often just downright stupid.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another visually stunning masterpiece from Guillermo del Toro.,"The Shape of Water tells the story of Elisa Esposito(Sally Hawkins). Elisa works as a janitor, at a classified research facility in America, during the Cold War. At the facility Elisa comes across a unique creature(Doug Jones), with whom she forms a strong bond.The Shape of Water is an awe-inspiring film. Director Guillermo del Toro has given us another unforgettable, unique & predominantly visual movie, after Pacific Rim(2013) & Crimson Peak(2015). del Toro is worthy of all the 'Best Director awards, he has been winning non-stop. The visual effects are flawless. Costume designer Luis Sequeira has done a fantastic job with Doug Jones'(who plays the Amphibian Man) body suit.

Hawkins masterfully portrays varied emotions, without uttering a single word. Michael Shannon gives the performance of a lifetime, as Richard Strickland. Richard Jenkins is amazing as Giles. Octavia Spencer is outstanding as Zelda Fuller. Michael Stuhlbarg is brilliant as Dr. Robert Hoffstetler. Doug Jones is awesome as the Amphibian Man. The supporting cast is great.

"A beautiful adult fairy tale by the brilliant director of ""Pan's Labyrinth""","Guillermo del Toro is today's master of fantasy, having been a childhood lover of monsters growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico, before making some of the finest films of recent years -- from the ghostly horror of ""The Devil's Backbone"" in 2001 to his gothic horror/romance, ""Crimson Peak"" in 2015. Indubitably, however, his greatest film is ""Pan's Labyrinth"", the 2006 film many of us consider the finest fantasy film ever made. Now he's broken new ground with ""The Shape of Water"", one of 2017's most beautiful films.Set in Baltimore in the year 1962 at the height of the Cold War, the plot follows a mute janitor at a secret government laboratory who forms a bond with a captured amphibian of the ""Creature of the Black Lagoon"" variety. Her name is Elisa, and Sally Hawkins plays her with an artistry that seems to reach back to the silent days of Chaplin and Keaton. Michael Shannon, with devoted viciousness, plays the right-wing Colonel Strickland, someone more interested in dissecting the creature for exploitation purposes than he is concerned over the space race with the Soviets. There are also elements of religious allegory (""We're created in the Lord's image. You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you?"").Del Toro saw ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" on TV at 7 years old and it changed his life. Wishing a different ending for it in which the Gill Man and co-star Julie Adams would consummate their romance and live 'happily ever after', he wrote various scripts of a remake through the years that Universal studio executives wound up rejecting. ""The Shape of Water"" is the result of del Toro's dream, and now today, with more permissive filmmaking allowable, he's able to deal with the previously verboten issue between fish and human. The resulting film is a worthy accomplishment not only for its production design (embodying various shades of green) and its special effects, but also for attaining the level of a genuine adult fairy tale that deals with issues of trust, tolerance, and love in the human condition -- but most of all what it's like to be an outsider (whether a lonely mute woman, gay man, overweight black woman, or an amphibious sea creature). ""This is a healing movie for me,"" del Toro states; one likes to think it would be for viewers as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unique and enjoyable,The Shape of Water is definitely unlike any film I've seen this year.It is unique yet set in an older time which adds to its mystery and intrigue. A lonely mute cleaner forms an unusual bond with a different creature with unique abilities. Throughout the film we see the two grow closer and face obstacles from a ruthless agent.The film excels in being unique and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. There are also some unnecessary scenes showing her normal morning routine. Her neighbours character could have been developed as could Octavia Spencer's character.Still an enjoyable experience at the movies. 7/10,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sensational director Guillermo del Toro is back to his roots with The Shape of Water. And it's making a serious splash,"Sensational director Guillermo del Toro is back to his roots with The Shape of Water. And it's making a serious splash.The Shape of Water takes audiences back to the fairy-tale style of earlier movies. The story explores the relationship between mute cleaner Elsa and the creature at the government facility where she works. The premise and plot are a little bizarre, but comfortably so. The plot seems interwoven around some deeper message, as is the case with most of his movies. But there is no explicit social commentary. It is the audience's job to fill that gap.The cold war backdrops The Shape of Water, but it never delves too deep into the background conflict. The cold war element of the movie serves more as a cinematic backdrop than a scathing social commentary, like in Pan's Labyrinth.Del Toro uses a generous amount of tropes, especially regarding Michael Shannon's classic bad- guy role. But with the lighter tone, the movie is freer to explore other themes: love, unity, oneness. Or rather, we are freer to explore the themes within the film.The Shape of Water is at heart a love story, although it feels abstracted enough as to be universally symbolic.Neither the creature or Elsa can speak, and it is through this commonality that they transcend differences of species. And symbolically, other boundaries like race, class, gender, and sexuality. But it's difficult to entirely indulge in the symbolism when the couple grows more intimate with each other. Things get a little strange then, but it's all light-hearted.The creature design was also the best we've seen yet from del Toro. He has always favoured physical costume design over post-production. The amphibian man is no different. He looks all the more real for his physical design. This feels homelier amidst the huge shift towards digital effects in modern cinema. There is still some digital effects, but they aren't noticeable. The amphibian man is of course played by long-time collaborator, Doug Jones, who plays nearly all of del Toro's monsters. His acting is impeccable, as is lead actress Sally Hawkins's.The relationships between other characters is excellently written and performed. The one-sided dialogue between Elsa and every other character is surprisingly evocative. This puts all the more emphasis on Elsa and the amphibian man's relationship.The colour scheme of the movie really sets it out visually. The vast majority of the sets are coloured entirely in varying shades of blue and green: a kind of teal. This reflects the coldness of the outside world, the coldness of water, and also the historical context.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Year's Most Original Love Story,"Let's face it one of the most artistic, visual, imaginative Directors alive and working today in Hollywood is Guillermo Del Toro.A CV with Pan's Labyrinth, Crimson Peak, Hellboy and Pacific Rim is definitely going to get your attention and defiantly make you wonder what a director/writer like that is going to concoct next.... well look no further for The Shape Of Water has arrived.The story set in the 60s follows a lonely mute Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who whilst working as a cleaner at secret government Area 51 style facility comes starts to slowly form a bond with a underwater creature that has just arrived to be experimented on under the watchful eye of violent, paranoid, unstable government agent Strickland (Micheal Shannon).The films spins a highly original fairytale yarn that pulls the audience on a journey of the years most unexpected love stories.The script negotiates multiple genres, moods and themes in order to carefully unfold the story through its generous two hour running time.Care and attention to details has been employed here to really justify any choice our characters make by giving all involved real features, flaws and frailties that isn't always the case in many films.The cast lead by Sally Hawkins are on top form clearly making the most of the script Shannon shines as the deeply troubled flawed government agent, Octavia Spencer hot of Hidden Figures performs charismatically as the best friend and Richard Jenkins lavishes his diverse character journey he goes on.Nicely and neatly shot but certainly not as trade mark stunning say as Crimson Peak the director navigates this film with the experienced skill that comes with his twenty plus years experience and shows us here that risks can certainly still be made. And worth the gamble.Whilst the film may not be for everyone, a highly engaging, entertaining and original modern day fairy tale love story like this should prove that originality like romance is not dead.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

There were points where I felt like this story tried a wee bit too hard, but it never strayed far from what it was. It was an un-apologetically monster fairy tale.

Yeah the fish man wasn't the most attractive, but the main character didn't care about that. They were both lacking something and they gave each other what the other was missing.It was a super sweet movie and I even got to laugh a couple of times.

I fell in love with an amorphous amphibian creature,"This was the first film by del Toro that I have seen, and I believe that he has made a very good impression on me. He has crafted here a tale of magical realism, with a wondrous amphibian-like creature (Doug Jones) who falls in love with a mute human girl, Elisa (Sally Hawkins). In many ways, it really feels kind of like a fairy tale, with a narrator (who is introduced at the beginning and disappears and comes back at the end - it felt kind of slapped on however), a mystical and godly creature and its lover, and the evil antagonist, Dick Strickland (Michael Shannon), rife with selfishness and hatred. Each of the characters are intricately written and detailed, and are each characterized in a unique and interesting way, very unlike most anything I have ever seen, but done so well and obviously it makes me wonder why it hasn't been done that way before. And to fill these characters are actors that give some of the best performances of the year, especially Hawkins and Shannon. Hawkins doesn't speak a single word throughout this film and conveys every bit of dialogue she needs through her face alone, aided by her signing which was so fluid it seemed like she learned American Sign Language in its entirety in order to play this part. Shannon does so well playing the villain that I would have been satisfied if it ended with him winning. These are some characters that you can really get behind and root for, no matter what side they're on. The creature was beautiful. I couldn't tell if it was done practically or with CGI and I think that attests to how well it was produced. And to sum it up, the dialogue and story were held with care and each felt finely crafted. Oh, and I want to praise the film for being ballsy as well, there was a full nudity masturbation scene in the first five minutes that totally caught me by surprise.
But, I don't feel that everything about this story was so finely told - mainly the attempt to humanize the creature. He eats eggs like us, he listens to music like us, and he has sex like us? What? They don't exactly bridge this conclusion all that well and it's never really explained why Elisa is attracted to the creature in the first place, aside from the fact she might relate to it emotionally. This kind of makes the love aspect of the story feel a little shotty. I could understand wanting to protect and care for this beast, but Frenching it? Idk del Toro. It felt like some sort of furry/bestiality porn to me, and everything up to this point was some really elaborate foreplay. Maybe it wasn't that intense, but I still got that feeling at points. Also, the pacing felt kind of weird between the climax halfway through the film and the climax at the end. Everything slows down super quickly and it feels like it's The Shape of Molasses. But the ending I will admit does kind of make up for that. It's safe to say that this is one of the best of the year and I am sure that it'll be nominated for some Oscars in at least some regard.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An Update of the ""Other"" in our time: Sadly, it is even worse than before.","I am not going to go over all the different aspects of this movie which I hold in high esteem. But I have not seen reviewers really dig into the theme of the monster, an update of The Creature from the Black Lagoon. A fearful society projects its anxieties onto others, particularly those that cannot defend themselves. The period after WW2, were filled with ""monsters"", particularly those that were created from atomic experiments and blasts. ""Them"", the story of the giant ants, in my mind, encapsulates the fear of American society. The little girl in the movie, the last survivor, is so stunned after the mobile home park she lives in, is destroyed can only say, ""Them"" to the authorities asking what happened. But ""Them"" is the other;Them are the communists of the 40's and 50's'""Them"" are the anti-war protestors of the 60's, and ""Them"" is the reaction of a black president elected and then immediately rejected being an ""other"" part of the ""Them"".

Unexpected Gem,"After watching the trailer, I found myself quite uninterested.I like Guillermo Del Toro's designs, but the 'genre', I suppose, just didn't pull me in.I ended up seeing this film on a whim (mainly went for Odeon Nacho's) and left with a new film to add to my list of favourites.The sets were all absolutely gorgeous throughout. I loved the casting choices and felt like they worked excellently. The music was phenomenal, and the story took me to an emotional place I really didn't expect.

That was a huge pull for me once I started watching. If you're into excellent creature design, it's a Del Toro flick... I feel as though it also had a lovely tinge of war time drama in there too, for good measure. I'm not usually a fan of romance plots, but this one really resonated with me. For all of those reasons, I enjoyed the film from beginning to end.

It is a story of love with a humanoid creature and a human being. They touch on subjects of mistreatment simply because someone or something is different. The film makes an emphasis on how it doesn't matter who we are on the inside or what we look like on the outside it's that your feelings are true to yourself. The character arc of the Amphibian Man is a seat clincher one moment you're scared he's going to bite and the next you're hoping he does bite.

"After more than twenty years in the business, del Toro is still full of surprises","The Shape of Water is a fantasy film starring Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, and Octavia Spencer. Directed and co-written by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim), it is an emotional story about friendship and a refreshing return to the fantasy genre from the veteran filmmaker.In the early 1960s in Baltimore, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute woman, works as a janitor at a top secret government laboratory run by Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). One day, the lab receives a humanoid amphibian creature captured from a South American river. Over a period of time, Elisa forms a special bond with the creature and devises a plan to help it escape with her.Visually stunning and poignant, The Shape of Water is exactly the type of film one would expect from Guillermo del Toro and shows that even after more than twenty years in the business, he is still full of surprises. Like Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water feels like a fairy tale for adults, with its storybook-like tone and fantasy elements. The film is uniquely tailored to del Toro's style, as it likely would have been awkward and disturbing in the hands of any other filmmaker. Sally Hawkins was simply brilliant as the mute Elisa Esposito, considering she has no dialogue whatsoever and her acting is entirely visual. Michael Shannon was also great as Colonel Richard Strickland, a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.I rate it 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Riveting story, great visuals, and emotionally evocative execution","At first glance, the pace of the film seems to move far too quickly. Within the first fifteen minutes, we meet the main characters, the main setting of the movie, the tantalizing merman himself, and start to see the plot developing already. It turns out, rather than being rushed, the film soars through these parts so quickly because it still has so much more to say and show.First off, the film's visual effects, setting, and overall world-building for a sense of Cold War era like technology and culture are very comprehensively developed. From the cars we see, to the casual smoking, to plenty of chauvinism, sexism, racism, fear of the Russians, and pious male self-righteousness, everything fits the time period like a glove. At many points the historical accuracy serves as a stark reminder of the many ways our society was once much more openly bigoted and imposing.My only issue with the visuals would be the merman himself. Seeing him for the first time on screen is jarring, in how low-budget his appearance seems. The merman himself looks like a costume from a movie made in the 60s, very easily a person in a suit rather than an other-worldy creature. With time, the merman's various movements and actions dispel this disbelief, and the immersion of the film comes in to compensate.Most importantly, the story and its execution are absolutely riveting. The phenomenal acting done by the cast, the pacing of the film, the shots, and the musical scores combine in such a way to evoke exactly what the film wants you to be feeling, even if you're aware of the fact. You cringe viscerally when you see characters act villanously. You shout with anger and disbelief at other moments. You feel uncomfortable and weird at other parts. You're tense with suspense and fear and trepidation as the drama develops. The film had me literally on the edge of my seat, almost too much to handle. Some of the best moments of the film get drawn on, seemingly deliberately, before giving the audience a sense of satisfying resolution, hinting at both the film's effect on the audience and how easily the plot could have taken another turn.Overall, I would highly recommend The Shape of Water for its story, its cinematography (and acting), and for the experience.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very simple yet heartfelt story,"7 +It's not Del Toro's best movie, but it's definitely still worth watching for many reasons : from a technical standpoint there's basically nothing to criticize, it really manages to drag the viewer into a sort of parallel reality, a world that is both familiar and fantastic, and the monster's look doesn't break the illusion cause it's so well done it won't look fake. Although the whole story doesn't add anything new to the genre, and it's a little too plain to be honest, all the characters manage to keep you interested in their development and overall look.
The message the movie delivers is heavy, but not heavily handled by the movie itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful movie experience!,"It's so funny that I went to watch this movie in a theater just after I was so disappointed by the latest Tarentino (Quint being in my top 5 Directors of all times), Hateful Eight, I just watched on a big Home Cinema on Netflix.
Here, it is such a great story, so inventive and colorful, so well played, with such great decors and outfits and hairstyle from the 50's or 60's (man, the cars, all so beautiful!). Congratulations Guillermo, you did a really great job here, not the first time, I loved Pan's labyrinth and Hellboy as well back in the day, that movie is first quality and deserves the prices it got granted.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oddly Beautiful,"The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's latest blend of fantasy mysticism and gritty realism. Set around 1960, Sally Hawkins stars as a mute janitor at a research facility who falls in love with a creature that they pulled from the Amazon. This is beautifully played over a cold war backdrop with outstanding supporting performances, like Octavia Spencer as the sassy coworker, Michael Shannon as the sadistic boss, and Richard Jenkins as her struggling neighbor. It is firmly reminiscent of Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, without feeling too similar.There were several moments when it dipped into being unnecessarily crude for a few cheap laughs that felt out of place. They also took her relationship with the creature to a place that kind of undermined the beauty of it and weakened the film as a whole. Del Toro definitely played into the R rating by diverting a touching love story to places that didn't help develop it.The Shape of Water is Del Toro's best work since Pan's Labyrinth and features beautiful cinematography and very strong work by the entire cast. However, it never manages to break through into being a truly great film despite showing the potential.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable,"I find the movie enyoable. It has everithing: suspense, romance, fantasy with a vintage touch. Great directing by del Toro as usual, and Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer made an excelent performance, and what can i say of Michel Shannon, just amaizing and convincing.

How did this win awards?,"""Shape of Water"" was a total letdown! I don't get what all the hype was about. The story was boring and unoriginal, with a cliché romance between a mute woman and a fish-man. It felt like a poor attempt at creating a unique love story. The characters were one-dimensional, and I couldn't connect with any of them.The pacing was incredibly slow, and I found myself yawning throughout the entire movie. The plot dragged on and on, with pointless scenes that added nothing to the story. The visuals were okay, but they couldn't make up for the lackluster plot and characters.The film also had some weird and uncomfortable moments that made me cringe. I couldn't understand the need for certain graphic and unnecessary scenes. It felt like they were trying too hard to shock the audience.Overall, ""Shape of Water"" was a disappointing film that didn't live up to the hype. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one. There are plenty of better movies out there to watch.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Interesting...maybe that's the word..,"How to describe the movie?A mash-up of many genres. Science Fiction, Romance, Spy, Noir....A fairy tale for adults with sexual elements, perhaps...As I sat down the woman next to me advised a couple of friends told her it wasn't very good and then during the viewing of the film a senior woman exclaimed well this is just ridiculous!I like the film. The actors all did great jobs. But it was well out there to say the least. Towards the beginning of the film the lead character masturbates in her bath tub. From that point you know sex is going to be a theme.I enjoyed it, but I don't think it will win the Oscar for best picture.If you go be ready for solo sex and mermaid sex.The music was fantastic as the minor dancing done by some of the actors emulating Hollywood dancers of yore.Worth a rental if you have an open mind and enjoy fantasy/sci-fi.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Year's Big Winner,"Oscar Nominations:So what is 'The Shape of Water'? I suppose that question might have two different meanings, so lets start with the simplest question 'how do you describe the form that real, liquid, water takes? Seems like an easy question until you try to answer it. 'Like a liquid', doesn't really cut it, and something like 'a blob, or pool, of liquid' ends up being circular. Ultimately, to answer that question, one has to end up saying something like 'it takes the form of whatever container it is in'. And that may be about as good an answer as it gets.Interestingly, the answer seems to work in response to the same question about the movie 'The Shape of Water' - it will likely take on the form that each viewer wants to see in it. The movie has a moving, shifting, and yes, fluid, nature to it that defies easy categories. If, like me, you find it convenient to peg movies with genre labels to help understand what emotions and thoughts it will likely inspire, the exercise with this movie will be a little frustrating.The Internet Movie Database (IMDb), puts it in boxes labeled Adventure, Drama, and Fantasy. And I suppose it has elements of those. There is a plot-line involving Russian spies, and a scheme to steal an important 'asset'. And the 'asset' in question isn't exactly human, at least from outward appearances and so represents a fantastical creature of the imagination. Certainly, some of its deepest moments reflect heartfelt emotion tinged with tragedy.But the movie could just as easily be called a work of science fiction, because of its setting (a 1960s research lab) and similarities to other science fiction classics (like Creature from the Black Lagoon). There are moments that provoke laughter as you see buffoonish characters, bumbling their way through a scenario that almost evokes scenes from the Three Stooges, or the Carol Burnett show. At times it could certainly be considered a 'thriller'. And, as the trailers convey, it is also a romance, even with requisite, and non-gratuitous, sex scenes.In short, this movie defies description and that is, I think, part of its intriguing charm. This movie, like water, takes the shape of the container that you put it in. The fact that it succeeds so well, regardless of how you look at it, is a testament to the high quality of the film. It meets or exceeds expectations.And the expectations were high. The Shape of Water was the Oscar darling this year, receiving the most nominations (13), and winning the most awards (4), including Best Picture of the year. It received nominations above and below-the-line, reflecting the fact that it was a balanced movie with quality attention lavished in nearly all aspects of the movie craft.The Shape of Water is the brain-child of Guillermo del Toro, who wrote, directed, and produced the movie. He was nominated for the original screenplay and won the Oscar for directing it. This is not his first trip into Oscar-country - he was nominated in 2006 for both writing and directing Pan's Labyrinth, a movie that shares a lot of traits with this one, including a fantastical creature, and relationships that can only be characterized as surreal. The earlier movie might be considered practice for this one, which achieves a level of surrealism that seems even more plausible. Del Toro has displayed his science fiction and fantasy roots in writing and directing the Hellboy series and the first two Pacific Rim movies (not counting the most recent one, released earlier this year.). And he showed how easily he can coax human sentiments out of non-human characters in his fabulous Hobbit movies. In a real sense, Shape of Water might be considered as the highest expression of his art form.The vision of the writer and director is important, but without great actors, the message doesn't get delivered. Casting Sally Hawkins in the leading role, as a mute and very sensitive janitor, Elisa Esposito, was a stroke of genius. She was nominated for leading actress - but lost to Frances McDormand in Three Billboards - and was previously nominated for her supporting role in Blue Jasmine (with Cate Blanchett). Although she normally plays supporting roles, her facial expressions and body movements, in this movie, convey her strong acting abilities even though she has no real dialogue throughout the entire film.As noted before, with the Three Billboards movie, it helps when the entire acting ensemble is of high quality since the acting gets reinforced as each actor plays off the others. Hawkins is lucky to work with several exceptional supporting actors, two of them also receiving Oscar nominations. Richard Jenkins, who plays her next door neighbor, Giles, and the sympathetic narrator of the movie, received a leading actor nomination for the Visitor several years ago. And Octavia Spencer, was previously nominated for her supporting role in Hidden Figures, and won the Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in The Help, plays Elisa's co-worker at the research laboratory. She is a perfect verbal counterweight for Elisa's silent machinations.Not nominated, but playing critically important roles, are Michael Shannon as the government- spy-bureaucrat-villain, and Doug Jones, who plays the all important creature (and also never speaks!). The combination of these actors creates a fluid ensemble that flows together perfectly.A great movie, though, isn't just above-the-line. del Toro was able to bring together a team of craftspeople of exceptional talent. The movie won nominations for cinematography, film editing, costumes, and production design, winning the Oscar in the last category. The design does a terrific job of evoking a 1960s science fiction setting, in combination with a feel from an early James Bond movie (think Thunderball). The camera work makes use of lots of contrasting lights and darks with light sources reflected off of metal surfaces. And the creature's costume is a perfect job of suggesting creepiness and beauty at the same time, part of successfully suggesting multiple emotions. (Apparently it took Doug Jones three hours to get into costume every day!).Shape of Water also received nominations for sound editing, sound mixing, and original score. Because so much of the movie revolves in and around water, there were special challenges in rendering sounds that reflected that environment. And although I hate to say it, the music from Alexander Desplat is so 'liquid' in nature that he certainly evokes the spirit of the movie, and deserves the Oscar for original score - his second Oscar and ninth nomination.
The Shape of Water is a very big movie in a tight, compact package. Although I haven't seen all of the Best Picture nominated movies yet, this one clearly deserves the Oscar so far. It will puzzle you, confound you, and astound you, all at the same time. It takes the shape of whatever container you want to put it in, and leaves you better off than you were before.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Above Average Creature Feature With Stellar Production Design,"A wonderful amalgamation of sumptuous production design, lush camerawork, composed direction & excellent lead performance, The Shape of Water continues Guillermo del Toro's fascination with monsters and is an unconventional story of love that's pure, perceptive & poetic.Set in 1960s America during the Cold War, The Shape of Water tells the story of a mute woman who works at a top secret facility as a janitor where she encounters a captured humanoid amphibian creature, with whom she forms a unique bond & later helps him escape from his captivity.Co-written & directed by Guillermo del Toro (best known for The Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth & Crimson Peak), of all the films that I've seen from the notable filmmaker, The Shape of Water is the weakest. Nothing about it is terrible actually but there is nothing about it that's memorable either.It's a typical love story between atypical characters that's crafted with affection, told with tenderness & decorated with splendid set pieces. There is a warmth to their blossoming romance at first but it becomes monotonous during the second half. That dance scene in particular is absolutely cringeworthy.There isn't much to complain in the technical department though. The set pieces in Guillermo del Toro films are usually so finely detailed & refined that much of it is often mistaken for computer generated imagery. Brilliantly utilising the shades of green, Cinematography give its images a luminous quality & fairy tale vibe.Editing calmly directs its different subplots towards the same outcome but pacing is a bit on the slow side, plus there are moments that could have used a few trims. Alexandre Desplat's score resonates a tenderness of its own with its serene tracks though the songs (both original & incorporated) fail to uplift the whole narrative.Coming to the performances, The Shape of Water packs a reliable cast amongst whom Sally Hawkins impress the most in what's a silent rendition that's packed with sincere emotions. Doug Jones adds yet another non-human character to his collection while Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg & Michael Shannon provide good support in their given roles.On an overall scale, The Shape of Water is beautiful to look at and makes splendid use of the director's trademarks but it definitely isn't one of del Toro's finest films. The subplots are more interesting than the main story at hand here, but Hawkins does well to keep us invested in her character's journey to an extent. In short, The Shape of Water is an above average creature feature wrapped in a pretty package.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad,"I decided to watch it after the Oscar nominations are revealed and this film leads with the number of nominations - 14 I think, if I remember correctly.So, you would expect a lot from the film with that many nominations and ... the film is not bad, but it is not mind blowing either. It has an interesting story and it has a very interesting end. Though her marks on the neck gave away - for me - right away what is going to happen.I like the artsy side of it. The creature is ...well...somewhere in between. I like the atmosphere of the apartment of the cleaner girl. The other cleaner lady was great too. in her role, but mute girl was really into the role.Music was interesting and I liked the whole 50's vibe.I have seen better films nominated for Oscars this year and I have to say this is not among my favorites.

Great Entertainment,"You can't help but feel that The Shape of Water uses a lot of other films for influences. Although it's understandable that some may find it a little too sweet I really enjoyed the movie.This is Guillermo del Toro at his Pan's Labyrinth best. The film is scattered with several breathtaking scenes. At the start of these scenes you breath in and know that you are about to be wowed for the next few minutes. I've always been a big fan of Michael Shannon and never have his talents been better showcased than the role of Richard Strickland. Sally Hawkins is also excellent in the lead role of Elisa who is a isolated mute cleaner working at a secret government agency.Not for the action junkies, but everyone else should give it a viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Really Cute!,I enjoyed this film. I know its not a great as Pans Labyrinth but it is a cute love story. The actors put on a stellar performance I felt engaged and interested in the characters and wanted to see where the story went. The effects were also top notch and it was great to see so much of it was done practically because it added a nice layer of reality despite the fairy tale feel. However even if it is a nice love story between a mute lady and a fish man there is some very serious and bloody moments which is a nice contrast. So if you want to see a love story with some gritty elements go check it out.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Love Story Folks,"The mainstream audiences apparently struggled to enjoy this film by Guillermo del Toro, but critics and the academy alike enjoyed it. The comparison to Beauty and the Beast is understandable, but not quite accurate. The idea of social injustice and how immigrants are treated hits closer to home, and for those looking for a hidden message, sure why not. But what happened to just good old fashion storytelling? Do we really need an angle, or a strong political message?The Shape of Water spins a beautiful yarn of two characters in love. Is it forbidden love? Of course. But more importantly it's the kind of love where these two only exist for each other. The film's closing narrative of a poem does an excellent job of explaining ""The Shape of Water"", which is the expression and theme of their love in the story. Michael Shannon continues to be the consummate bad guy, while Sally Hawkins tip toes into the unknown for quite a strange role. Substance is lacking nowadays in most movies so it's no wonder why it took home the Oscar. Watch this film for a good story that moves well, and delivers in the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A visually stunning thriller,"I'm a fan of thriller movies, and among all the thrillers I've ever seen, ""The Shape of Water"" is definitely one of the best in terms of visuals. The cinematography, production design, visual effects, and music score are all top-notch, making the viewing experience rather pleasant. It is surely a strong contender in the technical categories of the coming Oscars.The acting performances are also noteworthy. Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins and Michael Stuhlbarg all give unforgettable and natural acting. Michael Shannon proves again why he is one of the best actors in his generation by perfectly playing the villain.The storytelling and character development, on the other hand, are not that satisfying. Overall speaking, the pace is fine and taut. But the third act is overlong, and some interactions between ""the thing"" and humans (after people rescue ""the thing"" from the lab) are completely unnecessary. The director may try to make the audiences emotionally resonant, but fails in the end. The love between Elisa and ""the thing"" looks especially strange: no human wants to make love with a monster. The character development is largely disappointing in the sense that almost every character is flat and one-dimensional.All in all, I would give the film a 75/100 rating.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very unique and quite good,"Baltimore, 1962: In the midst of the Cold War, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a young mute woman who works as a janitor in a government laboratory. At her workplace, she becomes intrigued and fascinated by a recently captured man-like sea creature that is confined in a water tank.This film is courageous in its combining a historical era with fantasy science-fiction. It is occasionally far-fetched (during that paranoid time/place, it's hard to believe Elisa would have such easy, unsupervised access to the lab with the sea-creature) but it is mostly believable within its bizarre, unusual universe.While it may not live fully up to the awards-hype it is getting, it is still praiseworthy in many ways. Director Guillermo del Toro works with a great team to draw the viewer into his fascinating world especially in two thrilling scenes - one of which is the finale. The cinematography (by Dan Laustsen), the music (by Alexandre Desplat), and the set design team work superbly to recreate a long-ago era through a unique lens. And the cast is equally amazing.Though Hawkins' performance has many similarities to her recent work in ""Maudie"", she succeeds greatly in the current film to show passion and determination despite her limits in being able to communicate verbally. The other characters and their respective performers are more than noteworthy: Richard Jenkins as Elisa's neighbour - an underemployed homosexual who has trouble with aging and finding work as an illustrator (his personal story could have been even more elaborated); Michael Shannon as a high-ranking official in Elisa's workplace - he's even more monstrous than the sea creature he regards with indifferent contempt; Michael Stuhlbarg as a scientist whose own story provides plot twists; and Octavia Spencer as Elisa's sharp-talking co-worker and loyal friend.One thing is for certain: ""The Shape of Water"" is in a category of its own. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beauty and the Beast meets Creature from the Black Lagoon,"As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I was absolutely hooked. Fantasy romance with Guillermo del Toro directing and writing? Sounded like the perfect combination.I'm fairly familiar with some of del Toro's other works (Pan's Labyrinth, The Strain, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Crimson Peak, etc) many of which I loved, and this movie can be ranked up there with the best of his films. It was visually stunning from beginning to end, with a beautiful dark fantasy like feel throughout each scene. The whole film gives a sense of being underwater with reflective surfaces and gloomy aesthetics, making it absolute gorgeous to watch.The characters are wonderfully developed. The relationship between Elisa and the Asset is not one we as an audience are unfamiliar with, but presented in a rather unique manner with the presence of various obstacles to their love. The childish innocence of the Asset and Elisa's wit and caring attitude come together in an adorable romance that warms the heart. The side characters offer their own unique quirks to the story and help to lighten some of the action in the film.This film was so different from many of the others from this year and a welcome change. Highly recommend to those who love romance or tend to be jaded by the genre. There is something in this film for all.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Bend me, shape me, anyway you want me!","Guillermo del Toro directs and co-writes with Vanessa Taylor what would turn out to be the Best Picture Academy Award Winner for 2017. A much loved film that's not without dissention in certain quarters, it's a picture that warrants dissention but it should be noted that just because someone doesn't like it, that doesn't make it a bad film. I'm certainly in the camp that finds it over praised, even annoyingly disappointing, whilst appreciating many of the facets within its production.Story in simple terms is a Beauty and the Beast like fable where Sally Hawkins' mute cleaning lady Elisa Esposito falls in love with a captured Amphibian Man. Amphibian Man is known by the government types as The Asset, and as the Cold War rises and 60s paranoia takes a hold, the American big wigs want to vivisect the special species to learn from it. Elisa, after courting ""The Asset"", enlists the help of close friends and plots to free the creature from its captivity in the underground medical bunker labyrinth place.Now as simple as that sounds, there is more to it than that, del Toro and Taylor whilst enveloping the pic in a fantasy realm feel, ensure messages are thrust hard at the viewers. Be it the racial disharmony, the quest for different walks of life finding love with each other, the cry for humans to stop being bad and killing things because they don't understand them, torture is evil and etc etc. It's all right there in your face and we get it. So plot maybe simple but for sure there's a lot being said in the narrative.Yet as great as it looks, and it's superbly acted by Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer, it just to me loses its way come the mid-point, getting daft and even getting a little icky into the bargain. I have no problem with improbabilities and outrageous contrivances here, this is del Toro painting one of his fantastical worlds - only on Earth in the early 60s! But the pay off is poor, hinging on a twist that's not only ridiculous, but insulting as well because otherwise the pic would be very troubling indeed. No art deco eye orgasms or vibrant characterisations can compensate for a film that runs out of steam.That said, I was glad to have watched it, there's even a possibility I could return to it in the future - this is very good film making. But it's not a great film by any stretch of the imagination and not for the first time in the Academy's long history, many are baffled by their choice of Best Picture winner. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pain,"It kind of pains me that Guillermo del Toro would turn out a movie I ended up rejecting rather completely. His same sumptuous visuals are present along with that precise but weird approach to monster design, and yet, the script is something of a complete mess of coincidence while its villain is so cartoonishly evil that its obvious attempts at elevating Creature from the Black Lagoon end up falling apart.Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute janitor at a secret government facility in Baltimore in the early 1960s along with her best friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer). Elisa is a lonely individual who lives by routine getting herself ready for her nightshift and spending her mornings afterwards with her neighbor, Giles (Richard Jenkins), a gay man and ad painter working on a picture of red Jello for his former ad agency employer. Into Elisa's life comes The Amphibian Man (Doug Jones), the latest addition to the lab, held in chains and large tanks, and the capture of the head of security, Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon).Now, the first act or so of the film I was actually pretty on board with. It was about establishing the characters and the world, and del Toro and his cowriter, Vanessa Taylor, do a good job of laying out everything from Elisa's domestic existence in the dual apartments over a movie theater to the workings of the lab, including the wide-eyed scientist Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg). The only wrong note is Shannon himself as Strickland. I don't think he's supposed to come off as so thoroughly an awkward weirdo (the whole washing his hands in the bathroom bit is an argument against that, but still), but Shannon cannot play warm and charming. There do seem to be moments where he's supposed to be playing warm and charming, and he just comes off as veiled and threatening. He's honestly just wrong for the part, and I think someone like Jon Hamm would have done much better like his role in Baby Driver.Anyway, the Amphibian Man is being tortured by Strickland for...unclear purposes. It's supposedly about something dealing with the Space Race, the specimen's ability to breath in and out of water being key to going to space (I think this detail is actually borrowed from one of the Creature films, but I can't say for sure without digging, and I don't feel like doing that), and it is another one of those issues I have with the film. It exists in this space between the cheesy plots of 50s monster/sci-fi movies that never made much sense and this earnest attempt to update it to a more modern sensibility. When the plot mechanics end up being silly nonsense that can be dismissed with a handwave while everything else is treated so seriously, it creates this discordant effect that jars with the more serious stuff (the characters and romance and threat) around it.That also leads back to Strickland who is cartoonishly evil. I think he kind of needs to be for the plot to move as quickly as it does, but I was often comparing him to Captain Vidal in Pan's Labyrinth, an actual Spanish fascist with more depth and interesting wrinkles than this guy who puts his bloodied, gauzed hand over his wife's mouth to shut her up while he's having sex with her or is so easy to let out his talk of racial superiority to Zelda's face. He's so thoroughly unappealing as to be uncompelling. And, to make me roll my eyes even more, the one good guy in the lab, Hoffstetler, ends up being a Soviet spy. I mean, whatever. Sure, his Soviet handlers end up just as bad as Strickland, but sure, the people who ran the Holodomor are just as bad as the US military. Okay. Moving on.What ends up irritating me in smaller snippets throughout, though, are the coincidences that drive the plot. They're everywhere from, after Elisa gets the Amphibian Man out of the facility and into her flat, he ends up running off, and she can only find him by happening to find perfectly placed handprints to show where he is. Or how, in a key moment with military personnel in the room to describe their next steps with the specimen, Elisa is not only in the room, she is only spotted by the one person who wouldn't turn her in. Or, when Strickland is in his final chase and has no clues on where to go next, he just happens to find the exact place where Elisa is going. It's just too many little coincidences that add up to a script that honestly needed another polish to iron some of this stuff out.And that leads me to the film's visuals, which are largely a treat (for all of my issues with the script and Shannon's performance, del Toro has lost none of his visual acumen), but they sometimes don't make a whole lot of sense in ways that kind of call out that they don't make sense. Namely, I'm thinking of the bit when Elisa fills her entire bathroom with water so that she and the Amphibian Man can swim naked in it. It's a nice moment in a vacuum, but then del Toro expands it out to show the door leaking everywhere and even the water going through the floor to the theater below, and I just started thinking about how the thin layer of tile and the boards that formed her floor could not carry that much weight. Suddenly, the reality of water in a space like that came out in ways that I don't think del Toro intended. He wanted magical, and I started thinking of supporting planks because of what del Toro showed me.That's the one visual I have a problem with, though, the rest of the movie is gorgeous and doesn't break itself doing it. The deep greens of the images combined with del Toro's strong framing and propensity for fairy tale imagery works quite well in the film. The performances beyond Shannon are also quite good. Hawkins is, of course, the standout as the mute who finally finds love with a fishman, but I always appreciate Michael Stuhlbarg whenever he pops into a movie.In the end, this almost feels like an attempt to mimic del Toro rather than an actual del Toro movie. Plotting is too off. Characterization is too one-note. But, it looks good and has some good performances. I actually do like the first act, but how everything ends up playing out and the thinness of the antagonist ends up weighing the film down so much that by the end I'm not swept up in the romantic gestures and resolutions by the end. I'm just tired of the machinations that never felt right.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pure movie magic in my favourite film of 2017,"I fell in love with this movie from the opening scene. It is everything a great movie should be -- a compelling story with wonderful characters; it looks amazing, both through natural cinematography and visual effects; it is familiar enough to be warm yet new enough to be boldly original; the casting is perfect.
 
I originally saw this at a press screening at The Toronto International Film Festival in September and I was so enthralled that I did something I have never done before: I went back to see the same movie again at the same film festival. The second viewing was inThe Elgin Theatrein Toronto which is used as a key location in the film, so the audience erupted into applause when we reached the main scene set there -- we were watching the characters standing in a cinema in 1960s Baltimore, yet they were in the very cinema in which we were watching them! It was the icing on the cake in terms of sealing the magic into the viewing experience. I even sat in the same row of the cinema as the characters in the movie were placed.
 
I had the privilege of attending writer/directorGuillermo del Toro's screen talk at The London Film Festival and hearing moreabout the production, including its childhood connection toCreature from the Black Lagoon (1954). Simply wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A captivating tale,"This film tells the story of a mute woman who bonds with a mysterious amphibious creature in a top secret research facility.The story is captivating because it portrays the mute woman's inner world fully. I can feel her bonding with the creature, out of being misunderstood, and out of being lonely. They are in the same shoes, and they break every imaginable barrier to bond. It is a beautiful story, even with its occasional violence and goriness. Sally Hawkins was great in ""Maudie"", and she is equally great in ""The Shape of Water"" as well.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
IT´S A POEM!,"So, Del Toro did it again! (oops)
Always with the monsters storys, the dark face of ""the society"", the hate and violence of the military, the fear to the rare ones, the diffferent ones, the bullying of the strongest against the weakers, and of course, the dosis of fear to the foreing nation, Russia... I found this film beautiful in so many ways, the photography direction, the art direction, the interpretation of every body (except for the monster). The screenplay were perfect, with every twist where it needs to be, with the just amount of mawkish, of adventure, of risk... Simply, a poem!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Imaginative... but also really weird,"I like weird. Sometimes. This movie is definitely weird and highly fantastical.

Beautiful visually.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A surreal fairytale that's far more effective than it should be.,"This film is quite special for me. It's the first film (aside from standard Marvel/Star Wars etc. films) that I've actually been excited for, and anxiously awaiting it's release. Since it came out in America first, I also heard how good many people thought it was.Now, I haven't watched nearly as much of Guillermo Del Toro's work as I would have liked, and that's something i'm working to change, but I've enjoyed everything I've seen that he was linked to. This is the first of his works that I've seen in the cinema, and at this rate, he may end up as one of my favourite directors. Everything he does has tremendous style, whether it's a surreal 1960s romance featuring a fish man, or monoliths of metal and monsters clashing. Of course, The Shape of Water looks gorgeous despite it's relatively small budget of 19 million dollars. Despite how much I enjoyed Black Panther, TSoW had a budget 1/10th of the size and in my opinion, looked better. The creature effects were brilliant, and Del Toro captured the feel of the setting wonderfully.The music was quite gorgeous, and fit the setting remarkably. The soundtrack sounds like songs you might have heard at the time. It also captures much of the morbid whimsy the film holds throughout.Speaking of morbidity, I was surprised by the violence throughout the film. Despite my excitement for it's release, I'd never actually noted it's rating. I'd assumed it to be a PG-13 or something of the sort, but it holds (and earns) a hard R rating. The gore was almost distractingly good, and depending on the scene somebody watches, they could be forgiven for thinking they were watching a horror film.Surprisingly, I enjoyed every performance in the film. Sally Hawkins made good on a tremendous task; her character Elisa is mute throughout the film, and as a result, all of ehr acting must be done through body language and facial expression. This fact, coupled with the older setting, often reminded me of the classic silent films. Octavia Spencer also does wonderfully, and the duo have great chemistry despite the lack of words between the pair. Richard Jenkins also brought some much needed levity to many situations, while Michael Shannon gave our antagonist legitimate vulnerability, keeping him from remaining a simple, bland villain.Every character is interesting in their own way, and it's quite interesting seeing how this group of outcasts interacts with one another all throughout. There is a mute woman, a black lady, a gay gentleman, a Russian spy and a literal fishman, yet they all feel more human than our villain, despite how the world of the film may portray them.The plot, for the most part, is rather odd though I imagine this was intentional. The whole film feels rather akin to a fairytale, albeit a far more mature one with nudity and blood. Many times throughout the film, I felt extremely uncomfortable, though I feel this was the intended reaction; it really added to the scene, and the film overall. Even though I could tell the vague direction of the plot from the trailer alone, I wasn't at all disappointed after watching the film. The journey to the destination was far more important in this instance. I imagine you could even watch this film chopped up and reassembled in the wrong order; it looks simply gorgeous.Though, of course, I may be biased due to how excited I was for this film, I struggle to find many flaws with it. It just seems to have clicked with me, and at the risk of rating two films extremely highly right next to each other, I shall give this film a 9.5/10, especially due to it's budget. I don't give it a 10 simply due to a few moments which didn't land for me, personally.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Del Toro does it again,"'The Shape of Water' is the latest movie from Guillermo and, if you've seen anything he's done before, you should have a good idea of what you're going to get. I'd say, out of all his previous work, this is closest to the much-lauded 'Pan's Labyrinth.' Personally, I enjoyed that one, too, but I do recall one of my friends saying something about how he went into the film expecting a monster/sci-fi/fantasy film and all he got was a war film with a couple of fantastical scenes. Okay, so his appraisal was technically correct, however I stand with the majority of audiences when I say I didn't mind that - just like I didn't mind that 'The Shape of Water' was basically a war film with a monster thrown in there.However, that than being a subtitled film set during the Second World War, this time we go a little closer to present day and find ourselves in 'Cold War' America where government agents have captured a mysterious humanoid/reptilian life-form and intend to use it in their space-race (I'm not sure how this was to be achieved, but never mind!). Again, anyone who has seen any of Del Toro's previous films where a humanoid aquatic creature is involved, can probably picture what this one looks like (especially as it's even played by the same actor!). And, it's fair to say that this weird-looking half-fish-man isn't having a whale of a time (pun intended). He's routinely tortured by scientists and equally-creepy men in black (primarily) by Michael Shannon - who's probably more of a monster than the monster itself thanks to his overuse of an electronic cattle-prod device of torture!However, just when it looks like our fishy friend is doomed to a life of torture and dissection, he's befriended by young cleaning lady (Elisa, played by Sally Hawkins) who's also completely mute. They then form a bizarre friendship which - hopefully - will lead to a better life for both of them.I enjoyed 'The Shape of Water,' but I can see that it's probably not for everyone. If you're a fan of Del Toro's other work then you'll like it. The sets and period details and perfect and a wonderfully-magic atmosphere is created out of a normally mundane setting. At first I found it a little weird, having a protagonist who never uttered a word for the entire two-hour runtime, but Hawkins is a capable lead and uses all other bodily actions and expressions to convey just what she's thinking and feeling (plus she can curse using sign language!). Like I say, it is two hours and, although beautiful to watch, does tend to feel a little overly-long here and there.Richard Jenkins plays Elisa's friend and provides some much-needed 'heart' and humour into the film, but the stand-out goes to Michael Shannon, who portrays the most sinister man in black since 'Agent Smith' from 'The Matrix.'Don't expect wall-to-wall action, think of this as more of a 'Pan's Labyrinth' type film just with more 'signing' and less subtitles. Also, if you have a soft spot for cats, you may want to close your eyes mid-way through - or just never bring a wild monster home if you have pets.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantasy love drama,"Another movie that will have a lot of lovers and haters. You can count me in the people that like The Shape Of Water. I didn't expect anything else when I saw it was a movie by Guillermo Del Toro. His trademark of weird dark fantasy movies is something you have to like to appreciate his movies. If you didn't like Pan's Labyrinth or Hellboy then just don't watch this one because you won't like it either. But if you do just go ahead and enjoy the show. I don't say it's his best movie, to me that's still Pan's Labyrinth, but it's certainly worth watching. The makeup and effects are very good, as is the cast. Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito, playing a mute in love with the creature, did a very good job. Michael Shannon, he just never disappoints. He's one of those actors that can play anything. The story is a fantasy drama, a love story between a mute and a strange water creature. Nothing fantastic as a story but the execution makes it worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A socio-political fairy tale epic.,"In many ways The Shape of Water is a classic Guillermo Del Toro film. All the director's hallmarks are present: it's a fable, it's set against a socio-political backdrop, and it's about a monster.That first point is worth bearing in mind. Del Toro's films are always larger than life, and while that can work against him (Pacific Rim was too silly for many), here the broad tone helps offset the edginess of the material. And things get pretty damn edgy.That's where Del Toro seems to be trying something new. He's always had a taste for cinematic violence, but his films stayed pretty chaste until 2015's Crimson Peak. That film seems to have whet (wet) his appetite for kink, and here he really runs (swims) with it.This is a romance between two different species, one of them a fish-man imprisoned in a government laboratory. Del Toro never sugar coats the fact that the creature (beautifully performed by Doug Jones), is bestial, as likely to bite your fingers off as he is to wordlessly woo the cleaning lady.Sally Hawkins plays the recipient of the mer-dude's affections, a mute woman who takes care of her neighbour, an artist portrayed by Richard Jenkins. They are fantastic, as is the rest of the cast, all reliable heavy hitters.Michael Shannon plays, as he often does, a bureaucrat whose buttoned-down exterior masks a complete maniac. Of all the story beats his is the broadest. No prizes for guessing who turns out to be the real monster here.The film starts out with a level of whimsy comparable to Amelie, before delving into darker waters. Racism and homophobia begin to loom, and while the parallels Del Toro is drawing will be too clunky for some, the film's huge heart and good intentions are always on display.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant directing job by Guillermo del Toro,"The Shape of Water is brilliantly directed by Guillermo del Toro and is set in the Cold War era of the 1960's. The U.S. Military has found a creature in the jungles of South America, an Amphibian Man (that looks a lot like the 1960's monster, The Creature From the Black Lagoon), and they want to use it as a military weapon against the Russians. The Russians want it too. That's the big picture the film hangs its hat on.The deeper story is about Elsa (Sally Hawkins) and how her lonely life changes when she comes into contact with the ""secret experiment"" that the government is keeping in a military facility. She and her co- worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) are part of the cleaning crew and it doesn't take long for them to discover that there's something different going on at the military facility.It seems odd, but the movie is also a love story. Elsa sees the cruelty that the government's project head treats the amphibian man with (the sadistic head of the project is played by Michael Shannon) and she sneaks into his holding area at the facility to show him kindness and to show the amphibian man he's not all alone.The theme of loneliness runs deep thru the movie. At home Elsa lives next door to an artist (Richard Jenkins) who's character is a gay man in the 1960's. They are both each other's only friend. The characters are all well developed and del Toro gives you a good insight into the lives they are all living.Octavia Spencer is stellar in the movie. While Sally Hawkins character Elsa, who was born not being able to talk, is the main character, it's Spencer's character, Zelda, who keeps the movie moving along.It seems odd but the interaction between Elsa and the monster is beautiful. It's a fairy tale love story like in Beauty and the Beast. However, the movie seems to go off the rails for about thirty minutes with a fantasy scene about a musical (the monster actually dances) and a few other scenes that would be a spoiler for the film. But overall the movie has way more good stuff than bad.The Shape of Water is rated R for nudity and graphic violence and has a run time of 2 hours and 3 minutes. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" I rate this movie a LARGE.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Seriously over hyped,"There are some actors and directors that can do no wrong in the eyes of The Academy and serious critics. Guillermo del Toro is definitely one of those directors. Don't get me wrong , he has made some very good films but sadly , in my opinion , The Shape of Water is definitely not one of them.
In the hidden high security government laboratory where she works, lonely Elisa is trapped in a life of isolation. Elisa's life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda discover a secret classified experiment on a water based man like creature. Elisa finds she is falling in love with a creature that others want dead.I really do not know what all the fuss was about with this film. Sure , Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon are good but they usually always are. This had the feel of an average story that you might have seen on an episode of The Twilight Zone . For a Del Toro film the special affects were very average , almost like a B movie from back in the day. Perhaps that was what he was trying to achieve ?
Why this is has been nominated for 13 Oscars is a mystery to me because this film was average at best.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The main character is a mute woman, her best friend and neighbor is a middle age gay men, her colleage is a black woman and this is all in the cold war so it could't be harder to be ""diferent"" in those times. and then we have a love history between a ""fishguy"" and a cleaning woman.

"Entertaining throughout, but also forgettable.","The Shape of Water excels in several different departments. Its really well helmed in terms of directing and shot composition. The lighting and set designs were exquisite. The main performance by Sally Hawkins and main supporting performance by Richard Jenkins were amazing (Michael Shannon also delivers a delicious but fairly one note role as well) However the movie just feels forgettable, nothing about the story or the way its told is that great. Its hard to put in words exactly why but just from a subjective point of view the story was lacking a bit.I didn't really care that much about the characters. The romance felt forced and rushed to me. The main character basically falls in love with the amphibian just after a couple of meetings with him. The character does explain to here dad at one point why she is in love with him (in an attempt to get him to help her free it) but based on the scenes we have actually seen with the two of them it didn't feel justified.There are some plot holes that are forgivable but a little distracting, and also some out of character moments. But those are just nit picks. A bigger problem would be the anti climatic ending but I won't get into spoilers but lets just say it was unsatisfying.Overall this is a decent film for sure, one that is overall entertaining and is never boring, but don't expect it to knock your socks off or anything (unlike the directors last fantasy film Pans Labyrinth which I truly regard as one of the greatest films ever made).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Thematically Unusual and Visually Striking,"In this unusual mesh of fantasy, romance and science fiction, a mute woman working as a lab custodian in the late 60s falls for an abused, captive sea monster. The film dons many hats, several at the same time, which distract and compete for attention: that central relationship, the military's plans for the creature, a neighbor's quest to reclaim his job with an ad agency, a coworker's marriage, a supervisor's frustrated home life. Each adds a layer to the onion skin, and color to the world, but ultimately they feel like light diversions from the main course. On a technical level, it's exceptional. Guillermo del Toro's work has never been short on conceptual know-how, and The Shape of Water merely continues his habit of one-upping the preceding film. The beast itself, heavily influenced by The Creature from the Black Lagoon with a hint or two of Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy, looks fantastic. Lifelike and expressive, it's easy to buy into as a thinking, feeling participant in the story. Sally Hawkins is wonderful as the human lead, drawing inspiration from dozens of classic silent films in her flourishing role as a mousey, passionate, eloquent young woman. Set designs, too, are distinct and remarkable, from the slimy, clinical confines of the military science lab to her crusty, crumbling apartment just above an active movie theater. The plot drags, though, and more than once edges awfully close to cliche. I enjoyed it, particularly on a thematic level, but I wish it was about twenty minutes shorter.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fairy tale for our troubled times,"A classic love story with a reptilian twist, Guillermo del Toro's latest love letter to cinema, The Shape of Water, is a marvel to behold. Set against the backdrop of 1960's America and the accompanying Cold War paranoia, each frame of the film feels meticulously crafted. Marked by dark shadows and moody lighting, the film has a distinct noir feel. Yet punctuating the aesthetic gloom is a story brimming with light and indefatigable charm. It's del Toro's most sophisticated work to date, a master-class in mood setting and emotionally affecting filmmaking, even if it feels a little too self-satisfied at times.The story follows Eliza (Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor who feels ""incomplete"". She lives in a quaint apartment atop of a movie theatre and spends her days as a cleaner in a top-secret government facility. There she falls in love with an amphibious fish-like being (Doug Jones) who is imprisoned by the government and subject to cruel studies and experiments. Taken aback by the way the creature sees her for what she is, not what she isn't, she falls in love and conspires with her co-worker (Octavia Spencer) and neighbour (Richard Jenkins) to break the creature out.Once the love story takes shape, it doesn't deviate from the expected. Del Toro seems less interested in developing a complex narrative but rather providing depth through the film's mise-en-scene. While, at times, this makes the story feel a little stagnant and complacent, del Toro is nothing if not a distinct visual stylist. Set in 1962 Baltimore, the quintessential Americana setting is juxtaposed with French styled influences. The film's whimsical elements feel like del Toro channelling the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, with the music, quirky characters, quaint sets and surreal slant all trademarks of Jeunet's work. The film is a celebration of cinema just as much as it is about the power of imagination. It's a joy to behold and a latter half homage to Fred Astaire, by way of standout musical number, is one of the many inspired choices throughout the film.What allows the narrative to flourish, however, is Sally Hawkins' emotionally charged performance. She is able to communicate a wealth of emotion without uttering a single word. Her delicate and understated performance anchors the fanciful story and provides nuance to the central romance between Eliza and the creature. The companionship they share is one of deep humanity and, in a world too quick to judge, Hawkins' layered performance ensures their relationship never feels unbelievable.The Shape of Water is ultimately a story about the importance of communication and understanding at a time when otherness was seen as threatening and unwelcome. The parallels to the present day are not hard to draw and while the story plays it a little safe, del Toro paints it with a tenderness few artists achieve. The purity of vision on display is the work of master auteur and something seen far too rare these days. The Shape of Water is a classic love story, told with modern relevance and truly a tale for our troubled times.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A too predictable heart tugger,"Guillermo del Toro is known for the weird and his style. But this thing, if you want to call it a movie, barely rates a 6 for me.The acting is excellent, and has good production values, but that's pretty much it. The story is too predictable. The black lagoon creature is sympathetic, but barely so. The love story is hard to accept on suspension of disbelief, as well as the idea that the portrayal of government ineptness on this scale. And anyone who couldn't predict the outcome would have to be seriously stupid. Its as if del Toro decided he wanted to do a darker version of the Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah ""Splash"" movie from 30 plus years ago. It's watchable but fair at best. And thats the best that can be said for it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wow,"Guillermo del Toro's wonderful fable – ""my favourite thing I've ever done"" – is kind of like Arrival starring Amélie, as a shy, mute cleaner (Sally Hawkins) at a government base begins to communicate with the aquaman in the tank, and feels the first flickerings of love.Set – like my last film at the LFF, On Chesil Beach – in 1962, it's really about today: a plea for tolerance in the light of Trump and co's war on Muslims, blacks and gays, and a monster movie in which the monster isn't the Other, it's right-wing, gung-ho America, represented here by Michael Shannon, as a psychotic vet in a teal Cadillac who'll beat the living crap out of anything that doesn't conform to his very specific notion of a person. The toxic machismo and vicious hatred of otherness isn't restricted to him, though, it's endemic: and hiding behind the most benign of fronts.Shot in a rich, stylised palette of greens and browns (admittedly more City of Lost Children), set partly above an old, working cinema and filled with little visual effects – though with a creature who's delightfully and resolutely real – it reminded me of nothing as much as Amélie. That 2001 movie might be the last time I felt quite so charmed by a lead character as by Hawkins' Eliza Esposito, whose increasingly appealing, steely, sexy performance recalls that holy trinity of great mute turns: Dorothy McGuire in The Spiral Staircase, Samantha Morton in Sweet and Lowdown and Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda, and is just as full of nobility and pathos; just as lacking in gimmickry.There's nice work too from Richard Jenkins, who is frequently held hostage in underwhelming comedies, but showed in Tom McCarthy's 2007 masterpiece, The Visitor that he's just about the best actor in America when he can be bothered. As Eliza's gay flatmate, a struggling, alcoholic advertising artist, he's never self-pitying or trite, and those traits no more define who he is than the fact he's bald.The plot is fine: diverting, involving and well-balanced between moments of intrigue, suspense and humour, but it's the passages of poetry that completely bewitched me, including one sequence in a waterlogged bathroom that took the breath away.There's another beguiling flight of fancy that memorably references Fred and Ginger's 'Let's Face the Music and Dance', and music is critical to this film: Hawkins and Jenkins engage in an impromptu tap, Alexandre Desplat equips her with the most enchanting theme, and del Toro exhibits his great love for – and understanding of – classic Hollywood by including several clips from old Fox musicals, including Bojangles and Shirley Temple in The Little Colonel and colour clips of Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda rendered in the monochrome of '60s tube TV. Realising that I was in a cinema in which a modern audience was being forced to watch old footage of Alice Faye, and listen to a short monologue discoursing on her ill- fated Hollywood career was just the most delightful thing.So a sci-fi, a horror, a monster movie, a romance, a Cold War thriller, and a history lesson about Alice Faye: this genre-bender is many things, but above all it's an emotional experience, a clear- sighted, glowing-hearted picture with some of the most beautiful imagery and a performance I'm going to be rhapsodising about for weeks, months, years.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shape over substance and yet some wonderful moments,"Del Toro gives great importance both to the design of his creatures and their majesty: the Shape of Water is a wonderful monster of a movie indeed, one of those few movies that manages to create memorable sceneries but still make them coherent with the story and its themes. Not a single moment is wasted, everything is functional, even the silly sequences here and there. Differently from Pan's Labyrinth though, it's the movie's message that feels a bit cliché: it's not too different from tales we've already heard like Frankenstein, and the usage of the Cold War as a setting is little more than a macguffin for the second act of the story. Theoretically, the time period is functional to depict an age where America was constantly afraid of the ""other"", the stranger, the different one. But Del Toro isn't really telling anything new here. It's just telling it in the most poetic and ""fairy tale""-like way possible. And it works",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The main stand out of the performances mostly, Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer delivers a compelling performances that makes this film an apple of the eye.Despite the fact that The Shape of Water draws similarities with Beauty and the Beast and with a combination of its themes from Creature from the Black Lagoon, this film is a worthy companion piece that speaks of passionate and unrequited love with no divided boundaries or prejudice.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Shape of Water (2017),"Guilermo del Toro is a solid filmmaker. I'm not overly crazy about his work and don't rate him as highly as many others do, but the visual beauty of his films cannot be denied. I am not crazy about Pans Labyrinth or Pacific Rim but I do actually love Crimson Peak. I was always going to check out The Shape of Water to see if Toro could follow up Crimson Peak with an equally outstanding piece of cinema. While The Shape of Water isn't amazing its quite enjoyable.The film takes place in the 1960's where a mute cleaning women finds a creature has been captured by a Colonel and starts bonding with this otherwordly creature. She attempts to free the creature and falls in love along the way. On the other hand, the Colonel is an aggressive man and is abusive towards the creature and then goes all out to try to figure out who helped the creature escape. The film is set with a back drop of U.S./Soviet tensions and plays a part in minor aspects of the film.This is definitely the best Sally Hawkins performance to date. She is wonderful as a mousy mute woman and does so much terrific acting in the absence of words. Michael Shannon was just born to play a villain and pulls off a typically good Michael Shannon performance. While this film isn't as visually stunning as some of del Torro's other work, the creature design, camera work, and costume and set design is still very top notch.I'd say one thing about Del Torro's film that could be a criticism is the writing. The film is fairly predictable. Its good, but goes down a route that we've seen in similar type of films. Its an entertaining film but its not anything jaw dropping visually or creatively. Strong performances and del Torro's imaginative creature creation keeps the film moving and he creates characters you want to root for. Its not del Torro's best but its definitely going to please his die hard fans.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great movies are those that accomplish what they set out to,"I gave The Shape of Water a 10/10 because it is perfect in every way that it wants to be. No, I don't think it's the greatest movie of all time; no, I don't think everyone will enjoy it as much as I did; no, I certainly don't think it's my favorite movie ever (although it's probably top ten).It gets a 10/10 because I think Guillermo accomplished everything he set out to do in making this beautiful, haunting, genuinely gorgeous fairy tale. I hope it isn't too bizarre for people to go see, because the story is fantastic. The visuals are visceral and emotive and precisely Guillermo Del Toro. The soundtrack is superb.There hasn't been a movie that captivated me and had me deeply invested in the characters right off the bat like this one did. There's no moment where you stop and go ""wait, this is a little too weird for me"", it just works. Michael Shannon is fantastic in his role, but might be overshadowed by the flawless Sally Hawkins. Without the addition of Spencer, it might have been too overwhelmingly tragic at times-- she was a nice comedic break in a really pretty heavy story.I might come back and re-review this later, but for right now all I have left to say is: wow.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
E.T. Meets Splash,"""The Shape of Water"" in short: A mute woman has an unusual relationship with a strange creature captured in South America by the U.S. government.It's the height of the cold war, circa 1950's, and tensions between communist U.S.S.R. and the U.S. are nearly equal to that of the competition between the two in the Space Race. Elisa and Zelda are janitors working the overnight shift at a top-secret government facility housing an amphibious creature that may give the U.S. a distinct advantage over the Soviets. Elisa, who is mute and communicates through sign language, forms an instant bond with the creature, who has an affinity, it seems, for hard boiled eggs. Zelda is Elisa's good friend, co-worker, and translator. The creature, however, needs no translator. It's an intelligent being.Elisa spends her lunch hour in the lab communicating with the creature through sign. Witnessing these interactions is a scientist, Dr. Hoffstetler, charged with the creature's care. The man overseeing the entire secret government discovery is the creepy Richard Strickland, who reports to Five-Star General Hoyt. Strickland tries to convince his superior to mark the useless creature for death and dissection, a plan that doesn't sit well with Elisa and Hoffstetler. Hoyt has the power to make anyone disappear if he so chooses, a point that worries Strickland and influences his decisions later when all hell breaks loose.Think of this movie as a cross between an R-rated ET (1982) meets an R-rated Splash (1984).Two things you'll LIKE about ""The Shape of Water"": 1) It's hard to choose just two. The 13-Oscar nominations are well deserved. Everything flows nicely. Well-acted, designed, edited, directed, scripted, the list goes on. 2) Character actor Richard Jenkins (who is Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor) plays Giles, a former alcoholic, current homosexual, down-on-his-luck advertising-agency-artist (whew) and is Elisa's friend and neighbor. He's awesome in this role and has one of the best line's in the movie (I won't spoil it).Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) If you're not a fan of Guillermo del Toro's unique style of film making, you will not like this movie. I am neither a fan nor a hater, but I still enjoyed the movie either way. 2) The subject matter. It's, uhm, odd (keep an open mind).",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Did not enchant me, I'm afraid","I'm not going to smash this film with a super-low rating, but this is where my patience with Oscar nominated movies sometimes runs out.When I pause a movie half-way through to take a break, for whatever reason, it's a bit of a dud IMO. What I couldn't do was suspend reality at one moment but accept the endless possibilities the next, or tolerate the constant switches between plausible and 'not a chance'. I couldn't decide whether I was watching a 1950's detective/horror movie or some sort of crazy fantasy epic, and the music was super-really-boring too and didn't enhance the film or draw me into it at all, and the strange need for nudity which wasn't necessary either, and which turned a rather wacky kid's film into something bordering on absurd and failed noire, which ultimately left me cold because I didn't find it loving, erotic or stimulating.It does have some beautiful cinematography, great acting, interesting scenes and other enchanting aspects to it, so not a super-low rating from me, just miss-ably average Oscar nominee material.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A nice short review with no spoilers,"The Shape Of Water in a sentence. It's a VERY adult fantasy love story. Words I would use to describe the experience. Delightful, whimsical, sexual, magical, romantic, musical, grotesquely violent, and finally, unique.

Don't miss it in the theater!I loved it to death and will see it again before it leaves my local theater! Worth the ticket price, no regrets.

The love story we needed.,"Such a beautifully, weird love story. Also a story of the life of the outsiders of society during the 1960s. The monster in this movie is the ""normal"" everyday man. The main character Elisa never speaks, as she is mute, but she makes one feel with the emotion she portrays with her eyes and body language. In a world and time where someone like her would be seen as less than, she lives a comfortable life in a world of her own making. She seems to lack a certain something, a sense of fulfillment, maybe. 
All of this changes when ""the asset"" is brought into the government lab, where she works alongside her African American friend Zelda, as a janitor. Seen by everyone else as a thing, Elisa treats the Amphibian Man with kindness and develops a friendship with him. 
Other than this love story, the Shape of Water portrays a 1960s world where kindness is found in the other, outsiders, and malice is found in the ""normals"". It is a beautiful movie to look at, with a plot that flows.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not Del Toro's best by any means, but solid.","Guillermo Del Toro is one of a handful of truly visionary directors left and his work always manages to push boundaries and astonish audiences. The Shape of Water is a different kind of movie for Del Toro. Perhaps his most stylised work to date, the 1940's setting really sparkles, but I couldn't help comparing it to the visual style of Amelie, which was distracting, particularly with Sally Hawkins having a passing resemblance to Audrey Tautou and the musical cues being very close as well. It certainly has a very European feel about it, which is perhaps at odds with the content and setting of the film.That aside, everything moves along at a fast pace and the action comes thick and fast. Performances are all solid, and it's engaging enough.For me though, it didn't quite have the substance of Del Toros best work, which was a shame. I am incredibly pleased to see the film being such a success critically and commercially, and by most other directors standards the film is indeed a resounding success, but Del Toro isn't anyone, and for my money he can, and will, do better work in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The love story element isn't completely original but the way it has been executed is totally original.

"It's fantastic, lyrical, beautiful, and lyrical. It might get the Oscar, so SEE IT.","""This may very well be *the* most sensitive asset ever to be housed in this facility."" Fleming (David Hewlitt)If you consider writer Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (2006), you might call him a visual genius, a poet who transcribes myth into reality. Now in his beautifully-written/directed The Shape of Water, when Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love, it's with a fish, actually a large amphibian that can love her back, and the result is sweet.That is until the government of early-sixties figures Amphibian Man a political liability and the lovers become fugitives. Undoubtedly inspired by The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), The Shape of Water is a lovely fantasy fable set in the Cold War, where a simple janitress, who is mute and an outsider like her Amphibian, struggles along with him to be accepted for the love she chooses.I'm misleading you; the exciting struggle is mostly against the narrow-minded forces of convention and authority, which see the fish as a threat to national security, but just as much inscrutable and dangerous because of being misunderstood.In that xenophobia lies the similarity to today's political climate which threatens our history of tolerance because of ignorance. Just as odd-looking foreigners threaten our way of life, so too does Amphibian Man, whose value as a specimen to be studied is compromised by foreign agents who do not wish us to benefit from research.Strickland (Michael Shannon) is the weak authorities' security guy, who doggedly pursues Amphibian out of duty as much as ideology. His glee using an early version of a stun gun on the fish is a reminder of the rabid torture sanctioned by modern ""safety"" obsession.Although I have made this film out to be a sci-fi political thriller, it is even more of a love story along the lines of a thinking-person's Beauty and the Beast, far more modern and human, possibly closer to Frankenstein, whose monster in the Mary Shelly novel is almost lovable in his ignorance and yearnings.When Strickland seeks out to destroy the Amphibian and his love, he states the mantra of ill-considered radicals everywhere, even in politics: ""I deliver."" He could be Potus fulfilling a campaign promise or just plain evil. In either case, Beauty is always vulnerable and Beast, well, not meant for this ""civilized"" world.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A beautiful story,"""The Shape of Water"" is a beautiful movie which is slightly let down by clumsy pacing.

Fish Out of Water,"I must say from the outset that I found this film very disappointing indeed. The premise is ludicrous: cleaning lady at a top secret government research centre (at some time/place in the Cold War) discovers (and falls in love with) a creature that is half-man and half sea creature (in a very unconvincing costume), with little explanation of where it came from or what was the purpose of the research.For a film that clocks in at just over 2 hours there is little to keep you engaged for that length of time (as any film worth its salt over the 100-minute mark should).Having said that the story/plot just seems to go nowhere, and none of the main characters are interesting enough to hook you in and care about them. Also as has been mentioned in other reviews, the diversity of characters seems to be little more than a box ticking exercise.How this fish out of water won the Oscar for best picture & director (amongst others) will remain an eternal mystery. (One can only assume that the Academy has finally lost the plot as to what a top notch film actually is.)",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A highly political stab at the American dream,"The visuals in this movie are exceptionally well crafted and the director went to great lengths to immerse the viewer into that 1960's American society atmosphere. One does feel like they're being taken back in time to this idealised world of the American dream which is being talked about so much these days by people like Trump and his doctrine of MAGA. The movie clearly states the failings of that age, the white antagonist high powered man in a suit who treats women like pieces of meat. He claims he has created in the image of GOD which can only be a white God in his twisted mind. We are also presented with the rampant xenophobia of that age, racism, homophobia, discrimination against the disabled and generally anything considered to be different or outside the societal norm. Of course anyone who is a misfit or has ever been discriminated against, even abused for their identity will be able to identify themselves in one of the characters of this film and have a feeling of comfort or solace from watching it. The two lovers, the disabled female and the transgender freak from the Amazon are in essence an unique type of sexual minority. The movie has enough plot twists keeping the viewer engaged in the storyline and what initially seems to be a drama ends to a happy finale which is a nice bonus for this well rounded film. So a very strong political statement packaged in a fantasy love story in a dystopian age when the happy life was perpetually clouded by the shadows of destruction and the quest for absolute power",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Suck in a deep breath and take a plunge,"Guillermo del Toro's latest immersive fantasy spectacle began life as a remake of one of the Mexican director's favourite movies of all time - the iconic monster movie Creature from the Black Lagoon. When he pitched his plans to Universal, perhaps as part of their troubled 'Dark Universe' franchise which kicked off last year with spectacular misfire The Mummy, he wanted to tell a love story between the Gill-Man and a woman from the perspective of the titular creature. This idea, which sounds like a dream for film buffs but a turn-off for studio executives, was rejected outright, presumably being for too risque for mainstream audiences. Del Toro stuck with it anyway, and the script turned into The Shape of Water. Would the same film have nabbed the Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards if it was titled Creature from the Black Lagoon? I think not, so it worked out well for everybody apart from Universal, who are probably still licking their wounds from last year's Tom Cruise-starring horror show.The Shape of Water tells the story of Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute lady who lives in an almost dreamlike apartment above a barely-used cinema called The Orpheum. We quickly learn everything we need to know about her in a wonderfully edited opening sequence, in which she boils eggs, masturbates in the bath, and pays a visit to her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins), all before heading off to a top secret government facility where she works as a cleaner. Giles spends most of his time alone with his cats in his apartment, paying the bills by drawing product advertisements, occasionally venturing out to buy pies from a nearby diner and lust after the young man behind the counter. Elisa's best friend and co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) saves her a space in the queue for the clocking-in machine every morning, and has learned sign language so the two can chit-chat whilst carrying out their mundane job of cleaning piss up off the floor and, much to Zelda's befuddlement, the ceiling.This is 1962 America, where the happy (and white) nuclear family is the very definition of achieving the American dream, but also where minorities are still looked down upon. It's no accident that Elisa, who rarely stops smiling even when she is treated differently for her affliction, is closest to and most comfortable around a gay man and a black woman. The arrival of a strange amphibian humanoid from a swamp in South America and the loving bond it gradually forms with Elisa represents a threat to this very American way of life, at least in the eyes of Richard Strickland, a brutish military official who caught the creature, played with sheer menace by Michael Shannon. Strickland wants to cut the creature open to learn if its abilities can be forged into some kind of weapon, and to keep it out of the hands of the Soviets. Mild-mannered scientist Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) wants to keep it alive for further study, but Strickland is given the green light by his superior.What follows is a daring break-out and Elisa's efforts to keep the stranger hidden in her apartment. The story isn't exactly ground-breaking, and you can probably work out where the film is heading quite early on. However, The Shape of Water isn't a film about surprises and twists, but a strange tale of forbidden love to utterly immerse yourself in. Most directors would struggle to capture a sex scene between a beautiful woman and a slimy fish man with a straight face, but del Toro somehow makes the whole thing feel natural, and most importantly, incredibly beautiful. Longtime del Toro collaborator Doug Jones does some stellar physical work as the creature, forging a chemistry with Hawkins without the benefit of facial expressions or dialogue, relying on otherworldly howls and the odd bit of sign language to communicate. It warrants comparison to del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, and although it's not as good as the 2006 Oscar-winning masterpiece, it shares much of its creepy magic and vintage character design, and also reflects on a country's troubled past. It's the riskiest and best work del Toro has done since. Suck in a deep breath and take a plunge.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An unique idea which feels quite flat,"After seeing an odd creature in one of the laboratories of a facility in which she worked, a mute woman begins to empathize with the creature which was being held hostage so she slowly begins to interact with it. Pretty soon, a connection is made between the two which might lead to something more from her side at least.It's an unique movie which describes the life of a lonely mute woman and the events that follow her first eye sight with the creature. It's plot is quite interesting I must say, slowly building up tension and emotion while also delivering plenty of drama and even suspense. Most of its characters are very well thought and described, contributing to a rather slow but interesting course of events. It manages to avoid boredom most of the time by introducing something new pretty often, but the pace still feels a bit sluggish. My complaint here would be that its antagonist/s don't seem very compelling. You know that he'll do something bad but you don't quite feel it. It's some sort of predictability from the plot combined with a lack of credibility from the bad side. It's not dramatic or something but it spoils the overall sensation.The visuals are nice, the creature seems very credible with its bestial form and some special effects, from time to time, deliver some very pleasant scenes. Its time setting with the retro cars, shops and buildings also do a very good job, aided of course by the music of that respective period which goes nicely with the décor.I have to say that it's a good movie, but unfortunately, it wasn't able to leave a mark on me like other great ones do. Yes, it's one of a kind and yes, it has a good plot, but it doesn't feel like it was made to be great. There are many things left unanswered, a couple of issues with the antagonists and the finale is quite predictable and thus not very satisfying. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, but it wasn't able to impress me in such a way that I would feel that this is actually a multiple Oscar winning film. I might not understand the role of these awards but unfortunately for me, this isn't the first one that wins plenty of statuettes but doesn't seem like a movie that would have deserved them.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Beautiful, odd and emotional dream.","The Shape of Water (2017):I would say this is the kind of film that's more of an experience rather than a movie. Walking out of it, it feels like you just had a really beautiful, odd and emotional dream.Now I'm gonna warn you right away, this isn't a movie for everyone, but I think if you're the right kind of person for it, you already know that you'll like it. It's very art-house, it's very Guillermo Del Toro, it's very weird.Overall I really enjoyed ""The Shape of Water"", it leaves you with a good fuzzy feeling in your heart. I loved seeing every frame of it since Guillermo has a very distinctive and stylized look and tone. He manages to create a real world but with a dash of magic and fairy tale to it. The cinematography was absolutely astonishing (especially the colours), set design/costumes/etc were fantastic, the creature was really cool and pleasant to the eye (good mix of practical and CGI), the acting was good (even though the Russian was iffy).My only problem with the movie was the fact that it felt a little too long, I think a couple of tiny things could've been cut here and there and the movie would've been just as good. There's also a couple of things that felt unaddressed but as the viewer you let it slide and forget about them since you're focused on the main story.Basically, if you knew about this movie and you were interested in seeing it, see it. If you don't know anything about it or the works of Del Torro, probably don't.If I had to boil it down (egg joke) to a score it would be somewhere around 7.5/10P/SDo NOT see it with kids unless you want to have some VERY awkward moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And the Academy bit the bait...,"As a Best Picture winner, ""The Shape of Water"" is a most interesting choice, but I wonder if the Academy voted for the sci-fi spy thriller and its interspecies romance between the mute Eliza (Sally Hawkins) and the mysterious fish-man or the art-house movie channeling Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Alexandre Desplat whimsical Oscar-winning score à la ""Up"". I liked the content but there was something too bait-y on the surface to make me fully admire its merit.Speaking of the Oscars, let me start with my first gut-reaction: I wish Michael Shannon was nominated instead of Richard Jenkins, he played the kind of villains that make the difference in a movie, I enjoyed every minute of his screen presence, as Head of Security Strickland, he was creepy, intimidating (he also made a terrific entrance) but there was something in his attitude that betrayed a deep, almost childish, desire to be a perfect citizen, a good soldier, who'd never disappoint his superiors... I figured he represented the infantilizing of American manhood through hardcore and blind patriotism, a way to show that no matter how strong and almighty men felt these days, they were still submissive.Women are depicted as submissive but not as a choice, simply out of practicality in a still male-dominated America (those were the early 60s) but then they reveal themselves to be more dependable than men, it's interesting that the Octavia Spencer's character Zelda never betrays her friend, it's her husband, the guy who'd asked her to open the door who reveals himself as a coward. What I don't get though is whether Zelda was really going to let Strickland rip everything apart and not say a word, we'll never know, the film finds the perfect shortcut, the bad guy gets to Eliza but it's not Zelda's fault. It didn't make sense by the way that the husband wouldn't even let Zelda warn her friend... so I think the film had a little record to settle with men in general.There are basically three good characters of male persuasion in the film: the fish-man, who's said to have everything at the right place though it doesn't look like he's got it, there's Jenkins' character Giles who's a misunderstood artist and attracted to men, which makes him twice an outcast and there's Michael Stuhlbarg's Hoffstetter, a good physician but trustworthy to a limit as his real name's Dimitri. It's interesting that the only three good men live in a sort of duplicity, deliberate or not, they're never what they claim to be and what they are inside, they're forced to hide it. Women are straight-forward but good men are driven into pretending to be what they're not, as if the reality of men was one of ugly nature. And when you have a film that handles an Alien species, it's comprehensible that ""Man"" belongs to the antagonistic side but women are certainly not part of that ""Man"" equation. Interesting.One could even argue that Jenkins' character didn't want to help his friend Eliza first, until he realized how 'different' he was. In the scene where he gently pats the restaurant guy's hand and realizes that he crossed the line, you can see the young man making a 180° turn and going from a smiling guy to a dirty bigot, homophobic and much more racist since he tells the Black couple to get out, that's the reality of men, whether American or Russian, it doesn't make any difference. So obviously Del Toro is also putting a few baits for the feminist wave, and the janitor job is eloquent: it's literally the women who clean the men's ""dirty work"". Still, for all his efforts, he still got that comment from Portman when she nominated all the *male* directors in the Golden Globes ceremony, apparently, it didn't please Del Toro, but he should be good sport; If ""The Shape of Water"" tried to mix fantasy and sci-fi material with the current ""man vs. woman"" issues, it's only fair that these considerations interfered with the Awards race.Now, did I like the film?I liked Strickland because he drove the action, so yes, I liked the narrative. I thought the nomination of Jenkins was unnecessary but Octavia Spencer's was outrageous, I swear she plays the same role whenever she's nominated, and when your friend is a mute woman, it's not difficult to be a scene stealer, Sally Hawkins was impressive not much because of her silent performances but the way she dedicated herself to that role. Let's face it, she's not a natural beauty but she really made herself more beautiful than any other pretty face of Hollywood by being a gentle, nice and most of all, decent woman.Now, my real problem is with Del Toro, no pun intended, I thought he was trying to swim in too many waters at the same time: he makes a beautiful romance and it works, a cat-and-mouse thriller, it works, but when the film gets too cutesy and poetic, I'm afraid he loses his guidance. As I mentioned it in the intro, yes, his film reminded me of Jeunet's world, from ""Delicatessen"" to ""Amelie"", yes, they give a specific texture to the universe of Eliza, old fashioned and kitschy looking, but a little less could have been more. What happened to Del Toro reminds me of Gilliam when he gets carried away by his own extravaganza... in ""The Shape of Water"", when Eliza gets naked in the water, it's simple, sensual and powerful... when she imagines the Broadway musical, it's just too much.At the end, it's like Del Toro having the same childish desire to seek approbation from his peers that he tries to make an art-house movie out of what could have been a terrific thriller and a great romance. I didn't mind the ""social commentary"" aspect but for that, I found the ""Billboards"" film to be more powerful and more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"The Shape of Water was only released here in Australia only 2 days ago when it was basically a 2017 made film, but having seen it at long last we definitely think that this is one of this year's best films already (and only in the first month of a new year). The film tells the story of a lonesome mute cleaning woman named Lily, working at a contained facility that one day brings in a mysterious but valuable 'asset' that seems to get her interest when she sees the human sized creature. Determined to set it free after seeing it's captivity and treatment, she embraces to do so but manages to see that it is like her.It's a fantasy romance story set in the era of the Cold War, with moments of drama, love and even thrills. The production value here is as great, beautiful and visually appealing as with any Del Toro film, the use of colours, practical makeup effects, storytelling, music, symbolism and even the themes are all taken to the levels of excellence to make it work perfect.
The acting is strong throughout with Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon and the always great Richard Jenkins giving the best roles. Hawkins in particular embraces her character's mute with much detail and emotion, you feel and care for her as she discovers that even the most mysterious things in life can bring the best that life can offer, though there are consequences and rewards.
The Shape of Water is film that will indeed have your mind and heart set to it and will make you imagine a world where fantasy and love are alive. With award worthy values in direction, production design, script and great performances, this reminds us that films can still capture the magic.

The Shape Of Water,"The Shape of Water
(2017)
Dir: Guillermo Del ToroOkay so considering this film won ""Best Picture"" I needed to see what the hype was about for myself. Now Del Toro is notorious for creative wonderful worlds and unique stories with fantastic creatures in his films. The only complaint I have about this creature, is that it is eerily similar to Abe from ""Hellboy"" same actor same director but different character. The story telling was amazingly done and I enjoyed every minute of the film. Michael Shannon once again proves that he is amazing at playing a villain. I thought it was great that the creature was mostly practical effects (a guy in a suit) rather than depending solely on CGI. The ending was kind of expected, and there are a handful of cringeworthy scenes. Nothing is really held back in the sense of it being a film that is straight forward. The rewatch ability depends on wether I want to show the film to someone. Other than that I don't really think I would rewatch on my own. I can certainly see why it won best picture given the style and art of the film. Although I haven't seen the other films except for ""Get Out"".4/5 solid. No more and no less.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Darkness within us will eitherr rise or drown us all...,"This film does well at doing many things at once and that is the ability to show love in its rarity and also to show the darkening depths of fear itself. Fear from conditioning over time...This film show's that you can move forward and be free from prior ""fears"" that make us all incapable at times, however the main characters all join together in this film to say that there is love and hope after all.
This Film is for adults who want to share the realism of this life and that includes fantasy and foul of the every day life/reality. But at the end of our foul days, what do we look for? We look for peace of mind and love that understand us as we understand love.

A masterpiece signed by Del Toro,"After his, in my opinion very good, horror ""Crimson Peak"", Guillermo Del Toro returns completely changing genre going to the romantic with fantasy background.
Certainly it changes genre but not style and in fact from the first shots you immediately recognize the unmistakable artistic and stylistic approach of the famous Mexican director. A coherent, fascinating and always disturbing, in some respects, style.
In this case, however, he exceeds himself and creates a visually monumental and cinematographically sublime work. The film is simply a real beauty for the eyes, for the soul and for the heart.
All this thanks to the extraordinary images that Dan Laustsen's cinematography (Crimson Peak, John Wick 2) exalts and decorates with surreal colors tending to aquamarine (not by chance color that recalls the main element of the film) and a sweet lighting, a truly wonderful cinematography; and that the intimate and meticulous direction of Del Toro manages to frame with precision, passion and a lot of personality.
A director who proves to be quite explicit in several scenes, it comes to say almost brave, in fact in some scenes Guillermo Del Toro is not afraid to frame bodies, however pure, naked; this would seem to go against the extreme delicacy and incredible romanticism with which the whole film is characterized, but this is perfectly inserted in the aforementioned context, thus succeeding in showing, as it should be, this wonderful love in the best of the its Shape.
The wonderful images are transformed into exciting sequences and linked to each other through a dynamic and intelligent editing that uses small escamotage (like two drops of water on a window) to surprise the viewer already completely immersed in the film.
Thanks to the great skill of Del Toro you can not not be immersed in this beautiful story (similar to that of ""Beauty and the Beast"") and not even be overwhelmed by this love; had been made by someone else probably the effect would have been contrary, namely disgust and misunderstanding but in this case instead of doing this, instead of discriminating this love, you can not but desire it. 
Thanks mainly, not only to the director, but also to the indisputable skill of Sally Hawkins, first of all, of Octavia Spencer, perfect for the role entrusted to her, and of Richard Jenkins (all three nominated for an Oscar); fundamental was also the interpretation of Doug Jones who managed to make the ""amphibious man"" credible and appreciable.
Also helped by a good makeup despite some scenes in which the presence of a costumes is perceptible.
The soundtrack is also beautiful.
Less good is the screenplay (also nominated by the Academy Awards) that, despite its objective quality, can not give to the public unforgettable dialogues as, instead, it is all the rest.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comic book fable,"Giulleromo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' is a beautiful visual enterprise, set in a surreally exaggerated, but immaculately imagined and rendered alternative version of 1950s America. It's also a poetic love story. But behind the beautiful cosmetic detail, there's no real story beyond a straightforward account of good versus evil and love versus hate; there's simply no way to identify with the characters, attractive or repulsive, in the way one relates to normal, flawed human beings. There are rare movies (I can think of 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Delicatessen') which tell a profound human story within a stylised fantasy universe. Without that, what we're left with feels very much like a comic book: it may be beautifully drawn, but there's no depth to what's portrayed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A monstrously powerful fable about love and loss where plot simplicity, narrative depth and artistic beauty are unified and glorified","Without false decorations, there is no doubt that ""The Shape of Water"" is an eye-catching drop-dead gorgeous masterpiece, Del Toro's last Magnum opus is a eerie and charming homage to ordinary-people-do-extraordinary-things stories and, without hyperbolizing my extreme love for this filmmaker- although that's just the truth -his film is one of the most clever, stirring and visually handsome experiences, a deeply moving and impressive modern-cinema classic, an artistically perfect, beautifully acted, directed and scripted impossible-love movie that I have seen in my whole life.For the most stringent movie-buffs, like me, the first thing coming to light when the screening is over is that the script has many plot holes, namely, neither it provides minimal explanation about how or why was the creature created, nor uses scientific technicalities or the peripheral problems of the main role, the supporting characters or the time in which it's developed; the film simply doesn't walk around and to enjoy it is necessary to understand it in the way its director wants: As a story about monsters in which love and loss, as a whole, play the greatest roles.This film allows executing extraordinary tours de force for two members of the cast. Year after year, the great Michael Shannon surprises more and more. His Richard Strickland is voracious, egomaniac, magnetic and terrifying; this performance is made by real quality, portraying a man oppressed by machismo, greed and power, possibly a reflex that reconciles in a good way with the mess of sexual and labor harassment that has begun to be strengthened in recent months, an epitome of all those monsters with ties and contacts that simply require and cancel. On the other side of the coin, the second monumental performance lies, of course, on the shoulders of Sally Hawkins, getting that a mute lady gains a powerful label, not a new icon of female overcoming or anything by style, a sign of love, faith, and freedom.Del Toro keeps doing his job excellently, selecting a top-notch artistic team. Flick after flick, story after story are strongly driven by an overwhelming visual tidiness, leaving out genre or purpose, it's a tradition that each of its motion pictures means sublimity in creative fields. His newest work could be placed on the top of the podium. ""The Shape of Water"" is what it's thanks to the hard work put on it, a feat that must be recognized and praised. Dark colors and lack of brightness are trademarks, each scene uses the global tonality in order to encompass throughout the film the feeling that the filmmaker wants the spectator to get. While in the opening sequence prevails a gloomy green color in the water, in the later set-pieces you can appreciate green olives, pale whites, yellowish and greenish blues that give shape to the idea. In addition, such colors are also applied to costumes, makeup, staging and visual tricks, supported by an ideal and particularly opaque illumination that denotes a quietly beautiful time. Pictures are flawless. Its cinematography embellishes key scenes and the ingenious approaches switching from one scene to another use old-school techniques that Del Toro frequents, and here get a new level of complexity and intensity, simply outstanding. Alexandre Desplat is also an important piece in the puzzle, he plays again a role of issuer of emotions by means of sound, through a work that surely will give him besides an enormous recognizing, satisfaction and pride for becoming one of the most requested Hollywood composers.Guillermo Del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"" is a devastating experience, not due to its subtle horror moments, its entertaining material or its mischievous comic sense, but simplicity and delicacy with which this filmmaker treats his invention, a work brimming with gold qualities that are not created by film-romantic traditionalism, the core purpose is a message about loss and happiness, because this, in many cases, means love, and that's precisely the meaning of the movie title. In its entirety, water may never be contained, water is amorphous, love is amorphous, therefore, its conceptions are entirely immeasurable. It's one of the best years for Mexico in the American industry thanks to ""Coco"" and ""The Shape of Water"", it's also time to remunerate all the contributions for cinema made by this peculiar filmmaker. While some people give him millions of dollars and little gold men, we, the dreamers and most loyal followers, give our deepest respect, admiration and gratitude, becoming, at least personally, a true role model.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Speechless,"I love the films directed by Guillermo del Toro, so I was waiting for The Shape of Water.
We follow the story of a woman who falls in love with a strange aquatic creature, during the 60s. We also have an amazing cinematography, a great cast and some good subplots full of metaphors about racism, homosexuality, patriotism and male chauvinism during that decade. That's one of the things I loved more.I didn't hate anything about this movie, but there are some points that could be better, as: the main antagonist, he's just stupid and weak if I compare him with the sadistic and scary Captain Vidal from Pan's Labyrinth. I liked the main creature it but I missed the typical mystery and charisma that we can appreciate in some Del Toro's monsters.The Shape of Water isn't the best movie from one of the most amazing directors of all time, but stills good and perhaps one of the best movies of the year.Rating 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fairytale with great cinematography,"Dear movie freaks, The Shape of Water main story is not so original, because there are many fantasy and imagination about the creature from other world who are coming to human world and then they are falling in love each other. There is nothing special about this, but the movie The Shape of Water has a great cinematography and thanks to Guillermo del Torro who can give also the funny scenes and critical moments to make audience eyes stick to the screen. Some movies of fairytale is boring, but this one is not, so for me why this movie won Oscar is not about the storyline, but for the cinematography. I appreciate the producer who finally choose scene in America in the moment of Cold War, because this moment makes every scene looks easy to be connected: a poor painter, old cinema building, Russian spy on the scientist facility in America, Cadillac car as American Dream, etc. This movie story is not original, but because of American pop culture as the main idea of all scenes, this movie could be remembered as a fairytale with great cinematography.

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Shape of Water. This is a love story...with a difference. A strange but beautiful tale from the stable of Guillermo del Toro. Elisa is a mute who works as a cleaner a high security government facility in the early 60s. She witnesses the arrival of a new top secret 'asset'. What follows is the strangest most beautifully surreal love story I've ever seen. We are treated to the perfect example of how many bigoted people hold in contempt that which they don't understand, and how the person you least expect is the one who steps up to help the underdog. I always watch the credits, not only to acknowledge the work of everyone who has contributed to a film, but also for any snippets I might learn. In this instance I learned that Guillermo del Toro part contributed to the vocalisation of the Aquaman and that included in the list of thank yous at the end were notables such as James Cameron and Joel and Ethan Cohen.

Sally Hawkins engrosses in del Toro's Ambitious yet Predictable Fantasy Drama!,"Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' is visually dazzling & impeccably acted by Sally Hawkins. And sadly enough, its also predictable. While there is much to admire here, especially its technical aspects, its also a bit underwhelming how one can predict the entire film ahead. But del Toro is in form here and that enough makes up for its flaws.'The Shape of Water' synopsis: In a 1960s research facility, a mute janitor (Sally Hawkins) forms a relationship with an aquatic creature (Doug Jones).'The Shape of Water' is del Toro's love letter to cinema, as he said, so there is a beautiful Broadway dance here, along-with a love-story that tugs your heartstrings. There is genuine romance here between the mute woman & the aquatic creature. del Toro makes sure he keeps the narrative like a fantasy & the beauty remains intact in its characters & in the water.On the downside, is a tiresomely one-note villain, played by Michael Shannon, the wicked Colonel who tortures the Creature, even after he gets two of his fingers ripped apart. The antagonist is predictably a racist & misogynist, who only lives by orders & has no heart to speak of. del Toro tries to make Shannon's bad-guy human, but he barely remains anything but a regular villain in a film where you're suppose to be on the creature's side. And it doesn't help that Shannon, an otherwise brilliant actor, goes over-the-top.Another minus in this beautiful looking motion-picture, is the predictable story-line. You know where this is headed right from the word GO. And while some of it is genuinely interesting & offers heart, there is no denying its clichéd form. And the strong violence puts you off after a point.And despite the minuses that cannot be overlooked, the pluses still remain unmistakably powerful. del Toro's Direction is dreamlike & takes us into its world of picturesque beauty & gruesome violence. del Toro is in his element here & proves once again that he's among the most passionate filmmakers of our times, despite none of his films being perfect.Dan Laustse's Magnificent Cinematography, Alexandre Desplat's enchanting Score, Sidney Wolinsky's nicely done Editing, along-with extraordinary work on the Art & Costume Design, only add to the narrative's merits.Performance-Wise: Sally Hawkins is engrossing in her portrayal of the mute protagonist, who falls in love with a creature. Hawkins is pure heart & soul, fleshed out in a sublime performance. Hawkins leads 'The Shape of Water' with her astounding performance. Expect strong Oscar chase! Of the rest of the cast, Doug Jones does a splendid job as the creature. Richard Jenkins as Hawkins' neighbor, as always, is perfect. Octavia Spencer raises the best laughs as Hawkins' co-worker & friend, while Michael Stuhlbarg excels as a doctor who believes in freeing the creature from the sadists around him.On the whole, 'The Shape of Water' isn't perfect, but there's no denying its beauty or its strong leading woman.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Beautiful poem to Monster Kids,"Guillermo Del Toro mentioned that one of the driving ideas behind this was for the monster to get the girl. I'm not going to give this away, but unlike some of the naysayers who've damned this film, they obviously didn't watch it with their eyes open. Who can make a film like this for under 20 million these days? Obviously Guillermo can. This is a dark and beautiful fantasy that one has to pay attention to. The story flows like the water it contains and I can't single out any one performance since all of them are so excellent. I would have liked it if the Amphibian man had a little more original look. He looked like Abe Sapien with the creature from the black lagoon's hands. But he is a beautiful creature, streamlined and wonderful. While some may poo-poo this film, It's Del Toro's best original film since Pan's Labyrinth and far superior to either Crimson Peak and the utterly terrible Pacific Rim.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A gorgeously shot, classic yet original story.","Going into this film, I had already heard a lot of the award season buzz, so I knew that there were at least some really good parts about it. And that buzz was not wrong; this movie is spectacular. Literally, this film is a spectacle. The visuals of this movie are gorgeous- the colors pop brilliantly, the shots are stunning and unique, the lighting is dynamic and intriguing, and the effects are incredibly impressive. The Amphibian Man looks fantastic. He really looks like he's there, and the combination of CG and Prosthetics work incredibly well together. What carries this film, along with the effects, are the performances- the whole cast of this film is brilliant. Sally Hawkins gives an outstanding performance as Eliza. She's poignant and sympathetic and stunning, and the angle of her being mute really carries her performance, and also carries her relationship with the Amphibian Man. Michael Shannon's performance as well, as well as the reflection of his character against the setting of the 1960's, is really enlightening and interesting. His last line is my favorite line in the movie. The problem's I have with this film mostly stem from the third act, where things start to get a little cheesy and predictable, but the ending is still very well earned.

The Shape of Water is a mature, fantastical romance with a nostalgic Key-Lime slice of the Hollywood B-Movie classics of which we know he loves.It is beautiful story that explores broken people living in a hostile world, reaching out for a connection.Elisa's story is one of resourcefulness when vulnerable, showing the strength of compassion, love and empathy when all seems lost.
The visual style was outstanding and dragged (or rather, waltz'd) me back to the look and feel of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's The City of Lost Children with it's film-noir-esque use of light, shape and rain.
And as for the monster ... I've said it before, and I'll say it again .. I love the way Doug Jones moves!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An imaginative piece of storytelling and a work of art,"The Shape of Water is another fantasy-morality drama from Guillermo del Toro with the imagination and ambiguity of his Pan's Labyrinth, though with less engrossing storytelling. As a movie, I see it as a cross between Creature from the Black Lagoon and Splash with moral themes and compelling cinematic imagery.The core plot is that a man-like, amphibian creature has been found in the Amazon basin and brought to the US for study in a government lab. The time is the mid 1960s and so the creature is a desirable ""asset"" for the US and Soviet governments in their Cold War contestings. Kept in a holding tank, the creature is treated as an animal until discovered by Eliza (Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor. Eliza, personally suppressed from her disability, finds sympathy with the creature's situation and forms a relationship with him. While she's supposed to be cleaning the lab, she feeds him eggs, plays music for him, and teaches him sign language. When the government authorities, represented by Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon), decide to kill and dissect the creature, Eliza and friends facilitate the creature's escape.This central plot of ""escape of an intelligent, sympathetic, fish creature who is loved by a human,"" struck me as the basic plot of the 1984 Tom Hanks comedy, Splash. The similarity extends to the creature's cruel confinement and unsympathetic study, and even to the shedding of its scales in misery. Now, Splash was a good movie and certainly not original in its genre. I don't fault del Toro for using a similar plot device to drive his movie because he took it beyond that device. Rather than just entertain us with a thriller storyline, he incorporates theme and imagery to say something.The Shape of Water's central theme is a solid, Good vs Evil, extended to Misfits vs the Deluded Normal. Again, maybe not so original, but well done. The sets evoke the pre-digital 1960's with massive machinery and systems in a lab controlled by human technicians rather than computers. It all has a ""dirty"" look indicating that a large cleaning crew is required to keep it up. While that does stretch the believability of facility security (something innocuous in today's world) it is part of the fantasy and a needed plot device to put Eliza in proximity to the water creature.The movie's look complements the Fantasy vs Reality theme that is also prevalent in Pan's Labyrinth. Here, it's seen as transitions between black-and-white and color scenes. In an opposite take on The Wizard of Oz, however, the fantasy scenes are the black-and-white ones, reflecting the fantasy depicted in the old musicals seen on the characters' TV sets. Even here, though, del Toro blurs the edges with a scene set in a movie theatre where The Story of Ruth is playing in bright Technicolor. So, with such changing cues, where do we find fantasy and reality? Maybe in people's actions, or maybe we can't.There is also a religious theme that stems from the movie's consideration of Good vs Evil. We see a black-and-white view of God in Strickland's hubris where God is a white male human. Hence, in this view, the amphibian creature cannot be more than an animal (nor can people of color, represented here by Olivia Spencer's character). Playing against that, is the evoking of The Story of Ruth as a tempering Bible story where an autocratic God is not featured and the dominant theme is compassion.As a master cinematographer of fables, del Toro uses his medium to depict his themes rather than pontificate with dialogue. Having his protagonists being a mute and a creature unable to speak underscores this and urges us to finding the proof of things with our own eyes. And so we see the Perfunctory vs Compassionate theme in the sex scenes (yes, this movie earns its R rating), and the delusion of Escape vs Reality in the TV broadcasts of musicals and Vietnam news footage.Where the movie touched base with Creature from the Black Lagoon is in its depiction of the amphibian creature. Mr. del Toro chose to use an actor in costume for this character rather than CGI. That was a good move. Mr. del Toro's creature bears a resemblance to the Black Lagoon creature, even to the point of the webbed fingers with claws. Its ""breathing"" gills enforces that resemblance and allow the creature to be fearsome when required. Overall, though, he is depicted as another sympathetic and obvious misfit. Someone should win an award for this costuming.While The Shape of Water is a fine example of movie-making, it has its flaws. It doesn't draw us into its characters as much as Pan's Labyrinth did. The evil is more institutional rather than personified (Michael Shannon's Strickland comes off as more crazy than evil, as opposed to ""the Captain"" in Pan's Labyrinth), so we don't feel the threat to the characters as much. Also, the ending felt ""forced"" and gratuitous. Still, what I did like about the ending, was its melding of the ""happily ever after"" ending of Splash with the ambiguity of Pan's Labyrinth.The Shape of Water makes its mark in rising above the general fare of ""blockbusters"" offered by Hollywood. It is thoughtful with themes beautifully expressed in its visual medium. Those themes are classic in storytelling, but are progressive when compared to those in the current run of movies that seldom go beyond cliche and propaganda. I heartily recommend this film as an imaginative piece of storytelling and as a work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful, yet disappointing.","I agree with the few here who have said that The Shape of Water is good, even very good, but somehow it doesn't reach greatness. Although I can pinpoint why that is. The film is very well directed, but it's working with a screenplay that is perhaps simplistic and dare I say it, pedestrian. The film should have been anything but unremarkable, but that's how so much of it felt. The romance at its core was too quickly developed for my liking, causing it to feel like the film was just going through the motions instead of stopping to let us bask in its magic. In addition to being very unremarkable, the screenplay is also filled with some questionable storylines and some unimpressive, if even dry dialogue. Visually it's on point, although I would disagree that the film's cinematography is anywhere near that of something like Blade Runner 2049, which is unfortunate because it could very well win that Oscar. The score is also very nice, although again it should have been so much more memorable. The acting is definitely the best part of it. Sally Hawkins is luminous, and although I'm not sure I would rank her as being better than McDormand and Ronan (for Three Billboards and Lady Bird respectively, all three vying for the Oscar) it's an impressive performance that is deeply heartfelt. The other biggest surprise is Richard Jenkins, who lights up every scene he is in. Stuhlbarg is fine, and Shannon is disappointing. The latter is such a talented actor, but he can only do so much with such a one-note character (again, the screenplay's fault).Overall, it's worth it but in a pool of much more impressive award contenders like Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, and The Florida Project, it's a film that could have been so much more.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Del Toro Passion Project,"This film is a great example of when a director truly makes the film that they wanted to. This is the story that Del Toro wanted to tell and it is told exceptionally well. The Shape of Water boasts great performances from its cast with Sally Hawkins delivering an outstanding and passionate portrayal of a mute woman who falls in love with a monster simply due to the fact that it accepts her for who she is and doesn't see her faults. The film's characters however can fall into stereotypes with Octavia Spencer playing a sassy black character and Michael Shannon playing a bible verse spouting badguy but nevertheless these parts are played well. The films also fully embraces its 1960's setting, celebrating the music and TV culture at the time and this adds a feature of charm to the film. In the end The Shape of Water is a charming, well written monster film with only some minor flaws but these do not draw away from the viewing experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Controversial, yet oddly charming","Oh well.. Judging from the description, I definitely did not believe that a concept like this could turn out to be that beautiful. Even though the love story was way out of the ordinary, I really enjoyed their journey while building up a relationship. And I also appreciated the fact the movie's not solely about love, it has something to tell about several, deeper issues of the world that are still a thing, despite its genre. Amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very entertaining movie,"I'd never seen a Guillermo Del Toro movie before, but I'd heard of his movies and I was expecting an odd, fantastical film. ""The Shape of Water"" doesn't disappoint on that score, but I enjoyed the movie. The amphibious creature is very impressive. The movie makes you believe that the woman could fall for him. Octavia keeps it all real with her performance and earthy, snappy lines of dialogue. Michael Shannon gives his usual fine performance as the creature's cruel captor and keeper. His character is certainly ""over the top"" with his manner and cruelty. The sets are very impressive--the viewer is immersed in 1962 paranoid, cold war America. And of course the female lead actress deserves an Oscar for her portrayal of the mute janitor. She portrays so much emotion--love, desperation, kindness, anger--without a word. I will never be sure what motivates someone to write and direct such a story but congratulations to Mr. Del Toro!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Shape of Water. The Shape of Violence?,"Sex and violence really sell, don't they? A bit of porn, lots and lots of violence and you have a multi Academy Award nomination movie!I went to see yesterday The Shape of Water and I was highly disappointed. While the music, the cinematography and the performances are amazing, the love story is really not convincing and a bit creepy, and the unnecessary sex scenes (masturbation and coitus) and, specially, the monstruos violence killed all the poetry of the movie. In the same way that I don't think a director needs to show the actors shitting, pissing or picking their noses I find graphic sex a very poor choice for a director to illustrate a point. But, more than that, I find violence onscreen really disturbing and I think that such a high degree of violence is a very poor tool for a director. An exception to that would probably be Tarantino, who uses violence in such a crude way that it ends out being funny (nevertheless, Tarantino's violence is sometimes too much for me, even when he uses it for something great, like killing Nazis). I think that there are greater cinematic ways of showing violence than graphic torture, flying fingers, and litres of blood. If you don't agree with me, go and see Doctor Zhivago: you will be amazed by the power of the scene where the Imperial Army is massacring the people next to the Winter Palace and all you can see is the horrifying face of Doctor Zhivago, who, from a safe window, watches men, women, and children being slaughtered by the Imperial Army. Now, that's art. The rest is only good special effects and a big lack of imagination. The same goes for sex. There are many ways of showing the act of love with sensuality, strength, and poetry, but Guillermo del Toro chose here graphic sex. Why? I guess it sells better.Frankly, I don't get the hype around this film. 13 Academy Award nominations? Come on! Guillermo del Toro looks like a really nice guy, and I actually hate to write negative reviews. If I spend a bit of time in writing this negative review it's because, as with La La Land (an annoying and cheesy torture filled with cliches), I'm amazed at how bad or not so good Hollywood movies can get such a hype, while other movies, like Woody Allen's masterpieces, get shut out and don't get any important nominations (yes, I am a huge fan of Woody: I love his art, his philosophy and his genius, and I'm very angry at this wave of hypocrisy, opportunism and lies around him that mixes false accusations from two crazy and resentful women with the most beautiful art).The characters of The Shape of Water are all either black or white, there are no greys here: the bad ones are really bad and the good ones are really good. Well, life isn't neither black nor white. It's full of greys. While the performances are all amazing: Sally Hawkins is great, Octavia Spencer is amazing as always, Richard Jenkins is really good too and Michael Shannon is stunning (he really steals the movie and, surprisingly, didn't get any Golden Globe or Academy Award nomination), the souls of the characters are painted only in one color, and that's very Hollywood-ish and commercial.Also, I wonder, for which age is The Shape of Water? You would first think that a fantasy movie is suitable for children, but this one is not. Or, you would think that a love story with so much violence and a bit of porn is suitable for adults, but then, why put this stupid fish-creature? I'm used to seeing lots of fantasy and children movies with my kids (ages 11, 9 and 4, so, imagine: I've seen them all: since The Dark Cristal from 1982 until the last superhero movie). But this movie, for who is it?I understand why this movie can arrive to people, especially people who feel very lonely. I feel a great deal of empathy for all the people who feel alone in the world and seek love and company wherever they can, but I think that the black and white characters and the huge degree of violence kill the depth of this movie. Maybe the majority of the people of today are so used to see violence (on TV and on the internet) that they don't even notice it any more. I am very sensible to violence and it disturbs me a lot when I see it (here at home we don't have a TV for many many years, so I really don't know what's going on with TV violence these days -we only choose what we want to watch and watch it with our cinema projector). I understand that there are movies where violence is necessary (for instance, if you watch a movie about the Holocaust it may contain some graphic violence) but what really bothers me, artistically speaking, is superfluos violence: violence for selling, for entertaining a bit more and keep the audience amused. That kind of violence is repulsive.I don't like to put a qualification for a movie. I always found it pretentious of us, the audience and the reviewers, to qualify the huge work of a director with a number (I'm aware of the fact that to create art is difficult and to criticize is easy). But this time, since there is such a hype around this film, I feel obliged to qualify this movie. So, 1 point for the music (Alexandre Desplat), 1 point for the cinematography (Dan Laustsen), 1 point for Michael Shannon, 1 point for Sally Hawkins, 1 point for the amazing Octavia Spencer, and 1 point for Richard Jenkins. 6/10If you want to listen to good music, be amazed by a beautiful cinematography, see Sally Hawkins's sexual part, enjoy your popcorn while a fish-creature is being tortured in a brutal way, blood is running, and a cats loses her heads, go and see The Shape of Water.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Unnecessary Exploitation,"The whole movie is an unendurable combination of cliches that don't add up or become interesting at any point. The discretely repeated attempts at delivering overused social messages makes it even worse. Even those messages are shallow in content, irrelevant to the movie and extremely unoriginal just as the story itself. I hoped during the movie that it would get better at some point but it went just worse. For those who are aware of these issues this is just a pretentious attempt and for the rest they don't care or won't get that message from a movie like this one.I witnessed one of the worst movies of all times. You can't blame a movie for receiving an award but this clearly shows the demise of the movie industry as such movies can be produced and nominated and awarded just because of the exploitation of the social issues, and juries getting revenge and amplify the message with their own means.

The Creature from Hollywood Lagoon,"I'm not in the habit of reviewing commercial success films, and definitely not if they are also Academy Award winners. However, being a giant fan of horror/fantasy movies (and cinematic monsters in particular) as well as an avid admirer of Guillermo Del Toro, I suppose I should be very happy ""The Shape of Water"" won the Oscar for best film. Well, I'm not. In the 2018-edition, the one and only film that truly deserved to win was ""Three Billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri"".""The Shape of Water"" is, occasionally, a truly beautiful and emotionally confronting requiem. Presented as a homage (or maybe even a belated sequel?) to the magnificent ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", the story takes place during the gritty Cold War era and revolves around a timid and mute cleaning lady at a research laboratory who romantically bonds with a fish man-creature in captivity. Del Toro demonstrates his excellent craftsmanship via the stunning decors, the uncanny atmosphere, the dazzling use of colors and a handful of imaginatively poetic moments. And yet, there were far too many sequences that were too childish, far-fetched and preachy. Michael Shannon is a terrific actor, but his umpteenth role as an evil government agent is too much of a caricature, and so are the depictions of Octavia Spencer (as the good-hearted black woman) and Richard Jenkins (as the homosexual neighbor). If Del Toro ever deserved to win an Oscar for his fantasy oeuvre, it should have been for ""Pan's Labyrinth"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Del Toro's most artful and meaningful film since Pan's Labryinth,"So my award contenders binge begins with the Shape of Water. This was a very beautiful movie. Very "" steamy""and ""violent"" . But I really enjoyed it. I saw the Guillermo del Toro exhibit at LACMA last year and the man has such a unique style that I really admire. He knows how to world build in a way that's both magical and realistic. I mean this production design is just outstanding and beautiful to look at. Its a romantic story with beautiful art direction and awesome performances. The score was actually really nice too it was refreshing to have nice music in the background that flowed really well. I really liked Richard Jenkins and how even though it's in the 60's his story is very relevant to today. Sally Hawkins plays a mute character this entire movie and even though she doesn't say a word her performance sill conveys so much emotion. The movie can be off putting for some people because it might be cheesy or just really creepy and odd but it's crafted so well the pros outweigh the cons for me. I think I have to remove the It movie from my top 10 and bump some things up one so this becomes #6 on my list. I'll post a final list once I see the other nominees if I make more changes. Ps to all my fellow gamers, if Bioshock were to become a movie should Del Toro do it? I mean watch the first 10 minutes and think what it would be like if he did a Bioshock movie.

"""A Fairy Tale for a Troubled Time""","Imagine you're watching a classic Disney fairy tale, like 'Beauty and the Beast' or 'Snow White'. Now take that formula, and mold it to fit a mature tone, a 1960's Cold War setting, with unique lead characters and a touch a supernatural fantasy. Sounds a little bizarre, right? The Shape of Water not only proves the odd mix of elements can work, but does so with an exclamation point, creating a surprisingly outstanding work of film.The Shape of Water is, at heart, an adult fairy tale. Director and writer Guillermo del Toro's vision for this film is a never-before-seen take on the established fairy tale format which has stood the test of time for countless decades in film. Narratively speaking, the film doesn't necessarily innovate in terms of story progression in this particular genre. The main plot movement is still fairly standard for a love story, and the ending is easily predictable. But it's the exemplary presentation of a completely new way to experience this genre that makes The Shape of Water special. Instead of watching the love story play out between two stereotypical human leads, we see a female mute, and a strangely charming amphibian-type creature in the lead roles. As odd as it sounds, it just clicks. The structure of del Toro's script is filled with ingenious dialogue and terrific pacing, giving so much room for the heart to dive into the story and its characters.Subplots are present but not distracting to the primary narrative, they help deepen the tale and give it some room to breathe occasionally. The grimmer Cold War espionage setting weirdly blends incredibly well with the romantic fantasy tone, invoking a feeling of danger and security all at once. There are sequences of daring moments, keeping you engaged, then it streams effortlessly into a cleared, heart-warming scene. It's an unusual but greatly inviting feeling. So again, while I can't say the story itself is anything revolutionary, its del Toro's brilliantly flowing dialogue mixed with an exclusive set of tones and characters that propels this age-old storytelling formula into stardom.Del Toro is a brilliant storyteller, no doubt, but it's the underrated elements that give The Shape of Water its heart and soul. The film is backed by a simple, yet emotionally attaching score from Alexandre Desplat. The subtle and innocent sounding music is so in sync with the tone set on the screen, it gives another layer of depth to be consumed. It may not be a blockbuster action epic, but the cinematography and overall production value is superb, from the scenery to the wowing view of Amphibian Man's design. Smart little nuances cause the soul of the film to thrive and del Toro and his crew get additional recognition for that.As romantic movie duos go, this one may just take the cake in terms of pure abnormality, but it also might take the cake as one of the best. There's Elisa Esposito, a lonely mute janitor trapped in a life of isolation and Amphibian Man, the out of place creature being used for research at a top-secret US facility. The charming nature of Elisa is written extremely well, its easy to develop a love for the character who seems so innocent, and in her motives, which are just to find happiness in the company of others. The writing of Elisa is splendid, but actress Sally Hawkins deserves monumental praise for a delightful performance, especially in the role of a mute. Hawkins uses facial expressions and physical language to convey her emotions expertly, so well that there's little effort from a viewing standpoint to become attached to the character.Opposite Hawkins is Doug Jones who is excellent playing the role of Amphibian Man. He isn't necessarily unique in the way that we've seen his character type before; the outcast creature inconsiderately being beaten down, with a character on the opposite side that sees through a frightening exterior. But his mysterious origins and subsequent powers give a defining trait to the character, and it's his interactions with Elisa that make the character work. I didn't expect, but would have loved to see more background development for Amphibian Man. His mystical roots crack the door open for larger storytelling, but for this smaller contained story, what we got was all we needed.Hawkins and Jones lead the charge for the cast but with two lead characters who don't speak, a rock solid supporting cast in vital, and it certainly is here. Octavia Spencer brings her charisma to the role of Zelda, Elisa's work friend, a character that Elisa feeds off and becomes incredibly likeable, as with most of Spencer's roles. Richard Jenkins is equally as charming as Giles, Elisa's housemate, and the two have fantastic dialogue. Giles also gets a subplot of his own, which pans out satisfyingly in the scope of the main story. Michael Shannon rounds it out in the antagonist role of government agent Richard Strickland, and Shannon is awesome. The character's writing does at times feel a bit dull or rudimentary, but Shannon's rousing performance gives the danger this film needs to counter its romantic charm, he's excellent in the role.""A fairy tale for a troubled time"". This was the description of the film given by del Toro himself, and there's no better way to put it. It treads into familiar storytelling ground in terms of a romantic love story, but totally reinvents how we look at it. Darker fantasy tones mix with pleasingly pleasant characters, none more so than the leads themselves, to create a fairy tale we really haven't seen before and it's absolutely wonderful. Guillermo del Toro finally earned his Oscar wins with The Shape of Water, a truly unique, unequivocally rewarding fairy tale.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the sense of emptiness and the overwhelming sense of comfort,"The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's newest films, featuring amazing performances and stunning visuals. In comparison to many of Del Toro's other films there is a clear likeness in tone and visuals. However, in terms of depth in the narrative I would argue that The shape of Water exceeds many of Del Toro's other films by a long ways.At first glance, The Shape of Water is certainly a great romance but I thought that Del Toro certainly manages to weave in a very interesting theme of emptiness and the need to fill the void with some form of comfort or object of desire and affection. I really enjoyed the way this was portrayed throughout the film almost physically symbolized by the presences of the Amphibian man. What I mean is the way in which the film portrays this gang of 'misfits' or somewhat outcasts of society and closely examines their characters, their flaws and the way in which they are seemingly filled by the creature. The two most obvious examples being Sally Hawkins' Elisa who is mute and falls in love with the creature due to the fact that she felt that the creature can see through her largest flaw: her disability. Whereas, Richard Jenkins' Giles also an outcast, an out of fashion artist in his old age who is lonely finds some sort of rejuvenation in the creature.But, what is even more great is the fact that this theme is weaved into not only these characters but many others, Octavia Spencer's Zelda as an African American women facing racial prejudice and arguably most interestingly Michael Shannon's Richard Strickland and his relationship with the creature. I found that it was most fascinating to see that a character as such, living by the standards of the 'American life' with literal white picket fences, a loving wife and children having a very interesting rivalry with the creature. Somehow, their conflict stems from the fact that Richard some sort of superiority complex and the way in which the creature ties into his narrative as a sense of motivation almost fills his own lack of purpose in his suburban, stable lifestyle.All of this was done magnificently with brilliant acting across the board along with tje aforementioned stunning visuals and a musical score that went so perfectly with the beautiful story that was unfolding.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Beautiful and Enthralling Achievement,"The Shape of Water is a gorgeous achievement in film, one of the best of 2017, and one of Guillermo del Toro's finest.We'll start with a paragraph that can apply to any of del Toro's films. It's damn beautiful. Every scene, every setpiece, every emotional beat, is dripping with so much character and vibrancy that it's impossible not to be enthralled from beginning to end. Every frame is a masterpiece, and beyond that, del Toro perfectly films each shot in interesting ways that always remain appropriate for the film's tone. It feels like a finely crafted adult fairy tale. It's like a less-steampunk version of Bioshock.The casting is also brilliant for the roles. Sally Hawkins is the standout, as our protagonist, Elisa. I could not imagine anyone else doing better in this role. There wasn't a single scene, a single moment, where she wasn't perfect for what the film needs. I bought in completely.The other cast members are equally well-suited for their roles. Octavia Spencer is excellent as the foul-mouthed, funny, and caring friend and coworker. Michael Shannon's villain, while a bit over the top, certainly gets the job done and drives many scenes of the film. Richard Jenkins is a delight, as he often is. And, of course, I've got to give some credit to Doug Jones as the monster. Everything else being great, the movie still doesn't work if the monster is unconvincing or silly, and he nails it.Another standout, for me, is the score. The music is not only outstanding on its own, but actively enhances just about every scene. It never comes on too strong, it doesn't steal the show, it just gracefully supplements the on-screen action flawlessly. It's in-line with the setting, the themes, the tone, sentimental when it needs to be, and grandiose, orchestral, and sweeping during the more bombast moments. There were many moments while watching where I couldn't help but sit and smile at the gorgeousness of the film, and they were all moments where the score was in full-swing. It's perfectly appropriate for the film itself, and it's also a soundtrack that I wouldn't mind listening to on its own.While I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the film, it wasn't without flaws:The story is quite simple. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the entire story outside of the final five minutes. Every plot point is easy enough to predict, and every scene plays out as expected (I understand that this isn't necessarily an objective flaw. There's of course nothing inherently wrong with 'simple' stories. I just prefer writing that's generally more enigmatic, I guess). That being said, the scenes also play out with so much beauty, and every setpiece and shot is so meticulously crafted that I'm 100% fine with going along for the ride.Also, like most del Toro films, there's not much room for thought outside of the film. It gives you everything you need and more, delivers it on a silver platter topped with whipped cream, a million cherries, wrapping paper, and a bow for good measure. If you've seen a del Toro film, you know that he loves his metaphors and allegory. But there's a difference between simply putting this stuff in a film and letting the audience do some work to discover them (which, as a filmgoer, is often the most rewarding aspect of watching well-crafted movies), and repeatedly slapping you across the face with them. Again, is this an objective flaw? Certainly not. Just personal preference, so I'm not faulting it too much.Lastly, the characters are cartoonish to the point where it feels like the movie is forcing you to feel certain ways, instead of provoking free thought. There's honestly a decent moral and ethical argument in here about the treatment of a creature like this, about how exactly to proceed knowing it possesses a clear intelligence. Instead, we get an over the top, one-dimensional, pure evil villain (another del Toro staple) along with protagonists who are basically too perfect, without any flaws whatsoever. I'm better about overlooking this half of it, as they are at least incredibly charming, and Sally Hawkins is prefect for the role. Listen, given this set up, it's not difficult - at all - to get us on the protagonist's side. Trust that Sally Hawkins as Elisa will get us there (she would have, easily). You don't have to twist the audience's arm and make her go up against despicable, irredeemable evil in Michael Shannon (who is also great) in order to get us there. Just tone it down with the shades of black and white that are layered on these people. It feels like we're being forced to feel a way that we would have anyway. At the end of the day, is it a big flaw? Not really (I've certainly spent way too much time talking about it for how small of a flaw it is, honestly). The movie is great despite this. It's just something I noticed here, and is also prevalent in his other films, so I thought it was worthy of mentioning.I've spent too much time talking about flaws that really don't hurt the end product all that much. I think the movie is largely so beautiful and enjoyable that the few flaws stick out a bit more. The good elements of this are so great that I'd rather tell people to go see the movie to experience them, while the bad elements are so small and subjective that I feel like I'm obligated to explain them in more detail just to make it clear as to what I mean with my criticisms.Make no mistake, The Shape of Water is an excellent, excellent film.

Del Toro For Dummies,"For films by Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth and Devil's Backbone, plus Cronos and The Orphanage, are his four most nearly perfect works, for me anyway.

However, I only watched Shape once, and found it to be kind of ""Del Toro For Dummies."" Just the most simplistic, almost silly reduction of a story to a few base elements. I would have liked it better if he'd gone all the way and really made a 21st century Creature From The Black Lagoon.

a luscious production of an unoriginal fairy tale,"Auteurism is a key part of filmmaking mythology that leads us to view a film more favourably because of its director, actors, or cinematographer. Sight unseen, any film directed by Guillermo del Toro will attract superlatives like 'masterpiece', and such labels are now all over the sci-fi fantasy The Shape of Water (2017). It can be lonely for anyone to write against this tide.Also described as an adult fairy tale, the story is set in a top-secret research facility during the 1960s Cold War. Mute cleaner Elisa (Sally Hawkins) lives alone in a small apartment above a movie theatre and lives a life of dreams and fantasy. As an introverted fringe-dweller she gravitates to other outliers, like her closeted gay neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) and her best friend and workmate Zelda (Octavia Spencer), an African-American who is also Elisa's sign language translator. Elisa's yearning for romance is answered when an amphibian monster is wheeled into the facility inside a water tank. The monster and Elisa form an immediate emotional bond and Elisa is determined to save him from the sadistic director Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon). When the monster is scheduled for dissection Elisa and friends hatch a high-risk escape plan, with the increasingly deranged Colonel in hot pursuit.This is a luscious production full of Gothic foreboding, dreamy underwater atmospherics, and repressed sexual desire. The kitsch retro laboratory evokes 60s sci-fi spoofs with a heavily saturated other-worldly colour palette. It is not a spectacular or even original set design nor is the monster convincing or scary. Like Elisa, he is mute and his aquatic outfit is little more elaborate than a party costume with big holes to let his lovable eyes shine through. In case we doubt who is the bad guy, the Colonel is the only one with a disintegrating gangrenous limb to signify the moral decay of male authority. Whatever narrative nuance exists is found in novel twists on the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale template where our heroine finds eternal love in a most unusual way. With neither the monster nor the narrative especially original, it is Sally Hawkins alone who holds our attention all the way to the story's implausible ending. As she did so beautifully in Maudie (2017), Hawkins has a unique expressive talent for portraying firm resolve with fragile vulnerability.All fairy tales have a message, although some are more obscure than others. Unlike the thematic cohesiveness of the brilliant Pans Labyrinth (2006), del Toro has left The Shape of Water wide open for interpretation and many are applauding its ambiguity. However, like a Rorschach test, what you see depends on what is going on inside your head, whether it's the pain of 'otherness' or the yearning for love, mystery, excitement, or escape. Which returns us to the label 'masterpiece': if you are looking for one, you will find it. Others will be more moderately entertained with an engaging adult fairy tale that has more than enough charm for a full film of enjoyment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Shape of Water,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe Shape of Water tells a tale of two unlikely lovers. The story is interesting and engaging. Guillermo del Toro is a masterful storyteller. I just feel that the critical acclaim for this film set the bar way to high. I did not see it as a masterpiece, nor should it have won the Oscar for Best Picture. It is a good film with great visuals. The social message shown throughout the film is a little cliché (Love can be between anyone). But I did enjoy the ending.The acting is very good. Michael Shannon performs the best in my eyes as a man who never fails. Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Doug Jones all perform very well also. Sally Hawkins does a very good job portraying her characters. She is also shown completely nude in this film which is great (Her breasts and pubic hair can be seen).The pacing starts off fast but it slows down in the middle. The runtime is also overlong.The music used throughout the film is great and the set pieces and props make it feel like the 1960s.Pros: Original and interesting story, good storytelling, great visuals, very good acting by Michael Shannon, good overall acting, seeing Sally Hawkins completely nude, and a great use of music and propsCons: Some slow pacing, an overlong runtime, a cliché social message, and the movie was not as spectacular as the critics made it out to beOverall Rating: 7.2P.S. I truly don't believe this film deserved Best Picture. Films like Blade Runner 2046, Dunkirk, Three Billboards, and Phantom Thread were a lot better then this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Stunning Masterpiece!,"I usually find Guillermo del Toro's film either a hit or miss but this one is definitely a hit. The Shape of Water is a fantastical love story filled with charm, wit, danger, and somberness. While I will agree the story is a bit predictable, the characters are no less impressive and the story telling is on point with what it's trying to convey to its audience. Sally Hawkins is phenomenal with her portrayal as, Elisa, a mute woman whom cleans for a governmental facility and stumbles up on a creature they call the ""the Asset"", portrayed by the brilliant Doug Jones. Together their performance as two characters whom do not speak with their voice but with sign language or just by actions is truly breathtaking. While the overall plot may be a little unoriginal, I do believe its derivative is done with a creative twist and a spark of genius on del Toro's part. To have a strong female lead be a mute woman with timid tendencies and a quirky yet charming personality was a stroke of pure genius and you really empathize with her character.However, there is one more actor I would love to applaud for his work and that is Michael Shannon. His work never ceases to amaze me and he always portrays his villainous characters so well. His character in the movie, Richard Strickland, is the very definition of a bigoted and ignorant man I would hate to know. There times in this film where you are just feel completely disturbed by his presence and this is only watching him on the big screen! I cannot imagine what it felt like to be face to face with him while he played this vile character. I was really disappointed Michael Shannon did not even get a shred of a golden globe nomination for his performance because he truly deserved one. I love characters that I can relate to but if an actor can do their job well and really make me hate their character then I know they deserve respect.If you are looking for originality in regards to plot, I can't say this film is for you. If you enjoy originality in regards to characters, atmosphere, and special effects then this film will be for you. Its a wonderful and unique romance for those who want something different or whimsical. Overall, I do believe it deserves its praise in some areas of originality and wonderful storytelling done in such a charming way. In my opinion, its one of Guillermo del Toro's finest films he's ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great work of creativity,"A beautiful and sensual masterpiece of Guillermo Del Toro. Its one of the most creative stories in years, that's for sure, even if the subtle storyline refers to the famous ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme. Its a brave film that works even due to fantastical elements mostly because of the great amount of emotions from what the film lives. Not only the story is creative, so are the characters, especially in the way the are connected. Another great choice was to have all lead characters with a burden. You have a mute lead the film, a gay loner being the second lead and a colored help being one of the greatest heroins. 
Sally Hawkins was fantastic. She really has a brilliant year with this and ""Maudie"". One more prove that she is such a versatile actress. The performance she delivered was so tender and soulful, that you must love that character. Michael Shannon was the villain, and while most of his actions were a bit stereotypical, the character was not. He got an interesting backstory and was very well developed. Shannon himself went beyond that and once again gives a very intense and memorable performance. Richard Jenkins had many great and memorable moments that really stick with you. He makes you care for his role from the first appearance on screen to his last. And you feel sorry for him all the time because of the very natural turn he did. Octavia Spencer is a true scene stealer. Her speciality to mix wit with seriousness works here just perfectly. Its a great role for Spencer and she possibly gives her best performance since ""The Help"". There is so much going on behind her eyes. You really miss her when she is not on screen. The score is beautiful the look is tremendous and Del Toro told the story like a novel. Sometimes he let it go a bit, especially towards the end but generally it is a very intense and focused direction. 
Surely a film that sticks with you and I am glad that Hollywood did not lose all its creativity.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"We thought the multiple, detailed trailers had ruined it--thankfully, we were wrong","My best friend and I pay to see movies in theaters several times a month, and, when we saw the first trailer for ""The Shape of Water,"" months before it was to open, we couldn't wait to see it. But then new and even more detailed trailers started being shown, and, frankly, we felt we had to have seen the entire plot and most of its twists in those trailers, and decided to skip seeing the film. After it was awarded multiple awards from various organizations and associations and ultimately nominated for 13 Oscars (and it was a dry week for finding something to see) we decided to give it a shot--and we were both so glad we did. It's now turned out to be one of our favorite films of 2017, and has had a lingering effect after viewing as well. While yes, the trailers were too detailed, and some twists we wish we hadn't known about are shown in them, ""Water"" is so detailed with beautiful production design, excellent acting, an absorbing adult fairy tale story, and such a powerful, satisfying conclusion that it triumphs over those trailers and thankfully offers much, much more than we expected.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I'm a little disappointed.,"I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed. Del Toro's fingerprints are all over this film and that means there's a lot to love -- everything from the wonderfully strange premise to the gorgeous production design and overall visuals are unmistakably him. Sally Hawkins gives a stellar central performance, as does the rest of the cast; the score and featured music are lovely, adding tons to the general tone and feel. But the story. It has its heart in the right place, but as much as I love the creative idea, there's no getting around it: it doesn't work as well as I'd hoped. Yes, it's predictable, but what really hampers the affect is that I just don't buy the love between girl and fish-man. That's a problem because it's the centrepiece, the main attraction. There seems to be some essential elements missing to make it believable. So whilst it's touching, in a sense, and an enjoyable visual feast with a hint of magic, 'The Shape of Water' just doesn't soar to the heights it could have",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

In the 1960s, a very lonely Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a janitor in a government top secret facility somewhere in Baltimore, MD. when an ""Asset"" (Amphibian Creature from a river in South America) is brought in to the facility by Security Chief Strickland (Michael Shannon). She tries to communicate with it and they form a sort of friendship.Hey, I had my troubles with the Beauty and the Beast fad that went on and on and on and I said, ""Here we go again."" The movie is a good one, but I would not say it was the Best Picture as it did win the Oscar for it and also for the Director. This is a creative movie, but we seem to be going off the rails again as they did with Beauty and The Beast. See?Elisa is a mute, she can hear but cannot speak and she is cared for by Illustrator artist Giles (Richard Jenkins) and I am not sure what the relationship is as it was never addressed or I missed it. (What again?)Notables: Octavia Spenser as Zelda, a fellow janitor with Elisa and Spenser was nominated for Best Supporting Actress; Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Hoffstetler, the Russian Mole; Nick Searcy as General Hoyt; Doug Jones as the Amphibian Creature; and Richard Jenkins as Giles was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.The time is in the 1960s, but the music played is from the 1940s.

"Magical, romantic masterpiece","Shape of water , a romantic masterpiece created by infamous director of Hell boy, Pacific rim - Guillermo Del Toro. He has been known for his unique style of filming, creating his imaginative character into perfection without using CGI,but make up instead, so do the 'The shape of Water'.The story itself is so romantic that the audience may completely immersed themselves into the movie. The tension within the storyline may gradually build up alongside the depth of the character. Eliza Esposito,a muted character portrayed by Sally Hawkins, has a desperate keen of love. Her love at first sight with the amphibian man may be well illustrate through their intimate interactions in the movie, and may be well embellished on top of their sign language, which leaves the story emotionally engaging with the audience. The starting and the ending also may be related through the drop of the shoe, which leaves the story ending in circle - Guillermo's unique style of storytelling.Besides, the lighting and the music of 'the shape of water' is the main tools for creating the romantic atmosphere for the movie. Dan Lausten, best known by his cinematography in John Wick, Silent hill has done an astounding job in Shape of Water. His usage of Colour, and natural lighting creates a stupendous visual sensation for the audience. The shadows of the light, reflections of the water, or the use of contrast, generate a really warm tone which melt the ice out of the audience's heart.Foer the music aspect, Alexandra Desplat has just won the BAFTA awards for the best film music for his work in shape of water, but that comes with a reason The music mainly comes from the golden age of Hollywood , the 50s or the 60s. The music piece in shape of water may naturally blend in with the visual telling and the tone of the movie, creating a romantic sensational feeling. Especially when listening to the piece' The shape of Water', you may feel yourself submerging into the water, with the bubbles flying up to the water surface, and the whistling creating a peaceful feeling, which is the most magical aspect of the music piece.Shape of water, may be regarded as the film of the year.

The Ressurected Poseidon,"My first impression was that it would be a lot of nudity throughout the movie, and I was quite right. So, one star flies away because of the bad feeling it caused me since the beginning and we're left with nine stars. The next thing that bothered me was that it lacked some kind of cohesion. I got dizzy after some time and didn't know if I was watching a soap opera or an actual drama, as it was supposed to be. So, nine minus one equals eight.

A Beautiful Other-Worldly Romance,"I just watched this film today and I already adore it. It's a beautiful film that celebrates the magic of movies and fairytales while simultaneously subverting all of the genre's norms.The center of any movie is it's performances and this has some of this years best. The core is the romance between Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito and Doug Jones as the Amphibian. While the story of an interspecies romance may be a turn-off for some people, don't judge it by it's strange concept. Sally Hawkins is mute for the entire film, forcing her to show her emotion through her expressions and motions. And she brings so much emotion to the role. Whether showing the loneliness of her normal routine as a janitor at a secret government facility, her joy as she dances to music on the TV, and her curiosity when first meeting the Amphibian, it's all imbued with an earnestness hard to fake. And Doug Jones gives an equally silently emotive performance. He takes what could be a hulking brute and makes him a scared, confused being that finds a kindred spirit in Elisa.While the heart of the movie is Elisa and the Amphibian's, the supporting performances are equally heartfelt. My personal favorite performance of the film is Richard Jenkins as Giles. He is Elisa's neighbor, translator, and best friend. His moments with Elisa are purely wonderful, whether eating pie, listening to music, or breaking a South American water creature out of a government facility. And, as we learn, he's also a closeted gay man. There are a couple of brilliant scenes that show his challenges and motivation to help Elisa. Another incredible addition is Octavia Spencer as Zelda Fuller. She is one of Elisa's coworkers. She discovers the creature with her and goes from being wary of the beast to aiding Elisa in its escape. She brings humor, wit, and warmth to the role. On the other hand, there is Michael Shannon as government agent Richard Strickland. If you were to rate villains in how much you grow to despise them, he would be one of the best in recent memory. He's egotistical, hateful, and violent. Michael Shannon brings a cold ruthlessness to the role which imbues every one of his scenes with tension. And finally there is Michael Stuhlbarg, a scientist and Soviet double agent. In what could have been a one sided portrayal that fell back on overused tropes, he brings a layered character who decides to put science before country.Moving away from the performances, I'd like to focus more on the creative side, which is mainly the vision of one man, Guillermo del Torro. The script pays homage to everything from fairytales to monster movies to spy thrillers. It is tender, surprising, tense, and wonderfully strange in a way only del Torro could conceive. And the direction combines all of the formerly mentioned homages into a beautiful direction that creates memorable visuals that will stay with you far after the end credits.On top of the direction, the visual effects are beautiful as well, especially in regards to the Amphibian. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought that they really cast a fish actor. There is never a scene where he seems fake, a feat few big budget blockbusters can achieve.I decided to write this review not just because I feel very passionately about this film, but to right the wrongs I see in many negative reviews. A big complaint I've seen is about the interspecies relationship. While the film is very sexual, it is done in a very tasteful and gentle way. I find it done much better than a lot of films, especially a certain series named after shades of colors.In the end, the film is less about a romance between a woman and a fish, but a story of marginalized people coming together and finding each other. Look past the initial strangeness and you'll find a beautiful and truly unique film that must be seen, preferably in theaters.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a love story but not as we know it...,"Guillermo del Toro is a visionary filmmaker who has enchanted us over the years with films that centre around the fantasy and horror genre he has such a keen eye for. Whether it be the beautifully crafted Pan's Labyrinth or Pacific Rim, where the designs for the Kaiju were the stand-out, del Toro has blended such fantastical elements into a wide genre of films. His latest, The Shape of Water maintains such a bountiful filmmaking choice and then some.Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a mute janitor working in top secret research facility in the 1960s. When she stumbles upon an amphibious creature being held captive for research, Elisa forms a unique bond with the creature, leading to an escape attempt and a love story quite unlike anything we've ever seen before.The Shape of Water is del Toro's first foray into a proper love story and the results are utterly spellbinding, his direction allowing the gentle nature of this relationship feel much more believable than if it was done with a heavy hand and his writing, along with Vanessa Taylor, offering the audience sheer escapism in romance, espionage and subtle comedy.The all-round craft of The Shape of Water really is something to behold; Paul D. Austerberry's intricate and gorgeously detailed production design providing such a wonderful backdrop, Dan Laustsen's cinematography beautifully encapsulating the bond between the lovers and Alexandre Desplat's majestic score accentuating the fantasy element to proceedings. Expect all three to be major contenders at the Academy Awards.Coming to the performances, The Shape of Water is full of such vastly different performances, all coming together to deliver such an immensely satisfying viewing experience. Sally Hawkins is outstanding as Elisa, spending the near entirety of the film evoking emotion through her body language and expressions, making her such a great character in the process. Richard Jenkins is delightful as Giles, Elisa's best friend, his comedic timing being put to great use here and Michael Shannon is expectedly great as Colonel Richard Strickland, the villain of the piece. The screen presence Shannon has is just ridiculous, lighting up the screen whenever he appears so it's good to see him collaborate with such a filmmaker as del Toro.The Shape of Water is a mesmerising tale of romance for the ages, Guillermo del Toro cementing his place in history as one of the most special filmmakers ever to have graced the silver screen with such a delicate masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's beautiful, enchanting, moving, gripping but it's also strange and quite odd, like some brilliantly bizarre poem. However, the really great thing about THE SHAPE OF WATER, as well as the acting and script is how fresh and new it is. It REALLY IS something you don't see everyday. The concept, story and delivery really dazzle. The scope is awe-inspiring and this film has certainly earned it's Oscar in my opinion.Director Guillermo Del Toro has TOTALLY delivered with this movie in both his writing and directing. The script is genius frankly, smart, sharp and very original (whatever some say). We get a deep and emotional look at each character and each story. Though the film is obviously about Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and her romance with the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones), this film has many backstories and additional plot lines, and the film becomes brilliantly and complexly multi-layered. Del Toro directs brilliantly too, getting the uttermost from his stellar cast, but also grafting a brilliant and authentic 60s world. GREEN is something that features almost everywhere: the walls, the floor, the water, the food, and of course the Amphibian Man himself. The visual effects in this film are pretty much second-to-none (except BLADE RUNNER 2049) and the animated Amphibian Man is beautiful and vibrant, like a great painting.Now, onto the story. The plot is simple and uncomplicated but still grips and makes you feel for the characters. It is also authentic to the attitudes and paranoia of the times with racism, homophobia, sexism and the ""Red Scare"", all portrayed unapologetically. However, the main event of course is Elisa and her peculiarly amorous relationship with the Amphibian Man. Many people have said that the film's concept is rather creepy and weird and I must admit I was a little skeptical about the spectacle of a woman falling in (and making) love to a fish man, but the romance is told in such a beautiful and graceful way that you end up not minding at all. I WAS, however, rather glad that their love life was not explored too graphically. Almost as soon the two met I was rooting for them. I felt pity for Amphibian Man and the brutal way in which he was treated but I also fell in love with Elisa ""the princess without voice"". The only problem was, (and call me a cynic) I didn't get the emotional connection from their romance that I would get from that of a man and a woman. I DID care about their romance but it wasn't the same as the romance between human people.I should warn that this film is bloodily violent at times and may shock, it's certainly not some kid's fairy tale...However, the whole story was of course carried by the cast and I have (as usual) chosen a few standouts (4 to be precise): Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins. Hawkins was BRILLIANT! Totally different to what we know her for (PADDINGTON anyone?) as Elisa, the mute heroine. Hawkins gives such a convincing and strong performance and though her character can't speak, we still know exactly what she's thinking. Hawkins facial expressions are portraits of pain, sorrow, joy and raw emotion and Elisa becomes a heroine you can TOTALLY fall in love with. Richard Jenkins is also brilliant as Giles, a repressed homosexual and a real father figure to Elisa. He's emotional, a little vain but charming and Jenkins character is one you can really grow fond of. Octavia Spencer certainly earns her Bafta as Elisa's friend and confidant Zelda. She's a strong, independent woman, putting on a brave face for all the racism she suffers, but she has a very emotional centre and Spencer really does the character justice. Michael Shannon is monstrously magnificent as Mr. Strickland. Unfeeling and uncaring, he's a brutal villain you grow to hate as he brutalises the creature and terrifies other characters, driven with a powerhouse performance by Shannon.The charming vintage soundtrack and gorgeous dream sequences along with all of the above, REALLY moved the film along to it's tense ending. Del Toro ties it up beautifully, like a classic fairytale romance with a twist.As always, I ask myself, did I enjoy it? Yes! I really did enjoy THE SHAPE OF WATER. The cast was outstanding, the story was brilliantly strange and fresh, but most of all the film delivered and really deserves it's Oscar (and even my Dad enjoyed it)...",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Picture was generous... but it's a decent film nonetheless,"Guillermo del Toro leads us on a beautifully compelling, and oddly romantic story about a woman and a fish who fall in love.The film opens underwater, and although the later scenes do not, the set design and lighting makes us feel like we never really surface. deep Blues and swampy greens paint the film, everything I remember is shaded with these colours, it is a director which such a fine control over colour palettes I think Wes Anderson will probably feel a little outdone.Then we meet Elisa, we follow her through her morning routine, she likes eggs, is sexually frustrated, and she can't speak, she's a mute. Sally Hawkins teases life into Elisa, she could easily have played her as straight up quiet, introverted and shy, but there's so much more to her. In one scene she signs ""F*** You"" to Michael Shannon's character, for no other reason than her own enjoyment, she gives a smug little grin after doing it too. I like to imagine Sally Hawkins receiving a script from Guillermo del Toro thinking ""brilliant, finally my chance to win an Oscar"", only to open up the screenplay and realise all her lines are effectively facial expressions. She does brilliantly regardless.The film is well paced, but the blossoming romance between Elisa and Cpt Fish Finger is put rather dumbly into a montage. We don't spend enough real time with the pair as they begin to fall in love. For example by the film's half way point, Elisa is planning to break Fish Cake out of the research facility, effectively risking her life for him, but all we've seen up to this point is them eating eggs together and him watching her dance with some weird French music playing over the top. I saw no real motive for her to risk her life at this point. I wanted to see real scenes between the two of them; how do you fall in love with a frog looking guy you can't really talk to? I guess even Del Toro was unsure on that one, he skipped over the answer.The film's most redeeming quality is in it's character's. Richard Jenkins' character stood out, he is quirky and oddly magnetic, I wanted to see more of him. He got nominated for Best Supporting Actor because Sally Hawkins relied on his humour and daintiness to paint and strengthen her character. Michael Shannon as well plays a baddie straight out of the Del Toro's school of baddies, he's always sucking hard boiled sweets, his fingers bleed and get progressively darker as his character does. No character is alike. Everyone is brought to life brilliantly by the actor playing them. Octavia Spencer plays every role she ever has played, mouthy, sassy black woman - but she plays it well I wont protest.Allow yourself to fall into the trance Del Toro has created. Don't resist. It's odd and quirky and if you spend your time questioning that, the film will pass over you.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

i don't get it,"I watched this movie recently and i don't get why so many film critics went mad about it. it wasn't anything special. i thought the movie was pretty mediocre. i get what del toro was going for: movie was suppose to be magic and absorbing with great characters and to tell that people are often monsters and monsters can be hot. all that is nice and swell but the movie isn't anyting smashing. at moments, del toro's attempts to make more out of his characters look stupid. after seeing all of his movies i don't think he has the strenght, or skill to make something truly great.and sally hawkins, sally hawkins had a dozens of great and awarded performances but none of those were in multi-million hollywood productions instead they were in british cinema, so i guess that most of critics raving about her saw her for the first time so they went 'oooooooh-aaaaaaaaah'. sally hawkins is a great actress, and you noticed that just now?i hope that this film doesn't rob dunkirk of it's well deserved awards. just because something is selling sugar doesn't mean it's better that the thing that doesn't.in fact, i just came here to say that i think i now how del toro got idea for this film. i think he got it from la la land, and that this is, in fact, his version of that film. del toro, being self-proclaimed fan of monsters and monster films mashed this with la la land and scored with critics. only problem is, while la la land was a film really well made, this isn't.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good movie with somewhat of a predictable plot but full of emotional energy,"Del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"" is a movie that makes you feel really tense and emotional at the theatres, but restraints you to a degree with the linearity or familiarity of the plot structure. The villain is not really that scary or intimidating- the part where he snaps off his rotting finger is pretty much the only thing original about him- other than that he's a derivative of the typical bad, corrupt FBI agent who only listens to his mission/code similar to Anton Chigurgh in ""No Country for Old Men"".The reason i'm giving this movie an 8 is because although the characters and themes are very familiar and you don't come out of this movie with a fresh viewpoint on the world, it was well-written and some of the dialogue was very emotionally invoking. Especially the part where the old man is talking with the girl.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Shape of Water: The Grown up Fairy-tale Version of Beauty and the Beast,"This is a romantic fantasy drama, set in the 1960's at a top secret laboratory, a very tender love story between a mute cleaning woman and a captured 'sea monster', both isolated due to their individual circumstances and incapable of human speech.Starring Sally Hawkins, she is the mute, and has access to all the top secret areas in order to clean them. Octavia Spencer is also a cleaner, and crucial to the plot later. Richard Jenkins is her neighbour and Michael Shannon, is brilliant as the evil government security agent in charge of the 'monster'. It becomes obvious that he is more of a monster than the actual monster!The 'monster' is also referred to as the 'asset' and is being studied for any advantages that it could offer the USA military in the cold war with Russia.The mute says so much in her attitude, she offers the monster compassion and care, she slowly grows fond of the monster and builds a friendship through boiled eggs, sign language and music. The relationship develops further and grows into love. When she hears they propose to kill the monster she urgently plans to help it escape, houses it at her home and eventually set it free into the sea.This film has a very atmospheric, classic look, is about characters that are misfits but have inner beauty. 13 Oscar nominations.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Proof that ""The Academy"" Has Gone bye-bye","This is one of the very few movies I ever have tried to watch that I simply could not continue to watch to the finish. The story line is absolutely ridiculous. If such a creature was ever discovered in the real world, the scientific community would guard it so heavily that no one like the brutal keeper would ever get near it. There would be observation 24/7, and the military would never get near it. And the Cleaning Lady? In what fantasy world would the cleanup staff have free access to such an incredible scientific find? ""Oh, it's only a movie, and it's here to tell a story and the story is Soooooooo relevant...."" Please, spare us the platitudes. For the Academy to choose this picture for Best Picture once again shows that they are completely out of touch with those of us who actually go to the movies to watch them. Each year when I see which films are nominated, I scratch my head in wonder at how they can continue to nominate movies that almost no one has ever heard of, or are contrived to suit some crusade the director or producer is championing, or is a thought-provoking sketch about some social ill. How about some day we get back to nominating movies that people can enjoy watching? I long for the days of movies like Gone With The Wind, or Ben-Hur, or The Ten Commandments. Instead, Hollywood gives us garbage like a reformatted Ghostbusters with a female crew of specialists, or the seventh remake of The King and I. There appear to be no real new ideas for movies anymore. Some of the remakes are okay, but few really need to be made. Time to get some originality back in the game and stop the idiocy of more silly films nominated by an increasingly out-of-touch bunch of so-called professionals in the Academy. How about some real people out here having some input into the process?",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Combination of classic and modern cultures,"The Shape of Water is one of the cult-classic which combines a blend of classic and modern cultures. This is why Oscar love the movie apart from the premise which I guess seems simple, predictable, and ridiculous as I always see on the local television as romance crappy story. Guillermo Del Toro shows a simple blend of it with the fantasy technique that he always used in all his movies. The visual is one of the gorgeous pieces that ever existed, Sally Hawkins is incredible while doing a sign language, a mute princess. The set-up and production design are flawlessly underwhelmed when the film gets a lot of reputation at Oscar and the world. Some social issues may be fairly simple in this film but it can be used as a reference. But, this is a fairy tale that mixes adult components.

A mystical tale of fish and fingers,"With perfect timing after scooping 13 Oscar nominations, ""The Shape of Water"" arrives for preview screenings in the UK. Is it worth all the hype?Well, in a word, yes.Not since Spielberg entranced the world in 1982 with a love story between an isolated and lonely child and an alien, stranded a million light-years from home, have we seen a magical fairy-tale so well told.Here Lewisham's own Sally Hawkins (""Paddington"", ""Godzilla"") plays Elisa Esposito, an attractive but mousy mute living above a cinema and next door to her best friend: a struggling artist called Giles (Richard Jenkins). Sexually-frustrated, Elisa works out those tensions in the bath every morning before heading off to work as a cleaner at a government research institute. Together with partner Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer, ""Hidden Figures"") she is asked to clean a highly secured room where a mysterious aquatic creature is being studied by the cruel and militaristic Strickland (Michael Shannon, ""Midnight Special"", ""Nocturnal Animals"") and the more compassionate scientist Hoffstetler. (The latter is played by Michael Stuhlbarg (""Miss Sloane"", ""Steve Jobs"") in a performance that wasn't recognised by the Academy, but for me really held the film's story together). Elisa forms a relationship with the creature, and as the scientific investigations turn darker, she becomes determined to help him.When you think about it, the similarities in the screenplay with E.T. are quite striking. But this is most definitely not a kid's film, containing full frontal nudity, sex and some considerable violence, some of it ""hands-over-the-eyes"" worthy. Most of this violence comes courtesy of Shannon's character, who is truly monstrous. He is uncontrollably vicious, single-minded and amoral: a hand over the mouth to silence his wife during vigourous sex cleverly belies where his true lust currently lies. (Shannon is just so convincing in all of his roles that, after ""Nocturnal Animals"", it is a bit of a surprise to see that he is still alive and well!)It's worth pointing out for balance at this point that my wife thought this portrayal was over-egged for its villany, and she rated the film less highly than I did because of it.So its no Oscar nomination this time for Shannon as a supporting actor. But that honour goes to Richard Jenkins, who is spectacularly good as the movie-musical-loving and pie-munching neighbour who is drawn unwillingly into Elisa's plans. Giles is a richly fashioned character - also the film's narrator - who struggles to fit in with the cruel and rascist 1962 world that he finds himself in. ""Sometimes I think I was born too early or too late for my life"" he bemoans to the creature whose loneliness he relates to. A scene in a cafe where he fastidiously wipes all traces of pie-filling from his tongue is masterfully done.Octavia Spencer is also Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and it's a magical partnership she shares with Hawkins, with each bouncing off each other wonderfully.This leads to a 'no brainer' Oscar nomination for Sally Hawkins who delivers a star turn. She has to go through such a huge range of emotions in this film, and she genuinely makes you really care about the outcome like few films this year. It's a little tricky since I haven't seen ""I Tonya"" or ""Ladybird"" yet, but I would have thought that Ms Hawkins is going to possibly give Frances McDormand the closest run for her money on March 4th. My money would still be on McDormand for ""3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", but the Oscar voters are bound to love ""The Shape of Water"". For like ""La La Land"" last year, the film is (rather surprisingly for me) another love letter to Hollywood's golden years, with Elisa and Giles living out their lives with classic movie music and dance numbers: a medium that Elisa only ever truly finds here ""voice"" through.In the technical categories the Oscar nominations were for Cinematography (Dan Laustsen); Film Editing (Sidney Wolinsky); Sound Editing (Nathan Robitaille and Nelson Ferreira); Sound Mixing (Glen Gauthier, Christian Cooke and Brad Zoern); Production Design (Paul D. Austerberry, Jeffrey A. Melvin and Shane Vieau); Original Score (Alexandre Desplat) and Costume Design (Luis Sequeira). And you really wouldn't want to bet against any of these not to win, for the film is a technical delight. Right from the dreamlike opening titles (arguably, they missed a deserved nomination here for Visual Effects), the film is gorgeous to look at, with such brilliant detail in the production design that there is interesting stuff to look at in every frame. And the film editing is extraordinary: Elisa wobbles on the bucket she's standing on, but it's Strickland's butt, perched on a table, that slips off. This is a film that deserves multiple repeat viewings.An the helm is the multi-talented Guillermo del Toro (""Pacific Rim"", ""Crimson Peak"") who both directed and co-wrote the exceptionally smart screenplay (with Vanessa Taylor, ""Divergent"") and is nominated for both. I actually found the story to be rather predictable, as regards Elisa's story arc, but that in no way reduced my enjoyment of the film. For the ""original screenplay"" is nothing if not ""original"".... it's witty, intelligent and shocking at different turns.The violence and sex won't be for everyone... but this is a deep and rich movie experience that everyone who loves the movies should at least appreciate... hopefully in a dry cinema!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
clearly a labor of love from a unique director,"Set in Baltimore, Maryland at the height of the Cold War, this unusual romance focuses on a lonely and mute custodian (a warm, wide-eyed Hawkins) working at a high-security government laboratory. There, she runs afoul of a detestable military project leader (a vicious Shannon), but also forms a special bond with a captive, ichthy amphibious creature. At times resembling the old silent pictures this is an ambitious showing from director Guillermo del Toro who creates a rich fantasy world that's imbued with vivid scenery, captivating characters, plus deep emotional resonance. The set design is impeccable, the acting is first-rate, and the story unfolds in ways you wouldn't quite expect. Reminiscent of Beauty and the Beast this is unconventional, even a tad awkward at times, but thoughtful and touching in its own distinct way. ***",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bizarre Love Story.,"A masterpiece of cinematography, with a magnificent love story even though it was weird and uncomfortable at moments. 
Despite all the weirdness, Guillermo Del Toro did make it look normal and natural even beautiful. The touches of homophobia, racism and woman Right were perfect. It was an outcry to society and a reminder of how where things in the past. The depiction was brutal and realistic, it just makes it so touching and moving. 
Elisa, the mute woman, was loving in her own silent way. Without talking she could, with her gestures and her actions, show us that speaking, talking isn't necessary to a human being, that even though you aren't complete for society, that you are broken for society you are still human. 
I couldn't find one single thing that I didn't like in this movie, it was just good.

"It's a good movie, but not as good as I was expecting.","I don't know many Guillermo del Toro movies, but I imagined this movie to be a little similar to ""Pan's Labyrinth"", a work that I really liked. So I sat down to watch it with some anticipation. When it ended, I didn't feel cheated, but I also don't think it's any better than that other Del Toro film, despite the greater media attention and professional criticism. It received four Oscars (Best Film, Best Director, Best Production Design and Best Soundtrack).The film begins by introducing us to Elisa, a mute cleaning lady who works in a high-security Army facility, where there are military laboratories and workshops, and where a marine creature caught in the Amazon River ends up being arrested. The creature quickly becomes close to Elisa, who falls in love with that being. When it becomes obvious that the military is going to kill him, Elisa decides to save his life and give him back his freedom.The film is quite surreal and dreamlike, and that for me was something very positive. I really liked the creature, and the design given to it, and I think that the characters and dialogues were written and conceived in a very detailed and thorough way. Unfortunately, the film has too much explicit nudity to be a family movie, and there are also some shocking and violent scenes that are not strictly suitable for children or sensitive people.The cast leaves us, in general, a very well-executed job. Sally Hawkins manages to be convincing in the role she plays and leaves us with an excellent performance. I also really liked Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins, who brought to life the only friends the film's protagonist really had. Michael Stuhlbarg also handled the challenge at hand quite well, even if he doesn't have a lot of time to do much of it. The actor who turned out to be the weakest here was Michael Shannon. He wasn't able to make his villain really threatening and cold. Instead, he turned him into an insecure, fake, and aggressive individual who uses his profession to humiliate and demean others.We all know that Del Toro's films tend to have a lot of style, and a strong style, with a very personal nature. This film does not escape, on the contrary: it is one of the best to see well the habits and visual signatures of the director. This is the case of cinematography and the color palette that was used, and where green, in various shades, has a great ascendant. Set in the 60s, the film has several sets and period cars and this works very well, as well as the costumes, highlighting here, of course, the aquatic monster costume. All the visual effects worked reasonably well, and the characterization team also deserves praise for their work with Doug Jones. The soundtrack, signed by Alexandre Desplat, was also excellent and quite unusual.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A beauty and the beast fairy tale of love, hope, and connection.","Never really been a watcher of Guillermo del Toro movies, yet being a lover and liking movies that blend sci-fi and pay homage to classic monsters, I for sure had to check out this latest epic called ""The Shape of Water"". And this movie is a touching and moving film that's a blend of drama, romance, and adventure fantasy.Set in the late 1950's early 1960's in Baltimore at a top notch government research lab this movie becomes a journey of escape and a journey of connection for two people who couldn't be more different. Sally Hawkins is Elisa a lonely and mute janitor who's only friends are her co worker Zelda(in a blunt and brash performance from Octavia Spencer)and her neighbor Giles(a wonderful Richard Jenkins). Plus Elisa puts up with verbal and mental abuse from her cold and mean boss Richard(the in groove Michael Shannon). However being alert and noticing things behind the scenes with eyes and ears pays off for Elisa.Elisa slowly but surely begins a relationship of love and intimacy with a strange and mysterious sea like creature(something similar to the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""). And aside from this the film becomes a drama of twists and turns a need for escape and survival and you ask questions who can and who do you trust?Overall this movie is a great escape of connection and a journey to love and belonging proving that happiness is possible for lonely and different types of people.

Shape of Water: Strangely Poetic,"There are many dimensions to the Shape of Water. Ultimately it is a love story. It is a love that seems to defy reason. Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a janitor working at a government facility, where one day she comes across a mysterious amphibian man like creature (Doug Jones), captured by government agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). Due an injury as a toddler, Elisa cannot talk, and neither can he. From the outset, this relationship between Elisa and the creature is bizarre, and difficult to comprehend. But, if you look closer, their love is the most pure, and the simplest form you could find.They saw each other for who they are, and accepted it. To her, he isn't just a freak of nature. She is fascinated by who he is, and shows kindness and respect for him. Having been isolated and repressed for so long, she finally had someone who didn't judge for her for disability. Although neither of them could talk, they communicated most honestly and warmly. Hawkins and Jones ensured that Elisa and the creature's common language was their authenticity and their vulnerability.Water had a profound symbolic significance for this story. The Shape of Water suggests something is undefined and has no distinctive shape. Water gave oxygen to Elisa and the creature's love. Two of the most memorable scenes in the film involved masterful, artistic use of water. Without water, he could not survive, and she shows her love through being in water with him. Water is their love and freedom and director Guillermo Del Toro lets it bring to the scenes an elegant tranquillity.Hawkins, who was terrific in Blue Jasmine, gave another outstanding performance here. Although she didn't utter a word here, we could still see her soul. Her character and performance reminded of Amy Adams in the Arrival - the anticipation, the apprehension, and curiosity is all portrayed with heartfelt emotion. Del Toro cleverly employs a couple of side-characters to act as her interpreter for us. Through them, we get clear confirmation for what she is thinking, but really, Hawkins had already communicated what she needed to. Those side characters - Giles (Richard Jenkins) - a gay artist Elisa lives with, Zelda (Octavia Spencer) - an African American janitor who works with Elisa and Dr Hoffstetler (Michael Stulbarg) - a scientist who is also a Russian spy during the Cold War, all had something in common with Elisa, they are oppressed and have struggled through torment. Perceived as underdogs, and not really belonging to society, perhaps Del Toro wanted to show that the greatest tolerance comes from those that are already repressed.A monster isn't defined by its appearance. Del Toro boldly contrasts Shannon's Strickland with the creature, and let us decide who the real monster is. I could always rely on Shannon to portray a villain who is despicable, yet immensely intriguing. Strickland is icy cold, and Shannon infuses him with a fierce desperation that is deadly, but relatable. He is tortured on the inside and on the outside, and is often infuriated with himself. I found it amusing that he forces himself to only have positive thoughts - it shows that he is constantly running from the truth. We can see that he constructs a façade that isn't him - a family, a luxury car. It is quite intelligent that Strickland's character accentuates the qualities we value in our protagonists - that is truth, honesty and kindness.I could always trust Del Toro to imagine a world that is exquisitely colourful and exuberant (much like Crimson Peak, Pan's Labyrinth). I have always thought of the theatre as a very romantic place, and to have Elisa live on top of one, was the perfect setting for her romantic heart. The introduction of Elisa and the exposition was expertly crafted, with Alexandre Desplat's buoyant score skilfully complementing the vibrance of her character. The only thing I would have loved to see more of, was the development of Elisa and the creature's relationship, But perhaps it was that simple. We humans tend to complicate love. Perhaps silent dialogue is more truthful than a spoken one.The Shape of Water has elements of many genres. It is not an extremely comfortable film to watch - there are some graphic details of violence, and for some, it will be a strange film. I'd like to describe the film was strangely poetic, and it is fantastic in that once you have a think about what the film is trying to convey - it is actually done in the most poetic way.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Enjoyable fantasy tale,"Oscar winning movie about a lonely woman working as a cleaner in a military facility during the Cold War era. There she encounters and befriends a merman that they have captured.The film is enjoyable enough, although I struggle to understand the Best Picture Oscar.

The only thing that wasn't perfect for me was the villain and even that was amazing, it's just that everything was on a another level in this film and Michael Shannon just couldn't bring it home for me...only because a movie of this quality needed a Heath Ledgers Joker level of acting to be in line with everything else.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deep and beautiful as the water of its title,"""The Shape of Water"" is director Guillermo del Toro's finest film, a lovely, empathetic tribute to Old Hollywood, monster movies, outsiders and love that could only come from the mind of the visionary filmmaker and takes elements from ""Beauty and the Beast"". Del Toro creates a beautifully imagined world and characters, shot in blue and green hues, with touches of humour and social commentary. Sally Hawkins's performance is career-defining. With her eyes, mouth and physicality, she finds a level of emotional greatness. Her character Elisa may not speak, but you are never in doubt about what she is feeling. Like the water of its title, the film is deep, mysterious and beautiful. Definitely a must - see!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Giving voice to the voiceless,"The Shape of Water, which has an excellent acting quality, is not great, but is a fast-paced, not boring, good movie. The photography is not impressive, special effects are not excellent, neither is makeup, costumes or the plot, just as it does not introduce novel cinematographic elements. In addition, Del Toro repeats himself in the concept he used in Pan's Labyrinth, which by the way, is an excellent film in all its elements. Now, although the film is not particularly sentimental and for some it might be creepy to think of a human copulating with an amphibian, its real value lies in its ability to give voice and visibility to those who are invisible in our society. There is much talk, for example, of the rights of gay people, but there is no talk of the immense loneliness they are subjected to, especially when they reach a certain age or stage of life. Little is said about the loneliness, isolation and rejection experienced by people with disabilities or those who do not conform to socially established stereotypes. Elisa, Giles and the creature itself - of which we never knew its origin, or its species, or its story - personify the most painful of all solitudes, the one that is experienced even when surrounded by others. The Shape of Water provides us with a glimpse into the lives of these beings who go through life surviving instead of living, with the ever weaker hope of finally being seen by someone. It is worth watching this movie with a reflective spirit.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The form of Love,"The director Guillermo del Toro delivers a timeless story of love and terror mixing different influences since 60's noir and espionage films passing through Walt Disney's tales until German terror movies from the beginning of 20's century. Actually, he offers well-built scenes showing the little monsters and lovers that inhabit each one of the film's characters when they cross the creature way, an Amazon human form being that embodies nature itself. The main character is a mute janitor working to a military scientific facility where the creature is studied. The screenplay chooses her to bare both the social prejudice of being handicapped and a housecleaning hard worker. In fact, she lives stoically her life while dreaming of a better one in her bathtub of a small apartment over an old cinema theater. Thus, from this little place, she plans how to release the creature and herself. The last scene brings the film's synthesis encapsulated in two sentences: ""when you don´t see the form, the form is everywhere"". A final message that portrays the possibility of being loved no matter form you and your love have. Great film!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An unconventional beauty.,"Among my favorite directors is Guillermo del Toro. The guy has one of the most unique artistic and cinematic visions in the world of film. His inspiration to become a filmmaker was ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" of all things. Del Toro's love the Gill Man translated to his passion for monsters, though he felt sad that the famed amphibian never got a happy ending. Initially, he was brought in by Universal to remake it, but that deal went south, so he decided to more-or-less tell his own version of the story, adding a new spin that surprisingly won over both audiences and awards. That, folks, is ""The Shape of Water"", a movie I've wanted to see since its inception.Plot: In this variation of beauty and the beast, a mute janitor named Eliza (Sally Hawkins), who works in a government facility, meets the Asset (Doug Jones), a fish-like humanoid from South America, and the two form an unconventional relationship. With the Asset under threat of death and subsequent vivisection by the unstable Col. Strickland (Michael Shannon), Eliza will go to great lengths to ensure the creature's survival and happiness, but will she succeed in a world so unwilling to accept that which is different?This is, indeed, a masterpiece. The Asset is an amazing character with a stellar design and a performance that feels believable (animal yet human-like). Props to Jones and the effects team for making the suit and facial expressions work with flying colors. Sally Hawkins gets high marks from her own performance, a mix of sign language and heartstring-pulling facial expressions. The pair work well together as much as their characters. The rest of the cast did very well too from Shannon's execution of a threatening villain who feels unfulfilled (a product of the era) to Octavia Spencer's humorous inflections to sympathetic portrayals by Richard Jenkins and Michael Stuhlbarg.There is also much needed credit to the world itself. It replicates the time of which the story is set in very well with many great uses of color, music, and an assortment of objects that are relics by today's standards. The best part of it all is that a majority is physically built with not much in the way of CGI save for backgrounds and a few other aesthetics. Color is also used to convey mood or symbolize a character's status (physical or emotional) and water, as the title implies, is very prominent and more or less serves both a physical and symbolic purpose as well. What little lore that exists in this world intrigues me to no end with many open-ended questions, especially in regards to the fish man. As the film is set in the 1960s, themes of racism/sexism, Cold War tensions, minor religious references, and the classic question of what separates man from monster are explored, all done with superb execution in this case. Heck, the Asset is ideal in that he can represent just about any group that suffers unjust oppression.Fair warning that, unlike Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"", this is not for children. There is a little blood + gore, language, and sex/nudity (especially one controversial scene involving the latter in a bathroom).All in all, ""The Shape of Water"" is, like the abnormal pair, a thing of beauty, one that I imagine will be marveled for generations to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Shape of an Escapist Movie!...with flaws.,"Firstly I adore del Torro. I have enjoyed almost everything he has done & consider him a genius of modern movie making.(I am a massive monster movie fan!) For me the Shape of Water is no exception. I loved it! But ...Ok, onto the review. TSoW is a fairytale wrapped up in a love letter to the Hollywood Golden era. It tells the story of a mute lady cleaner (janitor) Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who falls in love with an ""asset"" at a top secret American base during the 60's Cold War era. The story telling is sublime & the direction near perfect. The movie is a visual feast too, which will delight those of us of del Torro's generation (like me) with temptations of deep nostalgia. Visually it is almost a work of art from the first few seconds of the film. The acting too is superb. I loved Octivia Spencer (Snowpiercer) as the friend of our heronie, which was wonderfully acted. However ther are some inexplicable mistakes in the story which I wont go into as I will be firmly in spoiler teritory. Also parts of the story are stiched with a delicate silken thread of collectivism. To be fair it is almost unnoticable but non the less movies that go down this route are very distracting to us, the audience. We do not need to see our lovley herione in the bath having some solo lady fun as it is unnessisary to the story. We are also told that this story is about the Other. I have been an ""Other"" most of my life. Bullied at school for my disabillities.. Oh I know what it is to be an ""Other"" But do we really need a fairytale about Othering? Please leave that to the other collectivists in Hollywood. Well this aspect & the ""lady solo"" scenes really put me off, sorry. I was also a little put off by the Hollywood all singing all dancing Musical number which seemed, forced, strange & almost out of place. TSoW is also a 15 certificate which seems fair as I certainly would not show this to children. Lastly this IS a good film! It is absorbing & does what movies used to do which is take its audience away from the rat race of real life into a world of fantasy & magic. It is pure escapeism. Just how it should be.A wonderfully escapist movie with flaws. But escapism is what we need.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Love Life Of The Creature From The Black Lagoon,"Guillermo del Toro is a real talent, but I think this movie asks a question that I was not that interested in: given that sexuality is an intensely personal kink, who would be turned on by the Creature from the Black Lagoon? And aren't the people who don't like the Creature from the Black Lagoon just horrid statists?My interest in the various more popular forms of scifi have never extended to K/S or such. They never brought it up; therefore it didn't happen or was none of my business, and none of yours either. The dirtier, the better, and the less your business. And mine. Good fences make good neighbors, and so do drapes for the windows. And thick walls.There are some fine images, and Del Toro has gotten some top-notch performers in to offer some wonderful performances, including Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins (a personal best performance) and Octavia Spencer. However, as is often the case with these visual stylists, the pacing becomes uneven in the middle.

Overrated. Politically correct is all.,"Moral ambiguity. Challenging questions. Debate-sparking presentations. That's what Guillermo Del Toro was good at! None of that are in this film.

Although I value such political positions, that was not why I wanted to watch a film! I wanted to watch, experience, and immerse myself into a work of art. Not a fleshed-out, philosophically vacuous, overrated, overinflated, oversaturated propaganda!

All characters did their part and the story is not that bad. But that monster was simply to horrible.

Shape of water depends on what it is used to contain it,"Del Toro's visually dazzling dark fantasy is probably his best since Pan's Labrynth.

poorly executed and highly overrated,"A story, no doubt, with a good premise - after all, who nowadays won't enjoy a slice of fantasy with a shade of xenophilia? I certainly can say that I do enjoy such things. Well, what a disappointment. Premise may be satisfying, but everything else is terrific. Atmosphere that starts to build up from the beginning of the film is constantly shattered by cheap symbolism and something that I could call ""not going with it all the way through"". Obviously, the movie is one that holds a purpose of disturbing feelings with good storytelling and aesthetics - unfortunately, it lacks in both of these areas. Components lead nowhere and keep viewer wondering why they were placed here in the first place. Scenes are either not disturbing enough or not beautiful enough. The fact that these little things ruin something potentially good and precious, well, is very sad. I don't know why this film is so widely appreciated - there's nothing special, nothing disturbing and nothing magnificent about it.
If you want to watch something with similar dystopian-ish atmosphere and aesthetics, better spend your time on La Antenna (2007). It doesn't contain any monster-loving, but it is a good example of dystopian fairy tale like story.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fairy tale for troubled times with competent direction and writing by Guillermo del Toro.,"Set in Baltimore, in the sixties. Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), is a night cleaner at an aerospace research center. When she is cleaning with her co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) in a high security area they bring to the laboratory a large capsule with a strange being inside it, it is actually a living fossil. Also appearing in the film are a violent security chief named Strickland (Michael Shannon), Eliza's gay neighbor friend (Richard Jenkins), a doctor (Michael Stuhlbarg) in charge of studying the amphibian man and the strange creature (Doug Jones). Experience a connection beyond words!.Based on an idea by Daniel Kraus and Guillermo del Toro, this is a story of love and loss in a time of collective psychosis, hatred, violence and intolerance. A mysterious fairy tale full of emotions, passion, spooky events and deep love. A superior story with fantasy, unexpected terrifying events and including a visually striking monstrous creature with remarkably human appearance. This gothic romance film features glamorous, evocative production designs and art designs by Austerberry and Nigel Churcher and brilliant cinematography by Dan Laustsen, along with a moving musical score by Alexandre Desplat. An interesting and frankly attractive script, full of surprises, twists and turns from Vanessa Taylor and Guillermo Del Toro himself. Deservedly winning the 2018 Oscar for best film, best director (Guillermo del Toro), best music (Alexandre Desplat) and best production, among countless other awards, this supernatural fairy tale is also a romantic drama set in the middle of the Cold War as background curtain. Directed and co-written (along with Vanessa Taylor) by Mexican Guillermo del Toro, the film tells the relationship between an amphibious humanoid monster brought from South America and a young and lonely orphan who was found newborn in a river, in the water, with her cut vocal cords.With this film Del Toro wanted to give a twist to monster stories, giving prominence to the creature and showing humans as truly dangerous beings. As the director explains: ¨In a 1950s monster movie, Strickland, the sharp-chinned government agent, would be the hero and the creature the villain; I wanted to reverse this type of things¨.To bring this fantastic fable to life, Del Toro enlisted the great performances of Sally Hawkins as Eliza, Octavia Spencer as Zelda Fuller, Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, Doug Jones as Amphibian Man, Richard Jenkins as the friendly gay neighbor and others very secondary such as David Hewlett as Fleming, Nick Searcy, Stewart Arnott, Nigel Bennett, Lauren Lee Smith, Morgan Kelly, John Kapelos, among others.The Mexican director explains the title of the film as follows: ""Water adapts the shape of what it contains at that moment and although water can be something very peaceful, it is also the most powerful and malleable force in the universe and also in the world."" Love. Regardless of the form in which we place our love, it fits in the water, whether it is a man, a woman or a creature. Director Guillermo del Toro said of Sally Hawkins: ""Not only was she the first choice, but which was the only option. I wrote the movie for Sally, I wrote the movie for Michael Shannon. I wanted Elisa's character to be beautiful, in her own way, not as if she were a perfume commercial. That you could believe that this role, this woman would be sitting next to you on the bus, but at the same time she would have a luminosity, a beauty, almost magical, ethereal"".This pleasant and beautiful film was competently directed by Guillermo del Toro in his usual, if sometimes somewhat slow, style. The film was acclaimed and praised by both audiences and critics. Toro is a good writer, producer and director with a special predilection for fantasy, horror and strange stories. Del Toro often photographs insects or takes images of them, as well as archangels, symbols and other religious elements. Guillermo is a film buff who usually shows dark atmospheres and sinister events in his films. Guillermo has made a lot of successful movies, such as: Cronos, Devil Backbone, Pan Labyrinth, Mímic, Hellboy I y II, Blade II, Pacific Rim, and Crimson Peak. Del Toro is also a prolific producer, his production works include blockbusters and acclaimed films, such as The Orphanage, Julia's Eyes, Biutiful, Kung Fu Panda 2, Mama, Puss in Boots, among others. Rating 7/10. Better than the ordinary average, although it is a bit long. The film will appeal to Guillermo del Toro enthusiasts. Being essential and indispensable observation.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Movie Review: The Shape of Water (2017),"Guillermo del Toro is one of the greatest filmmakers of the past 20 years, his resume is nothing but amazing. Del Toro has written and directed so many cinematic greats ranging from his video game contributions to his TV and feature length films.The Shape of Water is no different than his other amazing features. This film has been referenced as the ""unofficial"" sequel to ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and this reviewer must agree. Visually and story wise this film is beautiful in every aspect. Del Toro nailed it with this film, it not only has the horror element but it also brings the romantic and dramatic element as well which appeases the cinephile in all of us. This film creates a time warp bringing the audience back into the 1960's by paying tribute to early Argento with the individual colour schemes, as well as bringing back the feel of the old school films that many nowadays have almost forgotten.The acting in Del Toro's film have always been top notch, this film is no exception. The casting of this film is nothing short of amazing, starting with Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer who without this film couldn't have been a success that it was. Both women made Oscar winning performances, especially Ms. Hawkins who didn't speak a hardly a line of dialogue and alongside monster master Doug Jones made a truly romantic match in cinematic heaven. Richard Jenkins was also an amazing support cast member to this story. Michael Shannon could not have been cast better, he has such a way about bringing villains to life on the big screen. Shannon and Jones are such amazing actors and in my opinion should have gotten more screen time.Everything down to the set decorations, the music, the cinematography couldn't have been better. This film was so much more than a monster movie...it was a romantic drama as well with a splash of the old school flare than many filmmakers nowadays have forgotten about.If you haven't gotten a chance to see this film, do yourself a favour and buy this film on DVD or 4K I promise you, you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It is a film you must watch from start to end and it just keeps getting deeper and better right up to the time when the credits roll. Not a frame of this film is wasted, every millisecond is an important and integral part pf the story. Sally Hawkins is stunning in this role and it is a role that only a very excellent actress could have made believable and she did so superbly.

"A visually impressive, but ultimately formulaic and bland film","Having finally seen this film now, I do find it to be vastly overrated, while at the same time it became perfectly clear why this won the Best Picture award last year, as it comes off as typical Oscar bait.THE SHAPE OF WATER is basically the quintessential del Toro film - beautiful on the outside and crafted with great attention to visual detail, but shallow and formulaic in terms of substance. It's a fairy tale, a narrative consistently painted in black and white with its empowerment of all possible sorts of minorities in a conservative 1950s setting.My biggest problem with the film was its lack of real emotion. The whole romance felt clumsy and unbelievable. While it might have been plausible for the female protagonist to save this merman from certain death, them falling in love was just forced. A mute woman, scared of most men, suddenly offers herself to a humanoid fish? And her work colleague doesn't think that's weird at all? These offputting scenes did nothing for me except for making me feel uncomfortable.Again, just like with CRIMSON PEAK, del Toro made a good looking, yet strangely unemotional feeling film - they also both share scenes with explicit violence that kind of interfere with the narrative's tone. Some directors seem to struggle with conveying palpably emotion in their films, and besides Christopher Nolan, del Toro appears to be one of them.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A powerful fairy-tale,"A modern fairy-tale centered around the uncanny power of sexuality. Perfect art direction, and Sally Hawkins is a force (she was the best thing about Blue Jasmine, too). The beginning was more Jeunet than delToro, a few hints of Amelie and City of Lost Children, but the movie found its voice about 20 minutes in. It positively revels in its B-movie tropes (Michael Shannon's first scene sets the tone) and takes them to extremes which were not possible back then when the originals were shot, without changing the basic sensibilities.Was there something not to like? There's a side-plot about enemy agents which is completely superfluous; every scene we spend with those cardboard Russians is a scene wasted imho; ads nothing to the story and takes us away from the protagonists. In a fairy-tale things should be kept simple.But overall, while not delToro's best, The Shape of Water is definitely worth a ticket.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A few big problems (Contains very slight spoilers),"Yes, everything you've heard about this film is true, it's gorgeous, well acted, well written, entertaining and provides a lot to sink your teeth into in terms of symbolism and themes... but there's a few big problems I had with it...For me, the central romantic relationship was silly, I never bought into it. It almost felt rushed to me, like the writers didn't believe it either. Girl meets fish monster, girl instantly falls for fish monster even though it is rather terrifying and has already maimed someone, girl gives rather tacked on reason for her feelings etc. Personally it wasn't enough to buy this rather strange coupling of souls, unless you're easily pleased in films I suppose.Which leads onto my other problem with the film. Had this film been longer it really could have taken the time to add more depth and exposition to the loneliness everyone supposedly feels and Elisa's past so their motivations and actions made sense... it really felt a bit rushed throughout and I really wasn't as emotionally invested like everyone else claims they were. If you were to compare the portrayal of loneliness in this film to the likes of a film such as Moon... Moon has a much bigger impact, but then Del Toro crams a heck of a lot more into this film.On top of all this I found it very hard to believe some of the events in the film because of some annoying plot holes (the poor security in the supposed 'high security' facility being the most jarring). The film was never more than a delightful romp, rather than the high art some people are labelling it.I realise my review is quite negative but overall the film really is a lot of fun. It was never boring, it was funny, the set design and cinematography is astonishing, the acting is top notch, the story is good fun if rather hackneyed and there's a lot to take from it, but overall the film never reached the heights of Pan's Labyrinth or Devil's Backbone, because it never took itself seriously and remained very much a simple fairy tale, rather than the dramatic masterpiece I was hoping it would be.4/5Side note : I have noticed a lot of critics praise films very highly when they reference many other films so this may be where the gushing of love for this film has come from.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Very Well Made, But Lacked A Real Message","After seeing ""The Shape of Water"" take home the Best Picture award at the latest Oscars ceremony, I wanted to see what the buzz was about (I had been meaning to watch it before-hand but never quite got around to it). After viewing, what I found was that while the film was clearly very well-made, it seemed to lack a solid message to give it real purpose.For a basic plot summary, ""Shape of Water"" primarily focuses on Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a mute woman who works as a janitor at a government research facility in 1962. One day, a strange fish-like creature (Doug Jones) is brought onto the premises to be poked, prodded, and otherwise tortured while the U.S. government continues to try and keep one step ahead of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Elisa takes a more sympathetic approach with the new creature, however, and discovers that she must try and rescue it from whatever Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), the leader of the facility, has in store for it.As I mentioned, technically this is a very sound film. The cinematography is always beautiful, the pacing is excellent (it never feels rushed or boring), and the acting is great throughout the whole thing. Belying what on the outside looks like it could be quite a convoluted, supernatural tale, ""Shape of Water"" is actually a very simple film that most viewers will be able to follow quite easily. This is why I can't go any lower than 6/10 stars, as it deserves at least that ranking.That being said, I also felt that this was almost so simple of a film as to be a little pointless sometimes. It never really surprised me in the direction it would go, and there were certain plot threads (like what exactly this aquamarine creature and where did it come from?) that I felt could have been expounded on instead of others. Clearly, the intent here was to create a very simple love story out of a very complicated set of circumstances, and that isn't necessarily my favorite type of filmmaking. In short, I wanted more backstory/information than what I ultimately received from the viewing experience.So, while this would never be my ""best picture"" of anything, I can indeed see why it garnered so much Hollywood praise. It's exceptionally well-made, harkens back to old-Hollywood at times, and is very much a simple tale told at a time when such tales are looked upon favorably. It is also a film that can be enjoyed by large swaths of viewers, so that is a big plus as well. It's worth a watch if you are intrigued, but perhaps won't measure up to expectations if you are looking for more in-depth storytelling out of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

the shape of a good movie,"Guillermo del Toro shows why many consider him an excellent director, the film is wonderful as a dark reinvention of the story of the beauty and the beast gives it its touch of originality, it makes an inter-species relationship that feels attachment so real and beautiful his characters and this is thanks to the excellent performance of Sally Hawkins and his chemistry with Doug Jones show that acting goes beyond immense dialogues and that emotions through our expressions and sign language do not limit us to understand the feeling that surrounds us each scene, also the actors like Michael Shannon who plays an excellent role, Octavia Spencer who recently did an Gifted and shows how talented he is and Richard Jenkins also does a great job, the music of Alexandre Desplat using classical music to set the mood according to the moments that are happening throughout the film and the photograph of Dan Laustsen just beautiful who had already I worked with del Toro on Crimson Peak and mimic , but despite the fact that I loved the movie there is only one but I could put it and it is the manipulator that is with the protagonists and I mean is that each of the characters are forced too to love them or to feel sympathy for them or even to feel hatred for them, it is as if they were marked with a sign saying that he is good, he is bad, he is innocent that comes to feel forced at the time of seeing this film, outside of that the film is incredible both visual, and narrative (except for that detail) is definitely a melodrama with fantasy that you must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brutal novel that transcends languages and moral,"A film that goes from the playful French play ""the fabulous destiny of Amélie Poulain"" to the Japanese trash ""Guinea Ping"". A film of immersion and construction of impeccable characters. Guilherme Del Toro builds a plot with several narrative mirrors to the ""labyrinth of the faun"", a fairy tale that blends the brutality of human nature, a conjecture about love. hatred, depression and self-assertion. The screenplay for ""La forma da Agua"" tells us a bizarre, gothic love story that brings with it a series of characteristics, which are supported by its many and fabulous characters, which for me is the high point of script, the construction of characters, we have a character in search of love and its counterpoint, the one that is already sick of love, we have characters in search of self discovery, and in contrast, a character who has already discovered himself, and why , must be self-affirming. That is, the romance between a woman and a sea creature is only an excuse to explore and unite the most diverse human feelings and anguishes, and even this novel being diminished in my text in the film, it is absurdly explored, from this solitude and abstinence lived by the character of Sally Hawkins that ends up triggering in her a curiosity to the new, and even the fact that it is mute, this creates a bond with the creature, and leaves the scenes very the most beautiful because we have only the visual resource to contemplate the passion of the two, passion that transcends morality or language, is only one character completing the emptiness of the other and communicating through the universal language of love, Romantic too? may be, because the whole movie behaves like a French novel of the 90s, with some small shocks of reality, we can not fail to mention how much the dialogues are sharp and very clever. The moral of the film is really talking about the peculiarities of its characters, that although the world was in the 60s, the most primitive human feelings still stood out, and people, even the ""Villains"" had their dramas, because the Michael Shannon's character is completely broken, he's a villain who needs to stay down every second self-asserting, that leaves him completely meticulous and scary, yet human. Technically the film is impeccable, with a palette of greenish colors, an edition that cadenza well the rhythm of the film, great edition and sound mixing, besides an enviable production design and impeccable costumes and a soundtrack that strolls through songs of the years 40,50,60 always in a light way that combines a lot with the film and makes the viewer fall in love with Del Toro's feature film. Guilherme Del Toro, alias, who can win his first Oscar, the fabulous director directs a film almost completely perfect, showing that ""The Labyrinth of Fauno"" was not only luck but the competence of the Mexican director, who enchants with his monsters, script and technique, although I think that ""Labyrinth Do Fauno"" is still his masterpiece, but ""The form of Aguá"" is the film that will open the director's quality to the world. All the actors in the film are spectacularly great, Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins make a perfect trio of performances, and all of them were very well rewarded for their great performances, but I wanted to mention also Michael Shannon, who even a little forgotten in awards, looks great in his role, the actor has a magnificent screen presence. The film only ends in its act of completion, the film ends at the wrong time, and we do not have the dualism between real and ludic that I expected, in addition to the film little explore the drama of Michael Stuhlbarg, finally, ""The form of Water"" is one of the great films of 2018, is a work indispensable to the lovers of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An over-praised monster romance that's beautiful to look at,"Beautiful to look at and constructed with an old school filmmaking sensibility that moulds together well with Guillermo Del Toro's particular directional style and off-beat dark humour, the much acclaimed The Shape of Water is a good film but it's also not the so-called great film that's been lavished with an equal record 13 Academy Award nominations.It's not hard to pinpoint where Water excels and where its caught a little short, as surprisingly what lets Del Toro's visually captivating and sometimes fantastical treat down, is the very romance and relationship at the heart of this somewhat stereotypical monster infused romance.Built around Sally Hawkins mute, lonely and bathtime loving cleaning lady Elisa Esposito, who spends her night's listening to Octavia Spencer's The Help co-worker Zelda, only to find herself inraptured with a new fishy specimen at her work, Water neither spends enough time building the star crossed friendship/romance that builds between Elisa and Doug Jone's fishman or spends enough time with the two central figures as a whole as Del Toro instead focuses a lot of his attention's on side plots and distractions that work sometimes and plod at other times.With Del Toro choosing to fill his pre-Cold War set tale with nasty government baddies in the lead form of the hamming it up evil Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins repressed artist/pie lover and kindly neighbour Giles and Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian spy with a conscience Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, the heart of Water gets muddled at times and while clearly an elergy for race, the minorities and acceptance, this Beauty and the Beast with added H20 could've benefited from a greater focus and a more prominent beating heart.Disappointments aside, the craft of Del Toro's best project in year's is top notch.Following on from the gothically handsome yet genuinely bad Crimson Peak, Water is a return to form for the Mexian auteur in a production and construction sense with Dan Laustsen's cinematography capturing the film brilliantly, Paul D. Austerberry production design encapsulating the period with only a handful of sets, while Alexandre Desplat's award winning score is another fine piece of work for the composser.The film also features some committed and noteworthy turns with Hawkins in particular leading from the front and the always solid Stuhlbarg, who has had a great few years in front of the camera.Other Oscar nominated turns from Jenkins and Spencer seem more like the Academy getting a little carried away, with both performers delivering autopilot like turns, while Shannon needs to move very carefully in the coming months to make sure these off-kilter wide-eyed maniac's his made his built his career on don't completely pigeonhole him into a one dimensional character actor for hire.Final Say -There have been many that have and will continue to fall under The Shape of Water's spell but this Oscar frontrunner leaves a lot to be desired emotionally from it's romantic core, even if craft wise, this is Del Toro at the peak of his filmmaking powers.3 1/2 house cat's out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Of monsters and men,"It's the space race and Cold War crazed 60's again, with America being at its finest: gloomy underground facilities, ""mission above humanity"" ethics and slightly covered racist undertones. And huge glorious metal beasts on four wheels of course.And among those cold monstrosities live regular people, some big and self-important, some little, alone and confused. Elisa Esposito is a shy mute janitor girl working in some secret lab, whose life is a repetitive chore with the only refreshment being her dreams of something bigger and brighter, something we can only guess about from her gestures and the words of two people who understand her - a black co-worker and a older sexually confused painter with whom she shares a shabby but stylish apartment above a cinema.What comes next may be viewed as yet another take on the ""beauty and the beast"" story, this time told mostly without words and taking place inside a dark rusty bunker instead of a palace. But it's more than just love between a woman who feels out of place around her own kind and a creature taken from its natural habitat. It's a story about all the rejects of this world who don't know where they belong or, even if they do, hardly receive any acceptance in return. About those who dare to dream, to stay true to themselves and to do what they believe in, even if the risk is high and the consequences may be severe.In fact, this whole film feels like Guillermo del Toro's profession of love towards all those bizarre worlds filled with bizarre creatures that he's been creating for as long as we know him. The amphibian creature from The Shape of Water may not be directly connected to Abe Sapien from Hellboy, but it does feel like a homage to del Toro's roots, and to the gentle and sensitive side we rarely get to see in the monstrously looking things.This film is much more sentimental than you could expect from a movie with Michael Shannon playing a violent creep with two zombie fingers sewn to his hand. So sentimental that one could suspect del Toro was putting some personal reflections on his life into it. Yet, just like the creatures his imagination brought to life aren't a pleasant view for some, so is the subtle mix of erotic fantasies and yearning for a kind touch displayed through bodily movements and pantomime not a fail-proof key to everyone's hearts. I, for one, can easily admire the creative brilliance of the entourage and its aesthetics, but when it comes to letting the main characters inside your own head and seeing the world through their eyes, The Shape of Water is as effective and eloquent as talking to a fish. I guess the 60% of my body that is water is not in shape enough for this trick to fully work.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Shape of Water is simply an aqua flop. Have movie critics taken leave of their senses to rate this a success?,"Perhaps the most baffling moment from the recent Oscar awards was not so much The Shape of Water being the most-nominated film during the night, but actually winning the following 4 categories:Production DesignOriginal ScoreDirectorBest Picture""Stranger things have happened"" some say, but not that much stranger. I'm starting to think 'professional' film critics are taking leave of their senses lately, as they too also rave about this nonsensical, illogical and poorly conceived idea of a motion picture.Mute girl falls in love with a non-speaking, semi-aggressive aqua-man whom the American government from the 1960's are keen to study for the usual purpose of national dominance.With the exception of the rather unusual setting, there is really very little to like about it. Audiences will balk at the romance scenes between the two characters... and the only saving grace comes from Michael Shannon, who plays the government agent determined in finding out what they can from their captive.One is simply left wondering... when this film was presented to those who make them, did no one say, ""whoa.. slow down there a moment Tonto, this isn't a good idea."".... well, judging by the baffling Oscars wins clearly not.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful !,"Saw this at the cinema yesterday and loved it ! Definitely worth watching.Plot-wise, the film offers nothing new. It is basically a reworking/mash up of vintage creature features and the classic 'Beauty and the Beast' storyline. Socially awkward/withdrawn girl finds and falls in love with misunderstood beast, set in early 1960's Baltimore in a Cold War era top secret research/military facility.The real magic in this movie stems from both the lush cinematography and the flawless cast. The sets and feel of the movie are very true to the times. Del Toro relies heavily on green symbolism - one character stating that 'green is the colour of the future' - and the entire movie has a hint of green. The significance of the colour is interesting, and would love to find out more about that.The casting choices for this film are perfect. Sally Hawkins played the lead role to awkward perfection. Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Shannon were really natural choices as the shifty/conflicted scientist/spy and the dead-inside antagonist, respectively. My favourite acting duo in this film come in the form of Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins, whose comedic performances really made the film. It was also amazing how the movie touched upon their personal lives as segregated minority groups whilst focusing on them as such multidimensional characters.These days, it is rare to watch a film that really elicits the number of emotions (and some tears) that this movie has done.

a beautiful fable.,"I never know what to expect from the Guilhermo Del Toro films, he is a director who made the spectacular El Laberinto del Fauno which is one of the best fantasy films of the genre, but the rest of his filmography I've never been much of a fan of his films, Cronos is a good movie, The Devil's Backbone is cool, but I expected more, Blade and Hellboy I admit I have not watched yet, Pacific Rim disappointed me a lot, even though it's cool too and Crimson Peak is pretty weak and now comes The Shape of Water that is placed as one of the favorites to win the Oscar for best film, and look I think it will win (even with defeat in the golden globe), is one of the best films of 2017 without doubts, a touching and very beautiful film Guilhermo Del Toro does a great job with the characters in the film, but it is not a good idea to have a good ending. your best I work in directing, he does wonderful scenes and there are moments that would give an excellent picture to put on the wall, and in my view he deserves to win Oscar for best director, the film does not lose its rhythm, I do not like romance, but it was Impossible not to like the chemistry of the protagonist Elisa with the amphibious creature, the relationship of the 2 is very well built, the cast is excellent, Sally Hawkins made my favorite female performance of 2017 and I will hope her win the Oscar, she can transmit emotions Even without talking about the film, it's hard for you not to get infected with the character and cheer for her in the film, Michael Shannon is fine as always, you feel angry about your character, even if he has moments that he is a bit generic, but I liked the character in the film, Octavia Spencer is great, I really liked her character and how she is also built her relationship with Elisa, you see that it is a true friendship between the two, and even in difficult times help one another, Ric hard Jenkins is great too, is a character who also has a nice friendship with Elisa and he has a very important role in the film, Doug Jones the actor who always is with Guilhermo Del Toro, is an actor who deserves more recognition for his work, he is always characters that uses a lot of makeup, but he can handle very well always, the creature that is even very well made and looks great, not to mention the beauty of the creature, the rest of the cast is also very competent, the trail Alexandre Desplat's sound is impeccable, it's a smooth and great listening track, a great favorite in the Oscar of the best soundtrack and if you win it's going to be very well deserved, The Shape of Water is a masterpiece, a touching, romantic and very beautiful film , with excellent scenes, impeccable performances, an incredible direction from Del Toro and a very original and very well done script, is a great competitor to take Oscar for best film.

A true declaration of love for the cinema,"Guillermo del Toro is back at its highest level after Crimson Peak and Pacific Rim, two minor films compared to the legendary Pan's Labyrinth and, now, this magnificent Shape of Water. His taste for poetry and dark atmospheres is right back, as his ability to mix sensitivity of things to violence. There is a lot of humanity in the Shape of Water and a mischievous magic from which Pan's Labyrinth was stripped. From the first frames, we are drifted away by the strong current of this extraordinary love story, carried by great actors and actresses. Deprived of speech, Sally Hawkins is a receptacle of incredible emotions and turns a potentially rickety exercise into a beautiful silent symphony. Michael Shannon has the mouth of the job, odious and fiercely bad, engulfed in his American vision of success. In supporting roles, Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer ensure the touching and funny side of the set. And what about the creature, that distant cousin of that of the Black Lagoon of 1954? A creation in too artificial CGI is fortunately avoided to accommodate a little humanoid jewel perfectly integrated into the story and through which the emotion flows freely. An iconic representation of the acceptance of difference, sometimes martyr, sometimes lover, the keystone of this adult tale, the creature amuses and moves, without excess and with surprising accuracy. The subject, daring in its last faces, could have turned to shipwreck. But the talent and the energy of the whole crew, the care given to each image, to each movement of camera, to every word, avoids the ridicule, finds the right balance and propels the Shape of the Water towards summits of poetry. A true declaration of love with cinema, immersed in a great bath of nostalgia. A terrific film with well-deserved success.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A beautifully realized, transporting adult fairy tale offering vintage Hollywood magic","Guillermo del Toro already showed he could make a film like ""The Shape of Water"" before. His gift for turning historical fiction into fairy tales was abundantly clear in the stunning 2006 film ""Pan's Labyrinth"" - it's just a shame we had to wait so long for him to enchant us again.The delay was probably because Del Toro has many mistresses as a storyteller, namely horror, science fiction and fantasy, so the fact that he has such a big heart hidden beneath his inclinations toward surface-level genre pleasures always seems to come as a surprise. In ""The Shape of Water,"" he's able to scratch all those itches, but he and co-writer Vanessa Taylor craft a story rooted in classical romantic ideals of good, evil and love, pushing back against the complexities of most modern films to deliver something pure if not escapist.The story has dark turns and embraces violence, race and sexuality in a way you would never have seen if the film were made even 20 years ago, and that gives ""The Shape of Water"" an unexpected verve to accompany its many classic tropes and general romantic aura. In other words, the film presents and plays out in a way that's more traditional Hollywood than any of the other most-talked-about films of the year, but upon closer examination is actually quite progressive.Taking place in Baltimore during the Cold War, the film essentially tells the story of a group of social outcasts who try to save a mysterious human-like sea creature from being exploited and experimented on for the sake of America's pissing contest with Soviet Russia. It is Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a woman who is mute, who becomes taken with the creature (Doug Jones) at the facility where she is a janitor, because it makes her feel seen for more than her disability. So she recruits her black co-worker (Octavia Spencer) and closeted neighbor (Richard Jenkins) in her quest to free it from the clutches of the high-and-mighty Strickland (Michael Shannon).That's a little bit of the in-between-the-lines plot summary, but it shows the way the story blends traditional elements with contemporary consciousness. Each actor is perfectly cast in his or her part (many of the roles were written for the actors), with Hawkins and Jenkins the highlights. Hawkins doesn't even get to use her voice, but she channels so much through her hands and face. Jenkins is most of the comic relief, though certainly Spencer provides a major dose as we've come to expect of her based on ""The Help"" and ""Hidden Figures.""Some of the talents fill traditional Hollywood roles in a largely predictable story, but no knocks can be made against ""The Shape of Water"" in terms of artistry. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" won three Oscars 11 years ago in the categories of cinematography, production design and makeup and this film will earn similar honors. More than even the details, however, is the powerfully cohesive vision behind the entire film. Everything from the vibrant '60s shapes and colors of the production design and costumes, to del Toro's and D.P. Dan Laustsen's elegant camerawork and lighting to Alexandre Desplat's score create the magical world of the film and contribute to its transporting experience.The many subplots (especially those of Strickland and Michael Stuhlbarg's Dr. Hofstetler) and themes of ""The Shape of Water"" don't feel as interconnected or as convincing as they aught to be for a film operating so fluidly on so many levels, but it's a small knock against the screenplay in a film that is quite simply beautiful inside and out. In its simplicity, strong cast and many marvelous technical elements, del Toro offers audiences a variety of ways in which they can latch onto the romantic spirit of ""The Shape of Water"" and get lost in one of the year's few films yearning to bring a little bit of older movie magic back into theaters.~Steven CThanks for reading!

One word: Beautiful,"There's one word I'd use to describe The Shape of Water: Beautiful. It's beautiful in so many ways:The story and especially the love aspect of the story feels more genuine than anything I've seen in ages. The love between the characters develop and while it's of course unusual, it feels more real that way. All the characters in typical romantic movies are the same, but Elisa and the ""amphibious creature"" are different from those characters.Alexandre Desplat's score was also astonishing. It was light, simple and after the film ends it makes you feel like you're half dancing out of the theatre.And of course we can't talk about beauty of a film without talking about the visual side. The cinematography is stunning. The film is unbelievably colourful. I especially love the use of green and blue throughout the movie.

An atmospheric children's movie for adults,"Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) invites us into another of his atmospheric worlds of 20th century nostalgia and ominous mysteries in this romantic fable entitled The Shape of Water. We're effectively transported back to a Cold War-era world in which women are cleaners, homosexuals are shunned and secretive government agencies are conducting clandestine science projects. As representatives for these three groups respectively, the characters of Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins and Michael Shannon are entangled in a predictable but engaging plot centered around a humanoid-amphibian creature with abilities that del Toro appropriates from throughout film history. Compelling characters and glimpses of real creativity enhance a film which otherwise tends to becomes a little too naive and amiable. It's a children's movie for adults who are grown enough to watch gory images, but who still prefer a fairy-tale. There are brilliant performances all around, particularly from Hawkins and Jenkins, with honourable mentions to Michael Stuhlbarg and Octavia Spencer.

One of the weirdest movies that I've ever seen (but this is not a bad thing),"Ok, The Shape of Water definitely isn't a movie for the big public, it's incredibly weird (as almost every Del Toro movie), and unusual, but at the same time it can pass a beautiful and complex message about love.Before talking about the movie as a whole, I need to point some fantastic aspects of it. The acting is very good, Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer (as you may already know) shine in the movie, and their nominations are undoubtably deserved, but Michael Shannon also shows again that he is a freaking monster, he once again destroys in the role. I really think that he deserved at least a Oscar nomination here (probably more than Richard Jenkins, that is also very good, but not as good as Shannon).The cinematography and the photography is gorgeous, Del Toro shows us once again that he is one of the most unique directors working today, the guy has a style, and it shines here.Talking about that, Del Toro direction is freaking amazing too, everything is beautiful, the actors are shining, the guy will probably won the Oscar tonight, and it will be deserved.And, of course, the overall message of the movie, the prejudice, the feeling that some have, that they are alone in the world, how hard it is for some people to find love, and how painful it is for those who end up never finding. And is really fantastic how Del Toro is able to talk about such subjects with a movie about a big fish monster that makes love with a woman.Really, think about it, what were the odds of this end up been just a creepy and laughable movie? The concept sounds extremely cheesy but the final result is fantastic.All the visual effects also are fantastic, and the movie does not had a big budget, so, is another achievement here.Probably the only issue that I can have with the movie is that in some point it seems like it's going to end without a climax, but it kinda ""forces"" somethings to happen, in order to have a ""big finally confront"", you know, it doesn't make the movie less great, but was what prevented the movie to be a 10/10 to me. I think that they also could have given more time to the build of the relationship between the Fish and Elisa, overall you buy it, but it feels a little bit rushy.Well, in short, The Shape of Water is a great piece of work by Guillermo Del Toro, has a beautiful and powerful message, that is told in a unique and odd way. Another great movie from the 2018 Oscar's, right now I saw 7/9 from the Best Picture Nominees, and just one was under the 8/10 grade.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A pleasant cohesion of tones and styles that separately have always been on the fringes of Del Toro's films, and here coalesce exquisitely.","To compare it to a Wes Anderson Hellboy spin-off or a Bryan Fuller Bioshock would do it's myriad of other influences and its quality a disservice. The film is full of tremendously telling and expansive sets, sumptuous music and eye melting colours and idyllic bright sunlight. The script plays in shorthand both to tell it's little stories quickly and to sometimes turn them on their heads. Sally Hawkins is sublime, really genuinely committed and captivating and heartbreaking. The way the main characters use sex seems to illuminate the crass shorthand that other films use to show their sympathetic characters as lonely and their evil characters as sex-starved maniacs. In this film, their personalities and their pasts and their place in the world drive them. All the players in fact are as at the top of their game. The themes and allegory are all very current and although the ending is the weakest part, I'm still eternally grateful that this film exists at this place in time and this place in Del Toro's career; not as impersonal as Blade 2, not as ugly as Cronos, not as trial and error as Hellboy, richer than Pan's Labrynth, meatier than Crimson Peak; Besides Devil's Backbone, The Shape of Water probably represents the best Del Toro has to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"At the heart, human cruelty","At the heart of this film is human cruelty and the rarest quality :genuine human love and kindness. An outcast, a mute with only sign language and her social isolation takes a human interest in a mythological creature. Of course science has the creature locked, chained, and without caring, affectionate contact. Both the underwater myth and the mute are isolated through their differences and both express more humanity than the group, or normal crowd. I say normal because the fear that keeps the myth locked up is the fear that most people share when it comes to social contact with people who are different. The talk or language that goes across barriers is silence. The sign language is warmth, from the heart and reveals the human condition that is rare, authentic and quite disturbed. Why her?

Exploration into a myriad of prejudices and discrimination against anyone with differences,"The movie ranked highly for me in being well acted and artistically framed. The message was clear. The movie was set in a time we can safely think we have evolved away from, to more easily show the cruelties of prejudice and discrimination toward job rank and education, people with disabilities, women, people of color, homosexuals, people who believe differently (the Russian scientist) and non-humans. The crazed ""villian"" was motivated mostly by his ambition and his extreme limitations as a person, not because he was evil. It was surreal seeing him in his happy 50's or early 60's home environment, as if his family had no clue to who he was. I wished the movie included a truly fleshed out back story for the characters, especially the two lovers. All of the central characters gave us bits and pieces of their backstory, but not enough for me to really latch onto and feel engaged enough to care deeply about them. I think that would have helped me in this story. I do like how the artist friend speaks his assumptions about how it ended for the lovers, however I am not sure that was to be believed. I would not care to watch this movie again. Final opinion of the movie: A message movie which is artistic and sometimes beautiful, yet heavy handed at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Free Willy"" for adults this time.","""The natives in the Amazon worshipped it.
Like a god.
We need to take it apart, learn how it works.""I've watched this movie the night before the Oscar ceremony, because I could feel it in my bones this film would possibly win that coveted statuette. Initially, I didn't want to post my opinion about this winner. But as I had partially written down my opinion, I thought I would smooth off the rough edges and post it anyway. To be honest, I'm not part of the great crowd of admirers of ""The shape of water"". Even though I was looking forward to it with great expectations and knew it was a creation made by Guillermo del Toro (I appreciated his previous films) I was only moderately enthusiastic about it. In the end I stayed behind with a ""that's it ?"" feeling. Why the jurors of the academy massively fell in love with this film, still is a mystery to me. I didn't think it was so earth-shattering, breathtaking or groundbreaking.In retrospect, you could compare this film with ""Free Willy"". Only the amphibious creature that needs to be rescued rather looks like the monster of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"". And as in ""Free Willy"", where Jesse wanted to free his best friend, it's Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) who got the job of freeing the imprisoned creature. Only the friendship between Jesse and Willy wasn't as passionate and they didn't get caught while doing sensual stuff. Elisa and her scaly friend soon figured out how to get things going. Or rather, Elisa soon knew where her sweet sprat was hiding his stinger. So you can expect some wet scenes. And the facility where the government locked away the feared cretature (under military supervision) so they can experiment with it, was probably designed by an interior architect who's influenced by the interior style that you could admire in the Nautilus.""The shape of water"" is of course more than just a rescue mission that has been set up by a cleaning lady without sound. A cleaning lady whose compassion causes her to start smuggling hard boiled eggs inside and draw up a plan (bigger than that in ""The Great Escape"") to save the poor merman. ""The shape of water"" is also more than just a romantic concoction in which a scrumptious cleaning lady throws herself into the fins of a wondrous creature and loses herself completely after looking deep into those bulging fish eyes. Guillermo Del Torro denounces indifference and prejudice and makes it the central theme. A theme that also applies in our contemporary society. Being different as an individual and the excluding and exploiting by those who see themselves as normal, is symbolized here in many ways. A cleaning lady who is voiceless. And her colleague (Octavia Spencer) who has a different skin color. A somewhat older, homosexual neighbor (Richard Jenkins) whose flirtation was not appreciated by the owner of an ice-cream shop. And last but not least the miraculous seahorse. First a riddle and afterwards a threat.Just like in ""Crimson Peak"", again Del Torro delivers a visually overwhelming spectacle. The used images are at times magical and atmospheric. Elisa's residence and the colorful advertising posters made by the neighbor. The cinema complex and the ice cream bar that exhale the atmosphere of the 1960s. The military complex that looks sterile and metallic, full of obscure secrets and where less attractive experiments are carried out. It all looks perfect and breathtaking. And such quality needs of course high quality acting. This sublime acting is taken care of by renowned actors. Sally Hawkins is as enchanting as her salted new friend. And even though there is no sound coming out of her mouth, she knows how to grasp you by using her highly expressive facial expressions. Michael Shannon was also briliant as the dominant and cruel government agent who (with apparent pleasure) tests his taser on our fishy guy. He's a pervert whose sexual urges go into overdrive when the partner stays silent during the act. No wonder his hormones go haywire after seeing (and not hearing) Elisa. Finally, kudos for Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer.Without a doubt, Guillermo del Toro is a master in visualizing and a kind of visionary. He creates a unique atmosphere in his films that you hardly be able to take it all in. I'm never really overwhelmed by the content of his films though. Perhaps the message is sophisticated enough. But every time I have that feeling it's incomplete somehow. I suppose that the simmering topic in this film is in line with the values that were spread out this year during the awards. The equality of genders. Not tolerating cross-border behavior. And the fact that the Academy Awards are a more white-tinted business. I guess it's all about striking the right chords.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Shape of Love,"""The Shape of Water"" is beautiful. Writer and Director Guillermo del Toro tells the story of the shape of love, that it can look any way you can imagine. His screenplay along with co-writer Vanessa Taylor tells the poignant tale of feeling alone in the world, and the possibility of love that we all deserve. Sally Hawkins is amazing as lonely mute Elisa discovers her greatness within, her voice. Hawkins is so moving in her visage and silence. ""The Shape of Water"" is the strange love story of Elisa and the noble amphibious-man Creature.Discovering that the Creature's life is threatened, Elisa implores her dear friend Giles, played by compassionate Richard Jenkins, to help save him. Through sign language Elisa says, ""When he looks at me, he does not know how I am incomplete. He sees me as I am."" That breaks your heart. Elisa just wants to be loved. She just wishes to be gotten. We all do. ""The Shape of Water"" eloquently expresses humanity. Awesome Doug Jones literally inhabits the Creature through CGI effects and all. His languid movement and gentle expressions illuminate the noble Creature's generous heart of the one, who loves Elisa back.Dan Lausten's cinematography mesmerizes. Elisa is the janitor along with her friend Zelda, played by strong Octavia Spencer, on the midnight shift at the secret Government facility in Washington D.C. set in the 1960's during the height of the Cold War. The story set mostly at night has brilliant tones of gray and muted lighting in the midst of this touching love story fable. Del Toro gracefully balances the dichotomy of the narratives. Lausten and del Toro create the astounding images of Jones's shimmering regal blue Creature, nearly human enough for us to cheer on.Amazingly del Toro's world of ""The Shape of Water"" is mostly light or dark, little gray. The light is Elisa and Giles. Narrator Giles opens the tale of ""the princess without voice"". Jenkins's Giles is the old unemployed commercial artist, who suffers over his sexual identity.Brilliant Michael Shannon as Government Agent Strickland is the dark. Strickland captured the legendary Creature from the Amazon bringing him back to DC to uncover his secrets. He mercilessly tortures the Creature. In the meantime the Russians are also interested in the mysterious ""asset"" and pursue him as well. Strickland represents the one downside of del Toro's narrative. As embodied by Shannon, Strickland is clever, cruel, vicious and insufferably pious. He is also bigoted. He has no nuance. Greater villains are much grayer. Though gray comes in the form of wise Michael Stuhlberg as Dr. Hoffstetler, the dedicated scientist who seems stand for the Creature.We first see Hawkins's Elisa awake to begin her janitor night shift. She sets the timer to boil her eggs while she routinely pleasures herself in the bath. Elisa bares telltale scars on her neck. She packs two bagged lunches, one for her apartment neighbor friend Giles (Jenkins). She smiles and takes her bus to work.Hawkins is understated power in how she expresses Elisa's profound loneliness and hopefulness without saying. Much of the beauty of ""The Shape of Water"" is in the unsaid. Being with the Creature though unlikely as it seems, we get that it is Elisa's ""perchance to dream"". Hawkins harnesses Elisa's authentic desperation, and her great heart touches us with the lighter side of our humanity.""The Shape of Water"" is the fantastical love story fable. The great fables allow us to enter that world of wonder. ""The Shape of Water"" is the possibility of love no matter what it looks like. That is the world worth visiting, and perhaps living in as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yeah it's Ok.,"So, I see more and more a lot of people dismiss this film because of its politics, pacing, or the fish sex. I think that all these really come from people expecting everything to be explained and believable and no ""dream logic"" allowed. Which is a problem of another sort, but just in case you were confused by some of the more vitriolic comments, that's where that's from.The movie itself is...ok. It's not great, it's not terrible. If you're wondering how the film won best picture, it's because of an arbitrary point system the academy has that every year since it's installment has resulted in mediocre movies winning best picture.My biggest problem with the movie is that everything feels on autopilot. The story is autopilot (it's any number of fairy tales), the characters are autopilot (meek woman, doe eyed monster, crazy scientist), and all the actors are on autopilot.Octavia Spencer is playing the same character she always plays, Michael Shannon is playing the same character he always plays, Richard Jenkins is playing the same character he always plays, even Doug Jones is the one underneath all the makeup.The only one who seems to escape this is Sally Hawkins who is legitimately great, but that's nothing new.There's nothing standout or special about the movie, it's pretty standard.

A magical movie,"THE SHAPE OF WATER is the most romantic, beautiful, charming, weird and wonderful love story that I have seen in a long, long time.The fact that the love story is between a mute woman and the Creature from the Black Lagoon makes it just that much more interesting.From the fertile mind of Guillermo Del Toro (THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, PAN'S LABYRINTH), TSOW answers a question that a young Del Toro had when he first saw the 1950's creature feature CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. He thought, ""what if the creature ended up with the girl?"" In Del Toro's mind, the Creature was the leading man, not the generic hunk that was hunting him.Wonderfully realized by Del Toro, TSOW tells the tale of mute cleaning woman, Eliza (Sally Hawkins) who works at a ""secret Government agency"" in Baltimore. When she is asked to mop blood up in a highly classified area, she soon realizes that a ""creature"" is being held there. It is her realization that this creature is not just ""some creature"", but an intelligent being that starts this lonely, mute woman and the ""creature"" on the road to a loving relationship.Hawkins is mesmerizing as Eliza. Obviously, with her character being mute, she must express herself in other ways - and she does. Her eyes are truly the window to her soul and Hawkins' ability to ""eye act"" is astounding, she conveys more feeling with a look and a glance than most actors can with a mountain of work.She is strongly aided by some really good co-stars - Richard Jenkins is marvelous (as always) as Eliza's neighbor/friend who, himself, has a handicap - he is a gay man in the 1950's. The strength of Jenkins' performance is that he is able to overcome the trap of ""the sympathetic gay best friend"" and bring to the screen a complete character. Michael Stuhlbarg is watchable (as always) as the main scientist that studies the creature. Here is an actor that has grown in my eyes and he is a ""must watch"" in anything he is in. Michael Shannon is a presence as the main ""heavy"" in this film and though his character is pretty one-note, Shannon hits that note strongly and holds our attention. Unfortunately, compared to these 3 (and Hawkins' lead role), Octavia Spencer's talents are not put to the test as Eliza's co-worker. She is capable of so much more and her character is severely underwritten.But, while strong characters are a must in a successful film, it is Del Toro's direction and ""sense of place"" that embue this fable with the character and detail it needs. Set in a 1950's that is a bit more idealistic/stylized than is real, Del Toro steers us through a world that is fascinating to watch - and be in - and makes it seem almost plausible that such a creature could exist and that a woman could fall in love with him.Much like how I fell in love with this film.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Rating: A-,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Guillermo del Toro proves that his visuals are as impeccable as ever. Such a beautifully directed film, with so much vivid colors and wonderful production design. The editing is flawless, the score is magical and the cinematography is incredibly gorgeous.Sally Hawkins (Elisa Esposito) has a phenomenal performance. She is able to transmit her feelings in such a classy way and without saying a single word throughout the entire movie. Oscar-worthy display as well as the rest of the fantastic cast. Michael Shannon (Strickland) and Octavia Spencer (Zelda) are great, but Richard Jenkins (Giles) is right up there with Sally. An all-star cast delivers perfect performances that carry a meaningful, romantic and unique story.Unfortunately, not everything is perfect. The tone and the pacing are a bit unbalanced, but my main issue is the cheesy and predictable third act. Even though the story alone justifies watching this film, some people might find creepy the relationship between Elisa and the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones).Still, it is a brilliant screenplay with a lot of important messages and del Toro does an outstanding job directing The Shape of Water, which will surely get him a win at the 90th Academy Awards.

"Green, but not so good","The Shape of Water is one of the greenest movies I have ever seen, and it is aware of this. The color choice is visually stimulating for a while, but quickly falls from stylistic to redundant.The film, is overall quite good, well written, well shot, but it lacks a genuine feel of a singular vision, and instead feels like the best outcome of assembly line film making. Even though that is generally an insult, this is still the best example of that process. The shots are decently composed, the script is decent, and the set design is detailed but glaringly unbelievable.
In line with the stagnant color palette, most of the characters fail to develop beyond their initial portrayal, but at least they are maintain some believably. Minimal character development aside, the rest of the writing is fair. It regularly leaves logic behind in service of the plot, but never enters the realm of unbelievable. Most of the movie can be described as: ""not as bad as it could be, but still not great.""The movie is easy to access for a more general audience, but does little to reward repeated viewings, or in depth analysis. Simple characters unfortunately rob this movie of much of its potential story value. As the best case scenario for assembly line film making, these underdeveloped characters are at least developed enough to not become completely boring: just don't expect something great.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beating the flow.,"The possibility of rejection from a significant other, or perhaps the fear of losing them creates a distrustful and a devoid of love atmosphere. The very ideals of us not being fitful in someone's life could haunt us more than what we expected to. The Shape of water is a 120-minute poem to the transformative form of love and a masterpiece of compassion adding the fantasy element to spilling proportions. A clear blend and synthesis of influences layered over the morals of how kindness evolves love even from extreme prejudices. The established world inside the screen emanates an idiot box ambiance which catches us off guard and encourages us to throw caution and all senses of notion out of the window.Elisa (Sally Hawkins), is a mute cleaner in a covert government agency cooped up with Zelda (Octavia Spencer), a chatty co-worker with marital issues. Enter; the man-amphibian (Doug Jones) often called ""The Asset"", is a creäture with amazing capabilities pulled out from the Amazon where it was worshiped as a God by their natives. I'll leave the abilities to amaze the viewers without further spoilers. The asset forms the main crux of the story; unlike other mindless creatures, this one is capable of perceiving human emotions. Elisa's naked innocence and kindness lead her heart to make a somersault of emotions towards the creäture fading the rest of the world behind her. The head of security of the facility, Strickland (Michael Shannon) a ruthless agent determined to terminate the Asset for study purposes is introduced as the monster who tries to pull both of the lovers away with a Zod-esque performance. Such circumstances led Elisa, her close-to-the-heart neighbor, a closeted homosexual and struggling painter, Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda to orchestrate an amateur but surprisingly slick heist operation to extract the creäture from the facility. The events that follow after the heist dispatch a frenzy of unaccounted accidents and longing love from the characters.With a clear World War backdrop, the tension between the USA and the USSR fumes in every laboratory and strategic scene. With creature-human love themes, it certainly evokes memories from King Kong and Beauty and the Beast. However, it rises from the generic stereotype and varnishes its own color into the frame painting a picture with such vibrant colors that will make you wonder about the contents of the palette. With a tinge of B-grade romance backdrops, it does make you wonder its sanity and agenda midway aiming to make you swoon at every possible chance. The motivations and purposes of each character were beautifully folded from the deck it was presented artistically adding several layers to the otherwise simple story. A visage of masks and false fronts added by racial slurs with a pinch of religious devotion were the streaks adding to the structure of a farfetched story for the non-believers or the naysayers who proved incapable of opening their hearts to a queer romance. Clearly, this movie had no target audience, it either made you exalt at the belief of love through kindness principle or made it further absurd for the believers. After all, its beauty was an ambiguity left to the viewer to shape which varied alternately and perhaps drastically with shapes that were aesthetic for some while unpleasant for some.The trending shared universes remind me of the recently launched Universal Studio's ""Dark Universe"" shortly canceled after the bombing of ""The Mummy"" (2017). Director Guillermo Del Toro utilizes his most used theme of monsters, outcasts, and freaks, takes a relatively generic relationship and twists it and adds his own brand. The Shape of Water is the realism of how gods and monsters fit into our mainstream world, where the supernatural elements are downplayed for good. Something that the ""Dark Universe"" tried to forcefully stuff down our throats was the possibility of mythology existing in our daily lives with an approach so absurd that made it forgettable. An extravagant thematic element like this is far more welcome when it flows through the minds and hearts rather than stomp right in our faces. The break-up of studio agreements and creative visions clearly made the difference it was supposed to make for Del Toro. With a queer cake blend of monsters, love, acceptance, and devotion, The Shape of Water can be deemed as a coming of age story. It is a fairy tale for grownups that delves into deep waters, the once taboo interspecies ardor breaking your heart and haunting your dreams.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"An engaging, if predictable, ""fantasy for adults""","While we know that some monsters are decidedly not lovable, the creature in Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, like many humans who roam the planet, is more of a lonely outcast seeking connection than a life-threatening presence. Performed by Doug Jones (""The Danger Element"") underneath all the prosthetics, this monster is an amphibian humanoid known as the Asset, captured by scientists from the Amazon (the one in South America) to help with the U.S. space program. Amphibian man (as he is listed in the credits) resembles a cross between King Kong and E.T., though definitely not as cuddly as the latter but a much better dancer.The Asset is also an unabashed romantic who loves hard-boiled eggs, which is even strange for a human and enjoys Benny Goodman which is not as strange but, as del Toro says, ""What is ridiculous can also be sublime."" Sublime or not, The Shape of Water is an engaging if predictable ""fantasy for adults"" as del Toro characterizes it. The film explores the connection between the amphibious man and Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins, ""Maudie""), a mute janitor who works the night shift in the Occam Aerospace Research Center. Elisa lives by herself in Baltimore in an apartment above an old-fashioned movie palace that plays biblical epics in Cinemascope to a few remaining diehards.Set in the early 1960s during the Cold War, stereotyped forever as an age of social conformity, the film seems to be a warning to those who look back on the golden days with starry eyes by showing us how a part of our history has been marked by racism, homophobia, and xenophobia. In the opening scene, Elisa is asleep in a room filled with water as the narrator, whom we later find out is her neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), describes her as a princess in a fairy tale and Alexandre Desplat's score persuades us that the world is filled with childlike wonder, but it is a hard sell. As Elisa awakens from her dream, she goes about her routine - making hard-boiled eggs, taking a bath, making sandwiches and watching TV with Giles who is a gay commercial artist and has just lost his job for reasons unspecified, but we can guess.Though unable to speak, Elisa communicates at work with Zelda (Octavia Spencer, ""Gifted""), a supportive friend and co-worker who knows sign language. Elisa's routine undergoes a radical shuffling when the Asset arrives in a pressurized water tank. Controlled by arch-villain Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon, ""Nocturnal Animals"") who carries a cattle prod and who we quickly realize is the real monster in the film. Strickland plans to send the Asset into outer space where, if he wasn't lonesome before, he will now really know what lonesome is. The self-righteous and bullying Strickland is responsible for protecting fish-man from the Russians who he fears may snatch him to either kill him or use him to gain an advantage for their space program.
 
Tentative at first, Elisa senses that she has something going with the Asset and teaches him sign language which proves he has a good head on his shoulders as well as other functioning body parts. She then introduces him to the hard-boiled egg which he devours and soothes him with the music of Benny Goodman as they do a perfect imitation of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. Underneath her outward persona, Elisa has a big heart and big ideas. Once she learns that Strickland wants to cut her new friend open to better understand how he breathes, she makes plans to capture the sexy creature and put him in her bathtub until he can be released into the ocean at high tide.Aiding her in her scheme are the Russian mole, Dr. Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg, ""Call Me by Your Name""), Giles, unfortunately stereotyped as being weak and fearful, and Elisa's dependable friend Zelda who joins the group as a late arrival. The heist itself is genuinely exciting and the strongest part of the film with much of the pleasure seeing the expressions on Strickland's face. From the capture, there is the chase, and then the romance which is unorthodox to say the least, all taking place as the sadistic Strickland displays fewer and fewer redeeming qualities.The Shape of Water has some lovely moments and unique special effects, and the inclusion of pop songs from the 1940s such as ""Hello, Frisco, Hello's"" ""You'll Never Know,"" and Glenn Miller's rendition of ""I Know Why (and so do you),"" from the film ""Sun Valley Serenade"" help to capture the aura of nostalgia. Unfortunately, however, the film's potential is thwarted by one-dimensional characters who hammer us constantly with a message that we have already figured out. While The Shape of Water shouts ""magic and wonder,"" it ultimately falls short of conveying it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It really made me feel uncomfortable,"The movie is well made, cinematography, actors, cameras, special effects, sound, editing, everything is wonderful. Except there's a creature here that is not human, and a woman who falls in love with it, has sex with it (or at least kind of tries, since it is not human it's hard to tell). There's a point where the movie turns really weird and uncomfortable.
I've been thinking, there are a lot of movies with non-human characters who fall in love with humans and it's not remotely weird, in fact, it's nice and romantic. Take Guardians of the Galaxy with starlord and gamorra, or Avatar... but they are all human-like. The thing with this movie is that the creature is very animal-like. It reminds you of a dog. It feels, it learns, it tilts its head when curious, you see it suffering and you feel bad, it hunts and eats a house cat because it's a wild animal. So seeing the woman dancing naked with it gets extremely weird. You loose the point of it all. Is it a movie against bullying? Against racism? Against animal abuse? About love? About feminism? About strange relationships? The only thing I liked and I thought was very well achieved was the bad guy. The actor does a great job at getting you to hate him. The rest of the movie was a big WTF. I really don't understand why they gave it an Oscar.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Shape Of Water Review,"The Shape of Water is a film co-written and directed by Guillermo del Tero. I heard of this film for quite some time and was pretty sure that it was going to be good by looking at the trailers. Finally after seeing the film I can say that I was impressed.Plot: Elisa, a mute janitor, at a research facility forms a bond with an alien like asset bought on for research at the facility.Story and direction: Having not seen much of del Tero's work, I didn't know what to expect. But I knew that it will be something to look out for. The story has not much to it. But the way it was said was very impressive. Much credit goes to del Tero for giving us a great visual experience. The characters also are to look out for. Each are different and contrasting from each other. But you feel for each of the characters, which anyone wants out of any film. The production quality and make up for the characters (especially the asset) is top notch. I don't know how much of VFX was used for the film, but if used it was excellent. The costumes and cinematography made it look like the ear of Cold War. Hats off to del Tero for putting up a fabulous crew with a shoestring budget. But the film still has issues. Apart from the film being quite known, some scenes felt a bit cliched. I could guess as to what would happen next. Also the score from Alexandre Desplat was not that interesting. Yes, the old songs used were good to hear but apart from that nothing in the score was a stand-out.Performances: This film is filled with great performances. Starting with Sally Hawkins. I was mesmerized with her performance. She nailed her character so perfectly. Richard Jenkins was also to look out for. Octavia Spencer also did a fabulous job. Many didn't mention but I did like the performances of Michael Shannon and Michael Stuhlbarg. And finally, Doug Jones was quite good as the Alien.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Eliza shows the Asset how to eat the egg. This scene felt very crucial to the bond formed between these two characters. The honesty and earnest-ness is what captivated me towards the scene.Verdict: This film was great and a visual masterpiece. The film is a great example that a big budget is not needed for anyone to make a great film.I am going with an 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An extraordinary and amazing film,"Shape of Water is probably the most ""out of order"" Film I have seen in a long time- not in a negative way.The movie is set in an unbelievably beautiful setting that aims at recreating the 1960s, and it worked- watching ""Shape of Water"" feels like traveling into another time and world, since it has fantasy elements.
The music was conducted by Alexandre Desplat, a great composer, and he did it again: he created a awesomely fitting score, that has its themes and little nuances, and fits the movie very well.
The story itself could be considered as a classic love story but I don't want to go into any detail.
Sally Hawkings, being the protagonist of ""Shape of Water"", did a perfect job that definitely is worth an Academy Award. The rest of the cast, e.g. Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins or Michael Shannon, complement the set of amazing and on-spot acting performances.This is an amazing movie which can enchant you but also leave you behind unimpressed/untouched.
Be aware, this is a special kind of movie- and most of all, a special love story. 
It sometimes has harsh dialogues and comes along with a little violence and brutality , so you better be prepared for this.Nevertheless, this film, by Gulliermo del Toro, is a great movie which I enjoyed a lot, but personally I can not call it ""perfect""- but that's up to everyone.

It's fantasy, nostalgia and suspense told as an adult fairytale.
Superb performance by one of my favourite actresses Sally Hawkins , did you see her in Maudie now that's the movie I think she should have won an Academy award for but she's one of the favourites this year and roles where actors play handicapped characters that are deaf, mute, or blind usually win Academy awards.
A great supporting cast including Octavia Spencer but i'll single out Michael Shannon as the most evil villain since The Queen in Snow White and Richard Jenkins ,nominated as best supporting actor well deservedly for his role of Giles the ""Good Queen ""in this Adult Fairytale.

"Once upon a time, in the mythical days of prince JFK","This is a brilliant movie, a clever fable positioned by Guillermo del Toro in the early 60s, when a fair prince rulled the country, and every thing seemed simpler and more straight forward. And this is precisely what the fable telling us - it never was simple and straight forward. The biggest patriot could be a monster in disguise, the traitor could hide a kind soul inside and a mute, may speak out the clearest of all when calling us all to be more human.I'll be repeating everyone else saying how beautiful it is. The set design, the CGI, the editing, the cinemtography. Every minute detail combines to create a fairytale setting in early 60s Baltimore, and it's so perfectly done that one feels that both parts of the reality presented in the movie are indeed real. The acting is part of the truthful feel of the film Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, Octavia Spencer and everybody else in this magnificient cast, Topped by Sally Hawkins, who deserves an Oscar, which I fear she won't get, because some consider her being a mute in the film a less complete performance. In my book it's a perfect 10. I haven't seen such level of perfection in acting since Hugh Jackman in Logan, and he never got nominated.I have my reasons for ranking this masterpiece just 9 (should've been a 9.5+) but I don't think these are important.

Guillermo Del Toro's fantasy tale of an unconventional romance absolutely soars.,"Its gone on record that director Guillermo Del Toro himself has said that The Shape of Water is the only film he is entirely 100% happy with. After viewing it twice now, I must admit that I also basked in his happiness by not wasting any time in making up my mind that this is the man's most majestic masterpiece to date. Eclipsing the then unconditional love I had for both The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, this is a film that is utterly stunning, gorgeous and damn beautiful in its visuals, aesthetics and its now, BAFTA winning production design.As much as it is another dark fantasy; examining the themes of love, loss, communication and language, Del Toro's magnum opus can also be regarded as a real compassionate love letter to the golden age cinema era of musicals and romantic comedies featuring the likes of Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, in a time period at the movies where absolutely everything had a happy ending. This is just one aspect of the movie that really helps steer you into completely believing in this unconventional central love story at its heart. Honestly, it's been a good long while since I've seen something on this scale that radiates of such sheer and captivating human beauty. This is further aided by Sally Hawkins' amazing Oscar and BAFTA nominated performance that instead of words, is able to convey so much through body language and human emotive feelings as a way of communicating with others and making sense of the world she lives in. She makes efficacious effort as an actress in the role of Elisa in potently using many of her different facial expressions whenever she is curious, happy, excited or angry as a simple yet very effective translation to audiences.In terms of bringing this bizarre love story magically to life, renowned composer Alexandre Desplat, who I've been a long-time fan of, conducts a really hypnotising and wonderful score here that really sets and nails the romantic fantasy tone of the film. At times, hearing the score made me feel like this film transported me to the romantic city of Paris instead of being set in America. A truly mesmerising score that lends itself as an extra added character. Other accomplished cast members such as Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins and Michael Stuhlbarg all give excellent supportive performances to Hawkins' leading role but it's Michael Shannon as the main villain and real monster of the piece, who is truly on the same amazing par as Hawkins in terms of the highly impressive acting.I've seen Shannon play a few villainous roles in the past but never have I seen him play one as ruthless, detestable and sadistic as he does here in the role of Richard Strickland; a government official responsible for bringing in the creature into the lab in the first place, as he takes an immediate dislike to this Amphibian like God, torturing and bullying it with every chance he can get. As a character, Strickland is someone who is very controlled and loves being able to live by his own rules and regulations. It's only when things don't go his way and he can't get the answers he wants, that all Hell breaks loose and things start getting ugly. Shannon was the perfect actor to play this evil antagonist role and I can't think of anyone else right now who would have pulled it off just as well as he did.The best moments in the film are the scenes where Elisa and the creature are alone together. You really believe that they were destined to be together forever, the more they begin to understand one another. As their relationship grows the more times they're able to meet in secret, we begin to realise that the creature is a lot more intelligent than when we first see him appear. He too also responds well to sign language and communication, and particularly music. It soon becomes clear that both these characters are prisoners in a society that are too afraid to understand their motives and as a spectator, I wanted nothing more than to see these two break away free and live happily ever after.Not sure if my words did complete justice to what a stunning masterpiece The Shape of Water really is but I'm hoping it's convinced at least a few of you to see it on the big screen. There is literally nothing about this film that I didn't like. An entirely flawless and incredible piece of cinema. I'm thrilled that Guillermo Del Toro won the BAFTA award for Best Director as he totally, totally deserved it. I seriously urge you to see this wonderful and uplifting abstract movie if you still haven't yet. I'm already tempted to see it all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Unfortunately you can tell it's trying very hard to win Oscars,"The Oscars are a funny old bird. Unfortunately after the #Oscarssowhite controversy a couple of years back they have lost a lot of credibility. They came out and made a promise to diversify the nominees/winners of the show in the future. What did that do? It meant that when a film like 'Moonlight' won Best Picture the next year people were left to question whether that was based on the merits of the film, or simply the fact that they needed the winning film to be based around black people. Now obviously people are questioning the same things over Guillermo del Toro and his film 'The Shape of Water'. Is it actually deserving or are the Academy simply trying to include the Latinos in the mix this time around? These are never questions that should be asked, but unfortunately they forever will be now. So is 'The Shape of Water' the real deal, or overrated nonsense? It's somewhere in the middle.The first thing that has to be said is that this is a film that is trying very hard to win Oscars. That comes across very clearly multiple times. We all know that the Academy love a film about film, so of course part of the film is set above a movie theatre and there is completely unnecessary scene set in it. That's a part of the film I didn't like. What I did like about the film was its intelligence. When you look back afterwards and examine certain plot points and clues this is actually a very smart and well thought out film. Without getting into spoilers this is a tough thing to explore, but needless to say there is some very interesting reading up on people's theories you can do after you've seen the film.'The Shape of Water' is in a two horse race to win Best Picture tomorrow with 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri' (as I see it at least). Personally I think the latter is a far superior film and deserves the win. At then end of the day 'The Shape of Water' is a love story and I just didn't feel what I usually feel when I see the best love stories put to screen. Not a bad film, due to its intellect, but it's nothing earth shattering either.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Shape of Water by Guillermo del Toro,"I've never seen a movie directed or written by Guillermo del Toro, and my first experience with his work was a mixed one. The Shape of Water is an undoubtedly creative work, and features many unique aspects rarely seen or fleshed out in others of this caliber. While this is true, it only manages to shine a strong torch in some categories and not others. Where The Shape of Water succeeds in design, acting and soundtrack, it falls short in plot, pacing and ham-fisted themes. Without a doubt, it holds itself as a spectacle, but internally the movie struggles to keep itself together on all fronts.The first and most important concept I want to touch on is how a film is designed to be ingested, on a scale of seriousness. There are films that are very clearly designed to be taken in a serious tone, like Blade Runner 2049. These films immediately establish themselves with serious themes and concepts and consistently expect themselves to be treated as such throughout. Then there are films like Death of Stalin. These films establish a comedic and lighthearted tone within the first 15 minutes at the most, and generally maintain it throughout and apply the tone to even the darker elements of the story. A consistent level of seriousness is, in my opinion, key for a great movie.This is where The Shape of Water really led me astray. The film quite often jumps between comedic and grave undertones and rarely seeks to create a harmony between them. It was only by the end of the film that I finally concluded that the film was best experienced when it wasn't taken seriously. While this didn't seriously improve or detract from certain scenes in the film, it certainly made a difference on my overall enjoyment. The movie has a short and creative musical number, roughly two thirds into the film. This was the first time I realized that this film is far more lighthearted than dramatic, yet throughout the film it still presses rather grave themes.On a more positive note, the overall design in The Shape of Water was amazing. With a purported budget of 20 million, it really seems to stretch every dollar. Environments and (very obviously) characters are given great care and attention throughout the whole film, and the cinematography never falls short. The actual creature itself, which I don't think is named, is superbly created. A great combination of majority practical effects and some CGI blend perfectly into a seamless and believable supernatural being. The locations were well picked and the color palette of the film remains consistent without. I have not a bad word for the visual makeup of this film.What I feel very mixed on is the overall pacing of The Shape of Water. Firstly, I would like to praise the films use of its run-time. The film perfectly understands it's own genre, and doesn't waste time building suspense for the reveal of the amphibian beyond the first 20 minutes of the film. Throughout the film, there is little deviation from the topic, but yet the pacing still troubled me. Without spoiling story content, I felt that at times it moved too fast and at others took it's time far longer than necessary. I also felt that there were scenes, especially one sex scene (not the infamous one) that were seemingly unnecessary. Overall I believe the film would have benefited from a less expansive story, one that left international politics and irrelevant intrigue alone in favor of something more procedural and slower paced. Which leads me to the story.The story of The Shape of Water is largely baseless. I found it entertaining, and the plot never stalled, but there were just too many significant plot points and strange character choices that betrayed the overall narrative. Themes were largely left half done/explored beyond the one central one, and what could have been seriously fascinating minor and major characters were left at the mercy of lazy plot advancement. Some elements simply would have benefited the film if they were removed entirely. There is little more I can touch on without story spoilers.The Shape of Water's acting is one of it's stronger suits, however. Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones both deliver a great performance but it was Michael Shannon, one of my favorite actors, who manages to put on the best of all despite being held back by poor characterization. None of the supporting cast pulls down the movie, and there were yet still many stand outs. I personally really enjoyed all the scenes Octavia Spencer was in as well.In summary, my enjoyment of this film very much traveled up and down throughout it's duration, but raised itself significantly once I properly figured out the tone it was awkwardly trying to set. The good and bad of this film actually remarkably balances itself out and still keeps it as a very enjoyable experience overall, but nothing I would write home about. Outstanding design and acting kept me going, but couldn't recover the damage made by critical plot and pacing flaws. I'd be content giving it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Del Toro's Best English-Language Film To Date,"""Water is like love, it has no shape. It takes the shape of whatever it inhabits. It's the most powerful element in the universe. It's gentle, flexible, but breaks through every barrier.""-Guillermo del ToroDespite del Toro's love for comics, gothic visuals, giant mechs, and practical monster effects; the famous Spanish director has always been a bit of a romantic at heart as demonstrated by the above quote.From his more artsy Spanish films (Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth) to the more mainstream efforts (Hellboy and Pacific Rim), there is a touching reoccurring theme concerning the idea of societal outsiders and marginalized individuals finding solace within each other's company.With his fascination with fairy tales, it seemed only a matter of time before del Toro took a stab at creating a straight-out romance tale, which comes in the form of his latest feature that gives a great twist to the ""Beauty and the Beast"" concept.What makes TSOW probably one of del Toro's best films since The Devil's Backbone is that taken on a pure conceptual level, the inter-species romance angle could have easily been awkward and almost kitschy if done by lesser hands. But del Toro's mathematical but delicate storytelling, impressive set designs, and the incredibly layered performances from the silent Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones, despite wearing a thick rubber monster costume, turns TSOW into one of the most touching and honest romance tales in quite a while.The performances in general are incredible across the board, arguably the best when it comes to del Toro's English-language movie canon. Hawkins is obviously magnetic in the lead but Michael Shannon as the openly racist research team leader Richard Strickland easily joins the canon of Jacinto (The Devil's Backbone) and Captain Vidal (Pan's Labyrinth) in del Toro's brand of genuinely terrifying but tragic human villains.But the person that I feel really stole the show was Richard Jenkins, playing Elisa's down-on-his-luck friend/neighbor and closeted commercial artist Giles. Giles by far feels like the most down-to-earth character in this fantastical tale and you really do feel sorry for his plight in life. For most of the movie Giles and Elisa's coworker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) have to verbalize the mute Elisa's sign language; giving way to some unique interactions. Giles also provides some great subtle moments of comic relief.Praise should also be level at the spell-binding score by Alexandre Desplat (The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game, Argo), giving a film with admittedly strange subject manner a timeless classy atmosphere that further contributes to the fairy tale quality. The accordion and whistle-heavy music that plays over the film's mesmerizing opening underwater dream sequence was the first sign that I was watching something truly special.The movie on the whole has a magical Old Hollywood feel to the whole thing, which is something different compared to del Toro's previous efforts. It's not the type of Old Hollywood tribute that feels pandering either (Ex. La La Land), it all feels born out of genuine affection and is completely at the service of painting the film's intoxicating atmosphere.TSOW on the whole is a pretty unconventional movie that is hard to pigeonhole into a single genre.It's part ""Beauty Meets Beast"" romance, part creature-feature, part period piece, part fairy tale, part science fiction and part spy thriller. There is also the fact that this is an R-rated del Toro flick and while it's not nearly as violent as Pan's Labyrinth, there are a few scenes that will make you wince or shiver in uncomfortableness.Even with the trailers it's obvious the distributor's Fox Searchlight Pictures could not crack the egg on how to market the movie. Hopefully it will continue to get more attention due to it's appearance on many critic's ""best of"" lists and with award season underway; but regardless del Toro's latest masterwork is one of the 2017's best.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A beautiful but also predictable film,"Del Toro is a visionary auteur filmmaker. The Shape of Water contains all his typical features: a dark fairytale for grownups, beautiful, haunting and with plenty of subtexts. But this film is nowhere as good as his masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth. The main problem lies in the over predictable plot and objects that are so obviously there to help the story further along (I'm talking about you, calendar with a red hint written on it).

Molecule Review: The Shape of Water,"I'm unable to adjudge whether it is the outstanding performance of the cast or the brilliant narration of the love story that pushes The Shape of Water to the level of a classic. But I'm certainly able to call it one not because of its critical reception but because of what it aims to highlight and succeeds. Guillermo del Toro's protagonist is a mute, young woman named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who plans to save a mystical human-like amphibian from the clutches of a government-run scientific research institute where she works, and which is managed by a sadist and unscrupulous ex-Army (Michael Shannon). It is her love and sympathy for the creature that motivates to do what she does, but Toro projects it as a connection between two creatures with their own flaws and shortcomings. The Shape of Water is purely a love story and nothing else, narrated in the classic 80s style which only uplifts its appeal. Hawkins is Godlike, but I'm without words at the impeccable performance of Richard Jenkins, Shannon, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Octavia Spencer who play more than life. They are so intricate and IN the character that more than the otherwise bland love story I was impressed by their natural skills. Together with Alexandre Desplat's melodious background score and a fitting production setup that puts James Cameron's Avatar (2009) into shame, the film goes above and beyond as to what it sets to achieve. Which is why I will recommend it to anyone who's familiar with Toro's filmography and those who simply appreciate good cinema. The Shape of Water is good cinema and we must appreciate it.

The Shape Of Water is an ominous dark romance that acts as a love letter to classic cinema.,"All rise! Guillermo Del Toro, you have earned the right to sit among the greatest directors of modern cinema. Although, his masterpiece 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a greater accomplishment, this twisted period love story cements his talents. A mute cleaner in a secret facility encounters an enchanted sea creature and rapidly falls in love with it. With it currently being tortured and threatened to be executed, she takes it upon herself to kidnap the asset before it's too late. Del Toro is a director who excites me. Why? Because he is one of the few that boldly utilises creativity to paint canvases filled with magic and memorable imagery. His directing style is always so competent, to a point where I eventually forget I'm watching a film and actually believe I'm there in the picture. What he has crafted here is a beautiful tale that captures romance elegantly. Conveying themes of human destruction, solidarity and most important true love. A human falling for an amphibious creature, it does sound ridiculously childish yet Del Toro confidently sprinkles violence and gore to camouflage the inconceivable plot...to actually make it believable. Yes, our protagonist conveniently falls for the creature rather too quickly (and that's my only major criticism) but as the story unfolds we find the two are more connected on an emotional level. Rather touching I must say. The constant classic films in the background, Desplat's vintage score and the nods to silver screen traits (like monochrome tap dancing) heightens the cinematic appeal of the narrative. Sally Hawkins gives a luminous and powerful performance using just actions which conveys her emotions eloquently. Richard Jenkins provided great comic relief that honestly surprised me. Michael Shannon always plays an antagonising villain. In fact, all the cast members were fantastic. I literally could go on and on about how much I adored this experience. It's not just a film, but a journey and one that I will remember for a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nah,"I've thoroughly enjoyed del Toros work over the years, and I am an avid Sci-fi fan so this would have been a match in heaven if the movie hadn't been so utterly predictable, boring and... correct.Growing up in Sweden, this movie really reminded me of the 70s and 80s when movies where there to educate the masses and not to entertain. Political messages - I don't really care if they are ""right"" or not - belong in propaganda, unless the movie is about said political, obviously. Simply cramming it into a movie - for absolutely no real reason - gives me the shivers. Stop the subterfuge already!And then, predictability. Oh for goodness sake, who did not see that ending come after, what, 15 minutes? Maybe I've seen too many Sci-fi flicks but it was quite clear immediately.

"Suspend disbelief twice, and then enjoy the movie","The Shape of Water (2017) was co-written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. It stars Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito, Octavia Spencer as her best friend Zelda, Doug Jones as ""Amphibian Man,"" and Michael Shannon as Richard Strickland, of ""Security.""In order to enjoy this movie, you have to suspend disbelief twice. First, you have to accept the concept that there's a large amphibian creature that has been captured by the army, and is chained inside a high-security military facility.Then, you have to accept the fact that Sally Hawkins isn't beautiful. Sally Hawkins is beautiful, but she's a good enough actor to carry off her role as a shy, mousey, mute woman.Elisa has a job as one of the janitorial staff at the facility. Naturally, she comes into contact with the creature, and communicates with him in sign language. All this is laid out in the first few minutes. After that, the plot proceeds.Hawkins is great, and so is Octavia Spencer. However, I give the acting honors to Michael Shannon. He embodies pure evil. He always carries a cattle prod with him, which he uses with pleasure whenever he can.Suspending belief, as I noted above, is required to enjoy the film. However, you have to suspend belief again, because, even by the internal rules of the film, some things didn't make sense. (That's why I didn't give the movie a rating of 10.)One very positive factor is that the Amphibian Man is an actor in an extremely effective costume. There's a human being inside that costume, and he can act!The Shape of Water has an extremely high IMDb rating of 8.2. Not everyone liked it however, including Margaret Anne. She would rate it 6. I gave it a 9.We saw the film at Rochester's wonderful Little Theatre. It will work almost as well on the small screen.P.S. Stay for the credits.

Life is But the Shipwreck of Our Plans,"Whether it be Creature from the Black Lagoon, Beauty and the Beast, Edward Scissorhands, or even Her from a few years ago, movies about forbidden love are a common theme in romantic films. And if done right, they could be extremely effective. The Shape of Water stands as a fresh take on that tale, and yes it works really well as a romance between a government controlled creature and a mute custodian.Driven by emotional performances, The Shape of Water feels simple in premise considering we have seen similar stories (mentioned above) almost every year. But it all comes down to execution. Director Guillermo del Toro frames this story as a good guy-bad guy situation, but certainly rounds out each character with emotions and just enough depth to care about every scenario.In that way, the original screenplay by GDT and Vanessa Taylor could be among the best written this year. Every scene has importance and the 2 hour runtime is perfectly paced. There are also several actors who turn in Oscar caliber performances including lead Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Stuhlbarg. I would have to go through the other films and put together a list of Oscar predictions, but all actors mentioned above have a chance at a nominations.GDT has a knack for making gorgeous looking films and The Shape of Water is no different. Everything from the creature played by Doug Jones to the production design and cinematography, this is easily one of the best looking films of the year. To that note, I don't really have a complaint with the film. Performances, writing, directing, visuals, and romance are all way above par. These uniquely executed films are always something I will cherish, and I'm glad GDT was able to bring this to screens, especially before the Fox-Disney merger. It really makes you wonder if we will even get these types of movies once that deal goes down. One can only hope.9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Nothing new about the creator from some Amazonia water, but well directed","Have to say first that I was expecting more and that I had in mind that probably I will give 10, but after seeing it my expectations melted. From my point of view, the music has to be perfect. It is good, but Alexandre Desplat as in ""The Grand Hotel Budapest"" didn't mention then that he used some tones of Hungarian Gypsy music as in here that he used some French tones such as in ""Amélie"". I really love when someone is honest and he isn't, obviously. The second is, what I didn't know before, by my sister's comment after seeing it, Guillermo used the character from one older movie ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" for his Amphibian Man. So, it means it isn't original and nothing new what we haven't seen before. The third, the cast is ok and there I would like to say that Octavia Spencer as Zelda is the best of all of them.

Instant Classic and Sublime 'Adult Fairytale',"TL;DR:Phenomenal style - sound and visuals bring this vivid world to lifeBeautifully shotThematically richWonderful performances, particularly by Sally HawkinsAn instant classic, one that will improve with every watch------------------------------------------------Guillermo del Toro isn't a new director by any means; an expert and renounced filmmaker, he already has a few masterpieces under his belt (such as Pan's Labyrinth) along with a few blockbusters (like Hellboy or Pacific Rim). Now he's back with his first film since Crimson Peak in 2015...and it's wonderful, as good as Pan's Labyrinth, if not better. A modern reselling of a classic Beauty and the Beast-esque tale, Shape of Water is an instant classic, a fairytale film with a dreamlike quality about love, humanity and so much more.The first thing to notice in this film is the style, one that Del Toro absolutely commits to and makes exceptional. It's a beautifully romanticised view of the 1960s, with a wonderful soundtrack and exquisite set design. Imagine Bioshock with a love story. From sound to visuals, the style is unique and breathtaking, absolutely sucking you into a dreamlike world absolutely fit for a 'fairytale' such as this. Even monotonous parts of Sally's life are shot beautifully and Del Toro proves to us once again what he's capable of directing.However it's still Del Toro and anyone who's seen one of his films, from Pan's Labyrinth to Crimson Peak, knows that he has a penchant for the weird and wacky. Weird and wacky in this case though has never been so beautiful and emotional. Straddling themes of love, politics and what is is to be human, this is a film that will no doubt be studied and loved for years to come, with it improving with each viewing.Taking just the story and way it's filmed alone it's a wonderful film already; but it's the cast that make it that much more magical. Michael Shannon often plays the bad guy, but there's a reason for this typecast - he's perfect as it. He doesn't necessarily need to shout; with just a look and a mumble, he crafts an intimidating, unpredictable character that poses as an ominous threat throughout. Octavia Spencer is another one typecast, often playing a sassy lady who's prejudiced against (in this case by Shannon's character, believing himself to be God and everyone else, Spencer's character specifically, to be below him), yet she effortlessly excels in this role and is the perfect friend to Elisa. On the other side is Elisa's other friend, Giles. His friendly, but timid character grounds a film with so much craziness and lends some much needed comic relief; sweet and lovely as the film maybe, it's not a light, easy-going comedy. Zelda and Giles are the perfect friends for Elisa, one being black, the other gay, they understand her struggle as a mute and not being able to fit in with a prejudiced world. This is a struggle personified further in the Amphibian Man, animated wonderfully with terrifyingly realistic gills and colourful scales. Straddling the boundary between animal and man, Doug Jones physical performance really sells the character and the theme it represents. The real star of the cast, however, is Sally Hawkins. With next to no lines at all, her performance is stand out. We fall in love with her without her needing to say a word, similarly to the Amphibian Man. It's this similarity which really brings them together, but it's her performance which stands out the most. With every emotion and thought showing on her face, we feel strongly for this character, sympathising her with every step. Never quite given a chance to shine before, it's wonderful to see what Hawkins can do, able to command such screen presence without a voice and to show her character's struggle vividly.The Shape of Water is an incredible, beautiful and sweet film that will touch the hearts of moviegoers worldwide. A cautionary tale with a plethora of themes and messages that anyone can identify with, this will be a beloved classic, loved more and more with every re-watch. A magical, fairytale that deserves each of its 13 Oscar nominations. It may not win them all, but it certainly deserves the recognition and praise. A masterpiece and an instant classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Amazon's freshwater but whatever,"This is an entertaining, even charming fairy tale, if you can suspend not only disbelief but also knowledge and critical faculties.The story appears to have been inspired by ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" although it is a fantasy/romance rather than a horror movie. It has many similarities to Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" so if you liked that movie, you will probably like this one. Like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" it has a horrific torture scene, but unlike that film also has graphic sex. This is not a movie for persons under 14.The main theme of this film is the outcast. Set in the early 1960s, it ties together the lives of a variety of social outcasts including the amphibian monster. Del Toro and his crew do a good job creating the setting and mood. The acting and the costumes are stellar. Then why can't they get some basic geographical and historical details right? A creature from the Amazon lives in freshwater, not saltwater. The Soviets recruited Americans to be moles; they didn't somehow graft a Russian into America and have him pass as ""Bob."" The Bob/Dimitri character was beyond ludicrous (although if he had been presented realistically as an American or as a Soviet double agent his character would have been realistic and more compelling. It's sad because I liked the character). Again Hollywood insults our intelligence. But despite all I enjoyed this film, seeing it as a simple fairy tale on a child's level despite the sex and violence. If you like fairy tales (and I do) you will enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Princess and the Frog: A Fractured Fairy Tale,"GRADE: A-THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A lyrical re-telling of an age-old love story that is hauntingly beautiful.SYNOPSIS: A mute falls in love with her outer beast.RUNNING TIME: 2 hrs.JIM'S REVIEW: We all know of Beauty and the Beast, a tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, etc. Mismatched souls who fight adversity and become one. The famed director, Guillermo Del Toro's, takes that most cliche of notions and creates a tender love story about a plain-looking mute servant who falls for a big scaly Creature from the Black Lagoon type. Not the most typical movie fare, granted, but doomed lovers nevertheless. Such is The Shape of Water, a swoon-worthy romantic story that is glorious filmmaking.Pure poetry in fact.It is 1963 during the Cold War. In a hidden laboratory, the government has a top secret experiment in the form of a captive beast. Chained and tortured, this creature searches for the tiniest bit of compassion and finally finds it in a lowly worker named Elisa, a lonely mute waif who also yearns for that human touch...or the next best thing.The director carefully sidesteps the sexuality and walks that fine line masterfully, avoiding any unintentional uneasiness with its sensitive subject matter. He fabricates a totally believable world of romance and longing. Adding to the overall romanticism is an insightful and poignant screenplay by Mr. del Toro and Vanessa Taylor that takes its rather rudimental storylines of espionage and governmental conspiracies and wisely pushes those plot devices aside to concentrate on the relationship of two misfits who happen to fall in love. The dialog and voiceover narration is quite beautiful and touching. Also noticeable is the subtleties of racial tension and homophobia in the plot. Yes, there is much at play in this film.The Shape of Water works its magic with its strong visual images, lensed by Dan Lausten, and a lush romantic score by Alexandre Desplat. The production design by Paul D. Austerberry is exquisite. The muted colors, all teals and rustics, cast a melancholy aura to the story which most effectively transports the moviegoer into a otherworldly universe. ""The world is a lonely place "" it seems to say, and its characters reinforce that sense of desperation and sadness.The entire ensemble is splendid. Sally Hawkins is an appealing presence as Elisa. The actress relies on her facial expressions and graceful movement to convey the character's isolation and angst. She glows with a radiance that embellishes Elisa's pain. Doug Jones is her love interest and he literally provides such fluid movement and elegance to the role. (Kudos to the creature design, an elongated mass of aqua scales and gills forming rippling musculature that enhances the attraction factor. Let's face reality, the surreal story is far-fetched and if the beast were a gelatin mass of ooze or a furry fanged monster, the love story could have been a tad unpleasant and possibly intolerable.) Yet, we too fall under the filmmaker's charming spell.Michael Shannon plays the real monster in the film, a villain with no redeeming traits. He provides the necessary hostilities and is a compelling force that advances the narrative, although one wishes the character was written in less black and white terms. Michael Stuhlbarg is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, an impassioned scientist who sees positive communication with this alien as a breakthrough for mankind and shows the many sides of a conflicted man wanting to do right. As Elisa's friends, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins are simply wonderful. Also memorable is Nick Searcy as the military-minded General Hoyt.As this fractured fairy tale gently unfolds its love story about ""a princess without voice"" and a giant amphibian as her ""frog prince"", it all sounds absurd. And it is. But The Shape of Water exists and works its magic so completely that one longs for it to be real.

The dialogues were terribly boring, the music going along with it annoying (especially as the movie switched to become a musical for a few moments) and basically it is a rip-off of Hellboy and Beauty and the beast. Only purpose seems to be, that having intercourse with another species should be socially accepted. Sodomy at it's best? Not even close. The ending was predictable and appears as one of those you have seen a 1000 times before. Oh, and ofc the Russians are evil. America HAS to point this out until every first grader actually believes it.Sure, the visuals in the movies have great moments, allthough it takes a step too far in making us belive, that you can flood an entire bathroom by simply stuffing a towel at the bottom of the door.

The relationship between the creature and the main character seems unnecessarily intimate at times which ultimately made me cringe which is never something I want from a storyline like this which is meant to be serious.

Hollywood at it's worse,"If you know Guillermo del Toro, you know this is not his best movie;
Pan's Labyrinth is not only is best movie, bust one of the best of all times. Why this didn't won oscar best picture in 2007? For two reasons: first is was spoken in spanish, second there was a Martin Scorcese (departed) in the role which was miles away from beying better movie than Pans Labyrinth.
Havins said that Guillermo del Toro learned the lesson and created a Hollywood formatted movie to win the oscar and in the end he did!
We all won because Pans's Labyrinth remains intact in his beauty, in his natural language, and with no musical oscar winning format.

Glad it won an Oscar - but for ulterior motive,"I saw this movie with my wife, we both just thought it was an ""ok"" movie but nothing special. There are far better movies that could have won best picture award.What can be said about this movie that has not already been said? The actors seemed boring, the plot has been done before in one form or another. We also thought the pacing of this movie was a bit off at times.Is it worth seeing? Yes, even if you are not into love stories and just want to see effects.Did it look great? Absolutely, very stunning to the eye and wonderful effects that were not ""over done.""Me personally, I am glad in a way Guillermo del Toro got best picture of this for selfish reasons.Back in the early 2000s del Toro was very close in adapting HP Lovecraft's horror novel At The Mountains of Madness. As a Lovecraft fan, I was really stoked for this to happen. All the actors and crew were in place to put this on the big screen Unfortunately, the studio had an issue with his R rating and not budging on their request to lower it PG-13. The project was scrapped and remains in limbo.How with two Oscars under his belt, I hope del Toro revisits this.

"""Life is but the shipwreck of our plans""","""The Shape of Water"" (2017 release; 123 min.) brings the story of Elisa. As the movie opens, we see Elisa getting ready for work. She and her friend Zelda work as janitors at a restricted government research facility. Along the way, we learn that Elisa is mute. Then one day, a new ""asset "" is delivered to the research facility. Mysterious at first, we learn quickly that it is some sort of amphibious creature. Elisa is immediately drawn to it. But the guy running the research project, a no-good scientist named Colonel Strickland, and his boss General Hoyt, have other ideas... What will happen to the creature? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest fantasy story, if not fairy tale, from Mexican writer-director Guillermo del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth""). Here he brings us a story that in its essence is a variation of ""Beauty and the Beast"", or even ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and the original (1932 and 1976) ""King Kong"". The movie is set in the late 50s or early 60s (at one point, on of the kids asks if he can watch Bonanza), and in fact the overall feeling of the movie is as it it was made in that era, rather than today. The Location of Elisa's apartment, above the Orpheum movie theater where ""The Story of Ruth"" and ""Mardi Grass"" are playing, only increases that overall late 50s/early 60s feel. The set productions is first rate all the way. The way del Toro directs the movie reminded me more than once of Steven Spielberg. Sally Hawkins is outstanding as Elisa. That makes two noteworthy movies this year for her: earlier this year she was equally stellar in ""Maudie"", but watch her pile up the nominations for this film come the awards season (she already picked up a Golden Globe nomination). Last but certainly not least, there is a wonderful orchestral score composed by Oscar-winner Alexandre Desplat, and I'm going on record that he will score another Best Movie Score Oscar nomination for this.""The Shape of Water"" opened up this weekend at my local art-house theater on not one but two screens, a rarity. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, I'm happy to report. Given the overall quality of the movie and the nice counter-programming to the inevitable blockbuster that is ""The Last Jedi"", I can see this having long legs at the art-house theater circuit. Every day Elisa picks up a ""thought of the day"" from her wall calendar, and on a certain day the thought is ""Life is but the shipwreck of our plans"", and that certainly also seems to be the case for this movie, but in the best possible way. ""The Shape of Water"" is a WINNER.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sappy and pointless,"Is enduring love impossible without having first learned how to yearn, pine, or miss? Is love more meaningful if it overcomes social pressure, personal villainy, and inter-species barriers?Guillermo del Toro, with his partially steampunk, partially musical, partially fantasy adventure strongly suggests the answer is ""yes,"" to all of those questions.Can a movie be partially many moods, many feels, many styles, and many genres, yet add up to a satisfying whole? I, with this review, strongly suggest the answer is ""no"" to that specific question.For such a character-driven story, we surprisingly learn very little about any of the characters, except those slices of bits casually tossed around in order to add depth, none of which rise to the giving-a-damn level. One character used to have a drinking problem, another has a verbally combative marriage, and the ultimate reveal could possibly be when still yet another character shows a predilection for total silence while copulating. Oh, almost forgot: there's even one more character who absolutely loves soft-boiled eggs. Fascinating! Oopsie! Spoiler alert!Water, water, everywhere, and all the drops do sink. Even the dancing lacks fluidity, and the stunning visuals lose their patina when that dark thought creeps into your head: this movie might be a lot more entertaining if everyone would die tragically and alone.Of course, we cannot win Oscars thinking like that.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Love Runs Deep,"One of the best things for me about the fantasy genere is the romance aspect. Most of the best love stories come from this genere, I feel though it we have not just more creative freedom but the freedom to express what we geniuely feel. It's also expresses our deep seeded believe that someone somewhere is one for us and the struggle we go though to find and stay with them.Del Toro is one of my favorate movie directors and believe or not this is my favorate movie from him and one of my favorate films in general. This is another kind of film I can't help but feel was almost made for me as it has three of the things I love in most movies; monsters, fantasy, and romance. The premise isn't exactly anything new but it's really more in it's execution that makes it stand out.There are just so many great things from the cinematography and production value which is great. I really like how it recreated early 1960s era which was a time of chaos from bigotry and intolerance on all sides but also great change as minorities were struggling for equal rights.Music is just fantastic, the orchastratic score is just beautiful as it just perfectly captures what's happening but most importantly the feelings of both Eliza and the Creature and who they are as characters. However the best thing for me is the song ""You Never Know"" which is just wonderful and perfectly reflects the relationship.Characters are great from the supporting charcters; Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer are great as Eliza's friends, there is great back and forth between them but I like how well rounded both characters are as we get some depth on them to show the commonality all three have as each of them are struggling and dealing with intolerance on all fronts and forms.Michael Shannon is good as a villain you plain hate as he is a monster in the guise of authority. Theres an interesting character study about him is we get depth into his diseased psyche as he is literally a product of his time, a man living on fixed notions on what a person is supposed to be, which justifies why change or anything different that threats his infastruction shouldn't be aloud. But little does he know or a creeping awareness is he's just part of a dying breed because all those notions are bull crap, despite all the things he has in his life like the teal Cadalac, the whole American dream package he's never content because it's all materialistic there is nothing spiritually going on in his life which makes him spiritually empty.But of coruse what really makes this film are both Eliza and the Creature. Elsa and the Anphibian Creature are another one of my favorate fictional couples in my book up there with Misa and Hikaru in ""Macross"" and many others on my list, because like any romance story done right I actually care about both characters. The chemistry between both of them is just beautiful, I really was invested into their connection, despite their differences their feelings for each other are human.Sally Hawins is just great as Eliza, it's probably my favorate role from her. I'll level with you I actually have a crush on this actress believe or not. Sure she doesn't look like someone from the damn CW which makes it all the better. Personally I think she's beautiful inside and out, I really love here character and she's relatable as I'm not a person that talks much either. Despite a lonely soul, her mute condition and not living in the greatest circumstances she never lets it get her down, she's socialable, she has dreams, even like that she knows how to have fun as we see her display some dancing talent.The Anphibian Creature is great played of coruse by make up and costume actor Doug Jones. The design is great it's all practically there's no CGI bull crap, it really looks like something that could really exist. The creature is a fascinating character despite a mute and not much depth but I find sometimes what you don't say you say a lot. I love that there is mystery to him as you wonder if it's one of the meza god's from Mayan Legend, the God Nepturn from Greek Mythology, a creature seen or even worshiped from the lost civilizations like Atlantis or may'be even the mermaid creatures we heard of from fairy tales, as well as certain abilities of his which show as Shakespere put it ""There are more things in heaven and earth."" However it's really in it's behavior that makes us really connect and sympathize because his childlike curiousity and feelings make him very human.What makes the chemistry truly unique is that it's non verbal which to me is the best approach; it avoids a fundamental problem most romance films have where sometimes both characters go into a bunch of meaningless melodramatic prattle that really dampins the story. Personally in romance stories I find the quiet physical expression the best parts because both characters are expressing what they truly feel for one another.
Despite communicated in silence you can hear them loud and clear from not just their sign language but also just physicality which made the connection all the more genuine and beautiful. As Old Pete once said, ""If love is really true, it doesn't need an answer.""There are a lot of beautiful moments between the two like two scenes seeing both Eliza and him underwater together, which was like seeing a dance from how they move and float together. And there is one dream sequence which was great as it's a throwback to some of the old Hollywood musicals, let alone suprising seeing Sally sing and dance which I knew nothing about.The film does a good job at touching upon the issue of racism as well as other themes like the power of indiviuals and miniorities over corrupt powers and the infaststures built on their lies, the meaning of true humanity. But most importantly the universality of love and how there are no barriers or differences.Elsa and the Creature's love for each other just like the depths of the ocean runs deep.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good Movie, Wrong Oscar Choice","After winning Best Motion Picture of the year, against some pretty tough competition I just had to watch this movie and see what is it all about. I had a faint idea of what the story was going to represent. I knew already that it was about a woman falling in love with a sea creature (this isn't exactly spoilers) but I didn't know what to expect so I didn't have high expectations really.The film was good, the story was ok. The cinematography was great. It is a beautiful movie and an even better love story. I can see it appealing to a variety of people, it is original and less cringe worthy than a lot of romantic movies nowadays. I can't really complain much about this film, I found it very enjoyable in fact and would recommend it to anyone.Did it deserve Best Motion Picture of the Year? In my humble opinion: No, it did not. 
The fact that this movie was a feel good, cookie cutter of a film is exactly why it should not have won best motion picture. The story isn't revolutionary or controversial. I can think of a few other films that are more influential and have great substance to them. The Shape of Water is just a love story and that is it.

The Creature Walks Among Us,"Set in Baltimore in 1962, this entertaining, well-acted hokum might have been quickly dashed off in the fifties by Universal in black & white and with a more rugged music score, but here looks more like what might have resulted had it been assigned to Ross Hunter & Douglas Sirk. With 21st Century production values, eye-popping sex and eye-watering violence, an enigmatic title, some highfalutin dialogue usually delivered by Richard Jenkins, and knowing references to old Hollywood musicals (including a black & white duet recalling the 'Puttin' on the Ritz' sequence in 'Young Frankenstein' based on the Oscar-winning song, 'You'll Never Know', which actually first saw life in the Technicolor production 'Hello Frisco, Hello') it managed to collect the Golden Lion at Venice last summer and an incredible thirteen Oscar nominations.It would have been inconceivable that in 1952 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' could have been Oscar-nominated for Best Picture along with Robert Wise & Michael Rennie for Direction and Best Actor (it lost out to 'An American in Paris'), or 'Things to Come', director William Cameron Menzies and lead actor Raymond Massey fifteen years before that (when Best Picture went to another musical, 'The Great Ziegfeld').",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Heart Shaped Box,"Really enjoyable and beautifully made, if slightly corny love story that could only have come from the mind of Guillermo Del Toro.Mute cleaning lady Elisa (Sally Hawkins), works at a secretive Government facility at the height of the cold war. One day, an asset arrives at the lab, a merman dragged from the sea by his handler and now guard Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). As Strickland and the scientists attempt to gather information about the creature, Elisa secretly uncovers his intelligence and they form a bond. As their relationship deepens, the military decide that vivisection is the only option so Elisa, her neighbour and a reluctant scientist come up with a daring rescue plan.Like so many of Del Toro's films, ""The Shape Of Water"" is, at heart, a dark violent fairy tale. Full of magic and wonder, its implausibility doesn't really stand up to a lot of scrutiny - but that's not the point. The film is about connection. Elisa struggles for connection as she is unable to talk, only her neighbour played by Richard Jenkins and her colleague Zelda, played by Octavia Spencer are able to understand her sign language. There's a credibility to her relationship with the creature that stems from this, although perhaps a few more scenes together would have helped sell the risk she takes to try and save him. Richard Jenkins character too is unable to make the connection that he wants in his life, as a gay man in the 1960's. He has presumably lost his job because of this, and risks the dangers of engaging with the much younger man who runs the local diner. Both Zelda and Strickland have unrewarding marriages, which feed into their desire to help or destroy the central couple.Performances are universally excellent, but special praise must go to Sally Hawkins in what is a daring turn, if playing a Mute wasn't enough, Elisa is entirely naked in several scenes. Michael Shannon Strickland is closer to the thugs and psychopaths he's played previously, but he's still a magnetic presence whenever he's on screen.The ending is potentially divisive, but Del Toro, seemingly aware that it might be, suggests that it's an interpretation. The other criticism of the plot is that it's pretty predictable.It's not suitable for children at all, given the sexual content and violence scenes but adults willing to forgive a little contrivance will find much to admire.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"a hymn to all the ""incomplete"" individuals, never despair, never give up hope","""Incomplete"" sounds like the operative word in Guillermo del Toro's inter-specie romance/fairy-story THE SHAPE OF WATER, headlining this year's Oscar game with a whopping 13 nominations. A mute janitor Elisa Esposito (Hawkins) working at a secret USA government laboratory in Baltimore develops a cordially mutual bond with an amphibian humanoid (Doug Jones, once again, nimbly embodies del Toro's monster under its spectacular camouflage), the sense of ""completion"" is hinted by Elisa's gill-shaped scar on her neck, indicating that there must be an uncanny connection between them, and she must carry out a derring-do to rescue the creature from an imminent vivisection consented by the evil Colonel Richard Strickland (Shannon), yet, even if her plan works, is there a happy-ever-after waiting for the star-crossed lovers in the outside world?Opening the film with a stunning underwater showpiece of Elisa's water-submersed apartment through the voice of Gilles (Jenkins), Elisa's next-door-neighbor, a gay advertisement illustrator who becomes a father figure to her, del Toro cogently calibrates the story's fantastic texture right at the point of departure, and we are completely ensorcelled by his exhaustively fabricated 1960s' retro setting, tints of glaucous green, sapphire blue and subdued amber, adorned by Alexandre Desplat's euphonious tuneage and eclectic ditties.If the story doesn't pan out as revelatory as one might anticipate, what del Toro and his co-writer Vanessa Taylor excel in is the conscientiously integrated signs of the times, Elisa, her co-worker Zelda (Spencer), Gilles and Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Stunhbarg), a Soviet Union mole who steps up as an unlikely aide to Elisa when the crunch comes, they are characters living on the fringe of the society, their skin-color, sexual orientation, gender, vocation or parentage subjects them as the victim of racism, sexism, homophobia, cold war paranoia (destroy the asset so that the enemy can not acquire it as well) and treachery. Applying an unequivocal angel-and-demon dichotomy, the film establishes Col. Strickland as the superlative villain, living his American dream of suburban complacency and hooked by capitalistic consumerism, he will stop at nothing in finishing his job, and Michael Shannon's go-for-broke incarnation of intimidation is non-pareil, it is rather telling that his performance is left mostly unheralded in the awards season, which prompts Richard Jenkins as the MVP amongst the sterling triad of supporting male performers to receive Oscar's recognition, a similar feat when Shannon himself usurped his co-star Aaron Taylor-Johnson to swoop an Oscar nomination in Tom Ford's NOCTURNAL ANIMALS (2016), clearly, the current trend among the Academy members is good guys over sleazebags, which shouldn't be construed as a deprecated remark on Jenkins' affable, nuanced and constantly heart-felt performance. Ineluctably, de Toro pulls no punches in the token victim succumb to the sinister milieu, although violence has been well tempered along the road, Michael Stuhlbarg steals our hearts in his wondrous transmitting of trepidation and pathos.In the distaff front, Octavia Spencer pulls off an almost unrivaled record as an Oscar-winner bagging a third Oscar nomination in the supporting category (a recent predecessor could be Jason Robards), her Zelda might be just as well snatched from THE HELP (2011), but her earthy effulgence and earnestness are what connect and engage audience. The biggest asset, is of course, Sally Hawkins, deprived of verbal capacity (except for a singing-and-dancing, beauty-and-beast-esque, monochromatic figment of Elisa's imagination), whose expressiveness lurks unassumingly in every shot whether she is gesticulating along either Zelda or Gilles, reveling in her own fantasy or intimacy, or simply brazening out the mounting adversity with grace and valor.A fluidly bewitching, incredibly poetic tall-tale del Toro's THE SHAPE OF WATER might seem to be hemmed in its conventional narrative structure with every and each turn running to pedestrian, but in its heart of hearts, it sings a hymn to all the ""incomplete"" individuals, never despair, never give up hope.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Del Toro's Magic,"Guillermo Del Toro continues the magic he started with Pan's Labyrinth, my favorite movie of 2006, and Roger Ebert's. Sally Hawkins stars as a mute woman living in isolation who works at a top secret government facility who have captured a reptile like being who looks like the creature from the black lagoon. Del Toro was obviously influenced by 1960's American movies and television. Michael Shannon plays the requisite sadistic bad guy in charge of keeping the half man, half beast tamed, often with a cattle prod. Hawkin's, of course, falls in love with the lizard man and must help to save him from the evildoers. The Shape of Water is not a children's fairy tale, as Hawkins is often quite naked in the film.

"Auteur Filmmaking with a Capital ""A""","I just love movies like The Shape of Water. Not because it's particularly imaginative (it is) or because it's decorated to the brim with lavish costume, set and creature design (it is), or even because it's thematically ballsy (it very, very, very much is). No – I like movies like The Shape of Water because it is a rare glimpse into the mind of an original creator, cashing in most of his good will and gambling his professional reputation on a film he/she has nearly complete control over and that encapsulates everything they like and care about. George Lucas did it for Star Wars (1977), Christopher Nolan did it for Inception (2010), Zack Snyder did it for Sucker Punch (2011) and now Guillermo Del Toro has done it for The Shape of Water.The film takes place in a fable-esque early sixties Baltimore amid the height of blind consumerism, social conformity, oblivious futurism and Cold War paranoia. Elisa (Hawkins), a mute janitor working the night shift at a top secret research facility forms a deepening bond with their latest test subject – an aquatic humanoid creature with amazing abilities. But when the creature's handler Agent Strickland (Shannon) decides to kill and dissect the creature, Elisa, along with some unexpected allies form a plan to rescue the creature and keep it hidden until it can be freed.The Shape of Water is first and foremost a compendium of very interesting, very different ideas all melting into fine bubbly brine. It's part monster movie in the vogue of Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), part sweeping romance in the mode of Romeo and Juliet. There are shades of 1950's opulence, 1930's escapism and bit of 1960's civil unrest seething just out of frame. A little of Pan's Labyrinth (2006), a little Red Scare cloak and dagger stuff and an overall feel that conjures memories of playing Bioshock when I was a teen (though that last one may not have been purposeful).Even if none of those particulars appeal to you, the craft and detail in this film can hardly disguise the unbridled passion that's infused in every retro-verve window pane and dingy aquarium. This is not just a world you can touch but one you can feel as exemplified by, among other things, Alexandre Desplat's wistfully nostalgic score and Guillermo Del Toro and Vanessa Taylor's mood-setting screenplay. The result is a strong, consistent tone that evokes a feeling of longing for a forgotten past that may have existed in another dimension.Story-wise, the film more-or-less unravels exactly how you'd expect with the only surprises coming in the form of visceral extremes. This may arguably be one of the film's few weaknesses though considering it unravels like a fable, you can't really blame it for following through on its tragi-romantic precepts. Every time we as the audience are lulled into a sense of complacency, the film punctuates the moment with short bursts of gruesome violence, sleepy flights of fantasy and/or, shall we say unique sexual circumstance. These moments of adult content, rather than distract, amplify the overall experience like large crystals of sea salt on sweet caramel. It plays out like a dark, bloody, carnal fable whereby true love is a given and monsters are there to be vanquished.The largest monster in the film is Michael Shannon who plays the menacing Strickland. From one point of view, he's a dedicated family man, a patriotic American and an incorruptible company man. Yet his ruthlessness betrays him, showing that his inner core is just as rotten as his fingers, which the creature bit off and doctors haphazardly reattached. In this situation and in the eyes of Elisa, he's a villain of biblical proportions.Though not to be outdone in the monster department, the distinctive 6' 3'"" Doug Jones manages amazing feats as the amphibian creature. Behind layers of makeup and prosthetics the giant figure has the same level of expressiveness as the demure Sally Hawkins only with occasion to be primal when the need arises. Hawkins, Jenkins, Spencer and Stuhlbarg are all given a chance to imbue their characters with an inner life. Where in lesser hands they'd be relegated to stock, here the black maid becomes the privileged gatekeeper, the communist stooge becomes the moral arbiter and the gay confidante becomes the fallen man given new life.This bring me to the films larger flaw – because we're given so much time to get to know everyone, some of the more romantic moments come across a little unearned. This judgment isn't entirely fair given a lot of ""romance"" movies suffer from the same problem, but not every movie has an amphibian creature playing paddy-cakes with the gal from Paddington (2014). I for one would have liked to see a few more scenes of them getting to know each other before Elisa goes ALF on everyone's a**es. Of course adding a scene or two may ruin the pacing of the film, which is as artfully maintained as everything else in this film.Even at his worst director Guillermo Del Toro knows how to use film language; to make us feel for those tap-dancing across the screen with dreamy grace. The Shape of Water is with little uncertainty one of his best and most powerful films to date. It is a beautiful looking, lovingly crafted and as previously mentioned ballsy movie featuring some of today's best ensemble acting and best Auteur (with a capital A) filmmaking.

"Not disastrous, but failed to match the high expectation set.","IMDB users appear incredibly divided over The Shape of Water, with many hailing it as a masterpiece and others dismissing it as a horrendously overrated piece of film making. I believe the film lies towards the former, but fails to reach it by a considerable margin.As the lead role, you may expect Sally Hawkins to deliver the most accomplished performance in the film. However, that acclaim definitely lends itself more to Michael Shannon's ruthless and compelling depiction of ""patriotic"" agent Strickland, which I believe is unparalleled by another member of the cast.Guillermo del Toro delivers some favourable, though not entirely innovative or exceptional cinematography and direction (including a moderately effective score).The Shape of Water deserves praise for it's largely successful composite of comedic and serious, violent moments.There aren't a tremendous number of overt flaws with The Shape of Water, it merely fails to deliver consistently high quality material.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Let's see: mute girl falls in love with the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Yeah, great idea for a movie. Not. Are you kidding me? If this had been made as a farcical B movie it might have been worth a ""well nothing better is on"" watch, but it's not. This movie actually takes it self seriously and expects us to do the same, despite a completely absurd premise couldn't be worse, and one which was horribly butchered to boot. We start with completely pointless nudity and shots of our star masterbating (that probably scored big points with the Hollywood crowd - no wonder it won awards), then we're introduced to a series of characters, none who are at all likable, believable, or even interesting, including an absurdly cliched Dr Evil type who wants nothing more than to kill/torture our poor Black Lagoon dude. We're given nothing even the tiniest bit believable in terms of how/why this girl falls in love with fishface, even for a movie. And, being Hollywood, they make sure to go out of their way to toss the race card in your face now and again (God forbid that be left out of a movie!), despite that having basically nothing to do with the movie (no doubt why it was places in the 60s). The script (at least early on) was like Don King's hairdo, frequently shooting off in haphazard, unrelated, and pointless ways. I could go on and on, but unlike the movie, I'll be merciful and stop there. But basically don't waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not at all what I was expecting...,"This movie wasn't at all what I was expecting... don't wanna give much away, but it is romantic and cute (in a weird E.T. kinda-way), and offers a powerful message about communication and its benefits... definitely well worth the watch!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A needed Gem in a Time of hate and rage,"This movie is unusual, odd and queer. I wouldn't come out ld with such an atypical story in a million year, and that's what makes it alluring the fact that it takes you by surprise, that you don't know what to expect. Add to it, it's aesthetically pleasing to the senses and the mind, del Toro's directing is very dynamic and this vintage halo around the movie makes it feels like a mix of Wes Anderson and Spielberg, fused with Amilie and vintage Parisien aesthetics mainly through the music to give this genre-defying romance. Besides, the story is remarkably touching too it's a reflection on loneliness as every characte suffer from it on his own terms from Elisa who's craving for love and being understood, to her friends Zelda who's living with a man who doesn't appreciate nor respect her and Jiles, an old gay guy who mourns not living his younger days fully and truly and afraid it's too late to find someone at his age, plus there is Strickland the antagonist, a depressed ex-soldier bored of his plastic life with a billboard plastic family and professor dimitri who's left out by the bothsides he's working for. They all keep living their monotonous routines until this aquatic God comes and changes it, as he represents closure and release, leading the characters to either find love, find confidence, stand up for themselves or simply find peace in death. The other thing that touched me the most is the love story between Elisa and the Creature as it defies words and norms only relying on feelings and touch, showing us that love is unconventional and universal and count on del Toro to deliver this beautiful message in a beautifully twisted way.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of 2017's very best films!,"The Shape of Water accomplishes the same subversive realist-fantasy that made Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth such a modern classic in the first place. Del Toro has achieved the same sensationalistic and stylistic modern fantasy in similar vein to Pan's and HellBoy I & II. Del Toro knows to put the REAL in 'surreal' and applies believability of the highest order.What is it about del Toro and the way he's approached fantasy films by applying an extra dimension of reality into the mix? Pan's Labyrinth was groundbreaking for its gritty post-Spanish-Civil-War story told alongside the story of a girl who may be the long lost princess of a kingdom long-forgotten. The Shape of Water does the same thing albeit during the Cold War and in 1960s Baltimore, focusing on a mute girl and a fish-man from South America, who form a romance defying all rhyme and reason.The Shape of Water is like an old-timey fairy-tale movie but an adult reimagining of classic Disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Spielberg's ET, and even has mild elements that evoke 2K-Games' classic BioShock series.This film is a fantasy film for naysayers of the genre; it has the kind of 'teeth' some of those critics may be sorely missing out on. This is a gorgeous piece of modern cinema that I think anyone can appreciate regardless if the people in question are avid fans of fantasy cinema or not.Del Toro is easily one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers and give the guy control over any fictional domain and he knows EXACTLY how to command a memorable story on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Overhyped, but good.","This is not a revolutionary movie. Heck, if you ever watched a movie before, you'll know the general gist of how it ends within the first few minutes. I mean that quite literally. You'll think ""oh, this scene would not be here unless a scene so-and-so will come later, because this scene by itself is nowhere near important enough to spoil a PG-13 rating"". There's a second scene as well, which I can't mention without getting into potential spoiler territory for the first-time movie viewer. It's in the first five minutes, though (again, literally).But, still, I found it endearing. I'm of an age and life situation where I have a soft spot for romance. Also, I really love Sally Hawkins. There was nothing much awry with it. Great acting, direction, and so forth. There just wasn't anything particularly special about it. A standard story told very well.

A Beautifully Shot Film,"Being praised around the world as one of the best films of the year from people visiting festivals, The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's latest venture into the strange and moving area of film. From Pan's Labyrinth to recent films like Pacific Rim, I've always enjoyed watching his films. While I won't be praising this film as much as some people have been, it will easily be receiving a recommendation from my end, but to the right crowd. The Shape of Water is a beautiful, yet strange tale of romance, and even though you've seen this particular story many times over, I feel as though there is enough of a fresh spin to win fans over. Here are my thoughts on The Shape of Water.To get this out of the way, people will surely be going into this film and receiving flashbacks from films like Beauty and the Beast, Splash, or even Shrek. Taking place in a fantasy world where men capture exotic creatures and use them to experiment on, Eliza discovers the creature after being tortured. Forming a very close bond with him, forming a plan to help him escape, and having him stay in her bathtub where he can have room to breathe, this very quickly becomes a very strange romantic tale that people will either buy into or find themselves wondering why they're watching this movie in the first place.Throughout the course of the film, certain characters will present themselves in order to provide fear to the creature or to make you side with him, so that the story may progress. There are definitely a few forced aspects about this film, but when everything is filmed and presented so wonderfully, it's hard to let that clash with your enjoyment of the movie as a whole. To add to that, it was clear that certain scenes or lines of dialogue were added to the film in order to give it a sense of realism, but some of the vulgarity actually took me out of the overall experience, due to the fact that it wanted to get you emotionally invested at the same time. You'll know what I mean if you choose to check out this film.Aside from appearances in Paddington or Blue Jasmine, I'd never really thought about Sally Hawkins as a leading lady of a major production, but sometimes you're proved to be severely wrong because her performance here floored me. I was incredibly invested in every single moment her character was on-screen and anything I didn't like about this movie faded away every time she interacted with someone and had to display her emotions through her sign language or by just simply tearing up or showing emotion through her eyes. I will be remembering this performance as one of the best of the year by year.In the end, where I think this film slightly fails is in its addition of human villains. The Shape of Water is a beautiful romance at its core, but I didn't feel the movie shows quite enough of it to really be a masterpiece, even though the production designers sure made it feel like a damn elegant piece of cinema. If for nothing else, the set design, along with the visual effects and art direction, will surely be included in the awards season to come, because it's some of the best I've seen all year (possibly even the absolute best).Overall, I can call The Shape of Water a damn solid film, but it's not quite as wonderful as I was hoping it would be. To fans of strange or unique films, I recommend you check out this movie. Many people seem to be adoring this film, and while I agree that it's impressive, it's just hard not to compare it to many similar concepts. A great, yet familiar experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but best picture?,"So about The Shape Of Water,Overall, I think it's a good film. Pretty cinematography, great blending of little bits of genres and an interesting concept, although... I think the overall story was a bit bland and too simple.
The relationship between the two main characters feels unrealistic, there is no motive for both of them to have sexual feelings, it kinda doesn't make sense. A friendship? sure, they are able to look beyond their ""flaws"" and connect like they can't with others, but does that give any logical reason for them to have sexual attraction? 
Furthermore, the villain feels over the top and more like a comic villain. He has no reason at all to be so evil and torture a humanoid. He just felt like a bland and simple bad guy to move the plot. Over acted as well.
The CGI was fine, nothing ground breaking, not sure if the creature was part practical, but it wasnt as realistic as I expected from the hype.
The main character, the girl, was acted pretty good. I bought her character and I empathized her. I only thought her arc was unrealistic (like a healthy person would have sex with another species, ever) and had no motivation (coming back to the motivation for the sexual connection, not the friendship one).
Coming back to the cinematography, this is where the movie shines. The colours and filters used are really amazing, typically Del Torro. Combined with the old, french/european 50-60s feels of the music and the cold war america setting, created a warm and rich environment. The camera work was good, nothing fancy or groundbreaking (think Dunkirk was the better choice). Same goes for lighting and shots, nothing fancy really but pretty.Overall, good and enjoyable movie (more enjoyable then last years oscar winner, which should have been La La Land imo) but on a level of story and writing lacks the magic.Tbh, I think this movie mainly won because it can appeal and satisfy a larger crowd then Dunkirk can, although I thought that was the better movie (even with the lack of leveled characters).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A sweet, romantic creature feature.","'The Shape of Water' is co-written and directed by Guillermo del Toro and stars Sally Hawkins as Elisa, a mute woman working in a 1960's US government lab which is harboring an aquatic Amazonian creature which she falls in love with and decides to save from the grasp of the American and Russian governments. The cast is rounded out by Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stulhbarg and Michael Shannon.This film along with 'Dunkirk' is one of the finest technical achievements of the year boasting stunning cinematography (particularly the effect of camera seemingly floating on water the whole time), beautiful production design and a seductive old Hollywood-style score. The story of outsiders coming together to help another is absorbing and heartwarming and is greatly helped by remarkable performances across the board but particularly by Sally Hawkins who is mesmerizing without saying a word. Richard Jenkins is also noteworthy as Elisa's neighbor and friend Giles giving a sensitive, subdued but standout turn. Octavia Spencer and Michael Stulhbarg are also decent as Elisa's friend and work partner who serves as comedy relief and a soviet spy with a conscience respectively.Michael Shannon plays a very typical villain for a fairy tale and while his performance is passable, his character is underwritten and comes off as a mustache twirler. Other than this one flaw however, the movie is superb coasting on del Toro's superb direction and a phenomenal cast. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Academy Awards Best Picture yet only 7.1 IMDB rating?,"This shows how out-of-touch Hollywood and the Academy has become. They are only interested in making films that please themselves, each other and their sociopolitical masters.Neither Hollywood or the Academy care about the reality of the world outside their own self-absorbed, self-congratulating, elitist, politically-correct, far-left bubble. And if they do care about it, it is only because they see it as their enemy to be destroyed if it can't be brain-washed.They they are no longer making movies for the public unless it is propaganda designed to sway your opinion or vote. They don't care about appealing to main-stream Americans. They make their movies to please themselves and their masters. I don't how many movies I will NEVER see now because of the damage these Hollywood lunatic sell-outs have done to our country and culture. There are only a handful of actors and directors now that I would trust to not feed me a story full of of pro-communist, anti-American garbage.There is so much great content out there now from independent studios and others that this crap should no longer be accepted as the norm. This is NOT your father's Hollywood.... it is your Big Brother's!It's pretty amazing the Oscar for Best Picture in 2017 can barely score over 7 out of 10.

Great Film that emphasizes the importance of communication and fear of 'others.',"The Shape of Water-A Wonderful Adult Fairy Tale Movie about CommunicationEver since visiting the lakes, going fishing, and watching the Disney movie Atlantis, I've always had an obsession with the underwater world and believed that other human-like creatures were lurking beneath the oceans. So, before watching Guillermo Del Toro's The Shape of Water (2017), I was initially excited for this film, and after watching it, I was genuinely impressed with the cinematography, visuals, and theme. The Shape of Water (2017) stylishly tells the story of a classic monster-adult fairy tale and fuses with old Hollywood musical, making it a fascinating experience. Furthermore, with exceptional cinematography and visuals, this film has a great message about the importance of communication and shows it through the excellent development of the characters and narrative.The movie shows us Elisa (Sally Hawkins), who is a mute woman that works as a nighttime janitor in a research facility center. She doesn't have many friends, except her African-American co-worker friend Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer) who spends most of the time talking, and her close neighbor, who is a closeted gay man called Giles (Richard Jenkins). One day, as Elisa is working, the facility center brings an amphibious creature that lives underwater. Intrigued by the creature, Elisa secretly tries to get closer to him by bringing eggs, playing musicals, and teaching him to sign language. Eventually, these two get closer, but Elisa's superior Strickland wants to dissect the creature for study purposes and to avoid the Russians to get more information as well.In Del Toro's movies, many of his films have great visuals, and with The Shape of Water (2017), the director carefully uses colors to evoke the character's state of mind. The turquoise and teal colored background were used through the entire period to evoke the sense of bleakness and loneliness. All the characters, despite generally having a happy life have some sort of emptiness in their lives and Del Toro wanted to show it through the screen vividly. And so, when the use of color red appears, it is used in controlled situations to show passion and delight in Elisa, making it easier to establish the overall mood.As for the performance, all the characters including the supporting roles had great depth. The most astonishing feature of the film's vision was that the story was delivered from a voiceless woman, a gay artist, and a black woman, all sharing some problems regarding communication. In particular, Sally Hawkins undoubtedly outshines the rest of the characters as she only uses her body to communicate with others, making it both humorous, powerful, and truly magical. Additionally, Spencer and Jenkins elevate the arc of the story while Shannon as Strickland is genuinely a horrific villain.Because the creature is an outsider, naturally, Elisa, Zelda, and Giles who are also social pariahs see the amphibious creature as something magnificent while Strickland sees him as ""ugly as sin."" These direct contrasts show how the importance of communication is demonstrated through the character's situations. Questions such as what happens when we are taken away the ability to communicate with others or who gets to decide who talks are all emphasized throughout the film. In a way, because the characters are social minorities, their voices are all suppressed. Elisa cannot verbally communicate, so she gets help from her close friends Zelda and Giles, making her feel marginalized and incomplete. On the other hand, Strickland's position in society allows him to abuse his powers and use communication only to take advantage of his subordinates.Just as the title suggests, the element of water is flexible and adaptable, which illustrates that love can have many different shapes and form. Even though Elisa might not be able to communicate verbally, she still can interact with the creature through sign language and does not have to be judged for who she is. In a way, as she bonds with the being, it is shown that sex can also be a form of communication, one that Elisa eventually does to deepen the relationship with her love. Despite the absence of speech, Elisa uses other methods-especially in the water- to connect and communicate with the creature, making her self-expression fill the void that was empty in her life with someone who will love her just for the way she is.All in all, Del Toro and his cast and crew delivers a compelling film by showcasing unique and imaginative elements of the characters and story. It is no doubt that The Shape of Water (2017) is one of Del Toro's best works. By sticking with the theme of communication, this movie has a relevant message in modern society, and just like water, one can decide what kind of meaning love wants to be.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Guillermo Del Toro's Best Film So Far !,"Guillermo Del Toro's newest film ""The Shape of Water"" took my breath away. Easily this is Del Toro's finest film since ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and may even be his best in general. This is a film where Del Toro weaves magic throughout with a story he created which is simple, yet layered with such interesting facets embedded in each character, set, and prop as he allows the audience to discover this intimate and fascinating world of ""broken"" people searching for a moment of meaning. Captivating from its opening scenes with haunting visual imagery, and a lyrical score by Alexandre Desplat, one is immediately enthralled by this fairy tale that is not your usual saccharine variety that Disney cranks out.Del Toro knows how to tell a story with wit, style and heart. Assembling a cast headed by the incandescent Sally Hawkins in the role of Eliza who is mute throughout the film, but exudes such humanity and strength along with the villainous Michael Shannon who provides a great balance. Every single actor sparkles because every character has been developed with great care. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer shine in their roles bringing a touch of quirkiness and humor to this sometimes dark story.The film is achingly nostalgic with glorious production design by Paul D. Austerberry evoking the Baltimore of 1962 full of fascinating textures of faded glory, especially in the magnificent design of Eliza's apartment and hallways. Exquisite camera work by Dan Laustsen and beautifully designed costumes by Luis Sequiera contribute greatly to complete Guillermo Del Toro's vision.This film is really the ultimate version of ""Beauty and The Beast"" with a touch of ""ET"", capped off with a very emotional investment, that pays off for the audience in its poetic and lyrical final scene.Certainly one of the finest films of 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Vidiot Reviews....,"The Shape of WaterThe upside to a having a fish-man on your superhero squad is they can unclog any toilet.Surprisingly, the hybrid in this fantasy isn't affiliated with any sequential art.When a military colonel (Michael Shannon) arrives at a top-secret aquarium with a mysterious sea-creature in tow, the facility's mute cleaning lady Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is inexplicably drawn to the cryptic convict.While she and her co-worker (Octavia Spencer) are warned not to interact with the army's asset (Doug Jones), Elisa lunches with it anyways. When she learns of its imminent dissection, she enlists her neighbor (Richard Jenkins) and a scientist (Michael Stuhlbarg) to help free her new friend.Steeped in classic monster movie ethos, writer/director Guillermo del Toro crafts beautifully shot fan fiction of the Creature from the Black Lagoon and, in the process, manages to make his crossover masterpiece.The downside to dating a fish-man, however, is permanent shrinkage.

"beautiful film, creature, performances","Greetings again from the darkness. Recent release THE JUSTICE LEAGUE is filled with superheroes, but filmmaker-extraordinaire Guillermo del Toro finds his league of misfits and outcasts to be much more interesting - as do I. The numerous possible descriptions of this movie are all accurate, yet alone, each falls short: a fairy tale, fable, monster movie, unconventional romance, sci-fi, cold war saga, and commentary on societal misfits. What is also true is that it's a gorgeous film with terrific performances, and it pays lovely tribute to the classics.A government research facility in 1962 Baltimore is the setting, and ""The Asset"" being secured and studied is an amphibious creature that was captured in South America by a sadistic Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) and his electric cattle prod. Now the military, and a 5- star General played by Nick Searcy, is in charge. The lead scientist played by Michael Stuhlbarg certainly has a different agenda than the military, whose focus seems to be more on preventing the Russians (closer than you think) from stealing the asset than in actually seizing the rare scientific opportunity for advancement.While all the ominous and clandestine government operations are being conducted, a member of the nighttime cleaning crew - a mute woman named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) – makes a very personal connection with the creature through nutritious snacks, Big Band music and sign language. This is the enchanting portion of the story and is admittedly (by del Toro) inspired by the 1954 classic CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (a personal favorite of mine). Elisa and the creature experience a romantic courtship not unlike what we have seen in many other love stories  that is, if you overlook the amphibious being that makes up half of this couple. In fact, ""going with"" the story is crucial to one's enjoyment. Sit back and let the magic and wonder and fantastical nature of del Toro's imagination sweep you away – just as it has done for Elisa.There are many elements of the film worth exploring, and it's likely to take another viewing to capture many of them. The band of misfits is comprised of the creature (Doug Jones), Elisa (Ms. Hawkins), Elisa's wise and wise-cracking co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer), and Elisa's neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), a closeted gay graphics design artist. These are the nice folks/beings who make up the world that seems to be run by bullies and predators (sound familiar?). There is even a religious debate here as it's mentioned that the creature was treated by a God in his natural environment, and a brief discussion is had over what might a God look like. All of the actors are superb, and Miss Hawkins delivers her second knockout performance of the year (the other being MAUDIE).""The future"" is a central theme of the story, though Elisa is most focused on now – how to find some happiness in a world that has been so challenging. Elisa realizes she and the creature are more similar than not, and she feels his pain each time the power-hungry Strickland (Shannon) pops him with the electric cattle prod. There is an ethereal beauty (and yes, sensuality) to the scenes with Elisa and the creature, and it even leads to a terrific song (""You'll Never Know"" by Renee Fleming) and dance dream sequence. In addition, you'll notice many nods and tributes to classics such as Mr. Ed, Dobie Gillis, Betty Grable, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson and Shirley Temple, and Carmen Miranda singing ""Chica Chica Boom Chic"". It's also no accident that the apartments of Elisa and Giles are located directly above a palatial old movie theatre that is struggling to make ends meet. All of these pieces are tied together as Mr. del Toro honors the art forms he so adores.For those who enjoy such detail, it should be noted that the color green plays a huge role throughout the film  the water, the creature, the uniforms, the furniture, the walls – even the Jello, the pie and Strickland's (teal) Cadillac. The use of color ties in the ever- present mythology, and the theme of meanness and power versus kindness and love.Cinematographer Dan Laustsen adds to the magical feel with his camera work and lighting that perfectly complements the characters and tone. Oscar winning composer Alexandre Desplat delivers yet another spot on score that not only syncs with story, but also the numerous classic songs included. Guillermo det Toro is one of the most creative and inventive contemporary filmmakers, and though this one may fall a tick below his masterpiece PAN'S LABRYNTH, it is sure to dazzle and mesmerize those who give it a chance  and let's hope there are many who do!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good not great,"I've seen both this and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri and this movie is ok, Three Billboards was a far better picture.

A Modern Fairy Tale,"The Shape of Water has received extensive appraisal from the academy this year, as it currently leads the awards race with a grand total of 13 nominations. The film has garnered a plethora of nominations in the acting, directing and technical categories. Many pundits in fact speculate that it's the favourite to win Best Picture, with Get Out coming in just behind as a close second. Despite the awards buzz, I was rather sceptical of del Torro's new film, as the academy has previously rewarded films that are dull and overly pretentious. Though over the past few years there have been some notable exceptions, for example Titanic and the Lord of the Rings. However, once this fantastical story had concluded and the credits rolled, my scepticism had been completely washed away (no pun intended).The film tells the story of Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute woman who works as a cleaner at one of the US' research facilities during the height of the cold war. The aforesaid facility is run by the ambitious and cold-hearted Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), who oversees the transfer of a new research asset. This asset being an amphibious creature uncovered in South America. The film depicts an unconventional love story between Elisa and the creature, a love that has to overcome the cruelty and brutality of this world. A cruelty embodied by the prejudicial and cold Strickland.Such a fantastical story's believability is wholly dependent on the actor's ability to deliver compelling performances. Which is exactly what this talented cast does, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins deliver both likeability and emotional depth with their characters. Surprisingly, both of their characters are also quite amusing and provide unexpected comic relief. There was a particular gag from Octavia Spencer's character, after shall we say an 'intimate 'moment', that had me laughing out loud. Ergo, what is unsurprising is that both have received acting nods from the academy.Though to me, the real standout of this stellar cast is Sally Hawkins. She wonderfully portrays a woman isolated from society due to what she feels is an inability to fully articulate herself, among other things. The fact that Hawkins' character is mute means that much of the emotional weight of her character's story is dependent on her ability to express the character's emotions physically. Something that she is able to do with great grace and beauty. There is a particular standout scene where Hawkins's facial expressions and gesticulation, manage to express how this newfound connection has lifted her character from the depths of loneliness to a place of love and acceptance. In my humble opinion, her nomination for best actress is 100% deserved.Del Torro also excels in his duty as director. He crafts a visually evocative world, which he brings to life by combining creative and colourful cinematography with an authentic 60s soundtrack. I particularly liked how he used water imagery throughout the film to illustrate both isolation and unification.The film for the most part is impressive all around, but like any movie, it isn't perfect. I would argue that there wasn't enough time dedicated enough to building the connection between Elisa and the creature. It isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, it's greatest crime is that it's 'good enough', as it adequately serves the purpose of forwarding the narrative. I feel that if more time was dedicated to building their relationship, it truly could have been an iconic cinematic romance. If such time had been invested, I feel that the dramatic climax of the third act would have been far more emotionally impactful.Despite these flaws, The Shape of Water tells a memorable story. Not because of how it interweaves its different themes using its various characters, but because of the importance of its message. It tells a story of the transcendent nature of love. A story of how love can wash away the trappings of loneliness and transcend the ugliness of prejudice. Guillermo del Torro's simple story has an important message, one that is delivered with emotional honesty, we shouldn't let mere physical attributes and so called 'flaws' tear us apart and isolate us. Rather, we should love well and love freely.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It felt that it was shocking for shocking's sake, and as much as I tried to hold on to the theme of being an outcast....it really difficult to connect with any character.I give it 6/10 because it was enjoyable to watch in the moment, plus other pleasantries, such as Michael Shannon and some lovely cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Delightful Fairy Tale From Del Toro,"Guillermo del Toro is back with this visually stunning and thoroughly entertaining adult fairy tale. While this movie does not quite live up to some of his previous films (i.e. ""Pan's Labyrinth,"") it is still a great film in its own right. When one begins to watch the film, the first thing that the viewer will notice is the luscious and stunning visuals. These aesthetic qualities are all the more superb and stunning when one takes a moment to realize that they were done with practical effects rather than CGI. As usual, the visionary style del Toro takes to envision his creature and sets is incredibly impressive. Alexandre Desplat's score, with its simplistic, unpretentious and almost low-key charm, is also thoroughly riveting.The plot, which centers on a janitor's relationship with a creature kept in a research lab during the Cold War era in Baltimore, is entertaining throughout. The film is paced well, and never drags or feels tedious. The acting on display in the film is good as well, with a solid performance from Sally Hawkins in the lead role, a show-stealing supporting performance by Octavia Spencer, and a darkly powerful turn by Michael Shannon as a supervisor who serves as the film's sadistic villain. It is also important to note how the film is enhanced by its use of classic filmmaking tropes, which are managed well as to feel original rather than clichéd or too old-fashioned. They give the film a unique layer of depth to it that helps work hand-in-hand with its stylish aesthetic and unique mix of charm and darker themes. The only criticism I have of this film is the fact that there is a lack of individualization or characterization of film's supporting characters; these characters seem solely memorable based on a single personality trait. Otherwise, this is a skillfully made fantasy film and one that I would recommend very much. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

NOTES
This bizarre love story marketed as a Cold War thriller executes well, but doesn't quite come together in the end, achieving a B-. I hate it when they market movies incorrectly just to get people into the theaters. It's not what you're expecting folks. Usually writer/director Guillermo del Toro is a sure thing for me, but ""The Shape of Water"" misses the mark for reasons difficult to put my finger on.
REVIEW
Sally Hawkins's Elisa Esposito in ""The Shape of Water"" is not deaf, but is unable to speak for unknown reasons and is referred to as a ""mute"" who lives an orderly, simple little life. She lives above a rickety old movie theater that never has an audience and next to Giles (a superb Richard Jenkins (come to think of it, when is he ever not superb?)). Giles is a gay man in 1962 who is self-conscious about his age and his loss of hair. Both of them are understandably lonely and outcasts. Giles is in love with the local (much younger) pie restaurateur and Elisa pleasures herself every morning in the tub like clockwork. Elisa works at a government lab cleaning the floors alongside Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer), who carries on one-sided conversations until it's time to clock out. One day a mysterious canister arrives trailed by the ultra-macho Richard Strickland (a sadistically sensational Michael Shannon), a government agent who dragged the thing all the way up from South America where the Amazon people worshipped it like a god. Once we see the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones) chained up, helpless as Strickland tortures him with an electric cattle prod, he doesn't seem so godlike. What starts with a sympathy Elisa has for the creature becomes an affection, as she brings him boiled eggs, teaches him sign language, and plays him records during her lunch break. This otherworldly romantic sequence is at the heart of the story, but del Toro doesn't give it time to develop leaving it weirdly misplaced among the secretive Russian spies and off-the-wall racist comments provided as atmosphere. Strickland and his boss, a five-star general, decide to kill the creature so the knowledge of whatever it is and whatever humans can learn from it won't get into the hands of the Russians. Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) pleads that it must be preserved for science. Elisa finds out and must save the Amphibian Man no matter the cost. 
If you look at all the pieces separately they're executed flawlessly. The color palate is made up of varying shades of teal (not green, teal), and is explained to be the color of the future. Strickland's car is teal, the Amphibian Man is green, the water is green, Elisa's apartment is green, the tile is green, the....you get the picture. And it's beautiful. It sets up a beautiful dreamlike tone for the story. Director of photography Dan Laustsen does excellent work making nearly every waking frame drip with water or moisture of some kind. The basement of the laboratory where Elisa and Zelda work appears to be growing moss right before your eyes. The smell of mildew translates from the screen to your unappreciative nose. All this is perfectly executed. Even the choreography of little dance numbers scattered here and there are cute and fun. Alexandre Desplat's score lifts you up and takes you on a journey to a Parisian dream where you're floating in a romantic mist. All this contributes to a dream-like beautifully greenish romantic tone.
Tone is del Toro's main problem here. There are pieces that are masterfully presented, but when they all come together they're shattered by del Toro's abrasive use of graphic images, his sexual solemnity, and his callous use of racist atmosphere. Somehow it doesn't fit together, and it's too bad, because it could've been extraordinary. This all comes to a strange end, which I found to be unsettling, but not because del Toro wanted me to feel unsettled. Maybe because the second half of the film does not fit with the first as if it's two different visions being spliced together, and the ending is the final attempt to force them together.
Hawkins as Elisa is a irresistibly charming and one can't help comparing her to Audrey Tautou in ""Amelie"" (one of my favorites). Her shyness and silence draws you in and makes you want her to be happy. Del Toro makes a point to comment on a couple of social issues rather overtly. He teaches us that the ""outcast"" or the ""other"" should not be looked down upon and deprived of human decency. He makes this clear with the use of a janitor with the inability to speak, a black female janitor, a gay man past his prime (in the 1960s), and an Amphibian Man who are all treated abhorrently by Strickland and his superiors, who represent the privileged white American male. Strickland even makes it a point to bring up that man is created in God's image, and that God looks like him, not so much Zelda, and definitely not the Amphibian Man, but him and his kind alone. Strickland represents the conservative, traditional American man with his immaculately white sunny house, his perfectly put together housewife, and his 1.5 children, which is the past, literally smelling of decay. While Elisa and the Amphibian Man represent the liberal future. A future where love knows no bounds, whether gay, straight, black, white, mute, fish, doesn't matter. 
I appreciated del Toro's messages here, and I really wanted to love this movie. I am a supporter of his and have thoroughly enjoyed his past endeavors such as ""Pacific Rim,"" ""Hellboy,"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but this most recent work fell a bit flat. The feeling I got is that this was a personal project, that del Toro cared about this story on a deeply intimate level, but it emulates the title - coming across formless and disappointingly elusive in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mind-blowing!,"I am left speechless after just watching this movie. I rarely get this no words feeling after watching a movie, but this one left me so amazed. Michael Shannon delivers an amazing performance as this dark security agent with a mind-blowing psychotic tendency. Richard Jenkins delivers every bit of detail that I would have ever imagined he could. Its absolutely fantastic to experience the relationship between him and Sally Hawkins (who I think delivers the performance of a life time). Together with Octavia Spencer who is brilliant as always, I think they deliver this years best movie. The movie can somehow be a little bit drawn out with very long cuts however the fantastic scenery and amazingly intriguing characters makes completely up for that. This is probably the most weird love story I have seen since Beauty And The Beast however I was left with a feeling og understanding. Its a very relatable film about all the things we as humans are scared of and I think its brilliant. I would recommend anyone to go see this movie!AMAZING!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Different and enjoyable love story,"'The Shape of Water' is del Toro's 10th film, and one of his best - better than 'Pan's Labyrinth', in my books. It's an interesting tale about a mute woman Elisa (Hawkins), who works as a cleaner at a military base with her friend, Zelda (Spencer). There they find that Strickland (Shannon) has brought something strange back to the base. Since he's shown in the trailer & posters, it's not really a spoiler to say that Doug Jones plays an Abe Sapien-like creature (man, I wish they'd make 'Hellboy III'!) Elisa and ""the asset"" begin to connect and we're off on a peculiar journey.The film does well to integrate the fantastic with the real world, with everything looking like the 1960's and the racism, sexism and prejudice is still on display. There's also an interesting sub-plot of the Cold War, with Russian spies - and a bit of a sad ending there, but also slyly funny. All the actors are great - Jenkins as the helpful friend/neighbour, Spencer as the chatty/funny work friend, Stuhlbarg as the scientist, Shannon as the bad guy - always excellent - and Jones and Hawkins as the silent, but super-expressive leads.The other main stars are colour and water - everything's either a motif of green, blue or teal, and the use of water as a transition between scenes is great. The score's good and the film never seems hurried - except for one scene - but isn't too long either. There's moments of violence and comedy between the question of how does he exist? But mostly, it's a pleasant story about love and identity, with a solid ending and excellent cinematography.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Although this film got best picture Oscar award, it doesn't that much good.","I didn't have my hope that high because it says drama on genre, but I must admit that this film turned out good. The plot was so simple, but even at the nearly end, it still gave me some excitement. But since it's about love and drama, yeah, it's sort of boring for me. But it wasn't as boring as Blade Runner 2049. At least I could finish it in a day.I only watched this film because it was Oscar's best picture and it got three more Oscars. So, I wanted to find out how it was the best. But after I watched it, I had a little bit of disappointment. To be honest, it wasn't the best. Maybe it's because I'm not that much into love stories and dramas. If I was, I might say this film is one of the best just like some people said.This film showed the love could occur in different situations and even between different species. There's nothing to consider when it comes to true love. I might think like that if I'm into love stories and such those things.There were basically two main things I don't like. One was the completely naked scene and the other was sex scenes. As for me, my aunt is kind of conservative, so, I was lucky that I didn't watch this film with her. I watched alone. Thus, no one could scold me about I'm watching films with adult contents. I prefer if there were no such scenes.All in all, this film is on average. If you are kind of into love stories and true love those kind of stuffs, this film could be a good one for you. But as for me, it was just normal film. So, 6 stars only.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Part Cold War and part Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Shape of Water is a beautiful adult fairy tale","Today's movie deals with a love between a human and a monster. Many should immediately shout, ""Beauty and the Beast!"", as that's the most well known fairy tale of that same kind of love. When you come down to it, it's seen as bizarre, considering that it's practically two different species that have declared a love between each other. It's a connection that falls off the radar, but you could argue we have connections to a lot of things that are not human. Children love their electronic video games. Pet owners love their dogs. What's different is that those connections are not romantic, but rather mutual.Cinematically, we've gotten a lot more love stories between creatures then we realize. Shrek had an ogre in love with a human. Splash had a man in love with a mermaid. But the biggest example, oddly enough, are monster movies (more specifically, the universal monster classics). Dracula, The Mummy, and even the Phantom of the Opera pushed the boundaries of the connection that love is. The biggest example, though touched lightly, was The Creature from the Black Lagoon. Though I can't say it's a full remake, The Shape of Water seems to tell a story about a gill man who makes that connection with a human woman.It's the early 1960s. Elisa (played by Sally Hawkins) is a mute woman who lives a quiet life, working as a janitor for a government research facility in Baltimore. Her two friends consist of neighbor Giles (played by Richard Jenkins), a closeted gay man who teaches her about old music and film, and coworker Zelda (played by Octavia Spencer) who is also her sign language interpreter for their employer. Her life is changed when colonel Richard Strickland (played by Michael Shannon) brings in a creature he captured in South America.When Elisa comes to clean the room the ""asset"" is, she sees that it's a gill man. She starts to bring it food and even music to show that she means no harm. Slowly, the two become friends as they connect without ever speaking (considering that Eliza is mute and the gill man can't speak). Things look bleak as Strickland, obsessed with the cold war, want's the creature dissected and studied for the space race. At the same time, Soviet spies want the creature destroyed so the U.S. can't get ahead. The race is on to see if Eliza can outwit both sides of the war for her love.While there does seem to be similarities to Creature from the Black Lagoon, I can assure your that The Shape of Water is not only a different film, but a pretty good one to beheld. It's strengths lie within it's story and cast. Despite being very cold war orientated, this story has a fairy tale quality to it. It's director Guillermo del Toro directed a similar project called Pan's Labyrinth, but the goals were similar; to bring tales of beauty and hope within dark times.The Shape of Water is a love story first, and while I won't spoil anything, I can guarantee that I really wanted to see our two characters live together. You really feel for Eliza (who Sally Hawkins is phenomenal as playing), who is figuratively and literally a silent character waiting for her moment to present her voice. That all comes within the gill creature, whose effects are not only amazing (an example at how practical and CGI can work together), but you get a lot of personality from him. He's shy, but open to trying new things. He's a lot like a powerful child who is learning about the human world. These two do make a great couple.Even the cold war elements are really good. The film smartly presents both sides as wrong...yet with people that do want to see good come out. This is also a secret I'll let the film reveal, but it makes me realize how black and white many modern movies about Soviets usually are.I'll say now that The Shape of Water also happens to be a sexual story. I can see a lot of people turned off by this and simply too weird of a love story, but the movie makes it palatable enough that people should see through it's inner beauty.I'll give this nine gill men out of ten. It's definitely a well written, well acted, well designed, and well directed. Fans of Guillermo del Toro, monster stories, and fantasy will like this. Will mainstream audiences get into it? It's hard to tell, but if people can love a beast from Beauty and the Beast, I don't see why they can't also love this gill man. Go see it, and find out if this story of silent beauty floats.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"🍷 🍕 Sunday, March 4, 2018...and the Best Picture goes to The Shape of Water!","Are you a movie fanatic?Are you a movie lover?Are you a hopeless romantic?Are you a dreamer?Do you enjoy films that clearly define good versus evil?Do you wish to inspire our youth to do great things?The Shape of Water is the fulfillment of all these inspirational beliefs. The scenery brings us back to a past time in our lives when life was simpler and hidden secrets were in abundance. The screenplay was written by Guillermo del Toro and Vanessa Taylor. Their screenplay is both creative and at the same time haunting.The cast was perfectly matched. Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito a mute cleaning lady whose partner at work is none other than 2012 Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer who plays cleaning lady Zelda Fuller. These two ladies clean all day mopping up urine from the men's bathroom floor at a government run top secret facility in Baltimore. After work, they go home where Zelda cooks and cleans for her lazy no good husband, and Elisa spends her evenings alone in her bathtub pleasuring herself to the beat of an egg timer.Then in walks Richard Strickland (played menacingly and true to form by Michael Shannon) with his 3 foot electric prodding cane, and a water contraption that contains some type of amphibious creature that can swim and live in both salt water and stand upright on dry land. Richard Strickland brings this strange beast to the Baltimore facility for scientists such as actor Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Doctor Robert Hoffstetler can study and examine the beast.One very interesting character that I cannot fail to mention is actor Richard Jenkins who plays Giles, Elisa's co-tenant who both live upstairs from the local Orpheum theater. Giles character is lonely, he is a gay man, a commercial artist with great talent, but apparently without a bright future due to some previous drinking problem. Giles friendship with the mute Elisa is sincere and loving as they both are two lonely individuals looking for something more from life. Richard Jenkins character Giles, has some of the best one-liners I have heard in a long time. One such one liner was ""don't play with the cats"". You will have to see this wonderful film to appreciate Giles hilarious and timely comments.When Elisa has an opportunity to meet the amphibious creature while cleaning the facility she immediately forms a bond with the creature. They communicate by hand gestures and by heart felt facial expressions which eventually lead to a romantic relationship. Michael Shannon's role as Richard Strickland is a take no prisoners type of character and he plays a despised overseer of the creature who punishes the creature at will and for his own pleasure.Elisa realizes that if she does not react quickly to free the creature from his captivity he will surely die at the insistence and obstinate hand of Richard Strickland. So we the audience are kept in suspense on how will the meek and mild mute cleaning lady Elisa who has affection for the creature successfully save the creature?I felt the escape plan was executed with great suspense and curiosity and contained some of the best scenes by writer/director Guillermo del Toro's vision that I would be surprised if this film does not win at least six (6) Academy Awards on Sunday March 04th, 2018, Oscar night.Mrs Shullivan and I loved the film, and we were fortunate to be able to see the film with son number 2 and his set dresser girlfriend who contributed in making many of the films scenes so beautifully crafted and matched to both the musical score and the characters constant interactions that also happened to keep a full house of movie lovers in awe of your next Best Picture for 2018 winner.A perfect 10 for 10 score!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Guillermo Del Toro did it again, and this time in a way that speaks not only to his fans, but everyone","At a top secret research facility in the Cold War era America of 1960s, a lowly janitor (Sally Hawkins) forms a friendship with an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity.Also playing, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Stevens, Michael Stuhlbarg, Doug Jones, Nick Searcy et al.Fairy tales are for children, right? Well, no. An adult life is so intricately intervowen with them that it gets difficult to say where the fairy tales end and ""reality"" begins.I am not only talking about mass media, advertisement and promoting industry or such. Seemingly everybody has their own version of How Life Is and How It Should Be in their head which they try to distribute as far and wide as they think they can get away with.Considering that fairy tales are everywhere, it is only suitable that one of this Oscar season's biggest and best reviewed movies, ""The Shape of Water"", is a fairy tale too. Movie industry has always been about selling us dreams, and this golden figure is its highest and most prestigious accolade.It's rated R for sex, profanities and violence, and has quite a surprising amount of each, but aside from that, it would not go ""over the head"" of some younger viewers too. Because above all, it's a simple story well told, and for its delicious visual style, understandable and easily digestible for widest possible audience.Not that I suggest this kind of sex and violence to children - but on the other hand, what exactly here would be new and shocking to them?Given how delicious and majestic it all looks, it comes as a slight disappointment that the story is so straightworward.The main author, co-writer and director Guillermo Del Toro, is playing with some powerful symbols - water, the sea, amphibian creatures, oppressing regime - but as usual, he's satisfied with how everything looks and fits together, not interested to guide us somewhere deep. He's always been a visual kind of storyteller, so here he delivers in spades.Even the first scene depicting sunken apartment looks nothing short of breathtaking and makes one want to see him directing a possible ""BioShock"" movie (a loved videogame which begs to be translated on cinema screen). How ""Water"" looks would be such a great blueprint for it. Every frame looks like a painting, or something.The only thing I really found lacking is the awful pronounciation of Russian language on screen. Given how many instructors and teachers work for movie industry to make things on screen look and seem more authentic, it's horrible to see some things still stay the same.Or wouldn't the general audiences ""buy"" the Russian language which sounds like the real thing, just like Nigerian prince type of scam letters are supposed to be written in horrible English?But it's not just all about pretty pictures. Luckily for us, whatever depth the story may lack, has been compensated with emotion encapsulated by the performances.I see no need to talk about these in length, because every major player is doing his/her usual - Hawkins is quirky and lovable as always, Jenkins endearing and a bit eccentric as always, Shannon intense and towering tour de fource as always. You can be sure that they deliver. Which is great considering that many of the scenes were filmed in front of empty green screen, with digital objects added later.But the amphibian creature motion capture acted by Doug Jones is the real star here - such an attention-grabbing mix of human and alien attributes, all these little sounds he makes and all. The movie would be poorer if the centre of the show was not as successfully realized as it is. I loved him!In conclusion, it's a quite captivating fairy tale for adults, filled with dark themes as the fairy tales have always been. ""The Shape of Water"" celebrates all that we have always loved in mainstream cinema - emotion, visual artistry, mix of old-fashioned and modern - and as such is a perfect frontrunner for Oscar season indeed.By the way, it's quite rare for a movie to get nominated for 13 Oscars as ""The Shape of Water"" did. It has only happened nine times before (there are also three movies that were nominated for 14).I have a gut feeling that ""Water"" will get its awards mostly in ""technical"" categories such as best director, sound editing, sound mixing, production design, and cinematography - as opposed to best movie, original screenplay, or acting categories.And this would be OK, because this year's nominations are a tough bunch indeed, and I'd be sad to see ""Ebbing"" lose for example.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Some People Are Missing the Boat,"When it comes to Del Toro, we know we are going to get a dose of weird. We will also get some fine filmmaking.

For some reason, it is decided by the evil military complex that this fellow be destroyed. The Russians fear that somehow survival of the creature puts them in danger, so they want him done in as well.

Fairy Tale for Adults,"With ""The Shape of Water,"" Guillermo del Toro has crafted a wondrous fairy tale for adults. Many are saying it's not as good as ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but I didn't much care for that movie and liked this one much more. It's anchored by a marvelous and silent performance by Sally Hawkins, as a mute cleaning lady in a government installation during the Cold War who falls in love and tries to rescue a strange, amphibious being who is wanted by both the American and Russian governments. She's aided in her efforts by gay next door neighbor Richard Jenkins and work partner Octavia Spencer. It's notable that the three principal characters are people pushed to the fringes of society because of various things ""wrong"" with them from the perspective of 1960s America: being handicapped, being gay, being black. That a rag tag group of disenfranchised misfits dare to go up against the government and military establishment of a world superpower gives the film both a tremendous rooting interest and mirrors what's happening right now in American culture, in which groups who previously had no voice in the cultural conversation are now being heard loud and clear.The one thing I did not like about this movie is what it chooses to do with its villain, played by...who else?...Michael Shannon. I guess he's meant to represent the white establishment, but del Toro and Shannon take the character too far, turning him into a nightmarish psycho, when really the story would have been more interesting if the villain had remained more of a faceless institution rather than one single crazy dude with a score to settle. del Toro also can't resist the urge to peddle in gratuitous and graphic violence, most of it connected to Shannon's character, and which doesn't really serve any purpose other than to pull the audience out of the movie. The film doesn't need it and would have been better without it.Still, even with its flaws, ""The Shape of Water"" is a visually absorbing and evocative beauty and the beast tale with one foot planted in old Hollywood and the other in our current unsettled times.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bizarre adult fairy tale love story,"It's the 60s, the era of Cold War. The Americans are living their dream, while at the same time fearing the nuclear bomb and the Red Threat. Spy game is in full bloom and both of the great nations are vying for technological supremacy. In the midst of this, a most curious specimen arrives at a space research laboratory in Baltimore. A being unlike anything seen by modern science. But curiously it's the mute cleaning woman, who best seems to understand this beastman.Guillermo del Toro has always traveled down his own path. In fact, I'm unsure whether he even knows the main path exists at all. With The Shape of Water he returns back to the genre of adult fairy tales. Quite like his previous film, Pan's Labyrinth. And truth be told, these two films have much in common. Both feature female characters struggling between two worlds, those of myth and reality. In both the myth offers an escape both from the fears and horrors of the real world. In both it's the reality that reveals itself to be the source of true evil.That being said, there are differences. The setting is quite different, changing war-torn Spain for Cold War United States, though both of these locations are treated with a critical and nostalgic touch, although the films don't forget to have a smile every now and then either. And whereas Pan's Labyrinth was told through the eyes of a child protagonist, reflecting and talking about the fears and challenges of childhood, The Shape of Water has as its main character a woman. A sexually frustrated, lonely woman. And the film reflects that quite nicely. It's a risque film in many respects and I doff my hat to del Toro for having the guts to go all the way.It's also a beautifully acted film. Sally Hawkins is marvelous, especially having to play a mute person. Yet her soul is laid bare in front of us and we struggle alongside her through her hardships and victories. Michael Shannon as Colonel Strickland gives a great performance as well and I do feel he was slightly snubbed in not getting an Oscar nomination.If I was forced to choose, I would say Pan's Labyrinth is the better film. But it's a minute difference. The Shape of Water is a beautiful, thoughtful film that shows del Toro to be one of the best storytellers of our time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An Honest Review,"My girlfriend and I called it ""the Fish F***er Movie"" and that is really what it is...but it's also green, very, very green.Ever wondered how Abe from Hellboy had sex? Well this movie explains it.But honestly, it isn't bad. It's a total period piece. It's beautiful, I mean it is very beautiful, and it has a story.But, yeah, the thing about it is that it's beautiful AND has a story. The English Patient, Brokeback Mountain, they were just beautiful and beauty alone with no story behind it is boring. The Fisk F***** Movie had both.And, yeah, the story is something we are used to. It was the good, friendly monster that had to be rescued by the mean nasty government plot and, especially if you are a child of the 80s, it works. It's a plot that we've seen over and over again...only in kids movies.This Fish F***er movie, the plot is made for adults, so less adventure and fart jokes and a lot more beauty slightly deeper issues, issues that equate homosexual and racial issues to being the outsider that matters...in the right way. Not the immature and racist way that we see in Black Panther and Get Out......so it's refreshing to see that handled subtly and politely and still make the point.Subtle and polite hardly go hand in hand with a serious point now days.The Shape of Water was able to hint at a point, still entertain, and, well, do it in a way that was so beautiful it was mesmerizing.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I wasn't convinced.,"So I decided to watch this movie after hearing all the hype surrounding it, and I have to say I wasn't completely taken away by it... let alone convinced of the love connection between the amphibious man and the mute leading lady Elisa. The acting was well done and graphics visually pleasing, but that's all I really liked about this movie. It was a neat story but by the end I found myself asking, ""Was the amphibious man really in love with the mute woman, or taking advantage of the situation?"" Think about it, Elisa was mute and the amphibious man was mute so yes she connected with him in that sense, but other than that, it was just her telling everyone how much she loved him and we were supposed to believe it. I think there's two types of Romance movies- one being where the characters tell each other how much they love each other and you're supposed to buy it, and two being where the characters express their love for one another with words AND actions. I feel like showing says more than saying. Take La La Land for example, both Sebastian and Mia made the ultimate sacrifice for each other in the name of love. Overall this was an entertaining movie to watch, however I've seen more plausible love stories.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Life is made of the shipwreck of your plans.""","In brief, with Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, it's like how you might see a hacky critic say it: I laughed, I cried, I watched the other (first) awesome Doug Jones, and witnessed one of the most gorgeous and moving films of my lifetime. Maybe one of those isn't the usual thing, but you get what I mean.Longer: Del Toro is a filmmaker so engaged with how people make choices in stories and how the world around them and what is inside them is sometimes at odds and other times really not so, and how that steers a story in a particular direction. Fantasy is often his vehicle and it's to the point where he is so engaged with it that he deals with it directly as reality, or at least he gives it that texture; this is a film where reality and fantasy coalesce into something that is so tactile, pure, wondrous and it's unlike something you've seen before while being reminiscent of many things you've seen before. Pan's Labyrinth was one such way of going about that, and The Shape of Water belongs into that pantheon of a master working with a sharp focus on what he wants and having the cast and craftsmen to pull off his vision.The movie may belong to a lot of actors actually - Michael Shannon's sympathetic and yet hateful ""big bad wolf"" in this aquatic 60's cold-war spy-tinged fairy tale; Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian agent who actually has a lot of concern for science and what this creature could mean past its ""icky"" insides; Octavia Spencer as someone who on the surface appears to be the chatty best friend type (not unlike in a movie that might have come out in the 50's and 60's, whether she would have been played by a black actress I don't know, possibly not), and has to endure the same kind of racism mixed with sexism as nearly all women then; Richard Jenkins, getting many award nominations and deserves them all, as a closeted artist who is not defined by his sexuality (his hair is as much of importance as who he finds attractive, or his cats) - but, with all those noted, it's the Sally Hawkins show. She commands this with a face that is warm and inviting and a little quirky (maybe like a more tolerable Amelie, I'm sure silent comedians or Giuleta Massina from Fellini's films works in there too), and when she listens to people not like her or the typical-to-1962 worldview she's curious and definitely not dismissive. Oh, and she pleasures herself too, so the sexual active part is not submerged, so to speak.So when this Amphibian Man character, the most creative homage to Creature from the Black Lagoon since that film came out, is engaged by her, it's not like some kind of thing that's too overly quirky or about their differences (so, as good as this movie was, it's not Starman for example). It's about two outsider souls coming together, physically and emotionally (but, at times, certainly physically, though the most, uh, tasteful depiction one might care to see), and how the world around them is... well, it's a fish-man, kill it with fire! Actually, that's how it would have been in the previous generation, and Del Toro knows this. Moreover, he connects that to the political temperature of the period, which is, frankly, a mood that is not unlike at all what we have now. It's a distinctly American story too, and coming from a Mexican filmmaker that's not to be underestimated.But what makes The Shape of Water so remarkable, among the towering pieces of cinema this decade, is how seemingly effortlessly the emotion runs through this thing, and how Del Toro and his cinematographer and production designer and composer Alexandre Desplat and Doug Jones and so on, manifests that in total cinematic terms. He brings us through every step like a storyteller should to get us to empathize with most of these characters and even, dare I say, understand and see Shannon's guy as a tragic figure, the ""All-American"" who's been force-fed a lot of garbage and not only accepts it but wants to live up to it (a scene where his boss explains what decency means to him is the most 2017 scene that will ever be, but extends past that).This is a world that is not all wholly original and doesn't pretend to be - Hawkins and Jenkins live above a movie theater for (Fish-Man) God's sake - but it's sincere in a way that other filmmakers might have found cheaper, or even to the point of not trusting (or simply seeing at all) an actress like Hawkins can be this person. This is beautiful work on all the levels a piece of cinema should be, alive and provocative politically, romantically, in gender, in just how to LIVE in this world with one another. And, maybe, how to look at how we view ourselves in relation to God, or Gods or whatever.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Thrilling, Touching and Surreal Exploration of the Heart; Both Human and Monster","To be seen and desired for who we truly are; it is the passionate wish of many. For Elisa, an unassuming and kind-hearted maid in a 1960s era government lab, this wish is granted in an unusual way. Virtually invisible and isolated, yet content in her little bubble, Elisa is lured from this comfort zone as she witnesses the arrival of a strange, monstrous sea creature in the lab. Despite warnings to keep her distance, Elisa sympathizes with the suffering creature. It is in chains and tortured by Strickland, a sadistic and violent government agent. This wild creature is impulsive. It responds to aggression with the same, and to kindness with kindness. As the cruelty of Strickland escalates, Elisa decides she must act to save the creature. Friendly and opposing forces emerge from unlikely places to help or hinder her. Love and light hinge on the erratic hearts of monsters and humans alike.This thrilling, touching and surreal film explores the many forms and aspects of monsters. The worst monster of them all is the human heart, and yet it is also the most kind and beautiful. The film offers apt encouragement to speak up and act when others are in trouble and in pain. In this world of rising fascists who peddle hatred and opposition to science, art, sympathy and basically to all humanity, such encouragement is sorely needed.With expressive eyes and strong empathy, Sally Hawkins is amazing and mesmerizing in her portrayal of Elisa. Michael Shannon is perfectly cast as the crude, cruel, sarcastic and controlling Strickland. In Strickland's sinful, selfish and negative world, the monster is better off dead. The supporting cast is wonderful. The film is full of depth and splendor. The Southern United States is the setting, yet the film was shot in Toronto. The theater that appears prominently on screen is the very same theater (the Elgin) in which I saw the film at the Toronto International Film Festival. I went into the theater with high hopes and was not disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

They just drag, the storytelling doesn't make any sense and the sex scenes seem awkward as heck. I mean, why did they have to fill this time?

Top-Notch Effects and Wonderful Acting Carry the Shape of Water,"Even when I haven't been in love with Del Toro's past work the guy knows how to create wonderful environments and atmosphere. The window dressing in this movie is gorgeous. The sets look real, yet they have enough style to draw your attention. From the apartment to the government facility, there was never a point where something wasn't eye-catching or visually impressive. This is always the highlight of Guillermo's films for me, there's always a great sense of style that brings a unique edge. I haven't even touched on how Amphibian Man (Doug Jones) great as a character looks. He does have some similarities to Abe Sapien but he still has enough different aspects to be a completely new character. This movie is worth seeing just for how creative and lavish the visuals in this movie are.I also thought the setting of the movie added to making it tenser. The movie takes place during the Cold War and the movie benefits from the tension that they play with. Anyone could be a double agent and I dug how they handled the character of Dmitri. They even had good small touches with posters in the background saying things like Loose Lips Sink Ships. The Shape of Water also has some surprisingly suspenseful scenes and some gory violence. Something like that could have felt tacked on but it gave me something to focus on when other parts of the movie weren't working for me.The other amazing aspect of this movie was the acting. Everyone across the board brought their A-game. Sally Hawkins was great as Elisa, there was so much subtle work in her performance. She conveys so much through her body language and there were some risky choices with her character that she nailed. Richard Jenkins was also phenomenal as Giles. He gives a very quiet but impacting performance. Michael Shannon is great as the villain, he borders on being cartoonish without falling into chewing the scenery. I also really liked Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Hoffstetler. He was one of my favourite parts of Men In Black 3 and he's a really strong character actor when he's given good material. Octavia Spencer was solid, but I wish she had been given more to do than act like Octavia Spencer. Doug Jones was also really good, he has to do a lot under all that makeup, but he still gets the job done.The only thing that fell flat for me was the romance between Elisa and Amphibian Man. Unfortunately, this is one of the big aspects of the movie, so I couldn't just shove it aside. I liked both of their characters, but the movie was obviously going for a Beauty and the Beast vibe and it was just not working for me. I know that I'm in the minority on this and I still enjoyed the movie outside of it, but it did distract me enough to avoid giving this a higher grade.I also had a real mix of emotions about the ending. I don't know if I would have chosen to go another way, but they go with a crowd-pleaser instead of something a little more realistic. I agree with other user reviews on here that it seems like it was going for more of a fable/fairytale feeling but it also came off as a little sappy to me. There are movies that need to have a happy ending so maybe Guillermo decided that The Shape of Water was one of those.The critics have adored this movie and I can see why. This is a film-buff movie, there's more than a few scenes paying homage to classic movies. I think that people will enjoy this regardless even though it does run a little long. I couldn't buy into one of the bigger aspects of the plot but I still highly recommend this movie. What it gets right, it does so with flying colours and it is worth seeing just for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An underwater masterpiece,"This review of The Shape of Water is spoiler free**** (4/5)FROM PAN'S LABYRINTH, through Hellboy, via The Devil's Backbone to Crimson Peak, throughout his filmography Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has always had a way with creating intricate storylines with a simple character you can route for from start to finish. He's always had a way of layering his stories like an onion; firstly there's the simple opening - this can be the lead character or the narration of the story. Secondly there's the development of the character. Then there's the technical stuff; what the film looks like, what kind of visuals there are and what the storytelling entails through the visuals. And lastly there's the intricate ending whether its open ended (the first Hellboy) or it's closed ended (most of his others). This, essentially has given the Mexican native a career that's unlike most other directors, plus he can't be the only director out there who makes fairytale romance and horror work. Previously it was his gothically enchanting creep-fest Crimson Peak, there he went the supernatural route when a woman fell in love with a ghost. With his latest The Shape of Water he has achieved something on the level of La La Land; here he has made a beautiful, delicious and truly magical love story, which is as much of a paean to the world of cinema as it is a visually stunning, beautifully shot love story. One that takes you on a mesmerising ride from start to finish. 
 
We start with the simple route in the story; Elisa (Hawkins) is a mute woman who makes her living, working as a late-night janitor at a secret government facility in Baltimore during the Cold War in the early 1960's. At first, she's isolated living in an apartment above a cinema, and the only person she has for company is her neighbour (Jenkins), a has-been advertising artist who is her friend and confidant if she ever feels lonely. Her life revolves around watching old musicals, however despite the war setting there's only a tiny glimpse of war on a TV screen, and that's pretty much it other than that image war never makes an introduction through this story. Like in his other films, and his well-rounded characters here he wants to keep reality firmly at the bay (or in this case the water). But reality isn't an option with del Toro, there's always something that takes his storytelling to a level above reality, and this one is no exception to his fairytale storytelling. Elisa's life is seemingly at a dead-end, constantly working the same shift until the scientists find a mysterious amphibious creature, which looks like a mutant experiment between that creature off The Black Lagoon and Hellboy's Abe Sapien, and she slowly starts to fall in love with the creature. 
 
And it's here where the story shows off its true blue-ish colour. Like Pan's Labyrinth before it, this one is visually stunning, it's beautifully shot (a stunning shot of the creature coming out of his pool doesn't go without a mention), its inertly sweet, warm-hearted and charming. Through every moment his story is absorbed by exceptional performances, however full praise here goes to Hawkins who dazzles as the mousy mute lead. Also like Labyrinth, The Shape of Water has its darker routes; here we have Michael Shannon playing as ruthless G-man Agent Strickland, who sees the creature as a freak that must be tamed right away. He does anything to see his asset get hurt in vicious ways, and does anything to stop his escape. 
 
Of course you have to credit del Toro's imagination who keeps the story strictly romantic (a standout shot of Elisa seducing the creature) and it truly works on that side up until the end. Sadly, The Shape of Water isn't as good as it should've been it doesn't thoroughly work throughout and as much as it's imaginative storytelling follows original spates, there are moments where the storytelling falls to repetition of del Toro's other fables. Still, the film is a truly enchanting, mesmerising and magical one, that won't be forgotten any time soon. 
 
VERDICT Stunning visuals and enchanting storytelling bring del Toro's heart-warming and charming adult fairytale romance to life thanks to a dazzling performance by Hawkins and excellent production design.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good arthouse fun, but not all that great of a film","This is very much an arthouse film. For you young guns out there, all I mean by that is that this movie will be appreciated more by cinephiles. It has enough plot structure to be enjoyed above the surface, but it's really looking for the focused to dive into the deep end to find the subtleties and metaphors about. I don't find this to be a masterpiece of storytelling, but let's simply look at its elements by themselves.The story builds up Sally Hawkins' deaf character's mundane routine as a janitor at a research facility for about the first 20 minutes. Although del Toro's directing is at its most prominent, it also could've been shortened down a bit-especially when you consider the story that still has to be told. Also, to backtrack a bit, the very opening sequence is absolutely phenomenal-but anyways. Soon, a mysterious creature led by the always-evil Michael Shannon is transported to the facility for some testing. While everyone views it as a monster that has to be taken care of in some way or another, Hawkins starts to see the other side to the amphibious creature. I don't think they ever specify what it is, but for all intents and purposes, let's call it a merman. To avoid spoilers the plot follows this thread for a little over halfway, then it switches over to a different type of plot to finish the film out. Basically, it switches the main objectives of what needs to be done, and with the time it takes to properly develop each of these story elements, some of the added stuff I feel should've been cut down more: namely, the opening montage and actually getting to the reveal of the creature, and eating some lovely nasty pie at the shop (but I'm sure Richard Jenkins needed the boosted screen time to put him contention for a best supporting actor nod).Speaking of Jenkins, the characters are mostly good. Jenkins fills his role admirably, Hawkins is obviously amazing, Shannon is just playing the role he always plays, and Octavia Spencer turns in a great supporting role as Hawkins' janitor friend. But with the exception of Hawkins, everyone is still second fiddle so that the merman can shine. The characters are all interesting and all developed, but they fill the necessary gap and not too much more. And in the hands of Pan's Labyrinth (and Pacific Rim, but that doesn't help the guy here) del Toro (who also wrote), the fantastical mythicalness of the merman shines through. It's really quite a spectacle that fits perfectly within his realm

The best movie Oscar is in good hands!,"So let's start. What a movie, ladies and gentlemen! When you go to watch a movie by Guillermo Del Toro you already know what awaits you: originality, a beautiful, well written, strange and well directed film. Well, this movie has it all and more! The film so beautiful, not only by aesthetics, but also by history, is an elongated poem that talks about differences and about everything love.
Guillermo Del Toro, my friends, is the mind behind it. He has already stood out for other films like Pan's Labyrinth and Crimson Peak, but this one managed to put a title that will never be taken from him: Best director of 2017. Nothing more than deserved did an incredible job, as in all his films.
The actors in this film were chosen by the finger, they are the face of the characters, certainly was the best choice of cast. Richard Jenkins, Sally Hawkins and even the fish Doung Jones did a great job.

"Del Toro's new moving, thrilling romantic fantasy","If I was to tell you about Guillermo Del Toro's new film what would I say.As the father of dark fantasy, Guillermo Del Toro knows how to bring alive the illusive wonderlands and nightmares we can relish and transform them into wonderful poignant crafts of insight and meaning, and The Shape of Water is no exception. With its journey from Venice to Toronto, The Shape of Water has now hit the London Film Festival, now within reach of this exuberant critic. I had only the budget to see one film at this year's festival and I most certainly made a wise decision.During the Cold War conflict of the 60s, a mute but hearing Eliza (Sally Hawkins) works as a cleaner at a secret government facility, where she becomes drawn to the new specimen: a mysterious marine creature (Doug Jones). While Eliza begins to fall in love with it, the facility head Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), only desires to take the creature apart for experimental advantage against the Russians. Eliza's bond with the creature soon begins to effect those around her: her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins), work college Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and scientist Robert Hoffsteder (Michael Stuhbarg) What is amazing profound about Del Toro's latest work is its eccentric visualisation in reflection of the political and social conceptions of the past , but also today. The most centralised end is the the treatment of those who are different. Directly dealing with the fantasy of other species but intertwined with racial treatment relevant to the time in which the film is set, and then of course against the back drop of the national conflicts, but then also the value of those with deficiencies, as portrayed by Sally Hawkins.More distant from his darker tones in, Pan's Labyrinth, and Crimson Peak, but not far from the surreal fantasy, The Shape of Water becomes more grounded than previous Del Toro films, and diversely more lighter and funnier. With frequent laughs and jokes on screen, the romantic fantasy is a much light hearted watch, of course not without its moment of bloody violence but at a lower volume. What may be hard for some audiences to get their head around, is this idea of an inter-species relations and with the astonishing design of the creature itself becomes something more than just a fish costume. The bond and sexuality of this romance is a significant thread to the film and is one that featured heavily with its repetitive moments of adult content. But what Del Toro explores its is real beauty in love and within the context of the film it does becomes something remarkable.Sally Hawkins is exceptional in her vigorous performance as the mute Eliza, with dynamic sign language and spirited facial expressions, we see the isolated heart of the ""princess without voice"" which makes her connection to this solitary creature all the more real. Opposite her is the confident physical actor Doug Jones, manning the rubber suit of the creature in a brilliant bodily performance, outdoing his previous collaborative performances with Del Toro. Then Michael Shannon sensationally brings the real monster to the tale in Strickland, the dominating Colonel facing his battle in masculinity as well as with the creature. Shannon gives one of the best performances of his career, keeping with that classic fairy tale juxtaposition of man being the real monster.As with all Del Toro's dark fantasies, it all becomes about the characters. Eliza reaching out to another like herself. Strickland trying to maintain his power and masculinity in his skirmish with the creature and Eliza. Hoffsetider being caught between to sides but seeking his own right, and Giles trying to find his significance back in society.As never fails with a Del Toro films is the signature production design that brings to life these magnificent worlds. The Shape of Water although is not full Del Tory fairy tale land, does have a very extraordinary construct of the real world, from Eliza's apartment to the secret facility, echoing the true Gothic universe of the real world. Opening in a momentous title sequence, Del Toro literally floods the screen in ravishing visual effects and segments. Only more so combined with the inescapable talents of cinematographer: Dan Laustsen, swiftly moving from one room to the next in a mythical immersive experience alluring us furthermore into the depths of the story and art work of the film.The Shape of Water is a wonderfully weird, quirky, heart-warming, extraordinary piece of cinema. For fans who have found Del Toro's previous works too dark or scary, will be delighted by this much more charming fantasy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An immersive sci fi film soon to become a classic,"This is about a deaf mute cleaning lady learning to communicate in secret with gentle giant of a creature being experimented on and tortured by a US government agency.She pities the way he is treated and that leads to displays of kindness and affection that are returned by the monster.It is a lavish production with a few twists and turns along the way; it is suitable for all. I think it will become a classic before long.A wonderful bonus was the way the two leading ladies played off of each other.Truly a delightful film.At my screening there was a very memorable Q&A with the director that I would like to share.There were some rather technical questions about Japanese influences in his film (I will look for when I see it again).The amount of time and effort to make a real (man in a suit) rather than CGI monster and that he financed it out of pocket for more than a year before he got financing from Fox.A question about his colour pallet, and a comparison of his film with Beauty in the Beast from a little girl in the audience who spoke in Spanish.He used this question as a springboard to talk about a few topics that were on his mind. You might know the director is from Mexico and now lives in Toronto. He went on to say that many of the problems in the United States are not the fault of Mexico.Also, that the reason that there is so much conflict in the United States is because it is intentionally being done by the government.It is pulling people apart and making them fight each other, because, it doesn't want people uniting together to go after the real problem, the 1%.He said this to great applause.

Beauty and the Polyester Fish Costume,"As one of the seemingly few people who didn't like Pan's Labyrinth, I was not surprised to find myself somewhat bored and unimpressed by The Shape of Water. The cinematography and sets felt overly stylized and the dialogue was incredibly corny for a Del Toro film. I always appreciate the attempt to create something majestic and ethereal in this manner, but this was a production that just missed the mark for me.My biggest disappointment was in the creation of Fish-Man, who looked and moved like an am-dram student in a Kick-Ass costume. It was hard to engage with a love story when one of the participants is so farcically presented. I also found that the development of their relationship was unconvincing and incomplete.I appreciate that there may be deeper symbolism and subtleties that I have missed but I believe that a film needs strong characters and an engaging plot above all else and on that count The Shape of Water simply lacks substance, ironic as that may be.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not misunderstood, just disliked.","There's nothing hidden or secret about the plot if you're paying attention the first time. The amount of praise and hype for this film set pretty high expectations and I wish that it hadn't but it was too late. Parts of the story and some characters were enjoyable but for the most part, it just felt flat and was grossly underdeveloped for the amount of storytelling needed to make me care at all about any of these characters. Everyone fit into a perfect mold for their role in the story. There's not really anyone who feels like a real person, but if you can somehow find yourself connecting to the main character, you might have a shot at enjoying the movie. I did not, and I tried. Not the worst movie I've seen in the last couple years, but in the bottom 10 or so.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I loved this film and it hopefully will get an Oscar.,"The Shape of water will, in a few years, be one of those films that is a classic watch. It really made me feel emotional, there are a lot of characters who develop in natural ways and the whole story is simple yet effective. I will explain why I loved this film and will explain the few things I had a problem with.The pacing of the film is slightly stilted in places. No spoilers but in some scenes there are plot errors that you sit there thinking ""ok how did he know to go to the docks"" or ""why did she not just do that in the first place"".Also the fact that the effects of the creature were practical, while commendable, left me feeling that more was needed CGI wise to make him look a bit more realistic. It's not a major thing for me if the plot has holes and the practical effects look a little shaky but it is a noticeable thing that took me out of the movie a bit which ultimately loses points.The story is just so beautiful. Del Toro's best story since Pans Labyrinth HANDS DOWN. It revolves mainly around a mute woman (Elisa played masterfully by Sally Hawkins) feeling incomplete in her life. Elisa does the same boring things day in day out BUT then happens upon this creature that is her missing piece. I strongly identified with Elisa as, on a personal level, I've felt incomplete at times, as if something is missing and sally Hawkins plays the role so well. The best thing about this film is this charming, unlikely love story that is told so well and with a great deal of emotion.All the actors bring their A game. Michael Shannon is brilliant as the security guy who is himself incomplete and tries to buy his way out of feeling this way. His character is a little cheesy in places like when he tries his scare tactics. They sometimes work and are menacing and other times the dialog feels clique and just copied from any other movie.Octavia Spencer gives a fantastic performance as Zelda. She also is incomplete and uses Elisa as a sort of therapy tool. She talks to her constantly as Elisa can only listen to her problems because she is a mute. He husband doesn't understand her and ignores her half the time so Elisa is doing all the listening which really adds another level to their friendship. This film is a great example of how a great supporting cast can add so much to a story and it added that extra bit of enjoyment to every scene for me.Technical stuff is really excellent and is very much in keeping with the period it is set in. There is a ballroom scene that is shot in black and white and is just wonderful to watch. The cinematography in this is excellent. There are a lot of greens, blues and teal colour pallets used to resemble the sea and the colours water gives off. When we deviate to a sub plot the colour seems to change giving me a sense of tonal shift that is just really interesting to note and separates the different characters from their respective plots.The 1950's/1960's music is brilliant and it help create the cold war atmosphere that this film is set in. It has a distinct theatrical theme that presents the romance as something that is ""straight out of the movies"" and a romance that is just time less. Again going back the ballroom scene as a prime example of the way Elisa and the creature feel about each other. The music swirls all around like they are both swimming in one another's feeling for each other.Needless to say I found this film very emotionally powerful and entertaining. There are points that don't work and it's not a 10/10 but it made me look at my own sense of incompletion. At the end of the day isn't that what art is meant to do? Make you feel and look within to find a sense of self? For that reason this film will always be a favourite of mine. This film deserves at least one Oscar. Really Worth a Watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I only review movies that are excellent or terrible. This was excellent.,"This is phenomenal on a number of levels. It is a bit gritty at times but visuals, characters and plot are all very believable. The style feels like it was made in the 60s. The story comments on a number of social issues and those who diss the movie are probably braimwashed. Selective use of nudity, and not smutty or distasteful but important to drive the plot.

Fish-men likes them mute lovers,"A melancholic, saccharine-infused fairy tale strictly aimed for the mature audience.Mr. Del Toro presents the audience his tribute to the American's technological might during early '60s and prolific pop culture attached to it, but all the while not forgetting that this was also the time when some of the prejudices (racial, homosexuality and communism) pervades. As with that certain tobacco product's slogan during the '70s that says, ""(We've) come a long way, baby."" Yes, indeed, freedom from some of the biases that have already been dismissed as deplorable now, that is. Though, of course, there are parts of the world that are still the exception.Hawkins' impeccable nuanced performance as a mute cleaning lady in a research lab is an astounding feat that is antithetical to the crisp, discernible voices of the supporting players: Jenkins as Elisa's caring, closeted-gay neighbor, Spencer as her candid co-worker/translator and Shannon as a harsh Korean war vet in charge of studying the aquatic creature to whom the unspeaking cleaner would fall for. This film does not have conversations between characters that demonstrate wit and showcase ornate lines of dialogue or verse, but the eloquence of these three distinct marvelous supporting actors make up for it, for there is that certain musicality in the way they speak.What resonates throughout the film that is an abundance of interplaying disparate elements, both subtle and explicit, a sort of visual and emotional poetry, where the set production, the musical score and sound, cinematography, creature makeup, VFX are all first-rate.The significance of Elisa's color choice in clothes, or Giles who can't help but be compelled into buying the Key lime pie at the pie shop, or Strickland mesmerized by the teal-colored Coup de Ville. And then there's that overt exhibition of racism in public contrasted by one of the most underwhelmingly awkward display of harassment ever depicted on screen. Real life issues well-rendered and explored in a fantasy-romantic film that only a director with Mr. Del Toro's flair and objectivity could effortlessly pull off, whether be it forcing the viewers to see the film with a grain of salt especially when it comes to the admiration and acceptance of an unsightly creature as half of a romantic pair or to suspend their beliefs regarding condoning issues as anathematic as bestiality.My rating: A-flat.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
How did this film win best picture Oscar?,"The whole concept of The Shape of Water is bizarre and not in a bad way, It makes you uncomfortable from now and then and it is indeed a film that hits more than one narrative, it's a movie that appeal more for people who are ready to fantasize with it and accept it the way it is, but that doesn't apply for everyone.for me personally I did not like everything about it, It felt like the movie ended in the first act, everything beyond that felt forced and boring.one of the most things i liked about the film is how gorgeous it was, the cinematography is beyond stunning and that's the part that amazed me the most.The one thing that confused me is that this film won against some of the best films I've ever seen in my life and they deserved this win more than The Shape of Water.Get Out, Lady Bird and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri any one of these phenomenal films deserved the win.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enchanting but daft!,"Back in the 1950s we used to see sci-fi movies like THE QATERMASS EXPERIMENT and I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE, shot on desperately low budgets but satisfyingly scary for their time - more than a little daft. THE SHAPE OF WASTER is a 'throwback' to that eraGuillermo del Toro is not new to 'creature features' or, as he would prefer to call them, fairy tales for adults. There are some very adult scenes in this movie - a pity in a way since it excludes the younger audience who would be enchanted by it. The theme is not too far removed from Spielberg's E.T. or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS with Elisa replacing the children captivated (captured, even) by aliens. Michael Shannon's brutal facility chief is the equivalent of the Nazi bounty-hunters in an Indiana Jones adventure. There's also a good-guy professor, and Sally Hawkins has a sassy sidekick in fellow cleaning-lady Olivia Spencer.For all the wondrous CGI and make-up, the Creature is still visibly an actor (Doug Jones) wrapped in plastic. The budget was clearly awesome. I'm not sure that it really deserves to be getting all these Awards and Nominations. I couldn't help remembering all those 1950s sci-fi horrors. Yes, it's a beguiling fantasy romance but it's also totally - epically - daft.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Overrated movie,"I have to admit I wasn't thrilled with this film, and considering the Oscars, I find it overrated. Del Toro made a visually beautiful film however I didn't like the characters and the overall story to me was full of holes and incomplete. One smaller story would start and not end so it bothered me because I missed the ending of the same. Exaggeration and weird things didn't hold water for me either (hahaha). Overall a solid film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A 60's era sci-fi fairy-tale made for today's society,"Set during the 1960's space race in Baltimore, the story is a beautiful sci-fi fairy tale that explores the unexpected love between the mute cleaning lady Eliza (Sally Hawkins) and the mysterious amphibious creature (Doug Jones) trapped at the government facility she works at. When Eliza escapes with the creature thanks to the help from a gallery of colourful characters, we see the bond between woman and creature grow from mutual friends to lovers. And if that sounds like it wouldn't work on film, Guilllermo Del Torro can sell it and make it work.While the story of a mute women falling in love with the Creature from the Black Lagoon sounds simple, Shape of Water is anything but which helps it to speak relevance to today's Trump-age judgmental society. Each character is so wonderfully defined and explored through arcs that relate back to Del Torro's classic narratives about the underdog, persecuted and the silenced. We root for Eliza and the creature's relationship because they both know the feeling of people not understanding who they are. With her voice literally being robbed as an infant, Eliza lives a life of silence and always listening but wants someone who truly looks past her disability. Her routinely morning masturbation tells how she how wishes to be loved both physically and emotionally. Only called ""the Asset"", the creature is an anomaly of nature that also wishes for comfort especially since he was taken away from his native home in the Amazon and forced to be a prisoner and experiment for the US government. Eliza's best friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) lives in a strained relationship with a husband who ignores her at home. This leaves her to talk to about her marital problems to her mute friend who automatically listens. Eliza's neighbour and father-figure Giles (Richard Jenkins) is a failing advertisement artist who feels out of place in the world because of his age and homosexuality. The scientist/Russian spy Dimitri (Michael Stuhlberg) feels conflicted between his home country and the preservation of the Asset when both the Americans and Russians seek its death to each further their agenda in the Space Race. Even the villain Strickland (Michael Shannon) has his own ark. He constantly sees whether they are women, lower class, African American or non-human creatures are beneath him and wishes to be part of what he perceives to be the future of a better America but fears being left behind in the past. These characters struggle with communication in different ways from living in silence, hiding their true selves from a judgmental world, not having their ideas understood or preferring to have others be silent.As expected with Del Torro, his visually stunning colour palette is ever present with each shot of the film. From the wardrobe, the look of the government facility, the vehicles to even the food, green dominates the film reflecting off cool, organic algae and water. With the cinematographer Paul D. Austerberry, he creates long panning shots that move so beautiful and organicly which leads to an amazing dance sequence that would put La La Land to shame. Vanessa Taylor whom has wrote a few episodes of Game of Thrones, has written some of the best work I have seen Del Torro direct.Sally Hawkins is the true standout of this show. While not having to use dialogue (minus that one amazing dance sequence I mentioned), she relies on so much sincere and emotional expressions to really show how her character thinks and reacts. I will say it will be criminal if she doesn't get nominated for best actress next year. This being his 6th film working with Del Toro, Doug Jones as the Asset uses mime-like hand gestures to make the this character feel believable and intelligent with a human-like curiosity and soul. Just like in Hidden Figures this year, Octavia Spencer is just a breath of fresh air to watch and adds so much fun to the scenes. Richard Jenkins nearly steals the show with his dry witted and charming performance as his character Giles. While some may say Michael Shannon is getting type-cast as villains, his performance is a reminder why he is so amazing at it.Guillermo Del Torro I have always loved to watch whether his films are these prestigious art pieces or just fun blockbusters. But Shape of Waters feels like new ground that he has tapped into. At the Q & A for TIFF where I saw the film, the reason for him creating this story was a response to how America's persecution of minorities had risen since the Trump's presidential campaign. This is the most relevant film Del Toro has made and is his best masterpiece since Pan's Labyrinth.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fun retro story with great visuals,"Guillermo del Toro, knocked his newest film, The Shape of Water, out of the park. The film is a magical ride from scene to scene that mesmerizes the viewer with amazing cinematography, beautiful visuals, and an astounding soundtrack. That's not all; the acting in this film is fantastic. Sally Hawkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, Doug Jones, and Richard Jenkins are all amazing in this film, but my two personal favorites were Octavia Spencer and Michael Shannon. Octavia was hilarious in this movie as well as a great supporting character to Hawkins since her character was mute. I thought Shannon did a great job creating a compelling villain. You hated his character for the things he did, but you couldn't help but love watching him.Another thing I loved about The Shape of Water is how it played with genres. It was mostly a sci-fi/fantasy romance, but also included thriller aspects and (spoiler) musical aspects. I always love when films cross genres, and this film does it wonderfully. It is really what makes the film as unique as it is (that and del Toro's style as well).I still haven't discussed the story, which was also fantastic. The plot, which flows very nicely and keeps you entertained throughout, reminds me of an old monster movie turned love story. The film has a strong message about relationships and people who are different, which makes this film very timely. Overall, I loved this film and would recommend this to anyone, since I think that there is something that everyone can take out of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A contemporary fairy tale,"A modern day take on ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" and reminiscent of ""Beauty and the Beast"" without the beauty.

A fairy tale love story that looks stunning and conveys a lot,"Pan's Labyrinth was the reason I became a fan of Guillermo del Toro's work. The Hellboy films were also good but none of his other films came close to the greatness of Pan's Labyrinth. The Shape of Water is so far the closest.The Shape of Water follows Elisa Esposito, a mute woman that works as a cleaning lady at a top secret research facility. One day she finds an amphibious creature being held in captivity there and starts to get attracted to it.Visually, this is one of Guillermo del Toro's best works. The green tint that surrounds the entire world of this film is absolutely beautiful to look at. The camera moves in such an elegant manner and creates a fairy-tale like feeling to the story similar to Pan's Labyrinth. I'm very surprised at the fact that this film only has a $20 million budget considering how professional and gorgeous this film looks. Guillermo del Toro's use of practical effects made the creature's appearance look very real and unique. The film's recreation of the 1960s was also very well done. It was an immersive experience that transported me into its world through the entirety of its runtime. The performances by everyone were excellent. Sally Hawkins gives her best performance here as Elisa. Playing a mute character isn't easy but she pulls it off so well and manages to be a very likeable and interesting character that we care about. Octavia Spencer is very fun to watch. She plays a great contrast to Sally Hawkins' quietness and is great in the role. Michael Shannon is fantastic as always and Michael Stuhlbarg was also great. I really liked Richard Jenkins here as he put forth some of his best work.The story that goes along with it is also very interesting. It plays out like a very strange love story between a woman and a fish creature and I loved what del Toro was trying to communicate. There's the feeling of being incomplete and being an outcast that's felt by all the characters namely Hawkins, Spencer and Jenkins. Even Shannon's character has elements that make him incomplete despite being the most privileged out of all of them. It uses the setting of the 1960s to its advantage to show how the way these people are affect their lives, some of which can still be seen in today's world. As much I love what the film's saying, it does become cheesy by the third act and ends up going down a predictable route.Despite that, The Shape of Water is the best film Guillermo del Toro has made since Pan's Labyrinth. The wonderful performances, striking visuals and compelling social commentary make The Shape of Water a great watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The successes of its conception are flawed in their execution. The performances are solid. Sally Hawkins is a strong lead, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins shine, and Michael Shannon and Michael Stuhlberg play their parts perfectly. Shannon is a great antagonist, he plays creepy repression to a T.My wife hated it and I completely understand why. I liked it.

Sublime cinematic fare,"How incredibly sad that almost every user rating The Shape of Water on IMDB seems to have totally missed what the nature of the film is. It is a cross between a fairy tale, that much loved genre of del Toro, and homage to the ability of cinema both to express such fairy tales and to enhance the life of our imagination by doing so. It is a hugely metacinematic and intertextual exercise, with every scene and every theme alluding to something from the history of cinema, the black and white scene where the mute Eliza breaks into song and dance with the ""asset"" being the culmination of such cinematic homage. The movie is not literal, and a literal reading of it is puerile and dishonest. In cinematic story telling anything is possible: two loners like Eliza and Giles can share genuine friendship and a household. Dimitri the evil Russian is the one who appreciates and wants to save the ""asset"", the almighty all American power guy Strickland rots away at the severed and surgically reattached fingers, while the ""asset"", far from being a monster from the black lagoon, is actually a healer. And the marks on Elisa's neck since childhood are nothing other than a suggestion of her true destiny, to develop gills and live happily ever after in her water world with the ""asset"". There's a million other images I could go into. The colour green/teal distinction, the ever presence of water in every form, the contrast between little people like the cleaning women and the powerful men they work for etc etc. Go watch this movie with your heart open and your prejudices at bay.

Del Toro creates a magical tale about the shape of Love,"What truly makes The Shape of water standout is its treatment and the ingredients making it. It won't be for the first time that someone has chosen to tell a story about a fantasy creature. Yet, what makes TSW different from all the others of its genre is the perspective from which it is told and the things the film-makers have put the focus on.The Shape of Water is primarily a love story between two completely different species who find the connection due to their inability to speak the language of the humans around them. Now that's something new, isn't it? Finding the connection not because of a common ability but a lacking capacity. This is just one of the things where Del Toro has tried to tell the tale from a new perspective. Backed by the old world charm and the beautiful Gothic yet pleasing production design, it all creates a world of fantasy for you that only has a slight resemblance to the world we live in. When the light flows on Del Toro's frames, it is nothing less than a celebration every time.Sally Hawkins' character has so much rigor and strength to it that it almost amazes you to notice that people with a voice even can't bring out that much courage to show up when needed. Her will to save the Amphibian Man and the love of her life is almost empowering.Del Toro and Vanessa Taylor have written the supporting characters also with a heart to it. Though I felt that Octavia Spencer's role was similar to the one she played in 'The Help' but it is Richard Jenkin's character that leave a dent on the audience with his charm and underlying sadness reflecting a life marred by voids. All these characters when come together create a fairy tale effect. I believe that it is loved by the masses because Del Toro at the right places chose to draw the right boundaries keeping the confinement of screenplay to an effective one. You never get bored and even though much isn't said throughout the film, every character stands out with layers to it.

"Romantic fairytale. A bit too much sugarcoated and too little drama for my taste. Lovely movie anyway, but not the masterpiece I expected it to be...","A romancic story with a twisted fantasy plot and a few horror elements mixed in for good measure. A mute cleaning lady saves an alien creature from death and hides it from the government, who wants to kill it. Will she be able to protect the alien from harm?It could have been a big hollywood standard romantic movie, but director Guillermo del Toro mixes in some ingredients usually not found in Hollywood romances, (masturbation, homosexualtity, torture) which makes it only suited for 16 years and older. It could have easily been turned into a movie for all ages though, just like E.T, if the story had been softened a bit. Or it could have been as dark as his earlier masterpiece ""Pan's Labyrinth"", if the director had gone wild with horror, but the director chooses to compromise and now the end result has become a bit bland. Not a great romance, but not a great fantasy horror either. I fear this movie has fallen prey to the mediocre standards of Hollywood, because it wants to please everyone. And it did, because everybody liked it at the oscars.Maybe it was supposed to be funny at certain moments, but it didnt make me laugh really out loud once. But it did put a gentle smile on my face though. The story is a bit slow in the middle, that is its biggest flaw. Half an hour could have been cut out easily, without hurting the flow of the story. I really felt that the story lacked suspense and speed in the middle.Fortunately the ending has got a great climax.

Less than expected,"Given the science-fiction/fantasy premise and the accolades (including a best Picture Oscar), I had very high expectations for this film. I liked the first half, especially the development of Sally Hawkins 's 'Elisa' character and her friends Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda (Octavia Spencer ) but was less impressed by the grimmer second half, which focussed more on Strickland (Michael Shannon) an over-the-top bad guy. I also found the idea that Elisa was having sex with the gill-man faintly ludicrous (although I know that in fetish/furry circles, cross-species sex is highly diversified and inclusive). Despite Guillermo del Toro's imaginative story, the fantastic cinematography, music and excellent design work, the jarring mix of romantic/sexual and whimsical/brutal didn't work for me (but I can see how other people might love the film).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful Film,"I absolutely adored ""The Shape of Water."" I don't typically like romantic movies, but this one is completely out of the ordinary and has a very unique style. Some compare it to ""Beauty and the Beast"", but whereas that story focuses more on bringing the beast up to the level of beauty, this movie has an inverse theme of showing that the ""beauty"" is much more similar to beast all along. A common thread is the cultural backdrop of the 1960s, which allows us to imagine a time where the straight white male had much more societal power. Ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and LGBT all have interesting representation in this movie compared with the portrayal of the main villain of the story, Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), who has a whole plethora of character flaws and is shown to be a very insecure man.The cinematography, lighting, color pallet, acting, script; this movie has all of the great qualities on a technical level as well as being a work of art and shedding some lights on social messages of acceptance. Great movie and one of the best of the 2010s.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Continues The Academy Losing Streak,"While I have to admit I kind of liked this film better than Moonlight last year, I can't believe that this film was even considered for best picture. I am a 77 year old male, and I think this was more a woman's film, as the lady I watched it worth loved it. I never bought into it at all. Maybe it is because I am old enough to have seen ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"" which seemed to be a partial inspiration for this film. I have seen 6 of the nine so far, and this IMO was the weakest. ""Get Out"" was far better, but I guess the Academy wanted to give Guillermo Del Toro his due. The performances admittedly were very good, but I just couldn't take it seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A spellbinding love-story which transcends tradition.,"As if submerged beneath water, this dark, eerie, yet heart-warming fantasy tale engulfs you and your emotions, whilst leading you to reimagine the traditional setting of love and romance. Delivered in his usual occult fashion, Guillermo Del Toro weaves together whimsical fantasy and human sentiment to create a film which attributes the beauty seen in 'Pan's Labyrinth'.This is more than just a story of unlikely love; it's too a story of morality, sacrifice, and human judgement. Although wonderful, the quiet protagonist, Eliza (played by Sally Hawkins) is far from the typical girl next door, Hollywood bombshell. Eliza oozes beauty through her selfless and accepting character, an individual who is loved by those who have learned of her charm and beauty. The fantastical love-story which follows is one of great originality and will leave you warm at heart, despite its unorthodox nature.As well as its story and character development, The Shape of Water triumphs across the board; the 1960s aesthetic provides beautiful backdrop throughout, the extensive use of pathetic fallacy gives that element of adventure and risk, whilst the soundtrack whisks you away to another world, leaving you truly emotional. Neither sad, nor happy. Just full of... something.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
enen,"The story was flat, and the atmosphere felt... Depressed and sad. I don't understand the opportunity to fall in love with Mermaid, Mermaid fall in love with female owners can still understand. Kindness in a trapped animal environment. But where does the heroine like the mermaid to start... Because of what? Of the lonely soul... I don't see an outbreak in my eyes. It looks more like the heroine seduces the intelligent creature of the study period.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wonderful,"Wonderful film with stunning production design, visuals and a captivating plot that has reasonable sequences of thrill and suspense that tells a different version of a love story without being dull.

start as a great movie ends awful,"It was a movie with such a great directing , story and filming some will say the screenplay was predictable but I think in this specific case it shows how the elements of movie can be together in right place and I love music mixed by movie but all these things are good just until the last 10 minutes of movie when you think of just some decisions made by characters is dumb and dialogues are bad too and story ending is shamefully awful for first good parts and I dont think calling a fish creature as god is a good choice. but at all I wanted to give me num 8 or 9 till the last minutes of movie but those minutes made me to give this movie 6 because if a story dont want to ends in the right time and place its better for it not to be written ever.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film that divides opinion - watch it and make up your own mind.,"Look at the ratings, mostly very low or very high. I fall into the camp of people who loved this film. The cinematography is captivating, as is having the lead character never speaking. There's an almost comic book feel to the film, yet with some gore and nudity that delivers a unique experience. I've played computer games that are set in the past but with forward looking technology, and I'm sure many other movies have done the same, and The Shape of Water pulls it off perfectly.
No real twists - no complex plots - just a great story with great meaning, delivered beautifully.
(It reminded a little bit of Pan's Labyrinth).
If you're unsure about the film, then do watch it, because if you turn out to be someone who likes it - the ratings say that you will really love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sappy, Over-Dramatic Pap","I should've been warned. I guess it's too late to get my time back. Cinematography-wise, the film was spot on as was most of the acting. The melodramatic preposterous storyline leaves a lot to be desired, though. The lead's starry-eyed, wistful portrayal was agonizing to bear in parts, actually, through the entire course of the film. Too bad the writer/director didn't explore the elements of racism in the flick. Why introduce it in bits and pieces if it was irrelevant in the first place? Oh well, I supposed my time could've been spent worse at, say, screening a Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt or Leo DiCaprio movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Maybe not film of the year, but still great","Interesting blend of fiction and drama. I liked the diversity which was almost always nicely fitted in and/or added something (if not at the very least not actively ruining the movie, except for that gay scene. Added nothing to the whole movie, wasted a good 5 minutes, other than saying ""aw shucks the 60s sure were racist and homophobic"" which is not the plot of this movie). Main villain was interesting, despite being a wholly hateable character (not like Thanos~~).Very good film, but definitely not what I would've called film of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Michael Shannon at his best,As I always repeat good conflict movies are as good as villain or bad guy is good. If there was no Michael Shannon in this movie it would have been some mediocre love story of a numb female and some water creature. Michael Shannon is a real star here and the others simply create some interesting background to his character.Another thing is time location in 60s where people dress and drive cars from 60s.The story itself is simple. Woman who is unable to speak works as a janitor in a secret research facility. She discovers that some human sea creature is being held there and some experiments on him being performed. Government plans to make it a response for Soviet space achievements. She gets fascinated with the creature mostly because she has difficulty in getting along with people. So she feels accepted and then they get attracted to each other. But this is just a surface. Real story is about the security chief perfectly portrayed by Michael Shannon who is a nowadays Malcolm MacDowell - a person who is partially sane and insane. You never know what he is capable of and what motives drive him.For me plot in this movie was not so much important because Shannon completely stole the movie. And I loved it. I recommend this movie for him.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most beautiful films I've ever watched,"My title says it all.
It's a well thought out story, with few wasted moments... but there are a few.

The music is awesome.
The acting.. wow great performances.

The best worst movie,"The best: The direction and photography are spectacular, clear favorites to take both Oscars. Michael Shannon plays a sublime role. The BSO is the best thing that has been done in years for the cinema. Show that without great lines of dialogue you can get to have a great story that reaches the bottom of each viewer. The interpretation of the secondary characters.The worst: The film takes time to catch pace. The interpretation Sally Hawkins leaves to be desired. The parts that make up the whole do not quite fit, it feels like different artists who have put together their art, not like a complete movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

my illustration of the movie: like a dead mussel, strarting to decompose and stinky but inside containing a pearl. the death had been violent, by film industry conditions.about the pearl: it may be very subjective, i dont care in this case. touching and ibspiring to me in a couple of scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
magical - and obviously the negative reviews here are from the same person,"Beautiful film, ruined only by the pathetic blathering of some troll here who has the intellectual capacity of a turnip. Del Toro creates a fantasy film, one with heart and soul. I have to wonder who this sad person is here that keeps vomiting the same review after review. As for this film being ""PC"" it is not, and of you think it is, you have totally missed the point. Perhaps some White Power group allowed one of their goons to post quasi-political drivel against this film, but the film is still outstanding.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Easy review here,"This movie was different, entertaining, weird and just a bit too long. The lead actress was good and Richard Jenkins was pretty great again. This movie, with some created music for it, would be a phenomenal broadway play. As for a movie, we'll regret giving it best picture but not as much as some years.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A cold war fairy tale,"It is the early sixties and protagonist Elisa Esposito works as a cleaner in a secret government facility in Baltimore. We learn that as a baby she was found by a river bank with wounds to her neck that rendered her a lifelong mute, she can hear but speaks using sign language. One day a Colonel Strickland turns up at the facility with a creature he caught in the Amazon. It is humanoid but aquatic and apparently the native population believed it to be a god. It is believed that study of this creature could give America a lead in the ongoing space race. Strickland treats it cruelly and after it turns on him Eliza and her friend Zelda are told to clean the lab. After that she gradually befriends the creature. Then it is decided that the creature should be dissected... she decides to save it. In a subplot it emerges that one of the scientists is actually a Soviet spy; with orders to discover what he can but more importantly to prevent the Americans learning anything.Those familiar with writer/director Guillermo del Toro's work, particularly 'Pan's Labyrinth' won't be surprised that this film is, at heart, a fairy tale. Like most fairy tales it is also a morality tale. Those from groups considered lesser; the disabled, Eliza; Blacks, Zelda; and homosexuals, Eliza's friend Giles are looked down on... and this ignored and unsuspected. Similarly all-American Col Strickland is clearly the villain of the piece; he may not look it but he is the real monster not the aquatic creature he captured. The story blends genres with elements from classic creature-features, spy thrillers and love stories seamlessly blended; we even get a fantasy song and dance number. The cast is great; most notably Sally Hawkins who gives a stellar performance as Eliza. Doug Jones also stands out even though he was hidden under creature make up and doesn't speak; it is all in the way he moves. The way the story is shot was great; we get a stylised version of the sixties where most things seem to be an unpleasant shade of green. There are some scenes that be bother some viewers with violence, nudity and some sex although none of these are too strong. Overall I'd say that while this won't be for everybody fans of del Toro should definitely give it a go.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful.,"Absolutely beautiful movie. I've seen Guillermo Del Toro's other work and this one is by far my favorite.Put off watching this movie for some time, and I can't believe itJust everything about this movie is pure art. The cast, story, cinematography, and music, make this whole movie come together perfectly. The beautiful sets and cinematography kept me enthralled the whole time. It makes the movie seem almost dream like and beautiful. The score fits perfectly as well.Sally Hawkins performance is incredible. She completely melted into the role. I can't believe she didn't win the Oscar for this movie. I'll admit I hadn't paid much attention to her in other movies, but Shape of Water really showed her acting skills. I went and watched her other movies after. The rest of the cast fit together perfectly as well.10/10 recommend. Great for a rainy day. Del Toro definitely earned his best picture Oscar for this beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
