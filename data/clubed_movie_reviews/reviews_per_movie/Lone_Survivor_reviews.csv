A realism-adjacent action flick with no depth,"You get so many action movies nowadays following familiar formulas that when you watch one of them you know that, just when the good guy is about to be overcome by an overmatching enemy force, the backup arrives and saves him. The formula desensitizes you.But when a movie tries to be based on a real story, the good guys may not come. They do not come in an hour; they do not come in a day; and if they come, they are not invincible. Real problems do not follow formulas. Real life is sobering in its horror.Lone Survivor does not have a very original or interesting premise for an action movie. An assassination mission goes wrong. However, the quality of the cinematography, solid acting and good action is what makes this a good action film.Not a single actor phones it in. Everyone is trying to do their best. The film is also gorgeous. The Afghanistan these guys are in is fake because the entire movie was shot in the United States, but it looks authentic and breathtaking.The action is raw and graphic. Not in guts-on-the-floor kind of way, but falling-down-a-cliff-side kind of way. Again, you can feel the effort put in. Broken ribs and punctured lungs were involved in the making of this movie.There is one giant nasty pink elephant in the room and that's the fact that the main event at the centre of this movie's plot is bogus. Without spoiling too much, a crucial decision is made by these supposed Navy SEAL's and there is just no way this is how that situation played out. Therefore, the story is probably a lie.There is another issue: this mission with its predetermined ending is all there is to the story. No backgrounds are given for the characters, no events other than this mission, and there is barely any examination of their relationships with one another. I remember as a little kid, I wrote a story about an imaginary military mission. I abandoned it because I realised that it can never be that interesting to read because the range of the story is too small. This film is like that. What's worse, the title of this film gives away the ending.But it is a testament to Lone Survivor's quality that, even though it gives almost no background information about the characters, it still manages to make you care about them. And even with the weight of a potential lie at the centre of its plot, the film still manages to be such an interesting watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brutal and realistic, it opens eyes","If there is one thing that this film will accomplish is to make you feel something. I assure you you will not get bored watching it. Now, what you will feel will no doubt be up to you.For myself, I felt mostly rage against a botched mission in an ineffective war. Raytheon should be annoyed that a movie about a mission failed primarily because of communication issues showed their red flashy brand on the comms equipment.I wanted the characters to succeed, to survive, but I could not ignore the fact that they were soldiers being there only to kill an enemy commander. Having all Americans die in slow motion while scores of Taliban died instantly and kind of stupidly didn't help with the empathy. Also showing pictures of dead soldiers with their families with a pathetic American remake of Bowie's Heroes singing in the background at the end of the movie just fueled more rage. People in the field try to carry out their mission and survive, while their deaths become political and mediatic material. I didn't enjoy that.On the other hand, the fights were realistic, the subject based on real events and, outside the pathetism described above, I did not detect a bias towards one side or the other. You will witness two hours of low tech war in all of its horror and stupidity. The actors also play well, although I like Mark Wahlberg in almost everything he does.The story, while showing the preparation, courage and resilience of four soldiers in enemy territory, also showed other things, like the logistical blunders that lead to stupid deaths, over-reliance on technology that doesn't really work as you expect and how choices have consequences on the ground that are beyond the ability of normal courts to understand, whether looking from the legal or moral angle.I liked a lot about the movie how it made you think long after it was over. What would have happened if they just killed the herders? What would have happened if they tied them up, went a bit down, risked a sniper shot at the enemy commander, then just ran? What would have happened if the Pashtuni would have ignored the wounded American or would have killed the Taliban scout force when they came to them? How would the mission have gone if the four guys would have known from the get go that they would be completely alone, with no support or hope for extraction?Overall, a very emotional movie, two hours long, that shows more a general type of heroism than one with a specific purpose. Nicely directed and acted. A bit over dramatic, but then that's to be expected. Worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tour de Force,"The movie is not easy to watch. Right at the beginning you'll some training ""videos"" (more like footage) from the real people that are depicted in this movie. But it will be apparent a couple of moments later, that there is a lot of Death to follow. It's almost a case of what can go wrong will go wrong. And while there are a lot of other outcomes that this could've taken, decisions had been made, consequences had to be taken (upon).What really gets you though are not some clichés about soldiers (and I think this stays as much as possible away from them), but the fact, that this feels as real as it can be, without you actually being in a war. Mark Wahlberg and the other actors have to go through a lot, when ... well you know what hits the fence. And it does hit pretty hard. Not for anyone squeamish, this is fraught with tension ...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Easily the best War Movie since ""Saving Private Ryan"" only an actual story.","If you read the book and heard the interviews with the actual ""lone survivor"" you know that this movie got as close to the real events as possible. The 4 actors really gave it their all. Beginning long before shooting when they started their training so they would look realistic. This movie is also the most visceral experience since ""Saving Private Ryan"". There were falls in this movie that actually hurt more just watching than when I broke my foot 2 years ago. And in the making of you see that crazy stunt people actually did those falls, supposedly without dying. It's of course impossible to spoil this movie given it's title but it's important to note that the guy who helped him risked his whole village for ""The Americans"" Safety. And he didn't think twice about it. Sometimes we forget that not all of them are Taliban. After all is said and done this is a must see if there ever was one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great story,"A truly brutal and gripping cinematic experience, Lone Survivor may be brazenly gung-ho and jingoistic, not to mention somewhat anti-climactic, but it delivers a metric tonne of thrills and contains one of the most intense and bloodiest gun fights I've ever seen in a film. It might stretch the suspension of disbelief a little too much at times, with our heroes surviving not 1 but fatal-looking cliff falls, but the excitement comes from the fact that it puts you right in the action, and you feel everything. Every bullet, every kick, every punch and every single thing the protagonist crash into. It's a bleak as Hell depiction of the savagery of war and just how strong the will to survive truly is. It's not a masterpiece, and many movies have been made with a more complex and compelling message on war, but for its sheer amount of heart-pounding action, scenes, it's definitely worth at least one watch.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Pure intensity, action, death, and bravery","Lone Survivor (2013)A more-or-less accurate depiction of four highly capable SEAL soldiers dropped into enemy territory in Afghanistan. They were then discovered and attacked by dozens of area Taliban. The recreation is riveting, disturbing in its intensity, and eye-opening. Whatever you feel about the war there, or even about soldiers killing other soldiers, you end up admiring the sheer abilities of these fit, smart, determined men.And only one survives (this is told in the title). So you go into it knowing it will end badly, and also that one of them (probably Mark Wahlberg, the biggest name here) will make it. If the fighting, which makes up most of the movie in the center core of it, is seemingly endless, that's part of the point. But when it shifts to a local village near the end the tale has another kind of intensity, and a welcome change.This is straight up action material. It lacks even the layers that other movies with similar settings add (see ""The Hurt Locker"" for one example). But in a way that makes this distinctive. It moves in linear fashion through time, through the events, and so you barrel along without mental complication to the end. It forces everything on the action, and the realistic portrayal of the unbelievable hardship and pain, and death, that comes along the way.Check out the overly-long Wikipedia page on this movie for lots of facts about production, and about the liberties they took with the facts. Or just watch the movie knowing that there are the usual permitted changes that dramatization requires. Even as pure fiction the movie has enough kinetic and heroic acts to succeed on its own terms.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, but not great.","Greetings from Lithuania.I read some reviews about ""Lone Survivor"" where it was mentioned alongside to a ""Saving Private Ryan"" - you can throw a rock at me if this comes close to ""Saving Private Ryan"" which is beyond many moons and seas compared to ""Lone Survivor"".""Lone Survivor"" is good action movie, with some heroic stuff (they definitely couldn't avoid that...), and i know that it's based on real events, thats why i'm giving it 8, because many of things displayed in picture were sadly true, many, but definitely not all. When someone is being killed in this movie (exept for bad guys from Taliban), it's shown in a similar way as Jim Caviezel aka.Jesus was suffering in ""The Passion of the Christ"" - only true American heroes die like that, not afghans who are more or less just a meat between bullets and Americans in this movie.Overall, i liked this action picture, the sound design and sound editing were really top notch (no wonder it got 2 Oscar nominations) - you can hear every detail in the forest, every breaking bone (ye, the fall from cliffs scene was gripping). Actors were just OK, nothing special. The gunfight was terrific at least in the beginning of battle, truly terrific sound design and camera work. Later, well, when bad guys were shooting with RPG's every 2 min to our heroes, and they were suffering real good but still were able to do some heroic stuff, the tension was kinda lost.Overall, 8/10 for me because of good production values and for that it is based on real events.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Lies, Lies and More Lies","The whole movie is fiction, not a single bullet was fired from Marcus Luttrell, he was found with all 11 mags full of ammo, he abandoned his squad mates and fleed then lied and make money off the deaths of his fallen squadmates. Only one of them had combat experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Hollow War Film,"Something just doesn't click with Peter Berg's Lone Survivor.It seems empty, a hollow movie that should have been filled in with care and concern for its main characters. Instead, more time is devoted to combat sequences—which are admittedly well done—than to any sort of character development.Lone Survivor tells the true story of Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of a failed Navy SEAL mission, ""Operation Red Wings"" in the mountains of Afghanistan in 2008. Mark Wahlberg plays Luttrell convincingly, but his character isn't given much to work with. He has no solid back story, so the audience can't really connect with a familial side of him. Instead, all we know of Marcus is his love for his fellow soldiers, and we can cheer him on as a leader and warrior.Berg (who directed and co-wrote) takes his time getting to the actual battle, which comes as the result of a bungled covert surveillance/capture-or-kill mission. Luttrell and three other SEALs have their location given away and are soon surrounded by Taliban fighters. This is where Lone Survivor is at its best: the action sequences are well-staged, compelling, and easy to follow, despite a rapidly moving camera and tricky terrain. Once the action begins, it rarely lets up.However, the film's first forty-five minutes or so are combat-free, and one would think Berg would invest this time into developing characters and making the audience really feel the sense that these men have something at home worth fighting for. However, he chooses to attempt this through forced dialog (one character explains to his significant other back home that he has to ""make that money"" or something of the sort) and rather bland situations. By the time the combat begins, we really only care about the bond forged between our four heroes, and we can only care as much as for anyone we just met a half hour before.By titling the film Lone Survivor, we expect casualties. We know that only one man is making it out of this mission alive, and Berg could have framed the looming sense of dread a bit better. Instead, he prefers long, drawn-out deaths, which seem somewhat sadistic at times. I understand that war is all hell, and that in a real-life setting, there's no cut-away from the harsh brutalities of death. But one SEAL's death in particular seems like cinematic overkill. In other cases, Berg eschews the generally gritty look of the film for fog-filtered, picturesque, slow-motion deaths which come across as stagy and shallow.Lone Survivor is a well-made war movie, albeit one without a clear message. It is a simple retelling of facts, too true to them at points and too dramatized at others. It is no Black Hawk Down, or even The Hurt Locker. Nonetheless, its actors turn in realistic performances in their depictions of soldiers (Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch are especially good) in a film that ultimately keeps its audience at arm's length from them, emotionally speaking.The most powerful aspects of Lone Survivor are its bookend montages of footage of the real SEALs involved in Operation Red Wings. I wonder if it would have been a better decision to have simply produced a documentary with the real Marcus Luttrell chronicling his amazing journey. It may have paid better tribute to the brave men involved in the battle than Peter Berg's Lone Survivor.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely amazing movie,I honestly do not understand the negative reviews on this film. Man this is literally the movie that inspired me to join the military and also to be a navy seal. The beginning can bore a little I let any viewer that i introduce to the film know that you need to see it before the good parts start. Now I understand some things are exaggerated but from the book its mostly accurate info just with scenes to add more drama and action. The actors are amazing and its such a good war scene. Overall in my opinion this is a perfect war movie from start to finish. I still hold back tears when they show the ending. Ive watched this movie about 200 times (no exaggeration) for a reason. Also the reason mark wahlberg is my favorite actor.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Mere Propaganda Film. Nothing More. Nothing Less.,"Based on the nonfiction book of the same name & set during the War in Afghanistan, Lone Survivor tries to recreate the US Navy SEALs' Operation Red Wings, a failed mission in which a survey team of 4 soldiers were tasked to locate the Taliban leader, Ahmad Shah. And even though it impresses in parts & has a lot in it to evoke the patriotic response from its target audience (which is American viewers obviously), Lone Survivor ends up going completely overboard in dramatizing the true events & suffers from the very clichés that most films of its genre find themselves trapped in.What's right with this film is Peter Berg's dynamic direction, tense atmosphere, superb pacing, intense battle sequences, precision use of sound, music & relatively fine performances from its star cast who were actually capable of delivering more than what ended up being in the final print. What's wrong with it, however, is its lack of emotional depth or character development, sometimes going overly dramatic than required and too much reliance on action to push its story forward which ultimately crosses the fine line between exploration & exploitation to revel in the latter.On an overall scale, Lone Survivor has nothing new to offer compared to what other films of this genre have already given us so far. Yes, it's brutal. Yes, it looks realistic to some extent. Yes, the battle sequences are disturbing, graphic &, in my opinion, explosively entertaining as well. But, there is also no denying that its characters remain hollow throughout its runtime, the story or characters aren't explored enough for us to invest our emotions in & all in all, this war drama is nothing less or more than a mere propaganda film, unfortunately.",,Anonymous,Biography
Hard to call this the next Saving Private Ryan in the previews,"The expectations where set to high with that line, it's a good film, great acting. I read the book prior to seeing the move, perhaps that was my biggest problem with this show. More character development would have made the movie more interesting. Narrative dialog would have helped fill in the blanks. The movie see end like a long 2 hour action sequence. There is more to operation read wings then was described here. This story could have been in the same class as Saving Private Ryan but it had none of the elements that made that show great. The action scenes where fantastic. The realism was top notch.

They will give u a lot of insight to this amazing movie. Again, this is a must watch if ur into military stuff. Even the music from steve jablonsky is absolutely spot on.

"Solid, effective war drama","'Lone Survivor' provides an accurate and effective portrayal of a group of soldiers on a mission to kill the leader of the Taliban. It makes for fascinating and, as you would expect, highly suspenseful viewing. The stripped back approach works to the films benefit, with the minimalistic editing and special effects contributing to the film's raw and real feeling.Mark Wahlberg suits his character well and delivers a solid performance throughout, though I do think so more character development was necessary as very little is known of any of the characters we follow in the film. Having said that, 'Lone Survivor' is successful in doing what it sets out to do - telling a fascinating true story in the most accurate and effective way.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

What Are We Doing in Afghanistan?,"""Lone Survivor"" is a brutal, graphic, combat movie. It depicts US Navy SEALs fighting against Taliban in Afghanistan in 2007. It is based on Marcus Luttrell's book of the same title. There is very little plot. The movie opens with scenes of Navy SEALs undergoing rigorous training. Trainees are shown lying down under oncoming ocean waves, being dunked in water so that they cannot breathe, doing pushups, etc.After this brief segment, the film sets up each SEAL team member. They are shown to be lovable guys who have families back home whom they cherish and who cherish them. One SEAL wants to buy his fiancée an Arabian horse. Another is concerned about his wife's redecorating in a color called ""honeydew."" Given Marcus Luttrell's fame and the title of the movie, most people will know how this movie ends. That knowledge gives these scenes that much more poignancy, but also a sense of the director manipulating the audience. We know what's coming, and we know why the director included these scenes.The SEALs are assigned to assassinate Taliban commander Ahmad Shah. They are shown with all their gear, penetrating a steep mountain covered with pines and strewn with boulders. They see their target, and are ready to carry out their mission. They are discovered by three Afghan goat herders. They consider killing the goat herders, but Luttrell advises against it. If they kill the goat herders, they will be condemned on CNN as bestial Americans who assassinate Afghan civilians. Immediately after the soldiers release the goat herders, the goat herders inform the Taliban of their location. They Taliban quickly surround, outnumber, and begin firing on the four SEALs.The firefight is depicted in graphic, brutal, realistic images. A SEAL is shown aiming his weapon, firing, and a Taliban's turbaned head explodes into a squirting fountain of red liquid. Bullets penetrate flesh and blood and gore ooze out. This gunfight is lengthy and tense. I have to ask how it will affect viewers. Will viewers want to get a gun and make someone's head explode? Yes, our media is saturated with violence. Is that a good thing? Have we given up even asking this question?The film never addresses the larger questions at play, and by not addressing them, they become all the louder. What are we doing in Afghanistan? How do we win in Afghanistan? Are we wasting the lives of fine, patriotic Americans and other allied men and women in uniform? Not to mention the polio workers, doctors and other aid workers the Taliban murders in Afghanistan?How about the rules of engagement? If we are at war in Afghanistan, then why aren't we acting as if we are at war? Should the goat herders not have been immediately killed, thus possibly saving many soldiers' lives and leading to a successful mission – the death or capture of Ahmad Shah? If soldiers are forced to conduct a war while wearing kid gloves, how can they be expected to win? What if we had imposed these rules of engagement on our soldiers during WW II? Would they have been able to win that war? Would the swastika not still be flying in Europe as we engaged in endless talks with our ""partners for peace""?Again, none of this is discussed in the film, making the discussion all the louder inside the viewer's head. In fact there was some controversy when CNN's Jake Tapper asked Marcus Luttrell about the ""Senseless"" deaths depicted in the film. Marcus Luttrell asserted that no, the deaths depicted in the film were not senseless. Americans are asking this, though. What are we doing in Afghanistan?",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Patriotic entertainment,"Movies should entertain, enlighten, or inspire. ""Lone Survivor"" does all three in measured doses. Special Forces (including Delta, Green Beret, UDT, LRRP et.al.) soldiers form a bond far stronger than even marriage-check. UDT Training is SO intense, many recruits actually have to be revived from near death-check. Special Ops must follow ROE, and not kill unless in imminent danger- check. Not ALL Afghans are bad-check. When surrounded, Navy Seals kill a lot of enemies-check. Not much new there. Gut-wrenching suspense- check. Lots of big explosions, check, check, CHECK! Entertaining-yes!That the actors and director wanted this movie SO MUCH many took a pay cut to do so explains why it was made in the first place, when there have been so many similar films with more compelling story lines in recent years. I liked it, but I liked Back Hawn Down, and Zero Dark Thirty far more.Lone Survivor entertains at an 8, enlightens at a 5, and inspires at a level that depends solely upon your individual patriotism.

"Start of 2014 great, with this anti-terrorism hit, and Marky Mark's top shelf performance","Mr Wahlberg knows how to make action hits. He's an action star, but more so, can act. He's one of the most misjudged actors I've ever seen. Here, he's at his most dramatic best, thick beard and all, surrounded by other fine performers, the underrated Emilie Hirsh, Taylor Kitcsh, and Australia's own Eric (Chopper) Bana. Here, Wahlberg plays real life, lone survivor, Marcus somebody, part of anti terrorist squad, on a failed mission, due to bad radio connections, but more so a fatal one out of three decision, that soon sees the squad, outnumbered by the Taliban. Outnumbered is a tame word here too. Making the one out of three call, is a tough one too, some of it involving procedure, other parts of it, sparing the safety of the squad. The photography and direction are number one. Some parts of this movie, I warn you are incredibly tense and ugly. Working through story, step by step, in the factual events that occurred, through the real life 2005 incident, the movie comes off as top floor story/filmmaking of this genre. Probably in a couple of ways, it's better than last years, Zero Dark Thirty. I'll be honest, as a quality war film, it's better than I'd thought it'd be. When it opens, I advise you to see it. You'll be pleasantly surprised, but also by it, being directed by Peter Berg who brought that guilty pleasure-blacker than black comedy, Very Bad Things. A great way to start off the movies of 2014, but too The Wolf Of Wall Street, opens the same day here.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Based on facts about a daredevil commando is assigned a dangerous mission behind the enemy lines.,"A splendid and spectacular film with emotion, violent fights and spectacular shootouts. Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and his valiant team (Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster) set out on a mission to capture or kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah, in late June 2005. But they are spotted and the enemy descended about them. Along the way, suffering exhaustion, crossfire, relentless pursuit, surrounding and risked encounters with Talibans. At the successfully they're wiping out Talibans, but things go wrong. Marcus and his two-fisted team are left to fight for their lives in one of the most valiant efforts of modern warfare. Live to Tell the Story!. Based on True Acts of Courage!. Live to tell the story!.Moving and thrilling wartime production set in Afghanistan but actually shot in Santa Fe, Nuevo México. Decent reenacting about the ¨Red Wings¨operation focused on four soldiers and the Afghans go after them in a merciless chasing down the commando. The film packs warlike action, thrills, drama and results to be quite entertaining. The group must try to survive enemy that undergo a chase and a mini-war, as they fight all by themselves and finally find how wrong his misconceptions, suffering wounds, bloody gunshots and perilous falls from high rocks .The story contains a brief studio character seeking human frailty beneath surface heroism and dealing with the ¨Pashtunwali¨or Afghan code of honor. Mark Wahlberg heads the great cast of this action film that tells the story of Marcus Luttrell (author of the book on which the script is based) and recounts his experiences in Afghanistan in 2005, when he and other comrades were entrusted with the mission to take down a terrorist leader and were ambushed by the Taliban. It is an intense story about the power of the human spirit when it is put to the test and taken to the limits of physical and mental resistance. Lone Survivor(2013) is well written and directed by Peter Berg (Battleship, Hancock) and also has the interpretations of Taylor Kitsch (True Detective, Savages) , Emile Hirsch (The darkest hour, Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood), Ben Foster (Gavelston, Comancheria), Eric Bana (Deadfall, Hanna) and Alexander Ludwig (The Hunger Games, Vikings).This is a flag-waver commando movie with a typical crew of tough Navy SEALs soldiers battling Talibans, in fact the film is dedicated to the brave members who participated in the operation. Director Peter Berg's skill with the thrills overcomes the artificiality of the story. Mark Wahlberg produced the film along with Mark Damon, Grant Cramer, Simon Fawcett, Kerry Foster, Louis Friedman, George Furia, Akiva Goldsman and director Peter Berg himself. Being colorfully photograhed by director of cinematography Tobias A. Schliessler, adding a thrilling, tense musical score from Explosions in the Sky and Steve Jablonsky. The motion picture was competently directed by Peter Berg. It received positive reviews for Berg's direction and the performances of its cast. Nicely directed by Peter Berg, Lone Survivor (2013) marks the first collaboration between Mark Wahlberg and Peter Berg along with the films Milla 22 (2018), Deepwater Horizon (2016) , Patriots day (2016), Lone Survivor (2013), all of them based on true events.

"Realistic, but ...","Is this based on a true story? If yes, then I think the 4 mariners are purely insane. Info is the key in a war. If you don't want to kill those non-armed people and let them go free. At least leave their hands tied up. Make a little cut on their legs so they can only walk slowly. Or simply throw away their shoes. Why you put yourselves in such a trouble!?",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Jingoistic overtones rob this film of its anti war message,"Its lamentable that whilst Lone Survivor might be viewed as a anti war film it could just as easily be perceived as a ringing endorsement for the US military.The plot of the film is simple enough, a group of special forces soldiers are sent to Afghanistan to assassinate a militia leader with ties to the Taliban. Due to poor planning, dodgy equipment and a general lack of resources however the mission is doomed to failure.What follows is visceral, disturbing and above all very sad. Even if like me you are not from the United States you can not help but feel considerable sympathy as you watch a group of young men horrifically slaughtered as they take on an overwhelmingly larger enemy force.Whats really troubling about Lone Survivor is it stubbornly refuses to shed the jingoistic overtones that could have lifted this film above the raft of other US made war movies. Questions about the waste of human life and potential, the political validity of wars fought on foreign soil,that are inherent in this film are drowned out by the ""rah rah and hoopla"" about God and country.I can not as a consequence recommend this film. Indeed I'd go so far as to say it's an irresponsible film that romanticizes war, perpetuating the myth that dying on the field of battle is something other than bloody, gruesome and ultimately pointless.",,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Movie!,"Everyone did a fantastic job, I absolutely fell in love with the movie. I did my best to hold back a few tears, but I think I failed. I don't know what real Navy SEALs look like, but if I had to guess it would have been what these actors showed. I wish the best for these families & for Marcus, I hope god is taking care of them. Also one more thing, I loved that Eric Bana was in the movie, I have been a big fan since Black Hawk Down. I hope that he takes up another military role. This review needs at least 10 lines in order to let me submit, so I will also add that the stunt men did an amazing job, definitely one of my all time favorite movies. Another thing that I saw was that the extras and the actors that played the villagers were great. Thank you",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hate The War,"Beside a very nice movie with a lot of good scene's and acting and also a perfect sound mixing & editing we see the reality of war. The reality of war is pain, cruelty, kill, fear and at the end death. We can now just imagine a world without war and fight. people are dying everyday in everywhere in earth with no mercy and defense. soldier's are fighting for nothing because they are not even in they're homeland and country. they are fighting and dying far from they're house and family's because of nothing. How hard it is for the mother's and wife's who are waiting for they're son's and husband's? how hard it is for the men and women who are dying far from they're loved ones and the last thing they are going to see is fire and blood?I hope with all of my heart that one day we see all soldier's get back home safe and healthy and there be PEACE IN EARTH.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Some visual annoyances.. But a good watch,"This movie caught me by surprise. It was a great watch with action and drama. I did however have several issues with it. For me to really love and get into a movie, I need to know and love or hate the characters. In this movie I found that I couldn't tell some apart, even at the end. Another issue, was the visual effects only by way of the filming location. This movie, set to take place in J-Bad, was way too obviously filmed in the US or Canada, or so I thought. At the end of the movie I had to look up filming location because it was not real enough for me. I don't want to spoil anything so watch and make your own decision, and check out the filming location if you feel it seems strange. A good watch, but could have been a lot better if the script had played more into a deeper story background.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the most brutal and realistic combat pictures ever made in recent memory.,"On the summer of 2012, director Peter Berg faced harsh criticism when his big-budget sci-fi action blockbuster, BATTLESHIP, flopped big time at the box office. But thankfully, Berg manages to bounce back with this impressive combat picture, LONE SURVIVOR -- easily one of his best directing efforts to date.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Based on a failed ""Operation Red Wings"" mission which takes place on June 28, 2005, a four-man Navy SEALs team -- Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Michael P. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster) and Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) -- are sent into the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan to apprehend Taliban commander Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami). However, their mission is compromised when they stumble upon local goat herders. Facing a dilemma whether to kill them or to let them go, they choose the latter option -- a ill-fated decision that soon cost them dearly.THE GOOD STUFFKudos goes to Peter Berg for his well-paced direction throughout the two hours of this movie. He starts off with a strong setup that introduces all four main characters, sustaining the momentum, and finally hits full button with some of the most gruelling combat sequences ever staged in a war genre. Here, he doesn't skimp on the violence as well as the harsh reality of a war combat. In fact, the sequence is so intensely choreographed that you could almost feel all the pain (especially the scene where they rolled down the rocks and injured their bodies in the process) that these four main characters have to endure.All four main actors give believable and solid performances. But it was Mark Wahlberg who excels the most as the last standing soldier (hence the title).MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The extended combat sequence between the four-man Navy SEALs team and an army of Taliban fighters.THE BAD STUFFIf there's any flaw in this movie, it's Eric Bana. For such an established actor of his calibre, his performance as Lt. Commander Erik S. Kristensen is sadly reduced into thankless role.FINAL WORDSLONE SURVIVOR is definitely not for the squeamish. However, those who can stomach the unflinching act of violence, will be rewarded with one of the best post-9/11 war pictures ever made in years.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

He said nothing until an officer noticed it and ordered him out.He also said that none of this would have happened in his Army Ranger unit.

Brutal and bloody,"Based on the true story of Operation Redwing in Afghanistan, this movie follows a group Navy Seals through a mountainous terrain to hit a Taliban unit.
The film starts with the intro of characters with plenty of group soldier banter then what follows is a bloody long battle against a group of Taliban.
The Seals are outnumbered so it's a tough gruelling gunfight for much of the movie.
Lone survivor is relentless with its action with explosions and machine gun fire for most of the movie.
The story is simple and well played out with a strong cast.
So if you are looking for an intense, bloody battle movie this is for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unlucky 4,"If what this motion picture wants is to make an authentic impression, it does accomplish that. Of course, whoever looks close enough will notice computer generated images here and there, but everything looks real for the most part. Not to mention some real footage of young soldiers going through training or some real photographs of certain of those warriors. By the way, all that real material isn't just thrown in the mix to make sure you believe what the movie tells you, no, it is also important for the story it tells you and the point it wants to make, but more on that a bit later.If what ""Lone Survivor"" wants is to make sure the audience understands how bad that fight was, it does accomplish that. Of course, a thing or two can be questioned or criticized here, like the exaggerated survivability of the human body here and there, or the cinematography that wants the audience to feel like they aren't just watching, it wants them to feel like they are there, in that fight, experiencing it from the inside. The director of photography may have gone too far in a few moments. But it is clear that, again, for the most part, things look good. And as for the music and the sound design, neither is a problem.If what the movie wants it to show how there is disorder in certain parts of the US military and contrast that with the other parts, the ones that are nothing but order, it does accomplish that. Also, as a historical one, this movie may omit certain things or, maybe, get it wrong here and there, which isn't uncommon with historical movies. But it isn't exactly about the big picture, it is about one man in particular, the titular survivor, and as for that, there is something valuable to comment on.Marcus and his three comrades may come from the same country, they may be doing the same thing here, but there is a thing that separates Marcus from the other three. And the movie makes it clear. Both in the beginning and at the very end, and here is what it is, exactly. Danny, Mike and Axe all have someone back home, and their mind isn't entirely focused on the here and now, because they have that strong connection to their home. Marcus does not have that. His mind is here and now. He may get distracted by them bringing up their personal lives and even asking him for advice here and there, but that's it, he is here, focused and prepared. And only when it's all over and he is back from the brink, only then do we, the audience, get to see him with family, and that information comes from years after the ""cursed"" operation. Marcus had completed his journey and can now have a life. That's the point.And it doesn't just have ""LONE"" in the title for no reason. Marcus, unlike his three teammates, has no one back home, he only has his brothers in arms here, but he loses them now, and barely survives himself, but he does survive, and the last we see him in this movie is photographs years after the fight, and it's clear he has a son now, and that kid is named after one of his fallen brothers.In conclusion, there is something to see, there is something to hear, and there is something to think of. The material isn't meaningless. Nor is it pointless.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Brutal and Modern Take on Warfare!,"Lone Survivor is an excellent movie and is one of the better war movies to be released this century. The movie has themes of survival and heroism as well as the Navy SEALS protecting their brother-in-arms at all costs, down to the final death. I liked the opening of the film where it shows a montage on just how tough training is and if you can complete training, you can do anything. The film also made me angry in regards to this failed mission. Communication was the key here and the movie made note that the army's communication systems may be faulty thus resulting in a failed mission.Peter Berg's film is about a mission, where four Navy SEALS led by Marcus Lutterel are tasked to capture or kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. However they are led into an ambush where the four men are pitted in the ultimate battle, on the precarious mountain ranges in Afghanistan, against the better-armed Taliban army.The film was well-acted as everyone got a piece of the puzzle. Mark Wahlberg was outstanding as the one of the leaders of the four men and he actually had a few tear-worthy scenes. Ben Foster had another standout performance as Axelson. Taylor Kitsch does a great job as Mike Murphy and under the bulk, Emile Hirsch likewise did a great job as Danny Dietz. Finally, Eric Bana is forever reliable as Commander Kristensen.Overall, Lone Survivor is a great war film and a powerful one at that. The movie focused mainly on the character development between the SEALS, so don't expect to get to really know any of the Taliban that well. The film has lots of action and because of the odds stacked against the SEALS, it made for a very tense watch. The movie is an unflinching, brutal take on warfare and is also very realistic. A sad, but an ultimately powerful film. I rate this film 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than expected,Finally I decided to buy the DVD and to give it a chance. I have to admit that my expectations were met by far. Sorry to describe the action scenes similar to a Rambo movie. These sequences are well done.I couldn't imagine that the five Navy Seals had to fight against all these Talibans soldiers. Director Peter Berg captured all scenes very credibly. He managed very well the dramatic countdown too that I won't to spoil here anymore. Just watch it. It's a worth see. Especially Mark Wahlberg and the other actors did a great job here. Congratulations to all people that made possible to reconstruct this story based on true events. For all victims that died in this dirty war I want to express my respect and that God bless them.

Brutal battles,"This film details the failed operation of US SEALS in Afghanistan to capture a Taliban leader in 2005.The title already gave the plot away, and the first scene confirms all suspicion of the title. Hence, viewers are already given a grim outlook for the respectable soldiers portrayed in the film. For the first forty minutes, nothing much happens. I was about to lose interest in it, thinking it was boring and uneventful. When action strikes, it strikes big time. It is brutal and violent that most of the time I had my eyes closed. It's so sad to see the soldiers in such desperate situations, and yet they combat valiantly until the last minute. There is little emotional or dramatic element in the plot, but it will still evoke much emotions because the battles are so brutally realistic. ""Lone Survivor"" is certainly not a film for entertainment or an easy relaxing evening. Be prepared to see loads of nasty wounds.",,Anonymous,Biography

well done but Berg puts a little too much Hollywood in the action,"Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) is the lone survivor of a mission in Afganistan. He, Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster) are a four man SEAL reconnaissance team sent to track down a violent Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah. The team has constant radio problems. They encounter 3 goat herders. After some lively debate, they let them go and try to escape the onslaught of Taliban forces.Director Peter Berg brings the book about the real battle to the big screen. The start is reminiscent of Peter Berg doing 'Friday Night Lights'. I think he even used similar musical cues. The four lead actors do a solid job. They're all good actors and they don't let their Hollywood flash outshine their roles. This is especially true for Wahlberg. He continues to improve as an actor.However Peter Berg does put too much Hollywood flash into the battles. After an hour, the movie's second half is overblown both in explosive flash and theatrical posing. The action has some great realism at times but at other times feels like a Hollywood affair. All in all, the action pushes over the edge a few times. The villagers are nice but there again, Berg puts in a battle where the helicopters come over the ridge just in time to mow down all the Taliban in a blaze of glory. This would probably work much better if the action is not overproduced and be more realistic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great tribute to brave soldiers that died at Operation Redwing,"First, let me say that this is NOT a high budget Hollywood movie that glorifies war. It is a tribute to the story of the brave soldiers that died during Operation Redwing. The movie will bring you up close and personal on the mountain with four Navy Seals and their ordeal with a Taliban ambush.This story could easily have been made into a PG-13 feel-good Hollywood blockbuster, but it would have been a disservice to the soldiers that died. The action sequences are brutal, gory, and real... as is war.The movie follows Marcus Luttrell's book pretty closely, though some parts were omitted... as is needed to make a book into a movie. That said, all the key points of the story were covered.To any soldiers that may be reading this, Thank you for your service.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gripping action with messy morals....,"Lone Survivor claims it's based on a true story, though to what extent I'm not sure. I doubt that these four Navy SEALS engaged in combat like you would in a CoD game, in that they only need to rest in cover for a few seconds after being shot then they're fine. Lone Survivor is also rather messy moralistically as well, as it doesn't seem to have a clear message on war. One of my favourite scenes in the movie was one where soldiers debate what to do with some Afghan kids they've captured. I thought this scene would serve as a basis for more complex developments on the morality of war, but alas no, as Lone Survivor feels like a movie that doesn't know what it's trying to say.However, the movie is still well made. The action is very well directed and incredibly tense, there's one scene where the soldiers are falling down a mountain and I have no idea whatsoever how they filmed it, it was incredibly well done. The acting is excellent as well, with Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch all giving excellent performances, however I found myself not caring so much about anyone other than Mark Wahlberg because I knew what their fate would be due to the title of the movie and the posters which all have Mark Wahlberg front and centre, so it's not exactly hard to guess who will be the lone survivor.I was glad the movie didn't show the belief that all Afghans are Taliban members that will try to kill you instantly. For a good portion of the movie I thought it was going down this road but was glad to see that towards the end it turned around. However, message wise that's the one of the only things I thought was done well. Is it worth watching? I would still say so because it's enjoyable enough, but don't expect a complex social commentary on war.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Authentic and gripping.,"From Peter Berg, the director of Battleship and Hancock - WAIT STOP DON'T LEAVE!!! I know, Berg's reputation as a director isn't exactly stunning, but stay with me here...Lone Survivor is the adaptation of the book by Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell, and is based on his true story of survival after ""Operation Red Wings"", a mission to take out a high ranking Taliban leader, goes awry.If there's one thing you need to know about this film, it's this: This movie was a labor of love. Berg did his homework, visiting the real families of each soldier involved, using real veterans to fill in various extra roles, researching the looks and typical protocols of Tactical and Joint Operation Centers, and even getting the actual equipment. The result is a very authentic representation of Navy SEALs in action, and many veterans are calling it the most accurate depiction of modern U.S. military warfare. THIS FEELS REAL.Adding to this is the solid performances by the cast. Mark Wahlberg does a solid job, while Taylor Kitsch and Emile Hirsch give us great supporting performances. What should be noted is the fact that many of the people involved here - Berg, Wahlberg, and Kitsch most notably - took significant pay cuts to get this movie out. Berg directed getting paid the union minimum salary, which is still a nice chunk of money for 42 days of shooting ($17,000 per week), but the point is that everyone involved were driven by a great amount of pride in this project, and not by a major paycheck. Also, I should have gotten into directing.We all know that Navy SEALs are some badass mofo's when it comes to toughness, but DAMN, THEY CAN TAKE SOME PUNISHMENT. Some people might question how believable that toughness is in a few spots, but I WILL NOT BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. I have no desire to have SEAL Team 6 come flying through my windows tonight.Is it as good as ""Saving Private Ryan"", like some of the advertisements are saying? No. But it doesn't have to be. Lone Survivor is still a moving, gritty and authentic story that will leave you with a fine appreciation of what these servicemen went through.Lone Survivor scores a 4 out of 5 on the BDBOS.(Hey guys, thanks for reading.

A Good Film But You Do Feel It's Embellished A Bit Too Much,"A NATO special forces mission in Afghanistan sees a four man team capture a senior Taliban commander and they manage to extricate him without firing a shotA rather boring premise for a book which is why you'll never see it used . People don't like hearing about success in this context hence we get the horror stories of things going wrong in war . It appeals to both sides of the divide where war porn addicts can immerse themselves in gore and courage and jingoism while grief whores can gnash their teeth and tell themselves nothing in human nature is worse than war - not even eternal defeat and tyranny by a victorious enemy . This film LONE SURVIVOR based upon the true life account of a firefight in Afghanistan written by Marcus Luttrell might actually appeal to both sides but at the same time you can say it's guilty of having its cake and eating it . A four man Navy SEALS team goes in to hostile Taliban territory to keep tabs on a local warlord . As I said no one wants to hear about a mission that goes right so within a short period something goes wrong and things from bad to worse and even worser and we're not even halfway through the film yetLS shows that war is hell but overdoes things and has embellishment . It's not enough for someone to be knocked off their feet by a grenade blast - they must be blown off the top of a hill , and bounce off rocks , bounce off some more rocks and bounce off even more rocks then their fall is broken - by rocks. It does seem difficult to swallow what some human bodies can endure where physics is concerned but I wasn't there nor am I a USN SEALS member either . But even so the film often hits wrong notes like a lengthy scene where the team discuss the possible execution a trio of goat herders in order to make a clean get away to their rendezvous point . Again I wasn't there but why would a special forces team consider what is effectively murder in order to keep their cover ? If the bodies are found then that would invite counter-murder with extreme and painful prior torture from the Taliban if captured . Likewise it's almost as if the unit have been able to predict that they'd be unable to contact base once they arrived at the rendezvous point . I don't want to accuse anyone of lying especially when I'm sat here on a safe sofa out of a war zone but little things like the things seen here don't really ring true . But as I said I wasn't thereWhere LS deserves some credit is not portraying all Pashtuns as violent savages . Several years ago I had a brief online chat with a former security contractor who spent several years in Afghanistan . I asked about the Russian film 9TH COMPANY and if it was true of the Pashtun tradition of ""Haram"" seen in that film where if you're a guest of a Pashtun you're not allowed to be harmed . The former contractor whose name was Nick informed me that only was true but if you're a guest of a Pashtun village then the hosts have also a duty to Allah to defend you with their lives ! Despite all the understandable bad news coming of Afghanistan for decades Nick also told me if he hadn't met his wife he'd still be there if only because of Pashtun uber-hospitality .This is recreated in detail were the titular lone survivor crawls in to a local village though again the film overplays its hand a bit after this by having another action sequence And maybe this sums up LONE SURVIVOR perfectly . It's another film on the war is hell theme but the trouble with war porn is unlike sexual porn it ends up becoming ironically and unintentionally erotic . It's a good film from a technical point of view but you're left with the feeling it's more of a patriotic flag waver rather than being genuinely anti-war",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"bad screenplay, bad directing....","first of all, the screenplay was not well crafted and written, there were scenes after scenes obviously were added up to compile together to make a hollow combat record longer than it should be. the directing was so poor that made this film look like a patching work. there are lot of viewers, especially males, who just like to gobble up anything related to 'special forces', 'rangers', and 'navy seals' military movies but never watched them with 'reasonable doubts'. here is a movie that cheated us with fake terrain of afghanistan, the terrains showed us in this movie are absolute American, new Mexico or some location in the rocky mountains, part of the budget was spent on building some look-alike mud square buildings, houses imitated what should be look like in afghanistan, it's just horrible to watch a film so carelessly chose the locations to fool the viewers. the screenplay also suffered a fatal arrangement to put scenes on the enemy, those ragged headed actors looked so modern and phony. the whole sequence of the operation was pretty laughable and amateurish. if the real military operations in afghanistan were like this pathetic arrangement, no wonder we American ground forces in that country would have suffered such a big loss of soldiers and crippled so many young men without any probable cause. this is a horrible military film written by amateur(s), directed by amateurs, wasted by a bunch of actors who just tried very hard to wear cool sunglasses, un-shaved faces with beard, special forces costumes and weapons, but none of them, including the sole survivor, looked as the real deal.",,Anonymous,Biography

I guess if you invade other country for unknown reason your troops will die there. So this movie is about invaders getting shot at by locals and dying. Hollywood writing added 80% of exaggeration to the original story to make it block buster.Avoid, movie is awful, so is Mark Wahlberg.

An underrated war movie,"This is an underrated war film by Peter Berg which deserves much more credit. It contains well-done battle sequences and it keeps the viewer hoping for a happy ending even though the outcome is already known.4 Navy SEALs on a mission to find a high-level Taliban operative find themselves in a desperate gun battle with enemy forces in the Hindu Kush region.Like Black Hawk Down, this is a movie which puts you in the middle of combat and it immerses you well. It isn't as claustrophobic and tense as Black Hawk Down was but it still does a great job in immersing you. The make-up work is bloody realistic and it shows you how all 4 men slowly become weaker and weaker as the battles they face continue on and on. Black Hawk Down didn't have this feature but I still think that it was more tense. I'll explain why I think that later in this review.Mark Wahlberg did a great job acting. His performance isn't too impressive at first but after the movie starts to pick up, he gives it all he has and he does an exceptional job in the second half. All of the other actors give great performances as well but Wahlberg is the one who stands out the most considering that he's the main star of the movie.I mentioned earlier that this movie has a lot of tension (which is does). However, perhaps ""Lone Survivor"" wasn't exactly the best title they could have come up with. After the other 3 men die, I felt that the movie lost some of its suspense because I knew that Wahlberg wouldn't die and I felt more calm in the battle scenes which came after it. I know that some people already knew the ending since this was based on a true story but I wasn't familiar with the main story and I would've felt more tension if there was a different title.Even though this movie loses some of its tension near the end, I still think that this is an underrated war movie and it deserves a lot more praise. Some people have argued that it has intensity not seen in a Hollywood war movie ever since Black Hawk Down. I kind of agree with this statement. However, this movie still has well-executed battle scenes which are definitely worthy of a viewing. In my opinion, this is one of the best war movies of the past 15 years.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Intense up-close reinactment, not for the faint hearted","This film is insanely emotional with in-your-face attention to detail. I'm personally not sure Walburg was the best choice for the lead but his name definitly lends credence to the attraction for the audience. However, all actors did an incredible job here. I'm not in the military myself but many family members and loved ones are, so I do know a few things about their training and combat. In particular, I can appreciate that, while one reviewer claims it was unrealistic that these men were repeatedly shot and falling down rock faces only to keep perservering as the Taliban men instantly fellfrom one bullet, the training of these elite teams focuses on ignoring pain and digging deep while the Taliban soldiers are only trained to kill even if that means being killed in the process. Very different styles of training.We feel the pain of each man as he must leave one then the other team mate behind in order to just perservere in the face of certain defeat.There's many things that will stand out as shocking to many viewers, including the team being forced to let the farmers go free at the risk of being caught and the helicopter teams coming to save them - risking dozens of men to save a few. But these are very realistic and should beg the question: why are we allowing squeaky-wheel civilians to dictate the rules of war when it necessitates that long standing rules be compromised? Long standing protocol is to send in help but here they've allowed the Taliban a huge headway from the simple act of appeasing the public rather than put the safety of the team first. It made me feel so angry.It's an important film in many ways, not the least being that we see there are groups of Afghan who are as much against the Taliban as any religious sect could be; so determined they are willing to destroy themselves to defeat one murder. Truly mind boggling to the average person.This film is very emotional and upsetting yet eye-opening. Highly recommended. I can't say enough about the level of magnification the director and actors managed to pull off. Not a film you will easily forget.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Trademark Wahlberg Movie,"Last year , while watching ""Shooter"" on HBO , I realized something quite remarkable about Mark Wahlberg and the movies he stars in- they have a uncanny knack of bearing a striking resemblance to the uni-dimension unapologetic action movies of the 1990's or in short very entertaining.""Lone Survivor"" exhibits all the symptoms which make it a typical Wahlberg fare. To begin with the storyline is quite simple, linear and straightforward. The screenplay is trite and cleanly composed. There is no sub planar text here, nor any sub planar political undertones. It is in all aspects a very conventional war movie with clearly demarcated ""good guy"" bad guy"" ""patriot"" "" enemy"" themes. In this respect it is unlike most contemporary cinema.Much like ""Shooter"" the movie doesn't beat around the bush a lot no inordinate delays blot the plot. There is a conspicuous absence of subtlety and each character wear his emotions on the sleeve, which would have have been run of the mill in the 90's or 80's but seems refreshingly nostalgic in the emotionally devoid action flicks of the first decade of the new millennium .Moving on, the action scenes are downright impressive. The camera-work is superb and the sound effects impeccable. The cinematography and action choreography are totally in sync . The scenes do not look dragged out or repetitive, partly due to the plot progression and partly due to the smart usage of the shooting locations by the director.The cast too does well playing out their respective roles to the best of their abilities. Their task is made easier by the predominance of combat scenes where finesse is not required and also the melodramatic tone of the movie.There are times when you feel that that movie is duplicating scenes from older movies in the genre with stereotypical themes and ricocheted scenes appearing , but they don't hurt the overall experience.I am giving the movie 7 , but this is the kind of 7 which signifies a decent , entertaining Mark Wahlberg Action Thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Harrowing and Taut Experience,"Whether talking about a cinematic experience or hearing details of the real thing, the gallantry and heroism of our men and women at arms can never be overstated, be it in service to the defenseless, protecting the nation or for reasons with which everyone may not agree. Though ironically just that – overstated – at a number of junctures, Peter Berg's Lone Survivor is nevertheless an often breathless and riveting tale of a small band of brother's desire to survive, and how a greater objective can become a moot point at a moments notice.Lone Survivor once again makes the case that focusing on a smaller portion of a greater conflict is the proper way to go when attempting to make the events of a war film hit close to home. While sweeping, melodramatic conflict driven dramas have their place (and there are some great ones) there is little substitute to spending an intense two hours with a few select individuals as you follow them through a life or death ordeal. When the film's very title overtly hints that there will certainly be more death than life on screen, the experience becomes that much more uncomfortable and traumatic as we watch in unfold, unable to do anything but act as helpless spectator.The biggest compliment that I can pay to Lone Survivor is that it uses the already established nature of its outcome to its advantage rather than allow it to become a constraint that would dampen the impact. Despite the fact that only Mark Wahlberg's Marcus Luttrell escapes from the mountainous Kunar province of Afghanistan after the botched Red Wings assassination mission, equal time is spent with his three fellow Navy SEALs, never using them merely as canon fodder as our indestructible hero defeats the odds. The film treats them as humans, with loved ones, fears and souls and in doing so, as they are overcome by their ordeal, the losses hit closer to the heart.The simple fact we are aware of the outcome means the very journey organically notches up the suspense and all encompassing sense of dread. The stench of death is oppressive and in caring for these individuals and knowing and witnessing their fate it evokes a sort of anger reminiscent of the unfairness present in real conflict. Good, honest men may die, and it may be the furthest thing from fair or just, but that's simply the ugly nature of the beast, and Lone Survivor mirrors that frustration through its execution alone.The four principle cast members are all extremely solid, utilizing their shared screen time to great effect be it alone or with the group. Wahlberg, perpetually the everyman, anchors the picture and brings both the physicality and necessary weakness as the film evolves from firefight to survival situation. Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch have just the right look and overall level of public exposure to recede into their doomed characters, as they too sell their respective journeys towards the end. By far the most surprising member in terms of performance was that of Taylor Kitsch (reteaming with Berg after the dreadful Battleship) who in addition to acting believably as the squad leader employs a delicate blend of grace, heroism and humanity to a role that could have been anything but. This performance proves this young man has a future far beyond doomed blockbusters.The film's biggest folly comes when it paints these soldiers as nearly indestructible machines of war. Amidst what is some of the best shot and choreographed fighting in recent memory we get so many noble, eyes to the sky, slump to the knees, death scenes it both seeks to undermine the credibility of the situation and the otherwise brutal and realistic injuries these men endure. It's at those points that Lone Survivor makes itself clear it's no Saving Private Ryan. In films of that echelon when someone is on the receiving end of a bullet, in that moment at least, it is anything but heroic and patriotic. It's a person, alone in a pool of blood, gasping on a last few futile breaths, and its all the more searing because of it.All that being said, Lone Survivor puts us and its protagonists through the ringer and while presenting them as the supposed elite, never releases its grasp on the situation at hand in favour of pro American pandering. It's as intense and grisly as an experience you're likely to witness this year and though it stops short of greatness, its strides are mighty enough to take us places we don't want to be, and that we can't leave behind.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Harsh movie from the beginning,"This is a harsh movie, but you already know that with the introduction, taken from some kind of breaking boot camp for seals.This is based on real events, that makes it personal in a way and very vivid. Three acts is what this movie holds, and director Peter Berg makes sure we know the characters and their lives before heading them into the second act, this is where hell breaks loose, lots of action, bullets, explosions etc. going on there. The third act ends it of, it does however not show every Afghan as a Taliban terrorist, very refreshing and a different ending then what you mind expect. But it also gets a bit to stars and stripes for me, maybe thats the liberal European in me talking... never mind that.The Scenes seem very real, great action, great explosions and great scenery to keep it all together.

Less Testosterone & More Humanity Needed.,"Despite a very simple-minded approach to the war in Afghanistan, and an unashamed celebration of all things gung-ho and American, this is a pretty absorbing 'true' story of sacrifice and brotherhood during the height of this conflict ('true' as in certain parts feel like a movie, no doubt to make it more entertaining to the mainstream).I doubt these marines were the sometime supermen you see here, being able to take bullets at will and yet able to carry on for hours. And I don't believe the enemy hadjis were such terrible shots, with the four Americans killing the opposition seemingly at will. But its impact as an arresting spectacle is undeniable.I actually prefer the second half of the movie, when Mark Wahlberg (the so-called Lone Survivor) is helped by some local villagers who shelter him from Taliban soldiers. This part contains some truly moving scenes, as he bonds with a local boy and some of his prejudices about the people that live there are finally shed.Overall a bit too unbelievable in terms of its details sometimes and definitely overdosed on mindless patriotism, but worth at least one viewing. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Riveting! Best of the year,"Riveting. Best film of the year. Best war tribute since Saving Private Ryan (1998). This movie will grind your humanity to the core and keep you cringing in your seat as you experience the reality of war with no lines, no clear rules of engagement, no clear outcomesjust the clarity of life and death. If you don't applaud, cry and hug a soldier after seeing this film, you may not be human.Last night was pretty full. I read part of Robert Gates book, Duty and then attended the funeral of a good friend named John— a WWII hero. I saw John's purple heart, his bronze star. You don't get those things for sitting on the sidelines in college philosophy class. John survived to raise many fine children and inspire others. My Dad the same. No combat decorations for my Dad but the jungles of New Guinea were not exactly a day in the basement playing Xbox and eating pizza. My conclusion. War sucks big time. It may be necessary, but everyone from the President on down better be on board 180%. We don't put young men and women in harms way unless we are in extreme jeopardy of life and liberty. Because some men survive. Some do not. The survivors carry their fallen comrades for life, one way or another.The film is based on real life account of Marcus Luttrell in ""Operation Red Wings"" in Afghanistan 2005. The operation tasked four members of SEAL Team 10 to kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. They are poorly supported with communications more faulty than a Comcast cable box. These were regular young guys with girlfriends and a life at home and everything to live for. Americas best young men. Then they encounter and old man, a young child and several goat herders at the wrong place at the wrong time. Now everyone's life is in jeopardy. Suddenly duty, hour, country, right, wrong and basic human instincts to survive get very confused. Another great film, Casualties of War (1989) came to mind.I do not recommend this film for the weak of heart or for parents of current soldiers. Horrors of war should left off the table for some folks. This is not a film for the under 14 crowd. But every politician and wimp in this country that thinks political tricks and traffic jams are more important than our soldiers and ambassadors from Benghazi to Bagram should be strapped in a seat and forced to watch this film for or five times.God Bless America tonight.

Duped by IMDb,"Normally a movie's IMDb rating is a good barometer for suitability. Yes, sometimes things will be overrated a couple of points (Dark Knight & DKR being prime examples) by fanboys, others might be under scored because, as you will see from 'popular culture', the general public is by and large pretty stupid and can't comprehend something which requires a bit of analysis from the viewer without clear sign posts.Lone Survivor is the first example I've seen which has been overrated by at least 5 points, solely due to one nations sentimental patriotism. Take away the blatant propaganda, the glaring inaccuracies and questionable truths and you're left with what is just a very bad film. Poorly scripted, badly directed and wooden performances, especially from Wahlberg. Emile Hirsch phones in the worst performance of his a career and it was probably a relief for him when he was killed off.It will be lauded in the US due to their obsession with the military and 'people who give their lives to protect my freedom' despite their being very little threat and those they hero worship and generally there because they couldn't do much else.

The Most Moving Film I Have Seen..,"Where to start, for a guy who is overly cautious with films that are 'Based on a True Story' my thoughts changed once I watched this film. Im also one for being negative when real life tragedies are made into a film almost using what happened as a platform to sell. Once again this particular film has opened my eyes to this kind of film making and has made me even more respectful to servicemen both US and UK. The film had me up and out of my chair almost not wanting to watch the rest as it had entertainment factors, however the overwhelming realization that this happened got the better of me. I personally have to put this up with the likes of 'Saving Private Ryan'. It also gave me further interest into the 2005 mission, which got me reading up on loads that happened and what is happening. My only negative thought is the approach to the mission, things like this make me angry (Lets not get political). Although if i had it my way id just send an AC130 over. However... Once again the film changed and showed that ignorance to non Taliban is very high which just sold it for me.Final Thoughts.

Never Out of the Fight,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is one of those times where, in order to analyze a movie, one must separate from the emotion of the subject matter. In the traditional sense, this is not a great movie. However, in terms of practicality, the true story and characters and their actions, leave us emotionally exhausted and questioning whether any war actually makes sense. The other thing it does is bring to light just what impressive beings these brave soldiers really are.The story is taken from the book (co-written by Patrick Robinson) and real experience of Marcus Luttrell. A Texan and member of Navy SEAL Team 10, Luttrell was one of four chosen for the June 2005 Operation Red Wings ... the capture or kill of al Qaeda bad guy Ahmad Shahd. Dropped into the Afghanistan Hindu Kush mountains, the mission goes horribly wrong once the group is stumbled upon by goat herders. The Rules of Engagement provide guidance that is supported by CNN concerns ... and the decision is made to release them and call off the mission.To say all hell breaks loose after that is simply an understatement. The four SEALs face insurmountable odds that end according to the spoiler title. If you have seen Blackhawk Down or the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan, then you have some idea of what to expect on screen as these elite soldiers fight for their lives and their country. The intensity and visceral violence is impossible to describe here. The bullets rip flesh and bone, while desperate re-grouping efforts lead to horrendous tumbles down rocky cliffs.The movie begins with a glimpse at SEAL training, followed by a few minutes of base life ... the competitiveness, the bonding, the breeding of fighting machines. Director Peter Berg does allow for a peek at humanity and personality, but the Band of Brothers culture is unmistakable. When one of them states ""moderation is for cowards"", we never doubt for a second that this is part of their psyche.The four Seals are played by Mark Wahlberg (Marcus Luttrell), Taylor Kitsch (Michael Murphy), Emile Hirsch (Danny Dietz), and Ben Foster (Matt ""Axe"" Axelson). While they are all believable, this is not an actor's seminar. Neither is it a geopolitical editorial. Partisanship is non-existent here. Rather, we are reminded of the sacrifice that comes with war, and left to decide for ourselves if this approach is the best we can do.The real Marcus Luttrell makes an appearance in the movie ... he is the SEAL that spills coffee and tells the rookie to clean it up. Finally, as director Berg was meeting with the families prior to filming, this quote came from Danny Dietz's father after reading the obituary: ""That's who my son was. That's how hard he fought. Make sure you get that right"".",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good vs. Evil - is it so simple?,"This movie is not about heroes, it is about propaganda. It is like some bad old Western movie, where the Indians are just evil scum, who should be shot at every possible occasion, and where all the cowboys are automatically good.Face it: if you go fighting in a foreign country, you have a good chance to die. Does not really matter much if you train a lot, have good weapons and such. You can just get shot like a dog, like it happened in case of thousands of soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. USA keeps making wars since the end of World War II, and as such, portraying the ""heroes"" fighting in Afghanistan is just stupid and hypocritical. They do not defend their own country,they went to play GI Joe to another culture's homeland - and it has consequences.Although there are evil people in every country, this movie shows it like all the Americans are just friggin' awesome dancing around, training like hell, having fun team events, and generally being ""cool"", while all those bad-bad-stupid Arabic fighters should just die - as they hinder the Big Mission. We do not really understand from the movie what is the purpose of Big Mission - but who cares? They are fighters, aces, marines, and hell, they need some success!!!The brown guys must be bad, because they dare to fight back against the good marines. Well.. imagine if the USA would be attacked some day - would they also fight back? Are the local fighters automatically just evil for defending their own territories? The answer of this movie is: HELL YES!!! So they must die.They show a little boy (as possibly the only good Arabic guy?), and a lot of other evil brown-skinned fighters. There is a lot of fighting, and if an USA marine gets wounded - they show how everyone is doing everything to save his life. The movie does not care much about the brown-skinned ones, they can just get shot and die.This movie is empty propaganda, and such deserves no stars, but there is no 0 point possible, so I give 1.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Raw and realistic survival.,"Lone Survivor is based upon true failed Operation Red Wings mission in 2005 in which 18 US Navy Seals personal were killed in action. The film delivers a raw but real harsh look inside what happened during those fateful hours. The movie starts with honoring the men and women who serve the US Navy Seals and the ordeals they had to go through to become and a navy seal.Main Cast of movie inculde Senior Lieutenant Erik (Eric Bana) explaining the main plan for capturing terrorist Ahmed Khan who is hiding in the mountain regions of Northern Afghanistan and Navy SEALS Marcus (Mark Wahlberg), Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny (Emile Hirsch) and Matthew (Ben Foster) are assigned this task.

Lone Survivor is nowhere in the league of an epic war film but it deserves recognition as a visceral achievement in depicting modern warfare.,"Hard-edged, gritty and unrelenting, Lone Survivor is an action packed war film that is equally moving and as courageous as some of the tragic real life characters it is based on. While the story is a visceral achievement in depicting modern warfare, the film itself couldn't have arrived at a better time than at the start of a new year. And if this trend continues, 2014 should be another great year at the movies! Written and directed by Peter Berg, Lone Survivor stands testimony to the ill-fated 'Operation Red Wings' – a covert ops mission in 2005 that sent four US Navy SEALS into the Afghan mountains to track and eliminate a high ranking Taliban leader. Berg's narrative uses the first twenty minutes to introduce us to these valiant men. We get a peek into their personal lives – some are newlyweds, others have pictures of their infants. They talk about their hopes and dreams and providing for their families back home. We also get to see what makes them elite soldiers – real life footage of their rigorous training before graduating into Navy SEALs. But out here in a US military base in Afghanistan, their only family is each other. Bound by brotherhood, courage and sacrifice, they are Lieutenant Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Petty Officer Second Class Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Petty Officer Second Class Matt Axelson (Ben Foster). The mission is supervised by Lieutenant Commander Erik Kristensen (Eric Bana) via satellite communications at a remote US base. Outfitted with the latest military hardware, including high caliber firepower and over watch from a high altitude AC-130 gunship, you would expect a bravura show of force. However, Murphy's Law dictates their fate and the first disaster comes knocking in the form of civilians tending to goats. Almost instantly, they become sitting ducks against a hateful enemy in an extremely unforgiving terrain. It's all downhill from here and as the title predicts with ominous certainty, only one of these men make it out alive; that too, barely.As expected in a Peter Berg film, action is heavy and consumes more than half the running time. Battle scenes are thick with the zip and ping of bullets and shrapnel flying in every direction. It gets to such a frenzy that you begin to lose track of who is firing and from where. To counter this, Berg employs frequent 'pink mist' scenes of silhouetted blood spilling to signify confirmed hits. Then he cranks it up to a point where you start to think these SEALs are death defying superheroes. But if this film is based on actual events, then heroes they are, because seeing is believing. Also noticeable is the heavy handed vibes of patriotism emitted through the film. This is second nature for Berg, especially if you have seen The Kingdom, a similarly themed action spectacle that speaks volumes on the culture clash associated with the ongoing war on terror. Even with Berg's signature aspects embedded throughout the film, patriotism is hoisted to a whole new level by honoring the lives of America's slain sons. As a mass media obituary of sorts, this is reserved for the final segment where we get to see the real men who perished - eighteen individuals who made the ultimate sacrifice so that freedom remains a birthright in the motherland.Real combat heroism is not about racking up the body count or triggering spectacular explosions. Real soldiers don't have endless clips of ammo or nerves of steel; or so we have seen in epic war films like Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down. On the other hand, Lone Survivor is nowhere in the league of an epic war film but it deserves recognition as an action-thriller that packs a wallop in suspense driven firefights. Tension mounts even before the first shot is fired and Berg has some of these pre-skirmish scenes tightly packed into a powder keg. Wahlberg and rest of the supporting cast make this possible, even as stuntmen provide visual plausibility for some unbelievable scenes of physical trauma. And although the film ends on a sombre note, there is an indulgent bit of Hollywoodism in the final act that is almost laughable. But after Berg's last travesty, Battleship (2012), the overall making of Lone Survivor resonates the progression of a rising action film director. Welcome back Pete! All is forgiven.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Intense, brutal and emotional.","I saw the trailer for this film and got excited, knowing finally that there would be a film adaptation for the true story of Operation Red Wings. When I saw that Peter Berg was directing this movie, I had mixed emotions. His directing was great in The Kingdom and Friday Night Lights, but Battleship was a train wreck of a movie. I had read the book of the same name and liked it, and I was really hoping that the movie would be good. It exceeded my expectations. From the start I could tell that it wouldn't be 100% true to the real story, but I don't want to spoil anything more than what the title tells us. There is a somewhat cheesy portrayal of the daily life of the SEALs, but it works. Soon the mission is explained and the four men that the film follows are deployed in Afghanistan on a mission to neutralize an important Taliban leader. Of course things go wrong, and the four men are faced with tough moral and consequential decisions. This is where we start to see the actors in their characters. Mark Wahlberg plays the medic Marcus Luttrell, and he plays this role well. This is easily one of his best performances. Taylor Kitsch plays the team leader Michael P. ""Mikey"" Murphy. His acting job is not superb but it is good and believable. Ben Foster plays sniper Matthew G. ""Axe"" Axelson. He stole the show as Charlie Prince in 3:10 To Yuma. He is stern and does a brilliant job as Axelson. Emile Hirsch plays communications expert Danny Dietz. He is good in this role, and although he probably had the least screen time of the four, he is up to par with the rest. They find themselves surrounded by a large number of Taliban fighters. (Estimates vary the force from 10-200.) Any number in that range, these four SEALs are heavily outnumbered. This is where the action begins, and it is gripping. The editing in this 35 minute fight is amazing, every gunshot and explosion is made to be realistic. The fight is very brutal and intense and the audience can feel the sensation of being pinned down by gunfire. When the fight comes to its climax and the bullets start hitting their marks, the film gets emotional. The score, editing, and acting fit well together to make this film an emotional powerhouse. Later we meet Afghan villagers who are ""good guys"". This element is both true to history and good for the film, showing the viewers that turbans don't always make Taliban. At the end there is a very emotional tribute to the fallen. Overall this film did well to tell us a true story of courage and hit us hard emotionally. 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An emotional journey of courage and sacrifice,"""Lone Survivor"" is a gripping war film that takes you on an intense journey through courage, sacrifice, and the resilience of the human spirit.

Great action movie,"Lone Survivor is an excellent movie. It is based on a true story, which will make you appreciate the plot more. The pain and terror that these Seals went thru will have your heart pounding. If you have seen Black Hawk Down and consider it one of your favorites, then Lone Survivor will be a new favorite. The movie begins slow at a military base in Afghanistan and shows the military lifestyle of the Seals. They show clips of the camaraderie and hazing that takes place as well as the relationship with their family in the states. This engages the audience and makes the characters human. Once the action begins with that first shot fired, hold on because it just keeps going from there. The main character played by Mark Wahlberg was a great casting choice. I read the book before the movie came out and when I found out Wahlberg was in the movie as the lone survivor himself, I was excited. He embodied the character that my mind created while reading the book. I recommend this movie to any movie goer that is up for some edge of your seat action. It was intensely entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Realistic War Drama with a Narrow Focus,"""Lone Survivor,"" directed by Peter Berg, is a gripping war film based on the true story of a Navy SEAL mission in Afghanistan. While it delivers intense action and commendable performances, it falls short in providing the depth and character development that could have elevated it from good to great.Mark Wahlberg leads the cast with a solid performance as Marcus Luttrell, bringing a raw and authentic portrayal of a soldier facing unimaginable odds. The supporting cast, including Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster, also deliver strong performances, contributing to the film's emotional impact. Their commitment to their roles is evident, making the characters' struggles and sacrifices feel real and poignant.The film excels in its depiction of the brutal realities of combat. The action sequences are intense and visceral, capturing the chaos and danger of warfare. The cinematography and sound design are top-notch, immersing the audience in the harrowing experience of the SEAL team. The authenticity of the battle scenes, with their graphic depiction of injuries and relentless gunfire, adds to the film's credibility and impact.However, ""Lone Survivor"" is somewhat limited by its narrow focus. The film centers almost exclusively on the mission and the ensuing firefight, with little attention given to the characters' backgrounds or personal lives. This lack of character development makes it difficult for the audience to fully connect with the protagonists on a deeper level. We see their bravery and camaraderie, but we don't get to know them as individuals beyond their roles as soldiers.The film's title also serves as a significant spoiler, which detracts from the suspense and tension that might have otherwise been more impactful. Knowing the outcome from the start diminishes some of the narrative's potential for surprise and emotional resonance.Despite these shortcomings, ""Lone Survivor"" is a well-crafted war film that effectively conveys the heroism and sacrifice of its characters. It offers a sobering look at the realities of modern warfare and pays tribute to the bravery of the soldiers involved. The movie succeeds in its portrayal of the intense bond formed between soldiers and the extreme challenges they face in the field.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic movie,"What this man has been through it is shocking he survived. I feel bad to the families of all the men who died in this operation.

Brutally realistic!,"Lone Survivor (2013) is a film I had avoided for some time. I am a fan of war films, always have been ever since my dad would get me to watch war and westerns with him as a kid. I steered away from this film for so long through not wanting to sit through another American propaganda film aimed at showing how valiantly they fight the good fight. But I decided to suck it up and watch it and I have to say, it was not what I was expecting.The film follows the true story of four Navy SEALS on a recon mission in Afghanistan. They are locating their target and assessing the strength of enemy troops before the main contingent of American lads arrive. After running into some Afgans they have a decision to make, kill them and carry on or let them live but run the risk that they will alert the Taliban. I think we all know which option they chose.This is a film about, as the title suggests, survival. We see these four soldiers get shot, punched, cut, hurt by explosions but the thing which will always stand out for me is the cliffs. These men want to survive so badly that they throw themselves off cliffs numerous times when they find their backs up against it. We see them bouncing down the cliff face, smacking their heads on rocks, crashing through trees and being thrown around like ragdolls. These scenes were truly tense; gripping the side of my sofa I watched and hoped that these men would still be alive when they reach the bottom. As if that wasn't bad enough, they are getting shot regularly from the first encounter, and throughout the film we see them get progressively injured.Every time we see one of the soldiers take a bullet we are reminded that this is a true story, actual soldiers went through what we are seeing on the screen. The realism in this film is something not often seen in an American war film. These are elite soldiers, yet even they have weaknesses, they are not bulletproof and are human just the same as you and I.Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, the lone survivor. He pays this character very well in my opinion; he brings none of his cocky acting style to this role. Instead he swaps it for someone who never says they're dying, but doesn't say they will live either. You could say he is a positive realist.What sets this film apart from most American war films is the stance it takes on the morality on how Afgans should be seen. Many war films will show them all as evil, unable to aim and wanting to kill every white man they meet. This film however shows us a side to these people not often explored; the loyal, compassionate and honour-bound side. We see that not all Afgans are Taliban, not everyone in the country wants to kill the west, but in fact some want to help, some hate the Taliban as much as the west and want nothing more than to see them fail. This is something any logical person knows before watching this film, but it is great to actually see this portrayed on the big screen.So, all in all I was impressed with the films realism and different view on the natives. All of the actors did a good job, nobody stuck out as being bad, but similarly nobody shone for me. But if you like your war films then I would say give this a try, you might like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Movie that is worth Watching!!!!!,"Director Peter Berg made a massive misstep with 2012′s Battleship. There was a decent ninety-minute popcorn movie buried underneath all the bloat, but worst of all, it had no personality. It didn't feel like a movie Berg had to make. Not every movie has to be a serious passion project, but when the passion is on screen, it speaks volumes. That theory is proved well by Berg's latest film, Lone Survivor, his best film since The Rundown. The true life story follows, if you haven't guessed yet, a lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg). You could consider that a spoiler, but the movie opens with the rescue of Luttrell. It's a questionable creative decision because a good deal of film goers will discover Luttrell's journey with this film, but then it becomes more a matter of how Luttrell got there rather than who survived. Berg goes about introducing Luttrell and his team — Matt Axelson (Ben Foster), Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), and Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) — with the standard camaraderie and exposition that's expected. It's a fine set-up, but it's forgotten once the four of them are thrust into battle, where we learn more about them through action.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Great film, a must see.","Not a long drawn out thing, I will leave that to others to go over every detail. The story moves at a great pace and yet spends enough time with the men to draw you and make you really feel for them. The acting is good, very good in parts, and for the most part feels as though the actors are really going through what those poor guys did (portraying that it) The gun fights are very good, again you get the feeling of been there with them and having the fear of danger. Stunt work is a standout point, some by actors (more than normal) but those brave stunt people really earned their paychecks. The location for filming is spot on, there is very little green screen, and again it helps you feel like you are there. My only dis of the film is the last 30mins, it starts to slip from a real feel to a normal action film, but its not enough to hurt the score of this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well done,"Finally a solid war movie came out of Hollywood after a while. It is very watchable and tense all the time. Pretty well story telling, involving and convincing. Good acting. There are some minor downsides but only one real problem with this movie, if you ask me. I understand that 'Lone Survivor' has been made after the real events. However, it is still a feature movie, so it needs a well standing plot logics. I do appreciate the artistic freedom of the director as well as following the facts, but I can't really accept the horse and the dove standing on the same branch. It makes at least one big hole in the movie plot. This is why I can't accept that everything over here happened because four members of the elite special forces deep behind enemy lines let the imprisoned Al Kaida go only for the fact that they were unarmed or too young/old to be shot but not to shoot. I can even accept that these are the facts - but in that case I am sure that we needed the additional explanation to understand the whole picture, not just few isolated facts. And this is what makes these facts very weak: The prisoners where not armed and not part of their mission so they didn't want to kill them. I am not sure about you but I do find this logical until some point. But not the part where they don't want to tie them up. 1. Cause they might freeze to death. They were tough locals living in the place closer to stone age than a/c or gas heating condos, I doubt they would freeze over just one night. 2. They would be eaten by the wolves. 99% of people killed by the wolves are coming from the Hollywood movies. In reality, wolves are afraid of people and are avoiding them. In my opinion, chances of wolves attacking people even if tide up are low. 3. Most important, we talk about the indigenous people, people who know the area as their pocket and are moving like cougars on these stones. Don't you think that someone from the village would notice they disappeared and go after them, if they just left them there? And then, there are their goats all around to notice them easier if that is necessary at all since they were all the time around a mile or two from the village so there were great chances that they would have been found quickly while the seals would have enough time to boogie. Like this, movie scenario suggests that this story happened because four navy seals decided to play good Samaritans and even more than that to make themselves absolutely sure that nothing bad will happen to their Al Kaida prisoners or at least potential Al Kaida company. Once again, I think that movie is still entertaining if we can call it that way since it seems that lot of people died there for real.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great war movie, but not a great film","Very good performances by Ben Foster and especially Taylor Kitsch. Wahlberg was just Wahlberg. Nothing memorable...I think the picture did an outstanding job of showing the viewer what it takes, and means, to be a Navy SEAL. That is what makes it valuable. However, the script was thin. I feel the writer could've taken more time to develop the characters before we jumped into the second act. Also, there is very little context as to why the SEALs are after their target. We get he's a bad guy, but how bad? Why are there lives worth it? The script lacked an incident to really get us behind the SEALs.All in all, I think Peter Berg shot an incredible war film and really made me feel like we were right next to the SEALs the whole time. I just wish there was some more background on the characters and the their mission (i.e., Blackhawk Down).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Its More an Entertainer than an in depth Analysis,"The best way to consider this movie is as a high quality action drama movie rather than a deep look inside acts of war.Platoon, We Were Soldiers etc take a much deeper approach to bring something unique to the screen. Lone Survivor is a war movie/drama that focuses more on the flying bullets and bodies dropping.That is not a complaint, I just want to point out that Lone Survivor is not trying to emulate those other movies (in my opinion).Based somewhat on a true story, LS does a fantastic job of creating urgency and pumping the environment with adrenaline allowing the viewer to step right into the action.

The action sequences were brutal and realistic. It captured the hardships of the Afghan people and the humanity of the non-Taliban people who are driven to help anyone in need. The movie was raw and emotional. It ranks as one of top movies I've seen. The bonus features were worth watching as well. The interviews with the families of the fallen and hearing that they felt the movie was respectful to the memories also made the film even more endearing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent movie must watch,"Contain spoilersI'd give this movie 8.5 stars but have to round up out of the absence of half grades. The movie is very solid and based on a strong real story. I certainly would recommend watching this to anyone, any audience. The movie is superb but itself is a soul wrenching horror story that shows how the price of incompetence in war is death. I was seriously motivated by the movie to get this off my chest here. It's hard to imagine a more horrendous pile up of tactical mistakes made by the SEALS and the rescue mission. I have no beef with the decision to release the hoarders by the SEALS, there was really no choice as this indeed was bound by the rules of engagement. But to not try to tie everyone up and release just the oldest - and the slowest - hoarder, thus getting more time to escape or hide. Or openly argue about the direction of retreat and just go there then and wait, instead of changing direction to try and get lost in the woods, fully realizing they would be followed shortly after. Or giving up high ground in a fight (although there SEALs might had no choice already). Or performing air drop in a clear war zone without trying to generate any kind of suppressing fire, even by firing own firearms, knowing plain and square there is Taliban on the ground, like it was a picnic hike. And not following up with a search for survivors, if any (where is the ""no one gets left behind"" of the US Army we hear so much about in Hollywood blockbusters?). And finally the worst of them all - not taking up a defensible position while it was abundantly clear that the clash with Taliban was extremely likely. In aftermath while watching the things unravel horrendously, it appears that every single decision that had to be made was made wrong by the company leaders, and the loss of life is horrendous. The operation itself is a disaster, with 19 marines dead. The only thing you can say while watching this is Oh My God. Very sad and painful.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ghosted,"A film like this can be a profoundly troubling experience.You know in advance that the US army aided the production, the filmmaker spent time with the SEALS in Iraq, the actors underwent weeks of military training, so it has much more verisimilitude than old westerns did about that time. The characters are not Dick Cheney types planning oil war on maps but rugged cowboys with a family back home, expertly trained to do a job. You take all their bonding and mastery of mind and apply to something completely senseless, killing. You have to juggle the fact it's based on recollection, that it's a film, and that some version of this, probably not far at all from what we see, did happen. You watch two hours of endless pain. You take in a revealing line in voice-over as our 'lone survivor' near the end muses something along the lines that 'brave men died on that mountain to uphold our feared reputation' and you know that it is in the end a reputation of fear. And you get to the end to see images of the real people with friends or in their wedding, just ordinary people, not Rambos, all this still ahead of them.So even though the thing is simple, it elicits a complex response that I would rather confront than store away as propaganda or heroism. The fact is that it tries to perform a solid and precise job, as the men did, that the ugliness is both part of that world and gratuitous, war is, and that by its nature it dehumanizes. Did we need to see them throw themselves off cliffs like rag dolls not once but twice? But presumably that's what happened and that's how dehumanizing war is. We see them shelled and shot at, four guys against a hundred. A sense of injustice wells up and who are we to direct it against? They're fighting faceless Talibans, killing scores with a single bullet yet themselves surviving. But of course that's what the SEALS would see from their end, faceless enemies, and that's how deadly they are. And in retrospect of all that happens, the humane decision to let the Taliban goatherds go registers as woeful mistake, perhaps: they should have snuffed them. The film takes care to insert 'good' Afghans after all, a whole village of them, which also apparently happened.We could say there's no need for a film like this, but then we have the parting images to remind us this is all part of the narrative of who some people are, the celebration of courage and sacrifice as substitute for loss.Granting all this, there's still no room in my narrative for something like this. We enter the lives of some people in a certain moment in time to live through a certain revealing transition, it's what all films do. But history takes a few turns that you can inhabit and leave just bruised by blind necessity, nothing revealed beyond the fact that we can endure it. The real tragedy for me is evoked by the home video of a sergeant's wedding, a few seconds in the end credits, dancing with his bride, slicing cake and kissing, and it's such a tremendous waste that he should go half the world away to blow himself up and all the film can do is retrospectively celebrate a heroism.",,Anonymous,Biography
A heart-pounding journey,"A gripping war movie based on true events. Starring Taylor Kitsch as the brave Navy SEAL, this film takes you on a heart-pounding journey through the hardships faced by a team on a covert mission in Afghanistan.

The action scenes are intense and visceral, making you feel every bullet fly and every explosion rattle your bones. The cinematography does a great job capturing the vastness of the Afghan landscape, adding to the film's authenticity. What really stands out is the emotional weight of the story.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Lone SurvivorThe key to surviving in the wilderness is to avoid going into the wilderness in the first place.Unfortunately, for the Navy SEALs in this action movie, it's part of their job.When a Taliban leader is located in a remote region of Afghanistan, snipers Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster), along with spotters Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Michael P. Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), are dispatched to a nearby mountain range.Waiting for a shot, the team encounters goat herders. Torn between killing them and freeing them, Luttrell eventually let's them go.Moments later, they're attacked by their targets.

A great depiction of War,"Firstly I'd like to start off by saying why the negative reviews and why the so called propaganda term being incorporated with this. I actually found this a compelling, gripping, gritty and realistic true story on the mission operation red wings. This movie is extremely accurate if you have read the book and nearly everything that happens through out the film happened in real life. It may be tough to watch at times but I could never take my eyes of the screen. How is this propaganda ? How I ask. The film to me was actually more an anti- war message being portrayed as it doesn't just show the enemy as the enemy and it shows a different side to Afghanistan, this side we never really hear about. The film also packs some great performances with Taylor Kitch and Mark Wahlberg leading the pack. The films brutality and realistic warfare just adds to the tensity. Seriously if this film had been made 10 years ago it would have been hailed as one of the great war films but in a generation like today's where war movies are all hailed as propaganda it doesn't get the credit it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

From what I have heard the movie was true to the original story that the surviving Navy Seal had experienced and the actors including Mark Wahlberg did an excellent and believable job portraying the Navy Seals. As a Navy veteran, I am personally in ah of Navy Seals and the training they have to endure to be some of our Nations finest. There is now way that i would have been able to complete that training and probably be ringing the bell before the first day of training was over. At the end of the movie, I must say my disgust of Taliban terrorist has increased that they all should be eliminated permanently. There should be no rules of engagement when dealing with them and there sympathizers, no different than the NVA and sympathizers such as Jane Fonda from the Viet Nam era.

"Inconsistent and jingoistic, but it has good points to make.","Peter Berg had to sell his soul to Universal and direct Battleship before he was able to make his passion project of five years Lone Survivor. And now it's made more money than Battleship ever smelt. However, it's hard to say it deserves the honour. There is a lot of passion in the project, but the material is questionable. This may be ironic given my favourite film (The Assassination of Jesse James) but when films rely on the tension of the result that they put on the poster, it's very difficult to invest for me. Captain Phillips and Argo have similar issues and severely lack tension. However, Berg can be decent, he's the guy who directed the first half of Hancock. I found myself thoroughly enjoying the first 10 minutes of Lone Survivor with its powerfully edited montage on the value of brotherhood coupled with surprisingly great cinematography. I'm a sucker for an Explosions in the Sky score too who I'm surprised that Berg has such a strong relationship with.And then I remembered this is the guy who directed the second half of Hancock. Once the story gets going, it doesn't really go anywhere. It doesn't have anywhere to go. All characters are an assortment of clichés with no development to chew on, with rare exception to Ben Foster's engaging performance. Laughably fake makeup and hair really ruins the illusion the writing doesn't give. It spends its time milking the few moral dilemmas that it has before imitating Black Hawk Down's bloodbath on a smaller scale. Suddenly the cinematography and editing I'd been enjoying turn messy. It's unfortunate, but it does pick itself back up by the end. It may be a film that lives in a jingoistic world, but its final points are to make certain exceptions to prejudice. It wants to illustrate that not all Muslims are terrorists and are the true heroes of the story. Little too late to have that open mind but it's a valuable one to have which the film delivers in a moving way even if the characters aren't as strong.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""There's a storm inside of us""","Based on the true story of Operation Red Wings, 2005, LONE SURVIVOR is gripping, well-acted, and well-filmed.

Still, shoot-'em-up scenes in the mountains of Afghanistan very much predominate. That, of course, was mostly what ORW consisted of: Some will like this quality of the film while others won't.

Yes, they did fall, but the ""movie"" might have made it look too Hollywood...well, it's a movie not a documentary, but they did fall down that many times. The injuries were accurate after the fall and how they died. Marcus was not on the hill when his Seal brother made the life saving call, but the gunshot wounds reveal how many times he was shot and it is not hard to deduce this scene. The call was verbally accurate.Wahlberg was decent, but average actor...he is more a personality. The real acting came from Ben Foster and the others. Foster was excellent! Eric Bana strong support. My main issue with Wahlberg was his acting chops when he was to act ""emotional"" when caught. He does injury and pain well, but not so much when he need to be vulnerable. This is why he was so good in Shooter...did not have to display as much needed talent. Also...his monotone delivery is signature, but flip to any other movie he does (I was watching Planet of the Apes on TV a few seconds and it is the same character or Wahlberg being Wahlberg)...he needs to hit the classes and take it to the next level or just be satisfied until we all get tired of the repeat.

A 'War' movie as good as war movies get.,"A 'War' movie as good as war movies get. Yes, they were fighting for a just & noble cause but they were fighting with & for their fellow seals & friends. They develop the personnel well, showing they have and love their families & friends, and have all the feelings & wants of most normal men. The movie brings out just what men, mentally toughened, physically hardened, and disciplined by their training, can do, can overcome in time of need and trials. The movie has plenty of action for those that want it and much more of the interpersonal to add depth. There is blood & gore but not of the 'normal hollywood slasher' type. Yes, I would recommend reading the book for the bigger picture of this factual event but this movie does a good job of representing the book.

Emotional,"Lone Survivor could be compared to Peter Berg's Friday Night Lights since he relied on the same tools, a very stylish cinematography and a soundtrack still from Explosion in the Sky that both arouse this such singular emotion, and it works more than well.Sure, the story remains very classic but you get carried away by this band of brothers and their incredible will to survive this trap, through a nervous camera that perfectly films, and with no restraint, the violence of combat.The rhythm is intense and gives the viewer little respite, too bad the epilogue, calmer but also more laborious, breaks this such good dynamic and struggles to conclude a captivating, emotional movie which, for once, avoids the foreigner-bad guy stereotype, and which you will forgive its few clichées and melodramatic dialogues.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lone Survivor: Yet Another Over-exaggeration,"Muhammad Mustafa Mustaan was born in Afghanistan and witnessed first- hand the US invasion of the countryThe film ""Lone Survivor"" topped the box office after screening in cinemas. It had to do well as the storyline was based around four brave, invincible US Navy Seals facing in the Afghan war. After a compassionate decision of letting unarmed shepherds go free, they were caught in a firefight where US navy seals fought hundreds of Afghan Taliban fighters until the very last bullet. All of the navy seals perished except one 'lone survivor' who was offered protection after the rescue helicopter was shot down. The story did not end there as the lone survivor was protected by the people of a village, though he was still ready to fight with the only grenade left with him. Afterwards, the American army sent hundreds of soldiers, right in the middle of a firefight amongst hundreds of Taliban fighters and the few villagers who are trying to protect him.The truth however is very different.The true depiction of events is that a US Chinook helicopter was shot down in Eastern Afghanistan while it was transporting a number of Navy Seals to the area. One soldier survived the crash with severe injuries, who then managed to seek protection from an Afghan villager nearby. There was no firefight between the villagers and the Taliban, and the US did not dare to send any helicopter again and only sent a military convoy to the region two days later.One needs to consider the following:1. In Afghan-Pashtun culture, anyone who seeks 'Nanawatae' (protection) by entering any house, carrying no arms and as a true-seeker of help (the person must be in extreme need of help for his life) is protected by the family members as well as the people of the village. This applies even to enemy combatants.2. In 2005 the Afghans were unaware of the reality and nature of the US armed forces, and hence were quite susceptible to provide protection to any soldier, especially if he was seriously injured.3. The Taliban reorganized in 2003, however their numbers in individual units was only in the 10's and in rare cases up to 20. This continued well beyond 2005 and the numbers of the units only increased after thousands of Afghans joined the Taliban for the revenge of their family members who were killed by indiscriminate American air bombings and drone attacks. Until today the Taliban do not walk together in groups of more than 20 due to the fact that they can easily become targets of US signature strikes.This movie is another desperate act by the US to show it won the war and that the sacrifices were needed. This movie is another example of an incident which is completely misrepresented. It serves as an opportunistic tool to legitimize the unjustifiable war in the eyes of the general public. It is similar to the film 'The Hurt Locker,' which was based on an overly exaggerated account of those soldiers who were part of failed missions, including missions such as Blackhawk Down, where hundreds of American soldiers were killed in Mogadishu and in addition to two of their helicopters shot down and tens of their armored vehicles were destroyed.While this movie and more of its types will sell well in the US and the Western world, in order to justify its inhumane war, it will not change the reality of the war in which the US is bleeding to death and the anger and outrage it continues to evoke in the Muslim world.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very Good: 8.0,"Peter Berg has an unsteady track record, to say the least. Having directed such masterpieces as Hancock and Battleship, I wasn't exactly bursting with confidence when I saw his name on the bottom of the poster. As it turns out, I needn't have worried. Though Lone Survivor is unquestionably heavy-handed in its message and storytelling, it is also an emotional, visceral look into one of the U.S. military's most infamously botched operations. As you could probably tell from the title, only one of the four members of SEAL Team 10 is left standing by the end. But in the time I saw them, it was a bit too difficult to really care about them. Sure, each one had their own charm, but none of them (even Mark Wahlberg's character) really felt like people; just weapons that happened to misfire in the wrong place and at the wrong time. For what it's worth, however, the film is well-written, and the final fifty minutes are nothing short of spectacular. Just don't walk in expecting Saving Private Ryan.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I have rarely seen such powerful acting or direction.It was like being there, and if you are afraid of being in the middle of a firefight, please, don't go.We had seen the interview of Mark Luttrell on 60 Minutes, and knew the story. As I said, this was like being there, and the entire audience was taken along.This was in Aurora, CO, we have a large military presence, and maybe that was why the audience was so engaged, but I was also, and I never served.

Realism at its best,"I can't get this movie out of my head. I hate to use the term. ""It can't be unseen"" because it sounds like a bad thing. I'm very torn. This is an amazing story of the heroism of these Navy SEALS. A true story that you become immersed into. There's a love and brotherhood shared by these men that was portrayed right away. The acting served them justice, it felt so very real. But on the other hand, the extreme graphic nature of war was also portrayed without anything held back. It was horrifying and heartbreaking and I cried quit a bit. Just knowing what's coming brought tears in some scenes. It was overly graphic and I can't unsee what I saw, but i also respect the produces for showing the reality of war without distorting or holding back. It was truth. Just that. I definitely recommend this movie if you can stomach real war visuals. And I mean more real than I've even seen, and I've seen it all. There were several times I covered my eyes, ears or both. But in the end I left saddened and overwhelmed but also left with a higher respect for our brave servicemen and women and also the realization that they are just people, like anyone else with lives and families outside of their service and uniforms and this reality grips you when the many photos and videos of the real men that were portrayed in the movie are shown at the end of the movie. There hasn't been a movie affect me so much in a very long time, if ever. And I was not the only one affected. I heard and saw many tears. I have a much different outlook after watching this movie. This movie will change you. God Bless the men and women of our armed forced.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Passionate, immersive and moving.","In 2012's Act of Valor, current serving Navy SEALs were cast in order to inject realism into the action scenes, which they did, however the film couldn't overcome the dire acting and leaden dialogue to land out on top. With a group of dedicated A-listers undergoing an intensive boot camp before production, Lone Survivor proves that it's easier for professional actors to look the part in combat than it is for real soldiers to sprout a screenwriter's words. As the four- man team sent into the hills of Afghanistan to kill or capture an integral Taliban leader – which doesn't go as planned – Mark Whalberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster are fantastic. Their convincing portrayals and natural chemistry with each other ensures the audience has an immediate investment into their fates and makes the series of unfortunate events on their mission even more gruelling and gut-wrenching to witness. Writer-director Peter Berg has spoken about how this was a passion project for him (he took a pay cut on Universal's Battleship to get funding from the studio for this) and he proudly wears his patriotic devotion on his sleeve every step of the way. The opening act is relaxed, calm and humorous, slowly building a sense of camaraderie whilst introducing the military jargon and operational lifestyle. The extended middle act, where the bulk of the battle ensues, is a tour de force in modern warfare filmmaking. The meticulously researched gunfight is authentic and pulse-racing, amped up with tight, clear editing and an immersive sound design (unsurprisingly garnering an Oscar nod) that places you right in the middle of the action. Berg makes a crucial misstep with a dragged out, patience-testing denouement, but Lone Survivor remains in the higher echelon of war pictures and warrants a big screen viewing.",,Anonymous,Biography
As gripping as a death match on Call Of Duty,"A gripping action packed war film. The Hurt locker meets Saving Private Ryan.An high octane all action war movie, now I am not in the army and have no knowledge of what its like to be in a situation of life or death but this film seems to me the most realistic portrayal an actual war zone then most other films of the same genre in recent years. The film starts off quite slow but be patient because after half hour you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen as your thrown into the heat of battle. Its just as gripping as being in a call of duty death match. The hairs on the back of your neck will stand up as you feel the fear the soldiers are feeling as bullets reign down around them. Mark Wahlberg leads a group of four American soldiers stranded without a radio connection behind enemy lines as a mission goes wrong deep in Taliban controlled Afghanistan.This film is based on true life events, if you love war films there is no reason you wont love this one.http://raroe.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a movie for the squeamish...but a must-see,"I watched this movie, and all I can say is, ""Wow."" This movie has a gritty authenticity that makes it great, and at times almost unbearable to watch.The movie begins with BUD/S candidate training. You get a feel for the grueling training/qualification/preparation that is designed, as the movie says, to show the candidates that their mind can make their body do more than they ever thought it was capable of...this training is put to good use by the men in the field.Watching the SEAL team pay a price for a responsible and kind-hearted act was very difficult. By doing the ""right"" thing, they knowingly put their own lives in jeopardy. An extremely graphic ""Saving Private Ryan"" type of realism fire-fight shows the toughness and superior warrior skills of the SEALS, as they fight against overwhelming odds. It's hard to watch, yet at the same time, shows just how physically and mentally tough a SEAL warrior is...it's amazing.I'm trying really hard not to write a book here, or give any spoilers. However, I think everyone should see this movie to understand what our men in uniform go through in battle. Since virtually all SEAL missions are classified, we never get to hear about the heroic actions of men like these that result in saving lives for their brother soldiers, as well as innocent civilians.The movie brought a tear to my eye, and made me reflect on the sacrifice so many have made for this country. I don't agree with any need for the USA to be in the Afghan or Iraq wars, but I do respect those who serve so unselfishly. This movie made me reflect on their ultimate sacrifices--most of which we don't hear about.Go see this movie. I hope it serves as a catalyst to bring our brave soldiers home once and for all.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
terribly effective movie,"Lone Survivor is a brutally effective movie, made by people thinking they're serving their country. However these people make the audience coarser and more self-centered. They perpetuate the kind of propaganda that sent the heroes of the Seal Team 10 to death. The film is intense though but balanced by the moments of surprising tenderness, among the men themselves and also in the field. The ensemble cast delivers properly, working with a screenplay telling the story with considerable force. The story itself is not just about a fire fight with the enemy, it regards more the sense of brothers in arms helping each other to survive. This is what makes the film powerful and somewhat satisfying in a terrible sort of way.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The trouble they face during war is shown very very realistic and the decision making as also hard bound when we look at it. It also show do not judge people by their location or race.

We were to send back few movie rentals, but took the opportunity to borrow few other movies in return.The Lone Survivor was one of them I chose and NOT REGRET. I will say this, even though I am brought in an Islamic country and my family are Muslims. The movie is mind-blowing, excellent & crazy.I love this movie, I think it is a great movie. Why? Because The movie is about America & Afghanistan. It is also nice to learn the different cultures & groups in Afghanistan. It is also enlightening to learn about the life of American soldiers who swear to live for their country. I admire their courage, speech, bravery, & spirits. BRAVO!!!Just as There are Ups & Downs in every movie, there are Ups & Downs in this movie. However, The acting is also believable. Mark Wahlberg played his part really well as the Petty Officer First Class. I like his character Marcus Luttrell in this movie. I believe he is a good guy in real life but I heard that he didn't return & help the people from Afghanistan back after the events. (No Spoiler I hope)Anyway, The soldiers are amazing. I respect. I think Taliban & terrorists are cruel, violent & inhumane at times. The movie shows that America is strong at heart. Their soldiers are strong at heart too. I also love the Afghanistan people(good people) in the movie. They too, have strong heart!I am a fan of militant movies, war movies, helicopters & flying jets, armored vehicles, etc so if you are not like me even...then watch this movie and you can learn something.

Best Film,"Filmmaker Peter Berg and crew put together an awesome film. The acting was top notch. Mark Wahlberg did a great job in portraying Marcus, even with the variance in their backgrounds. Ben Foster did an absolute excellent job in performing like Axe and as a Tier one operator. Foster maintained that focused, tactical persona and it showed in every expression. All these guys showed the lighter side of Brotherhood and then into the fight of their lives. I've seen this film twice within one week. Without going into specifics, I sat with other men who operate in the environment portrayed, some were former SEAL operators, some were SWAT members. All were men that I've served with where we have been tasked to the point of a firefight. Nothing even close to the Hell Marcus and these fine men went through. The Brotherhood and team spirit that is real was shown in this film to an extreme. This film accurately depicts men, warriors, brothers, loss and humanity. This is the proper way to honor these men, show they are human and a how they are patriots.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Actual combat veterans consider this one of the most realistic and accurate portrayals of combat in Afghanistan,"Moreover the book itself is considered extremely accurate. Not full of allegory and falsehoods like Jones' Thin Red Line, but actual realism.
I should note that perusing the negative reviews here I see that virtually all are single use accounts, and that the language is repetitive. This indicates one or two account users who set up multiple accounts. The negative reviews are all from people with no military and certainly ZERO combat experience in Afghanistan. We have claims like that ""modern rifles"" ""rip people in half."" That is an inversion of the actual truth about modern military calibers which for the huge part are not high power, but pretty much the weakest rifle round used (eg 5.56) . We also have claims by reviewer alcibiades-ej"" using a different account that that in Lutrell's book Murphy held a ""vote"" and in the film Murphey just made a decision. That is not what happens. The book and the film are failry consistent on that. Lt. Murphy did poll the squad members as to what they thought. That is not the same as a vote. He also made his own decision. Nothing inconsistent with that. That same reviewer also claims that Director Peter Berg had the afghan farmers ""display no soldierly virtue"" and not yet also be able to find the Seal squad. That isn't inconsistent at all, and in fact that is exactly true
It is a fact that the Taliban were combatants but NOT soldiers. They did not know or use proper infantry tactics. Did not use enfilade and defilade, or covering fire. They tended only to attack villages and engage combatant personnel only when they had overwhelming force; some were decent marksme, most were not. Virtually none had optics. so a team of four seals would, in an actual firefight, dominate until the numbers of opponents were huge (and they were at 100 to 200 by the end). And yes what the afghans would be able to do in the diaylight is know the local area, and in fact find the seal squad. The goatherds working with the Taliban portrayed in the film would know where every single trail and track would go, what could be seen from where, etc.. They would goatherds and locals WOULD know what tracks/trails to get on to get to the sound of the gunfire.Lastly the negative reviewers tend to say the Afghan war was pointless or lost. Really? 9/11 was caused by state level Afghan Taliban support, organizing and refuge of major terrorist's organizations, with thousands of Al Qaeda operating freely in Afghanistan. In fact supported by the Taliban government. How many 9/11s out of Afghanistan have we had since? We stomped the Al Qaeda and its allies there, and made them profoundly fearful of acting against the US from any bases there. Our secondary goal of scaring other state level actors from doing the same also worked. This was especially important after Clinton administration's failure to address the problem at all for eight straight years. More so given the entire al qaeda 911 operation infrastructure, planning, equipping, school at US flight schools was already done during clinton's endless prevarication, and set to go by the time Bush got into office/As an tertiary goal we wanted to set up schools, and some of the instruments of democracy. That proved elusive. But that doesn't change the fact that were were entirely successful with our primary and secondary goals. You have to be a complete fantasy land to say it was unsuccessful it the major goals/.This is a great film. It is really entertaining, and very realistic. And from the point of view of actual US combat veterans who served in Afghanistan, a brilliant piece of filmwork",,Anonymous,Biography

"For the most part, thrilling and moving stuff","Like 2004's excellent, melancholy Friday Night Lights (and the TV series that followed), Peter Berg injects Lone Survivor with the same sense of camaraderie, as a band of brothers go to near- impossible lengths to carry out the task at hand. But where Lights took place on the football pitch, Lone Survivor is set amongst the unforgivable terrain of the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan. Based on sniper Martin Luttrell's book (here he is played by Mark Wahlberg), the events that took place in June 2005 was one of the most gruelling acts of warfare ever recorded.After receiving orders to execute Ahmad Shah, a Taliban leader responsible for deaths of over a dozen marines, a Navy SEAL's unit headed by Erik Kristensen (Eric Bana) plan for a quick operation. Luttrell, team leader Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), sniper 'Ax' Axelson (Ben Foster) and communications specialist Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) are picked for the job, and are dropped onto a steep and jagged Afghan hillside. They locate their target, but after experiencing some communication problems, come across a Taliban sheep-herder and two children. After deciding to obey the rules of engagement and let them go, they are soon pursued by a small army, who rain bullets and rockets down upon them.Starting with the same twangly-guitar music that steeped Friday Night Lights so beautifully and richly in atmosphere, the film begins with heavy in shots of sunsets, our heroes staring at photographs of their loved ones. and cracking wise over dinner. It doesn't do much to help us distinguish one from the other (apart from the fact they are all recognisable faces), but it does establish a sense of foreboding doom. The opening scene depicts a bullet-ridden and near-dead Luttrell before skipping back in time, so the outcome of a film called 'Lone Survivor' leaves little ambiguity. And when the bullets start to fly, Peter Berg shows us one of the most brutal and realistic depictions of war even put on film.The four are shot, blown up, and in the most wince-inducing scenes, thrown down a hillside of sharp rocks and thick trees, where we get to experience every impact and every bone broken. It's an endless array of loud violence, and when you finally think it's over as Luttrell is aided by Afghan villagers, they still more to come. It's in the later scenes when the film becomes less a serious study of warfare and bravery, and becomes more of a Hollywood movie. There's a lot added in these scenes that didn't happen in real life, and it feels like an unnecessary attempt to appease an audience used to more traditional action-movie climaxes. But for the most part, this is thrilling, and quite moving, stuff.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Peter Berg unveils a brutal, uncompromising, but ultimately moving picture of the bravery and heroism of Navy Seals","Peter Berg pulls no punches when showcasing the heroism of U.S soldiers and the tragedy of war that consumes the inner and outer soul of human beings in this gritty retelling of a Navy Seal mission gone terribly wrong. Based on the real-life story told by former Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell who endured an unforgiving taste of active combat, this film sees Berg, director of military action flick 'The Kingdom', high school sports drama 'Friday Night Lights' followed by its television series of the same name, and science-fiction actioner 'Battleship', painting an uncompromising portrait of war in the Middle East laying the groundwork for a true story of a failed 2005 Navy Seal mission Operation Red Wings. It is violent, it is bloody, but most importantly, it is powerful in its testament about the moral complexities that put a group of soldiers' bravery and commitment to the test. And without glorifying war, this movie powerfully strikes at the heart with its mean portrayal of the harsh realities of active combat. The film follows Navy Seals Marcus Lutrell (played by Mark Wahlberg), Lieutenant Michael Murphy (played by Taylor Kitsch), Matthew Axelson (played by Ben Foster), and Danny Dietz (played by Emile Hirsch) who were sent by Commander Erik S. Kristensen (played by Eric Bana) into the mountains of Taliban to take out Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. Upon stumbling across three Taliban civilians, the squad has a heated debate of whether to execute them and risk being charged of a war crime, or letting them go. They choose the latter which leaves them with no choice but to compromise the mission. Unfortunately, before they are able to retreat, they are caught in the crossfires of the Taliban militia. Before they know, they are pitted in a brutal fight for survival.As you can tell by the title, the result of the mission did not end very well. The mission as a whole was a major failure that left its sole survivor in shambles. Nonetheless, the greatest asset lying within Peter Berg's directorial muscle is his gritty demonstration of the soldiers' bravery and commitment to protecting each other in the midst of the chaos that reigned upon them. And he does so without breathing a jingoistic attitude into the mix. If there is a weakness peaking into his portrayal of the grisliness of war, it is his shortage of character development which is left heavily buried under his exhibition of active combat, which follows a turning point sequence where they are forced to make a thought-provoking decision to comply with smart, if questionable moral responsibility. Despite the glaring flaw, that does very little to diminish the brutality of active combat as these four Navy Seals are overwhelmed by a horde of Talibans unleashing their bullets on them, followed by not one but two nasty falls down a cliff that would leave more than a few broken bones. Shot effectively by Tobias Schliesler, these scenes of combat earnestly showcase not only the bravery of these soldiers but to emotional impact that rains on them as they are forced to endure the unforgiving chaos. As for Mark Wahlberg, it does a magnificent job at fueling his role with gripping humanity, as does Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster working along his side. These four exhibit a palpable chemistry that plays a strong role in the emotional touch during their hour of chaos.Lone Survivor is a brutal, violent, but ultimately moving retelling on a real-life Navy Seal story. It is a powerful picture that has more to say than just ""war is hell"", it offers a fair amount of food for thought that many are likely to admire in the midst of the heroism splashed onto nearly every frame. If there are a few tears, there is a good reason for them.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worse than Rambo,"It had got good reviews, so I sat down with my evening meal to enjoy. Half an hour in and I was beginning to wonder. One hour in and I was thinking, this is going nowhere, it's a five out of ten, and I think I will register my vote. Super American heroes under overwhelming fire power are retreating. They fall down a couple of cliffs, bouncing off granite rocks, their bodies bent 90° as they hit trees. Still they get up, and the bullet tally mounts. All four seem to have taken a dozen or more body shots. And still they go on.By this time I'm thinking how bad can this get, it's a 3 out of 10 now. Amazingly three of the four fugitives finally succumb to all they have been through - at last, though totally improbable that they lasted this long. The remaining hero with all his wounds pushes a broken patella back into his knee (2 out of 10 now) and then takes refuge in a village where the locals take him in. An extremely unlikely situation!Here is where it gets worse than Rambo. Our hero takes a knife and performs delicate operations on his leg, removing bits of tree, bullet or bone - whilst wincing and biting on some cloth in his teeth. Who cares by this stage - we know he can't die!I easily guessed what was going to happen next - the American helicopter calvary swings into view, strafing everyone in the village (apart from the 'goodies') and rescuing our remaining hero. 1 out of 10. Why are people still making films like this? Great sets, acting and camera work, but a film story that beggars belief!

Excellent Movie!,"Since I have never been in the military, I am not sure if all the details of this movie were accurate, but once I got into watching it, that really didn't matter to me.The only reason I gave this movie a 9 out of 10, is because there is one disturbing scene, that I think could have been much less graphic than it was.Mark Wahlberg was excellent in this movie, as were the other actors.Since this movie came out Christmas Day, I figured by now most would have already been to see it, but that was not the case. The theater was packed, the movie was sold out, and it was difficult to even find a seat! When I saw that, I knew the movie must be a good one.Either way, this movie made me respect the young men and women who serve our country.

It does what it says on the tin,"I know you really shouldn't put 'spoilers' in film reviews, but the title itself must give you a bit of a clue regarding what eventually happens. 'Lone Survivor' is the true story of an ill-fated U.S. Navy Seals mission to root out the Taliban.Mark Wahlberg plays the leader (or at least the main) Navy Seal on the mission, so no prizes for guessing who's the one who makes it to the final credits. However, just because you probably already know what happens, doesn't really detract from the film's tension. No one really stands out as giving the performance of a lifetime. All the main characters (who speak English) are functional, i.e. the play battle-hardened soldiers as you'd expect.It's actually pretty scary stuff. There aren't exactly a million different special effects used (or required) to tell the story. It's quite a simple affair, i.e. a small squad of soldiers in the woods, deep behind enemy lines. But, when they finally come into contact with those they're there to destroy, things do not go according to plan and they end up being the ones on the receiving end.Being a true story helps. It does make you ponder what troops go through and the lack of big budget special effects give it a much more gritty feel (although, sometimes watching guys run through a wood did make it feel a little like a 'made-for-TV' movie).It's nothing revolutionary, but, if you're into true life war films or are generally interested in modern armed conflict, it's certainly worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Can't elaborate any more without giving away some of the plot.As a war movie, it's pretty accurate-looking, although many moments are distinctly 'Hollywoodized' (particularly one of the death scenes), and the movie makers love of glamorizing explosions is often present.There is an excess of glib chat between soldiers - there would have been no harm to the accuracy of the movie in toning this down, it didn't tell me anything about the characters or plot. Mark Wahlberg's closing line, obviously something significant, was incomprehensible to me.There's a lot of padding at the beginning and end of the movie, with shots of service personnel training and other matter, which was repetitive and didn't add to the product as a movie or documentary. Also a lot of slow-motion and intrusive music score, particularly in the earlier part of the movie.So, a lot of criticism from me, but ... eight out of ten all the same, less one point because of the uneven production issues mentioned above. It's quite good, and leaves one thinking a little. Lone Survivor takes a step further than the much hyped Zero Dark Thirty, by recognizing the role of the people whose home actually is Afghanstan. This is done in a simplistic way, but then this is really a movie about soldiers doing their stuff, and how they cope (or don't) when things go wrong. Grim, but with a thankful message of hope in human nature by the end. Would have loved to have given it eight (although certainly not nine), but it's just a bit to ragged and uneven in places.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Powerful and crude, This movie deserves 10/10.","This movie shows its audience the brutally crude and horrible reality of war. It is an emotional powerhouse that will make you appreciate you are living in a peaceful country, and are able to enjoy a motion picture.All the actors do a great job. Mark Wahlberg is at his best, and the supporting cast are able to captivate the audience. The fact that this is based on real life events makes this even more impressive.I hope their roles were true to the actual soldiers they were playing.I am glad this movie was made the way it was.

A film based on a true story worth watching.,"wasn't sure about this film before watching, thought it might be a bit of a slow drama about how caring and brave US soldiers are in the face of adversity. And it's a true story so however the film depicts them, it must be true..In fact this film is about a group of soldiers getting shot the crap out of for over and hour. where in most films two groups of people shoot at each other, and bullets fly off the ground and rocks, but unless they land a fatal blow, people generally don't get hit, pretty much the opposite here, they get hit.. a lot. I mean they really did not have a good day up on that hill. And the hero of it all, was a local villager.Was a good film, and the slideshow of the end of the real people depicted in the film was good, especially the one of the 'lone survivor' and the villager that saved him.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful Film!,"This movie has been snubbed for every Oscar this year and it has been unjustly snubbed because Lone Survivor is one of the best films of 2013.Mark Whalberg pulls off an amazing performance and so does Taylor Kitsch. Peter Berg's direction is incredible and the way this movie is filmed made it even more intense.This movie was, in my opinion, more brutal of a film than the critically acclaimed 12 Years a Slave.Everyone should see this movie it is incredible.I'm going to give Lone Survivor an A+",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not What I Expected Wahlberg Saved This Movie !,"It wasn't much what I expected based on IMDb ratings , box office . Literally Mark Wahlberg's performance saved this movie from being a complete failure . I think the screenplay wasn't that good and din't made it a real action movie but mostly of the time in first 50 minutes was boring as f*** . Only Mark when was left by himself the only that survived the movie started to revive the movie . His fantastic acting skills made the movie awesome with his dramatic role .The script (story) was fantastic , but I don't know maybe the producing or director or something turned into a boring movie till some point Mark came and saved it .Love Mark's performance 6.8/10 this movie :D",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood Ruination,"Forget politics or patriotism (whether blind or the real thing). This movie made absolutely no tactical sense whatsoever. I cannot believe that elite seals could make such stupid tactical decisions. It has to be Hollywood's attempted dramatization for effect - which essentially ruins the movie for anyone with half a brain.Equally nonsensical was the seal 4 man recon team's ability to absorb fire. Seriously, how many 7.62mm rounds can one unarmored human take without bleeding out or at least going into shock if not plain old dying (and where the hell was their armor)? Multiple RPG blasts at 1-2 feet away without so much as ringing ears, much less brain hemorrhaging? Oh and lets not forget that gravity + rocks = bouncy castle injuries.If you want to see a proper combat movie, go for Black Hawk Down (Eric Bana is 1000x better in that). If you want to see marky mark as a baddass soldier then watch Shooter.Don't watch this unless you're bored and it's free... and you're drunk... or naturally kinda dumb already.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Based on the""Operation Red Wings"" mission. Four navy seals are tasked to capture Ahmad Shahd.","Mark Wahlberg,Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, and Eric Bana play true navy seals and pull it off, the movie is an emotional, bloody, and a bit of humor. the realism the actors portray makes it feel like a gritty documentary and that's why I love this film. each second is a thrill ride that's gets better its twist and each fall you get scared for the characters and I haven't felt like this since Captain Phillips. Mark Wahlberg is the one who truly gives the film it's glory he truly is talented. Each actor makes the movie real like they are the person you can feel that this is how the real men of operation red wings act and reacted. 8.6/10 in my opinion",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliantly depicted horror of modern warfare,"Wahlberg is a pretty good bet for superior acting and this film doesn't disappoint. He plays the titular lone survivor, no spoiler alert there, and lived to tell the tale and write the book about his horrific experience in the field. Whilst an American production, it wasn't as flag-wavingly red white and blue as I expected and whilst that's always good, we do expect a little understandable bias but I liked how the film pushed hard the fact that not ALL people from that part of the world are bad. The Gulab villagers were incredibly brave and true to their beliefs of hospitality and obviously Marcus Luttrell owes his life to the father and son, who risked their lives for him.The premise of the film obviously told you the ending, which does diminish some of the anxiety and stress of the action, but there is still a lot of horrific scenes of war and conflict. The action was generally graphic, realistic and powerful but a few bits were too ""staged"" but knowing that it was a true story overrode any of the minute flaws in the production of the film. Photography and editing were good - the camera always in amongst the action and low level, almost like hand held and therefore emotion watching the film ran high as the viewer was in the centre of what was happening. Certainly not a film for those viewers who don't like blood and gore, but realistic SFX of combat. With my limited knowledge the procedural aspects of the film seemed good (Luttrell was involved in production) and I noted his documentation of the concept that the Generals in war were able to stand back and send their men into untenable situations like pawns on a chess board and they are safe back in the bases behind the lines was commentary on the unfairness of combat on the ground. All the actors in the squad were good at their individual personalities and characters and overall the film was engaging and exciting, if a little emotional. Whilst not necessarily the sort of film you could watch over and over, it is certainly one that would stand repeat viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gritty war movie with a heavy sense of realism,"Lone Survivor is the depiction of a navy mission that fails and leaves the men entrusted to carry it out in an out gunned fight with a huge taliban force. Based on real events, the movie is presented with a fantastic sense of realism. This is a war movie at its best and the scenes leave nothing to imagination. Whether it's the terrible effects of the explosions or the cringe worthy wounds these men suffer, you will find yourself very attached to what's going on. All the performances are equally and resoundingly superb. Throughout the whole ordeal the bond these soldiers share will be tested and in the end it will triumph despite the obvious consequences.This is usually a genre that doesn't do it for me. I like most of the films and some are exquisitely better than others (E.G: Saving Private Ryan). What makes this one a little more interesting than others is the incredible courage of these man and the sacrifices some of them made. Lone Survivor is about as real as a war movie will get nowadays. I certainly understand the praise and is deserved. On a personal note it is merely yet another movie I enjoyed due to great entertainment values.Rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great inspirational true story!!!,"Lone Survivor 8/10- I did not know what to think coming into this movie. I have seen so many disappointing war movies I have lost count. Lone Survivor though, was a truly great war film that is probably the best war movie of the past ten years.Now, I have no clue if these kind of films are realistic or not since I have never been in any situation remotely like the ones in this movie, but people I know who have been say that this movie is one of the only realistic war movies they have ever seen. That itself is something very rare. For those of you that do not know the plot to the movie, Lone Survivor tells the story of four NAVY SEALS who are tasked to go a mission to neutralize a high-level Taliban operative and are forced to fight for their lives when the mission goes wrong.It starts out with footage of NAVY SEALS training and it is amazing to believe all of the stuff they have to do to become biggest badasses in the world. I could not imagine how mentally and physically tough a person could be to go through all of that and all of these actors in Lone Survivor were able to portray these roles very well. Mark Wahlberg, who plays Marcus Luttrell, gave his usual amazing tough guy performance and gives this movie exactly the right character portrayal that it needs. Taylor Kitsch, who plays the leader of the mission Mike Murphy, gave probably the best performance of his career and I am very glad that he is finally is in a successful film. Emile Hirsch, who plays Danny Dietz, gives a good enough performance to make his character memorable enough. Without a doubt, the best performance of the movie was surprisingly by Ben Foster, who play Matt Axelson. He gave his character more life than any of the others. The acting though is not the thing that the audience remembers when they leave the theater.The action scenes are amazingly crafted and are the best I have ever seen. It just seems impossible how well the director was able to make it look like the NAVY SEALS got shot or fell through the forest like rag dolls. I do know who was the head of that department, but that guy deserves an Oscar. One thing that I also like about this movie is it doesn't just show the Middle Eastern people as the bad guys, Lone Survivor shows how a lot of the people are and how they feel about the Taliban. It really showed me a new light about the Gulf War and how it happened. What I personally loved about this movie, is the message that it leaves you with. It inspires you to go farther than you can possibly imagine and to never give up. It plants the idea in the audiences minds that if these NAVY SEALS can go through all of this stuff and not complain, I have a pretty good life and have very little to complain about.This movie could be a little too much for some people as it is pretty gory in some scenes, but for those who can handle it, you will love this movie and feel incredibly inspired as you walk out.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top notch action with a weak script,"There is much to admire in Peter Bergs tribute to the men lost in the botched 2005 Operation Red Wings Military expedition but there is an overall feeling one gets also that Berg has himself to blame for failing to properly establish his 4 leading men beyond typical war film characitures and give the film an identity and audience affiliation that would of allowed the film to pack a much bigger emotional punch.Lone Survivor starts things out in promising fashion with the opening montage of real life military training giving the audience insight into what these man endure to become elite soldiers. The subsequent segment at the Military base of the man gives off the sense also that we will be spending some quality time getting to know the man involved in the real life tragedy but it's merely a false pretense for once the operations starts all character growth is stunted in favor of typical war skirmishes despite them being unquestionably well staged.Berg delivers world class direction of a roughly 40 minute barrage of frighteningly realistic action that while acting as edge of your seat, white knuckle filmmaking due to a disappearance of any character we truly know or care for it can only take the film so far. In the lead role as Marcus Luttrell Wahlberg gives one of his less charismatic turns with only Ben Foster making something worthwhile in an acting sense with his turn as Axe. When talking about Kitsch and Hirsch they equally don't get an opportunity to make much of there underwritten roles which is a strange thing considering the wealth of information that would of been made available to Berg upon research of these real life man and when reading about the films research time spent to do justice to them in the movie it would be considered a failure for the film in allowing us to not get a sense of who they were as there lost in a spray blood squibs and bullets.Lathering on the patriotism thick and fast Lone Survivor is a impressive feat of filmmaking that is not allowed to truly shine thanks to its lacklustre script and cardboard characters. With more time spent on the script and developing these brave men into more than mere movie soldiers that movie would of been a sure fire war classic cut from the same cloth as films like Black Hawk Down and Platton. Special mention must also be paid to the stunt team on this film who on face value look to have endured some serious bruising on there work here.3 and a half agonizing mountain side falls out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies in Action & Biography,"True stories are always awesome topics for movies. This movie also based on the awesome story. The Red Wings Operation was really sad history for US military history and these had showed how it was hard to fight against Taliban in their land.I want also mention that Eric Bana is always good option for acting positive and spirited leaders and in this movie he again did his best. The only weak point of the work is maybe some fighting episodes were so exaggerated, especially rolling downs in couple times. I strongly recommend for biography and history lovers. I always prefer scenarios which are based on true stories like Lone Survivor and could say that this movie met my expectations.

Action packed,"The Thing with ""Lone survivor"" is that its an action movie. An action movie that's based on a true story. Trouble is, its one of those ""they couldn't possibly survive that in real life"" kind of action movies. So the only problem I really had with it. Was over how true the stuff that happens in it actually is.Now, i'm sure the basics of the plot are the true part. 4 soldiers find themselves fighting off hundreds of enemy soldiers while trapped in Afghanistan, and indeed, the later parts of this story are genuinely amazing.The earlier gun fighting itself, though entertaining as a movie, I have a little bit of trouble with. As the title suggests there's a ""Lone survivor."" So, when all the characters split up, how does he know what happened to his colleagues? Now I know its been dramatised for movie purposes, but some of what we see in these parts seems gratuitously violent and un-necessary. If these were fictional characters then OK. But they're based on real guys, and to me, that seemed in bad taste.Still, the movie tries to honour these heroes in an ending that may bring a tear to your eye, and overall the movie is action packed, and has a great cast. Yet, maybe a ""rambo"" style action movie wasn't the way to go with this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Modest Yet Unbending, Epic Yet Tragic, Authentic  Yet Larger Than Life","When young Shane Patton (Alexander Ludwig) is being initiated as a SEAL, he has to recite a long monologue full of bluster and doggerel basically saying he is the ultimate fighting man. Instead of shouting the speech, however, he recites the lines thoughtfully, as if he's examining his own conscience as much as trying to find a place in the pecking order.Bear in mind that this is a minor character, and that most of this speech is background for basic visuals of the heroes preparing for combat. But the tone is set for a modern American epic that is as timeless as the Iliad and as relevant as today's headlines, a motion picture that is extraordinary, complex, and moving.I've been a fan of Mark Wahlberg ever since THE BASKETBALL DIARIES. There's no one else as authentic or intense as he is. Whether he's playing the very worst of human beings (a teenage junkie killer) or the very best of American heroes (Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell) he is always uncompromising and gives one hundred percent as an actor. Which is not to say that he can't be funny, playful, or charming, sometimes most unexpectedly so. But he is always authentic in every role he plays.This movie explores a classic military scenario, as old as Thermopylae or the Alamo. What happens when the greatest and most professional warriors of their age are hopelessly outnumbered and face certain death? This is not when they fade away. This is when they become who they are.It's impossible to say too much in praise of Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Mark Wahlberg, not to mention newcomers like Alexander Ludwig and the ever-reliable Eric Bana. Not one of them fails the task. They became the heroes they portrayed in this movie. What makes the movie shocking is not how real the violence is, but how real the bond between these men is even in the most casual and amusing moments, and how they remain loyal comrades even when death is only moments away. Every single performance is powerful and authentic, and the effect is not merely inspiring or patriotic but poignant and meaningful.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intense drama! 6/10,"Review: This movie does take some time to get going, but once it does, it's full of intense drama which is very believable. The action scenes were put together well and you can't help but feel for the 4 band of brothers who find themselves in an impossible situation. The fact that this film is based on true events, makes it even more intense, but they had to put a Hollywood spin on it by making Wahlberg the hero, as usual. Anyway, the footage of the real soldiers was emotional but there are better movies out there that portray the Americans at war. Watchable!Round-Up: I would have liked the director to concentrate on the individual characters because the film just jumps right into them going into the jungle. Apart from that, the actors done extremely well by making the film feel real and it really does make you think about what the real soldiers have to go through. I personally would have cracked under the pressure, but when you see the footage of the training at the beginning, you can understand that they are prepared for every situation. Anyway, you can't fault the film for intense drama.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $150millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there war movies about 4 band of brothers who get caught in an impossible situation. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not without flaws but still a brilliantly intense war film,"The true story of a small group of Navy Seals on a mission to kill a Taliban leader that goes wrong. They are left to fend for themselves in a hostile environment against massive odds. It's a brutal, relentless but exhilarating tale which is brilliantly filmed from start to finish.It does have a few flaws, the Americans seem able to withstand many shots and rock collisions whilst the Taliban go down with every shot. Even given the fact the Americans are highly trained and skilled whilst the Taliban presumably are not, this does grate a little. However the action scenes are so intense and incredibly well done that I am able to forgive this. The acting is superb and realistic from the whole cast especially Mark Wahlberg and Ali Suliman.It is nice to see a war film with a different angle, one that shows that war isn't always black and white and things aren't always what you believe them to be.Lone Survivor for me is one of the best modern war films combining a great story, great action scenes and great drama. An absolute treat to watch. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Documentary - rather than feature film,"Military movies based on biographical books and focusing on a single operation have both advantages and disadvantages. The first includes accuracy, naturalness, real names and places, but if you know the course of action and the ending (including hinting title), then you have to find some other angles and elements to catch...Well, the cast is evenly good, a real ensemble, although several actors performing members of the team were unknown to me.Shootings and dramatics were also in place, but the movie was roughly and unevenly divided into 3 parts: preparation for the mission (a bit protracted), failed operation (a row of fast and changing scenes), and escape of a single man (with ups and downs, and where I was confused why the US sends their soldiers out without any knowledge of local language, even with the help of a phrase-book).Occasional aridity in the plot is outbalanced by great cinematography and realistic atmosphere, probably better appreciated by those having direct contacts with troops or military service.Thus, I like Lone Survivor, but there are dozens related movies I like even more, e.g. Platoon or Saving Private Ryan.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Review: Lone Survivor/ Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,"The war film genre is one where the sensationalisation of the gains and losses on the battlefield and highly fictionalized moments drenched with brotherhood, duty, and honour, are what differentiate it from other film genres. Sadly, Lone Survivor is no different from the many other war films that have come before it. Despite its lack of originality in a genre that has, for the most part, run out of ammo in the originality department, one of the advantages that the film has compared to more recognizable battles of the past, is the obscurity of Operation Red Wings (the mission the film is based on) and the lack of mystery as to who lives and who dies.Lone Survivor tells the story of Operation Red Wings, an American search-and-destroy mission in Afghanistan, and focuses on the four men sent in to do the job. Giving a little insight into the lives of Petty Officer Second Class Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), Petty Officer Second Class Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster), Lieutenant Micahel Murphy (Kitsch), and Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg), the film is a comical and brutal account of the ethical decision-making on the battlefield and the impact of certain 'rules of engagement'. Within the war film genre, death is inevitable and thanks to its spoiler-laden title, audiences already know that only one of the four main protagonists actually comes away with his life. However, by taking the focus away from the mystery of who lives and who dies, the film is able to quickly establish heartfelt connections and deliver a deeply emotional response, even if the roles are played by not so emotionally impacting actors like Taylor Kitsch and Mark Wahlberg.As the opening monologue of the film echoes in its first few minutes, ""There's a storm inside all of us; a burden, a river, a drive, an unrelentless desire to push yourself harder and further than anyone can think possible"". This storm, this drive, is one that can be appreciated through the growing body of work of writer/director Pete Berg. Berg has made a career as Hollywood's go-to director for entrusting soaring production budgets and seasoned action stars, while confidently obtaining a great box-office return, despite dismal or mixed reviews. From Friday Night Lights and Battleship, to the out of nowhere mega-blockbuster Hancock, Berg has been fortunate with large scale budgets and generous star power behind his films. Spanning the course of five years, Lone Survivor is Berg's passion project. Working for the Director Guild of America with minimum salary, Berg was instantly drawn to the memoir of Marcus Luttrell during the production on Hancock. After proposing the film to Universal studios, and getting stars Wahlberg and Kitsch at a discounted rate, the funding for his film was the only reason Berg actually agreed to make Battleship.The film is being hailed as an authentic representation of the encounters many US Armed Force Officers are faced with. Although at times repetitive, the film is a bustling, hard-boiled piece of the American military life and a look into the lives of these triumphant men and women. Filled with moments that will have you clenching your fists and lifting yourself off the seat, Lone Survivor is a true testament of the artful representation of violence–proving that in Berg's book, moderation is definitely for cowards.Much like the highly overrated Captain Phillips released earlier in the awards season, the film really does not shed much light or give any insight to the antagonists of the film–the Taliban. Pursing Operation Red Wings for the sheer fact that their target is notorious for killing off Navy SEAL's, the four men are tested; mind, body, and soul through a perilous journey where their actions dictate the consequences of their future. Other than a scene involving a decapitation of one member of the Taliban as a supposed traitor, the film's first half shows the target Shah (Yousuf Azami) and his heartless second-in-command Taraq (Sammy Sheik) as diabolical animals. It isn't until we reach the last part of the film where the true nature and over- embellished actions of the Afghani people are accurately depicted.Despite the celebrity status of the four leading men, the real stand out is the always camouflaged Ben Foster. Taking queues from his career best The Messenger back in 2009, Foster brings a vulnerability to his role as Petty Officer Axel, one that quickly outshines his male cohorts. Foster's interpretation of inevitable death and the persistence to keep fighting for his country, is one that out-guns anyone else in Lone Survivor.When the mission is compromised and the four men are forced to decide the fate of the three civilians they take captive, the film with an obviously overcasting American attitude, becomes even if just momentarily, a quite reflective art-piece. Thanks to the memoir of the only surviving member Marcus Luttrell, the film highlights the fundamentals of the Afghan culture as well as highlights and gives due diligence to the reason for his survival–which comes as a big, pleasing, politically correct surprise.2014 has just begun, and although the film premiered to a selecte few audience members in 2013, I can confidently stand by my opinion that the film will offer one of the best photographic opening montage credits scene of the year. Showing the gruelling world of these Navy SEAL Officers who abandon all physical and mental sanity is portrayed in the opening credit sequence as a tactical and highly effective way to introduce audiences to the real world of pain, adrenaline, and perseverance many American men and women face when becoming SEALS.Contrary to what people may say, Lone Survivor surely will not be a serious contender at this year's Academy Awards although the film is one that pushes its audience relentlessly to the far corners of their comfort zone and forces them to endure the hardships these men, along with many Afghani people, constantly face being abraded by the Taliban.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
It was okay but not great.,"Mark Wahlberg wasn't as good as I was expecting and any of the other cast members could have played Luttrell better. I have no doubt a lot of this movie is fictional to keep the audience entertained BUT this just was too over the top. This movie shows that all the technology and training in the world just can't beat true will and toughness. These towel heads are below 3rd world yet they kicked our ass!! I thought it was funny to see Luttrell in the movie and he actually signed off on this flick? Nothing like a ""Saving Private Ryan"". Decent movie but I give it a C+ for effort. I didn't like how the ending had the American military coming to the rescue and the beginning of the movie was as fake as they come! Luttrell NEVER was about to die on a chopper.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mini Black Hawk Down,"A visceral display of streaming bullets and gory bloodshed, Lone Survivor follows a botched military operation with relentless intensity. It portrays the unforgiving struggle as the four stranded NAVY SEALs climb and jump for their survival in punishing hostile territory. The movie does a good job of not excessively use special effects, action feels more realistic with restriction on design, make up and practical effect. While it boasts military lingo and thick atmosphere of exclusive brotherhood, the movie manages to convey the sacrifice to the audience.The movie is a dramatization of an actual failed mission which left the four men team behind enemy line in Afghanistan. Mark Wahlberg is at his element as Marcus Luttrell, he thrives more in an arduous action movie. Stoic and with grit, he produces more natural rendition in this type of role. The cast of recon team could use more characterization as sometimes they might fall into stereotypical macho soldier. However, as the movie progresses and these men engage in battle of attrition and moral, they perform more compellingly in extreme situation.There is a raw primal feeling at work as they are shot endlessly. It's a grueling and exhausting process; the sensation of utmost emergency is almost as engaging as what Black Hawk Down had to offer, although in smaller scale. The way the shootout is portrayed, by visual and audio, is impeccably organic. Whiffs of nearby bullets sound intimately closely, the flesh tearing hits are even more so. The movie understands how to build up exhilaration while the protagonists fade with every hit they take.It reaches its height in the second act; the latter part does tend to falter. The pace loses a bit of steam towards the end, even though it makes a decent conclusion. Most time goes to reenact the gruesome battle and it's done justly, but there could be more effort made for the buildup as well. Audience might not follow the mission well as it's peppered with military terminology or the geography of Afghanistan, the movie could clarify the position and movement clearer.There are flaws, but in essence Lone Survivor succeeds in portraying a courageous act. It's patriotic without being preachy; instead it delivers with tightly packed action and sheer tension.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
True story told from Navy SEALs perspective,"The story stays in a great measure faithful to the events back in 2005, underlining critical choices and situations who can be decisive in such moments that test soldiers to the limit of their training and abilities. I am not going to go into details as anyone spending 5 minutes on Wikipedia can have a general idea of what happened there. It is nice to have this sort of movies depicting realities and how hard it is for US troops, both mentally and physically, yet, I still sense these movies are generally directed and targeting mainly the US viewers, as stereotypical it may sound, it's a dedication to fallen heroes, who are not only seen as soldiers trained and paid by the US military industry to be ultimate weapons, but also normal people, loved and grieved by their families back home. Of course, as a viewer, every US war related flick tends to empathize only with the US side, but things are slowly changing, as enemies have also a drop of humanity sometimes.I give it a 7/10 as I would wanted a more detailed plot development on the enemy, who did not seem at all very Taliban-sh to me. But, yes, it's the story told on the US side, because such a mission fail is not on the daily agenda of the US Army.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Mighty Fine War Movie,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsAn emotionally inspiring and gripping film about courage, honor, patriotism, and brotherhood. ""Lone Survivor"" tells the tale of four soldiers fighting for survival behind enemy lines after a reconnaissance operation gets compromised by an unforeseen circumstance. How these bravehearts battle for their lives and how they push themselves beyond conceivable limits for the men they fight with form the rest of the proceedings. The intrepidness, tenacity, and willingness for sacrifice displayed by these brave souls leave us literally spellbound and humbled. I ended up saying to myself, 'I'm a very small human being and not all that important in the face of these great men. Whatever grand notions of courage I had about myself were quickly made to feel minuscule.'Since this is based on a true story (from a book by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson on a real-life mission of Marcus Luttrell and his fellow Navy Seal team comprising of Michael Murphy, Matt Axelson, and Danny Dietz), you shouldn't expect many unexpected twists. Anyways, the heartfelt nature of the content and the positive impact it has on us as viewers, is enough to keep us thoroughly engaged and even entertained. Plus, the veracious sources of the movie provide ample scope for some heart-pounding action and edge-of-the-seat thrills. Credit must be given to the Director, Peter Berg, who aptly adapts this heroic tale of unflinching camaraderie and irrepressible bravado. Berg's assured hand evokes a keen sense of pride and respect for our four protagonists. Along the way, he also escalates his standing as a Director of note be delivering a film that's leagues ahead of his erstwhile passable fare.An inspiring war film with so many action scenes demands strong support from the technical departments like editing, cinematography, special effects, and sound, and ""Lone Survivor"" astutely delivers on all these accounts. Performances wise, all the actors delivers true portrayals of their roles, which blend seamlessly with the script on offer. Mark Wahlberg puts in another act that does equal justice to his star value and acting credentials alike. He's ably supported by Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, and Emile Hirsch.""Lone Survivor"" is a gripping, inspirational, and heart-crunching film on bravery, honor, determination, loyalty, and camaraderie. It's certain to go down as one of the best war films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Enthralling; Profound Courage,"Not very often does one get to stumble upon action movies inspired by real life happenings.A part of me wants to blame Marcus for the death of Murphy, Danny and Axelson, but the fact is if they had survived, the feelings would differ. Through his insistence and on the command of Murphy, the lives of three persons were saved, which eventually ruined them; but his surprisingly got saved in return.I loved the tracking shots of the Spartan-01 unit rolling down the Rocky Mountain; the impact was enthralling.Also loved the CU-shot of Axelson's eye when he was shot by the taliban. The shot greatly conveyed the intensity of the scene by heightening the mood.Wished the unit were without beard. Maybe the casting director intended for the cast to look almost alike with the real platoon members, but it would have been nice to see the soldiers without beard for easy identification. Most of them look too much alike due to similar body features and then the beard. In reality it really wouldn't matter since beard adds to a man's beauty. But in the army, majority of them aren't even allowed to keep beard.I must also commend the costume department too and the art direction for all props utilized, Great work! Enjoyed the movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Doesn't match the cool style it opens with, but still a worthy show","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn June 2005, Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and his team of men are sent on a mission in Afghanistan to take out a notorious Taliban commander whose lack of mercy is becoming intolerable. But after arriving at their destination, they find their mission compromised when unexpected problems come up, and they do end up finding themselves in heavy gunfire with insurgents. The following is a true depiction of his battle for survival and the unexpected kindness and humanity he was shown by some local Afghan villagers.The backdrop of the controversial Afghan war would no doubt provide many a setting for some really meaty tales that could be converted in to a Hollywood film, and here we have one by Peter Berg, adapted from the true life story of Marcus Luttrell and his harrowing five day long battle for survival in the Afghan wilderness, where he saw his comrades brutally killed off one by one and was forced to endure his own terrible ordeal, before re-discovering the humanity of others after being rescued by some local villagers. Berg has crafted a film that manages to open in a really involving, absorbing style that is more than you expect, but which loses it somehow after the battle starts, descending in to a stylish but less moving effort. Somehow, the early scenes give it a depth and development it loses when the action starts.Somehow, more than in any film I've seen him in before, here Wahlberg's limitations as an actor really shine through, even though I can't say he gave an especially bad performance, or any worse than usual. It could be because he takes up much of the screen time on his own, and can't rely on a supporting cast including the likes of Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster and Eric Bana to carry him. It's surprising what a lead star can reveal when their safety net goes. The film seems split in to three parts, before, during and after the battle, and even after during his humanistic scenes with the villagers, it doesn't switch on.From the director who gave us the likes of Battleship, this could have been a lot worse, but a more charismatic lead and not letting up on the stirring human dynamics at any point would have still made the experience an even more dramatic depiction of a real life thriller. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant,"I have just watched this film. Beautifully shot and the acting was great. None of that over the top gung ho lets go get em boys. As its based on a true story, this film certainly hits home the horror of what happens for these brave men. I loved the banter between the boys, made me giggle. But the ending had me in tears. I love how they used the real photos of these brave men at the end, had me sobbing i can tell you. As a female, i generally do not watch war films per se..but this had good reviews so i gave it a go. Im glad i did, the whole thing was superb. I loved it. Its a Must See. I wish this film the best, i honestly do. Its a real tribute to the Brave Men ( and women ) who are overseas fighting for their country and with their Brothers in Arms. God bless you all",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""New grass leads to new bushes by the window, leads to new windows, leads to new curtains, leads to new sofa, leads to new rug, leads to new floor...""","Lone Survivor is a 2013 War film directed by Peter Berg and starring Mark Whalberg, Taylor Kitsch and Ben Foster.
This was a pretty underwhelming experience, seeing a 7.5/10 on IMDb got me excited but the film didn't really live up to expectations.
I think Mark Wahlberg is pretty good and so was Ben Foster but I didn't care much for the other characters.
There are some good action sequences and suspense but I think the film is overall very forgettable.

Patriotism and Pashtunwali,"The operation of Navy Seals in Taliban country in the mountains of Afghanistan go awry. And as the title already tells us quite obviously, there is only one lone survivor.However, before it reaches that inevitable conclusion, we will be brought right in the middle of the action where bullets fly and bombs explode. You will definitely flinch as director Peter Berg does not shirk from showing in stark graphic close-ups how bullets and shrapnel hit their targets, drawing blood and ultimately death.We will also bear witness to a 2000 year old code of honor among Afghan villagers called Pashtunwali where undertake the responsibility of protecting an individual at all costs. This is something new I have never known before and is heartening to learn about.Honor and valor comes in different forms from different people. We see a lot of it here in ""Lone Survivor."" The Seals (played by Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch) show it. The Afghan villagers (played by Ali Suliman and Rohan Chand) show it even better.You will really get into the horrific experience of being in the battle zone. This will make you admire and appreciate these brave men who do their unenviable duties in the face of death out of sheer patriotism. This is brutally frank war movie, not for the faint at heart. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intense thriller,"I really liked this movie, but they should have come up with a different name because it spoils the entire movie. From the start, you know only one of the Seals is going to make it.Anyways the story takes place in Afghanistan where 4 Seals are sent on a mission in the mountains to take out a Taliban leader. Their mission is compromised when 3 goat herders stumble onto them. My biggest question is, why didn't they just leave them tied up till the mission was over, and then release them. Or why not wait until dark, knock all 3 out, untie them, then get out of there before they could warn the Taliban. The solution they chose was stupid on their part.Anyways, soon the Seals are surrounded and a thrilling gun fight ensues. It's very disturbing to think anyone in real life being in that situation. Also, I find it hard to believe that the villagers would help an American, but maybe that part is true. I guess they thought the Taliban was worse.FINAL VERDICT: Good story, intense action, definitely check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perspective Boom,This movie was unreal in respect to realism of what a true warrior can handle before his inevitable demise in a life threatening environment. No way out? Fight. I was so intrigued by the story I immediately went out the next day and purchased the book. Read through it in a week and the shocked look never left my face. A completely inspiration tale of 'common men doing uncommon things'. This is definitely in my top three modern war movies of all time with included company of 'We Were Soldiers' & 'Blackhawk Down'. The movie itself was brilliantly filmed and the directing was spot on. Not to mention Mark Walhberg and his supporting cast killed it!,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's Hard To Say Where Exactly I Stand On This Film,"""That's not a knife, that's a f***ing duck."" That line is too good to not be mentioned in this review.This film really has me conflicted. I heard really good things about it when it came out, so I thought it would go above and beyond the usual military hero movie, but i'm not sure if it did. The strongest part of this film has to be the whole sequence of the squad being attacked by the Taliban. There are lots of great blood and gore effects that help make their injuries feel realistic, and you really feel bad for these guys. They go through so much and the movie does not pull any punches.One of the biggest things I can't quite make my mind up about is whether or not I think the film is too ""hurrah USA!"" or not. The last little bit of the film feels too Hollywood, which would make you think so, but the amount of terrible things that happen to the characters makes me think otherwise. Regardless, I really respect the real men who died during this mission in real life, and the sequence at the end where they show real pictures of the men is quite moving, especially when we see footage from one of the men's wedding videos. Touching stuff.I think the performances were pretty good all around. Mark Wahlberg is the main character, and he does a good job, but I actually think Ben Foster would have been more interesting in the role of the lead, because I found his performance extremely interesting and impressive.There were also some things in this that I found humorous that i'm almost certain aren't supposed to be. The ""f***ing duck"" quote is obviously supposed to get a laugh, but i'm not sure about Mark Wahlberg yelling ""i'm gonna f***ing kill you!"" over and over at a group of Afghan men and a kid while holding a grenade. I couldn't help but laugh and I don't think that was the response the director wanted. Also the way one of the falling down the cliff sequences was edited almost seemed like he kept falling down the same slope and hitting the same rock, which made me laugh once again when I know it was supposed to be serious. I'm not one of those idiots who laughs at things all the time, I just don't think these scenes we're done well.Overall, this is a good movie. Not great, just good. Take from it what you will. It certainly is an interesting story based on a real event, and I think that makes it worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"#1 reason NOT to waste $$$ on ""Lone Survivor"" theater ticket (+8 reasons it should NEVER have been made)","Summary: I convey 8 reasons why this movie should never have been made, and highlight the #1 reason why you shouldn't waste your money seeing ""Lone Survivor"" in the theater:Reason +1: It's Not Worth the Price of AdmissionQuite simply, having been based on a factually dubious ""memoir"" that has more in common with fiction than any genuine biography, ""Lone Survivor"" movie fails to deliver significant value in exchange for the cost of admission. This film should be avoided until it's available on DVD for a fraction of the cost.Eight reasons why ""Lone Survivor"" should not have been made into a movie, based on violence dot com:Reason 1: Luttrell got his facts wrong.Marcus Luttrell exaggerated the importance of his target Ahmad Shah, totally misunderstood why the US went to Iraq & Afghanistan, and even over-estimated the number of fighters in the ambush. How can you take seriously a movie based on a fictionalized war memoir after reading mistakes like these?Reason 2: The backlash could be gigantic.Remember the backlash from Soldiers against the Hurt Locker? Lone Survivor will get a full blown tidal wave, and from more than just the mil-bloggers. Liberals will think it is too ideological, and Soldiers will think it is too over-the-top. Based on what some people wrote in our comment threads, even SEALs laugh at Luttrell.Reason 3: Lone Survivor is too political.The character of Luttrell is nauseatingly partisan & political, when war stories (in print or celluloid) shouldn't be political, they should be honest. ""Black Hawk Down"" worked because it ignored politics. It told the story of Army Rangers in an awful situation, but it told it forthrightly. Lone Survivor doesn't come close to this level of honesty, and unfortunately this movie mirrors the SAME DISHONESTY that characterized Luttrell's horrible book.Reason 4: There were better stories.The battle of VPB Wanat. The attack at COP Keating. Operation ROCK Avalanche. The Pat Tillman Ambush/Incident. Peter Berg could have told countless stories w/ more honesty and importance than Lone Survivor, without the political rants or exaggeration.Reason 5: Lone Survivor will get soldiers killed if they follow its implicit advice.Simply put, Luttrell doesn't get counterinsurgency. If Soldiers followed Luttrell's advice, they would either get themselves or innocent civilians killed in Afghanistan (or anywhere, really)Reason 6: Luttrell needlessly vilifies Muslims and Afghans.Luttrell (the ""author"" and the character) labels all Muslims--Shia, Sunni, Persians, Afghans, and Middle-Easterners--as hate-filled terrorists. This is ignorance at its best. First, not even 1% of Muslims are terrorists, and two, terrorists can be from Africa, Japan, Pakistan, or even America (think Timothy McVeigh, the Unabomber or Eric Robert Rudolph). Only lust for money could lead a director or a studio to validate and promote Luttrell's hate- filled propaganda.Reason 7: ""Lone Survivor"" the Movie corrupts and impedes political discourse - you won't ""learn"" anything from it (Except how to die)You can't call liberals evil, hold them responsible for the death of your friends, like Luttrell terrible book, and then have a courteous political discourse. Afghanistan shouldn't be a Democratic issue or Republican issue, it should be an American issue. Letting partisan politics get in the way of serious security issues is disgusting (but apparently the American way).Reason 8: It will ruin the history of Afghanistan for years.Many Vietnam veterans don't like Vietnam war movies because the twisted reality they promote is often how most Americans who see them remember Vietnam. Many active service members hated ""The Hurt Locker"" because it misrepresented the experience of War in Iraq. Lone Survivor movie does the exact same for Afghanistan. And Hollywood makes the same mistake again.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
I liked it allot despite the embellishments,"I really liked this movie. It gave me a good feel what special forces can be like especially when things go bad and I've never seen that before. It made me think about what these guys can go through. Normally, Special Forces movies are like Commando where Arnold Schwarzenegger mows down about a hundred bad guys and saves the girl and kills the really bad guy and spends most of the movie being stoic and looking really cool. So, this movie was a refreshing change.I read many IMDb reviews about this movie and a lot of people were giving it a very low score, bashing it for inaccuracies and the choice of soundtrack. This minority lowered the overall score noticeably. Here's my view: I've never been in the military so I'm just trying to get an understanding and a feel of what it is like and I want to be engaged by a story. This movie did that. If I wanted to watch a documentary where there is no acting or embellishment, I'd do that instead.Hollywood is in the business of making money and they know more people pay for an embellished story. More people will watch it. Look at Lincoln, a remarkable man who didn't require any embellishment. Embellished movie. More people watched that embellished movie than all the documentaries. I'm fine with that. If anything, I think embellishments helped convey the main lessons I got out of Lone Survivor. It made me think about and feel for these people.In regards to the soundtrack, just by the title of this movie alone, we know this story is a tragedy. So, I found the music appropriate. I thought it was a bold choice to contrast to the imagery. I happen to really like Explosions in the Sky so maybe I'm biased on that.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A journey in hell in enemy territory,"Im' not going to open a debate on how stupid and pointless wars are because it will never change anyway. The fact that the Taliban have weapons that were given to them by Americans to fight the Russians and that they now use those weapons to fight Americans is just a prof how ironic all those wars are. Like you can guess I'm anti-war, I don't see anything good coming from it so to me it's useless. Now for the movie itself, since it is also based on a true story, I have to admit it is a good movie. You can really feel the hell those Navy Seals have gone through. The movie is full of high suspense action and the cast is top notch. All good actors that did an excellent job. Without revealing anything, and even for a guy like me that detests wars, the end is emotional and makes you wonder who the real enemies are in this world. It's definitely not the foot soldiers that follow every command but it are the political deciders and those high ranked officers that will never risk their life like they command others to do.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solid war/survival flick,"The film is based on the 2005 American operation in Afghanistan where four SEALs are dropped off near a remote Afghan village to survey a Taliban leader. The mission is compromised when the team runs into three Afghan civilians. Once the Taliban hears of their presence it's four SEALs against a veritable army. Can they make it out alive?I thought this was a solid war/survival movie. It's very realistic, except maybe for the scenes of the SEALs falling down the rocky slopes of the mountain a couple times (how could they even walk after such falls?). The first 45 minutes presents a nice build-up to the action and then it's intense throughout most of the rest of the movie.The final act shares something that I didn't know about this operation, which involves an Afghan village. I not going to say any more because I don't want to spoil it.This is just a straight war/survival flick based on a true story and on that level it works well. It's not American propaganda, as some criticize; it simply honors these courageous men, including some Afghanis. It may lack the depth and greatness of films like ""Platoon,"" ""Rambo"" (2008) and the original ""Apocalypse Now"" (not that lame ""Redux""), but it's still worth checking out.I can't give the film a higher rating because it's not something I care to see again anytime soon. It works for what it is, but it's too one-dimensional and there's one aspect of the story that wasn't true to the real story; it's an obvious cinematic addition to heighten suspense and it's just eye-rolling.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A gripping, horrifying action movie that loses sight of its soul when the bullets fly.","Not many films would be willing to place a spoiler so squarely in their title, but Peter Berg's Lone Survivor has no such qualms. We know right from the start that Mark Wahlberg - grim-faced, stone-washed, blood- bathed - is the only soldier who makes it back alive from a surveillance mission gone badly wrong. What's surprising about the film is that it still positively thrums with tension, its action beats pounding fast and furious through a gunfight all the more horrifying for the number of casualties we know it must yield. But Berg also loses sight of the men within his soldiers, sacrificing intimacy and nuance for blood and bullets.Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg) is one of four elite SEAL team members dispatched on a reconnaissance mission in the mountains of Afghanistan. Together with squad leader Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) and fellow soldiers Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster), Luttrell is on the hunt for notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. While hiking through the rough terrain some distance above Ahmad Shah's suspected hideout, the team run into an elderly goat-herd and his young shepherds. The SEAL team's decision to spare the lives of these possible innocents unleashes a brutal, bruising battle, the outcome of which is tragic and already-known.The squeamish and faint of heart should look away now. In the hour-long bloodbath that forms the centrepiece of Lone Survivor, Berg has crafted perhaps his most thrilling, bone-crunching action scenes yet. In order to avoid fates worse than capture or death, characters fling themselves off cliffs, crashing headlong and parkour-style into seemingly every rock and tree along the way. Blood dripping down their faces, flesh torn to shreds, the SEAL team limp and lurch across the mountain, a host of nameless Taliban foot-soldiers hot on their heels. There is little respite for the characters, and even less for the audience, who will find their hearts clenched in their chests as bullets fly and lives ebb slowly, devastatingly away.It's such a virtuoso piece of film-making - edited together in short, sharp bursts - that it's almost possible to forget that Berg hasn't shown us who any of these men really are. There are a handful of moments at the start of the film, when he tries to establish character: one doomed soldier is contemplating getting a horse for his impending wedding; the other has a new wife. But these details aren't enough to provide a genuine depth of connection. By the time war rings out across the mountain, we still don't know much about these four soldiers who have been thrust so senselessly into a bitter, horrible fight for their lives.The politics of Lone Survivor are also murky at best. In stretching out the ferocious gunplay to such a horrifying extent, Berg's film winds up asking the oddly amoral question: should the soldiers have, after all, decided to permanently silence apparently innocent villagers? The final- act twist in Luttrell's tale - when he must seek refuge from the Taliban hunters - feels exactly like what it is: an exaggerated coda tacked on to drive home the point that, alongside the crazy terrorists, there are also right-minded heroes amongst the Afghan populace. It's a point made so bluntly that the film goes from bruising and believable to odd and over-blown.That being said, Lone Survivor is dragged back from the brink of mediocrity and excess by its truly staggering action sequences, choreographed so expertly that they actually become harder to watch the longer they go on. Wahlberg serves as a grim, gritty presence at the heart of the film, battered in both body and soul, while Kitsch, Hirsch and Foster provide able back-up despite their characters' woeful lack of depth. It makes for a heck of an action movie, even if it stumbles when forced to confront the thornier politics and complicated morality of its true story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great film with a dreadful opening scene that lets it down,"When a film begins with how it ends there has to be a damn good reason for it to have done so. The best way to use it is like 'The Hangover' did, where it implies something, sets up the story and also sets up the mystery. 'The Hangover' used it perfectly, 'Lone Survivor' used it very poorly and it is one of the few faults I could find with this movie. The reason it was a problem? Because it takes away the suspense from a number of scenes that would occur later on. If someone could explain to me a valid reason they chose to put it there I would happily listen. Until then though I think it was major mistake.That negative aside though, this is pretty fantastic film. It holds nothing back. For a 'True Story' it is particularly brutal and some of the imagery is quite shocking to watch. It was filmed immensely well and did a great job of putting you in the character's predicament. The best thing the film has going for it is that almost every character feels vulnerable. It feels like anything could happen at any time (and it often does). It is unrelenting in that sense. There is a lot to like here and this is certainly a must-see if you haven't already.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Excellent cinematography, score, acting and story make this a superb war film where you do care about the characters you're watching","'Lone Survivor' is a very well-made and fast paced war film. It helps that it's a true story out of Afghanistan and does a great job of setting the scene and characters in the first half hour, before putting you right in amongst the action for the final 90min. I really liked how some of the camerawork was frantic in the right moments and slow/steady in the other moments. Let me just say that when they 'descend' the hillside, you really feel it!Is 'Lone Survivor' as good as 'Saving Private Ryan'? That's debatable, but it's certainly better than 'Black Hawk Down' in my books, as far as modern war films go. There's no politics involved, just survival, and this has plenty of teeth-gritting moments! It helps that there's only really the four characters on their own in the wilderness - does a great job of showing the isolation.There's a fair bit of blood and violence, but nothing too grisly and it all looks very realistic - there's no cohesion to what the soldiers (Navy SEALs, rather) do, they're literally fighting for their lives as best they can. The photos at the end compared with the actors are good, although Peter Gabriel's cover of ""Heroes"" would've been better served if it was the David Bowie original. Otherwise, a great score.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good movie, a few nit picks","Obviously, when based on truth, especially a very modern truth, with characters still having survivors, a story may have many sides.Except in the case of the demon possessed Taliban monsters. There really is only one side here.There are gray areas. Such as how to deal with prisoners and civilians. JUNGLE FIGHTERS explored this for WWII quite well. PLATOON showed a scary side of uncertainty in Viet Nam.Here, we get more of the uncertainty of modern warfare.A small team of well trained soldiers go on a mission to eliminate a human monster that the world would obviously be better off without.The plan goes awry because of a compromised situation.The story is well told, and I believe told quite credibly. When the four soldiers are outnumbered, you will probably be like me and hope they all get out, despite the title, and kill all the nut jobs out there, because you know those nut jobs make life miserable even more for the local people.And we get insight into that, which is good.A lot is good with this film, and well done.A few nit picks I have.First, I found it easier to understand the Farsi speakers than the Americans. Whether it was sound quality or just horrible enunciation from the actors, I have no idea what any of the Americans said for the entire first half of the film. I would walk out if I didn't plan to critique it.Fortunately, the rest of the film made up for it.Second, I learned some Farsi from Pimsleur tapes and a book, though never practiced in real life to real people, and even I could understand and communicate better than the soldier among the villagers. One would think he would at least know to say ""chaghu"" for ""knife"", and ""motoshakerim"" (which I always remember by saying ""Moto Shack Harem""), and to understand the simple ""Taliban nist"".Unbelievable that the soldier couldn't understand any of this, but then he was horribly wounded, but then it should have been made clear that this was the reason he didn't understand. I can't comprehend that simple Farsi wouldn't be taught to an elite unit.Third, and lastly, the soldier should have known that the villagers weren't hostile, I guess because the villager kept saying ""Taliban Nist"", and thought he was a little crazy during that time.These are mere nit picks on a good film. Thumbs up.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning,"Peter Berg confirms once again his talent as a director and as an actor's director with this war film unlike any other that shows the debacle of a special unit that finds itself unable to carry out its mission in Afghanistan (dropped in the mountains, they must reach a village to kill a Taliban leader, but unforeseen events will change the course). They spend their time running away from the Taliban who chase them in the mountains.The film also highlights the hospitalized dimension of the Afghan population. Of course for this kind of production everything is technically perfect, photography, sets, make-up, special effects, pyrotechnics, reconstitution, with little digital technology, but a lot of chases, because our soldiers are chased and trying to survive permanently in the hostile environment of these mountains. The film contains a strong patriotic dimension of course. The film was advised by one of the survivors of this unit who suffered a lot.A success in its genre. With a permanent tension, once the preparations are over. Stunning.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Incredibly Well Made War Film,"Lone Survivor is a film directed by Peter Berg, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster, and centres around the true story of 4 Navy SEALS who are sent on a mission to kill a notorious Taliban leader, and how the mission quickly goes from controlled to chaotic.I'll begin with my main negative towards the film, and that has to do with tone and music. The music here, done by Explosions in the Sky, is not necessarily bad. I must say though, within the context of the film, it is used fairly poorly. At various points in the film, when gunfights are raining, and everything is as intense as ever, the music turns towards a slower, calmer tone. Now, I noticed this around 3 times within the film. It's almost as if, whilst these gunfights are going on and people are dying, Peter Berg is trying to glorify it all, or make it seem somewhat heroic, as that's how the music sounded to me. The whole film sends the message that war is horrific, horrible and should be avoided at all costs, yet at various points throughout these tremendously powerful fights, we get tonal shifts that hint at heroism, when that tone should be avoided at these specifics times very carefully. It took me out of the film, and unfortunately, it affected the overall rating as well.As well as this problem, I felt, like a lot of reviewers, that this film didn't give enough time to character development, and it really hurt the emotional attachment to these men. I couldn't remember two of the four guys names for most of the film, actually. I'm not necessarily saying that Berg needed to take time away from the action to put towards making his characters more important to us, I'm just saying that a little more effective character development would go quite far for this film.On the positive side, this film, for the most part, is a technical masterpiece. The film is acted to perfection, with Mark Wahlberg giving an impressively emotional performance, and Taylor Kitsch giving us something, that dare I say... is actually good?! The rest of the ensemble is well done, with special mention to Alexander Ludwig, an actor who I previously ridiculed for The Hunger Games, who gave a very solid performance.When it comes to action, Peter Berg knows how to do it right! The action scenes here are intense, brutal and incredibly gritty. There are some real cringe moments here, and some points at which you simply can't watch. When a bullet lands on one of our main characters, you feel it, and it emotionally drains you watching these men get pinned down and beaten up. I have to say, I'd rival the first stage of the main fight with the first fight within Saving Private Ryan, a film which some would consider the best war film of all time, me included. That's a pretty heavy compliment. The gunfights are intense to the point of tears, and they will often have you at the edge of your seat. Berg has nailed the action scenes perfectly here.Now, a lot of reviewers have made mention of the propaganda factor within this film. I personally didn't see much of it. I feel that the film is telling us, as I've mentioned before, that war is not heroic or full of glory, and honestly, we should avoid it all costs. It shows us that war is not black and white, and that everyone involved can very well suffer from it's effect. I'm going to dismiss the propaganda factor as a whole, because I've said, I just don't see it that way.Overall, Lone Survivor is a powerful film, that whilst often tonally inconsistent, will leave you feeling emotionally drained. Peter Berg has a wonderful direction, and his cast helps him in achieving a balanced, centred film. Props to the makeup department as well, who really nailed it with all the blood and injuries. Ultimately, I'm not going to watch this film again, but I do feel that it is a brilliant film. I'm fairly sure it will be on my top 10 of 2014, at least at this stage!9.1/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Real shame that they gave this to Peter Berg,"Hear me out. I am a bit biased about this story because I had friends over there like many of us, and this could be one of the most important stories to come out of nearly 20 years of that conflict. The most important and captivating, what Lutrell and his team went through is truly the stuff of legends. Enter: Peter Berg and his directing skills.I don't want to go off on a tangent, but you remember how you felt when you first saw Apocalypse Now, or Platoon even.. its truly unforgettable, the tone, the imagery, the soundtracks, everything about those films is imprinted on your pysche for the rest of your life. These are made by master filmmakers, different styles, but similar outcomes on the audience of course. On the other side of the spectrum we have Peter Berg. I can go on and on, but quite simply THIS STORY DESERVED BETTER than PETER BERG. And its nothing personal, its like we're all baseball fans and instead of Mickey Mantle coming to the plate to try and win the world series, (which is very important to sports, like this story is to American history), we get Lenny Dykstra. 50 year old Lenny Dykstra, not even Lenny in his prime.Anyway, that's how I feel. This movie could have been a classic, not some cheap ra-ra-ra red white and blue propaganda film that you forget by bed time. It deserved way better.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing story of a brutal SEAL mission,"I've always been fascinated by the Navy SEAL's, and the amount of training which they are required to complete in order to achieve the rank of NAVY SEAL. I feel that the movie did a very good job of highlighting the amount of persistence, strength, and skill required for these men to become the elite.After reading the book ""Lone Survivor"", I was captivated by the story, and level heroism portrayed by our elite servicemen during Operation Red Wings. The movie remains close to the written accounts of Marcus Luttrell, and is a realistic, and brutal recount of the ongoing war against the Taliban. The movie is violent, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Although i would not recommend this for the squeamish, it is a must see.

A Gripping True Story of America's Bravest,"I walked into the movie theater not knowing what to expect, the trailers for the movie did not show much and I was unsure how well done the movie would be. I walked out of the theater amazed and moved, a stunning story about a SEAL team and what happened to them in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. Recently some critics have accused it of being ""jingoistic war propaganda"", though I honestly do not see how this could be considered as such. The movie is a straightforward tale of what happened when a mission took an unexpected turn, there are no heavy-handed pro-war speeches or messages other then what the viewer may project upon the film.

I have viewed this film twice now and I can honestly say I find it very difficult to pick out any flaws from the screen play to characters themselves, utterly flawless. I myself have been in the armed forces so can relate the fear, integrity, will and determination of the actors, therefore making it far more impressive. Would love if they release a 3D version of this movie to feel even more part of a wonderful story.

Brutal and Awesome.,"This film took me by surprise. I was not expecting it to be this good especially considering the guy who directed this (Peter Berg) also directed Battleship.Based on a true story, it is about a group of four US Navy seals on a mission in Afghanistan to hunt down a Taliban leader and it goes horrible wrong. What I really liked about the movie was how brutal and realistic it felt. Seriously, there were times when I was cringing and saying ""OUCH"" etc. Pretty brutal stuff they went through and it is portrayed in a great way. The cinematography was great and really made these scenes epic.The movie also doesn't depict Afghanistan as just plain EVIL all round and US soldiers being the good heroes. The last act was really refreshing for me and it became even more awesome considering it was based on True story.There is some cheesiness here and there that you usually get with war type movies and the character establishment of Mark Wahlberg and other guys at the start could have been better and longer. Also, it did felt very realistic during war scenes BUT there were a few occasions where it became kinda hard to believe they survived that much punishment.Overall, a great film and a must watch.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen,"My only issue with this movie was that it didn't show more of Marcus's struggle before he was found by the heroic villagers that saved him. He actually had to crawl for something like 12 miles because he was paralyzed from the shoulders down. He'd draw a line in the sand with a rock and if his feet made it to the line and he was still alive he'd do it again. He did that for 12 miles and none of that was shown.As much as I loved Saving Private Ryan and Act Of Valor, I think this one takes it as the best war movie I've ever seen. I also love the fact that Marcus was in it!And for those who didn't read the book I suggest you do. Like I said in the beginning of my review, some important things were left out.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brotherhood of warriors, the Hollywood version,","Enjoyed this one a lot, intense, action filled story of bravery, heroism and survival. I also immediately disregarded the book it was based on and watched it purely as Hollywood entertainment. On that note its a good war movie. The action never lets up and I enjoyed all the actors involved (Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hirshe, Taylor Kitsch, Eric Bana) they're believable as soldiers.The opening of this is powerful, showing our ""lone survivor"" battered and bloody getting some serious medical attention aboard a helicopter, his heart stops... and then the images switch to real footage of potential SEALs during Hell week, ignoring pain and pushing through at all costs. I suppose this is meant to show how our four men can later fall down a mountain (twice) get shot multiple times, break several bones and still carry on. Although it could also be a nod to Marcus who dedicates a large part of his book to explaining the training SEALS go through. I highly recommend reading his book, its excellent.The story is based on Navy Seal, Marcus Luttrell's bestseller following himself and three others on a covert mission into the Afghan Mountains to locate a Taliban leader. The mission is ""cursed"" from the onset, with poor communications and a run in with goat herders that sees the men ambushed, badly outnumbered and fighting for their lives before receiving help from several local villagers.Its a good movie if a bit too a bit too much ra-ra flag waving propaganda at times. I did like how we briefly got to know the back story of these guys before the sh!t hits the fan.From the cast Ben Foster stands out as he always seems to,Wahlberg does a good job as Marcus, I got Emile and Taylor confused most of the time as they looked very similar. Shout out to the make up team who did a great job here with the changing bruises, scratches, swelling shut eyes, missing fingers, bones sticking out of leg etc. It all looked very realistic. 4/13/16",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Two thumbs down - way down,"If you are expecting something on the level of Shooter you will be disappointed. I was. The book was excellent. This movie is ho-hum. Needed a better screenplay, director, character development, you name it. Never involved me. Marcus Luttrell deserved a better homage. Mark Wahlberg doesn't shine - no one does. A waste of time, talent and money. Fluff. Even the scenery is questionable. It looks like it was shot in the Rockies or Idaho with Aspen trees. The first half of the book is omitted - except for a little slide-show prologue - no Seal training, no sniper training at Pendleton. No reference to how Luttrel was focused on the Seals as a young boy in Texas. It could have been so much better. Not sure if it could be worse.Is everybody on this board from Colorado? This is a terrible movie. With a terrific book to start from the director produced nothing. No character development, no sympathy, no catharsis, no nothing. It belongs on video. It is not worthy. It is not worthy. READ THE BOOK and then you judge. Terrible, terrible, terrible.I am a patriot. Two sons in the USMC. But filmmaking is filmmaking and this is not worth your time. Another director, another script - this does a disservice. Piece of junk. If there was a zero possible or minus numbers.... I give it a 1. Rather watch the Simpsons in Chinese or a rerun of Gidget.

"The closest to the truth about war -- there is no honor in war, only horror","Before turning the TV off and going to bed the other night I watched the last half of the new war movie ""Lone Survivor"". This is the true story of a squad of US SEAL soldiers who were nearly wiped out by Taliban forces in the rugged hills of Afghanistan. In my experience in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Pakistan) this movie is the truest account of what it's really like to be a soldier or a civilian in war; what's it's really like to come under fire in a battle. It is a pure horror; full blown horror.Why do humans, and particularly human leaders, continue to forget just how horrible war truly is? There is never, repeat never any honor involved when the shooting starts. It's pure unadulterated mayhem and horror for every soldier under fire.Watch this movie to understand what war really is.It worries me a great deal that the US stopped the military draft after Vietnam. Today, save for the elite officer corps, the US Government basically hires its military from the lower rungs of the US social and income ladder. The military is a way out of poverty. This has been tried before. Think Rome. I continue to believe that all young US men and women, both rich/privileged and the less advantaged, should serve their country for 1-2 years in some capacity. If this happened, the US would engage in fewer wars because the leadership would think twice about sending their own sons and daughters into the horror of war. Also the cost to the government would be lower, and, over a lifetime, such a democratic military would increase the participation of the citizens in their local, state and federal governments.Don't forget; vote!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"An Excellent, if Flawed, War Movie","I agree with some of the negative reviewers that the invincibility of the heroes and the ineptness of their opponents is implausible. 
 The best parts of this film happen as the team realize that they will probably never get out alive. But it's an action movie, and you do almost feel every bullet and fall. However, the other 1-and-2 star reviewers seem to be culled from the ranks of those useful idiots who regularly post selfies of their attendance at one or another of the foolish marches plaguing the urban centers of the U.S..It's ironic that almost everyone will cheer the ""good guys"" in movies about the Civil War, WWI, or WWII, even though the motives for entering each of those conflicts were initially as insidious as the motives for our involvement in Afghanistan. In fact, the Civil War was an unconstitutional, Machiavellian plot to expand the power of the federal government masquerading as an effort to free the slaves.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

An emotional rollercoaster of courage and sacrifice,"Lone Survivor, directed by Peter Berg, is an exceptionally powerful and emotionally charged war film that immerses viewers in a heart-wrenching tale of survival against insurmountable odds. Based on the true story of Operation Red Wings, the movie takes audiences on a gripping journey alongside a team of Navy SEALs thrust into a fierce battle in the Afghan mountains.From the opening scenes, the film grabs your attention and refuses to let go. The cinematography is visually stunning, capturing the beauty of the natural landscape while juxtaposing it with the brutality of combat. The action sequences are expertly choreographed, offering intense and realistic portrayals of warfare that keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film.Mark Wahlberg delivers an outstanding performance as Marcus Luttrell, the central figure and lone survivor. His portrayal is deeply moving, capturing the physical and emotional struggles Luttrell faces with unwavering authenticity. Wahlberg's ability to convey vulnerability, determination, and the weight of survivor's guilt adds layers of complexity to the character, allowing the audience to connect with his harrowing journey on a profound level.The supporting cast, including Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster, also deliver exceptional performances, bringing depth and humanity to their respective roles as members of the SEAL team. The chemistry between the actors creates a palpable sense of camaraderie and brotherhood, making their inevitable sacrifices all the more impactful.Lone Survivor's greatest strength lies in its portrayal of the human spirit and the unyielding courage displayed in the face of unimaginable adversity. The film delves into the moral complexities of war, examining the choices soldiers must make and the bonds they form under extreme circumstances. It presents the harsh realities of combat with unflinching honesty, never shying away from the physical and emotional toll it takes on the characters.Peter Berg's direction is masterful, expertly balancing moments of high tension and explosive action with quieter, introspective scenes that allow for reflection on the profound themes at play. The score by Steve Jablonsky perfectly complements the narrative, heightening the emotional impact of each scene and contributing to the overall intensity of the film.While Lone Survivor is an emotionally charged and riveting war drama, it may not be suitable for those who are sensitive to graphic violence or intense war scenes. Additionally, some viewers may find the film's portrayal of the conflict heavily focused on the American perspective, leaving little room for a more comprehensive examination of the broader implications of war.In conclusion, Lone Survivor is a remarkable and deeply affecting film that pays tribute to the courage, sacrifice, and resilience of those who serve in the military. It is a poignant reminder of the human cost of war and the unwavering spirit of those who put their lives on the line. With its exceptional performances, breathtaking cinematography, and thought-provoking storytelling, Lone Survivor stands as a testament to the indomitable human spirit and is a must-watch for fans of gripping and emotionally charged war dramas.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lone Survivor,Lone Survivor is the live adaptation of real life events in an action packed war thriller. The quality of production and cinematography was exceptional. The action and way they captured the violence and fighting was top tier. You truly felt like you were witnessing things first hand. They did a great job reeling you in and evoking emotions from you. The cast did an amazing job representing each of the soldiers and it felt real. My one issue is that things were a little exaggerated or over glorified in how things happen.

Our Wounded Warriors,"I'm usually not a fan of flag-waving war movies. But this one had a lot of nice elements. What carried the narrative along, so that it wasn't just a shoot out, (although one of those scenes went on too long for my taste), was careful editing, back and forth between two or three narratives. And what carried the day, was not patriotism, but the the band of men, fighting together. The four men, were admirable, although I wasn't completely happy with either Mark Wahlberg's character or acting, I'm not sure why, I seemed to have the sense that he wasn't in the fight as much as the other men, as if the star needs to be saved at the end, and I dislike having to say that, because I am sure the real life hero fought as bravely as the others. The script and dialog were tight. The film showed war at its bloodiest, most fatal, hand-to-had combat. And also had an interesting plot twist at the end showing the humanity of a culture other than our own. Interspersed with the fighting shots were wide angle natural beauty: supposed to be a mountainous range in Afghanistan; the film was shot in New Mexico. The film's credits at beginning and end - stay all the way to the end - nicely framed the picture in our real country's heroes. The entire theater audience with whom I saw the picture, applauded the film at the end, and at the end of the credits. Films don't often get that kind of praise.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Blood, Guts, and an American Classic","Lets be honest with ourselves. When you walk out of the movie, you may have the irrational urge to go and take up a rifle and join the Navy Seal program as soon as possible. When i first saw that Mr. Walberg would be the main actor in this movie i kind of chuckled at thought of him playing a Navy Seal. We are talking about the same guy who played the stud racer, bully beat down type character in the Itallian Job ten years before. But back to Lone Survivor. If you are one that might be known to have a faint heart, this movie is most certainly not for you. This might just be one of the most graphic movies i have ever seen.

Another case of bad equipment and military planning and leadership,"After capturing three un-armed Afghans who could blow their cover on a mission to kill a Taliban leader, the unit's leader says they had 3 options: 1) kill the hostages 2) tie them up -- in which case they would most likely be eaten by wolves, or 3) let them go.They chose option 3, and soon were pursued and trapped by an overwhelming force of Taliban/insurgent fighters.There was a 4th option -- realizing their communications equipment was unreliable, and aborting the mission, they could have taken the hostages out with them to a point far enough away that by the time the Afghans made it back to warn the Taliban, our team could have been escaped or been extracted.What it boils down to, is an incredibly bad decision on the part of the military command to send four men on a dangerous mission into a region where their communications equipment might be unreliable, and a total lack of coordination between extraction teams;choppers etc.Marcus Luttrel and his three dead buddies were the victims of P__s poor military equipment, planning and leadership.No wonder we're losing this war!!",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solely Touching & Bombastic Movie,"Lone Survivor a Breathtaking, often unbearably brutal account of a June 2005 military mission that claimed the lives of 19 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan's Kunar province.The movie is absolutely filled to the brim with action, emotion, and decent acting.Watching each of them falls is heartbreaking, with some breathtaking camera work and stunts, we see, hear, and feel every bullet zoom by, every burst of fire, and every bone shatter.The gun fights are very good, again you get the feeling of been there with them and having the fear of danger.The real acting came from Ben Foster and the others. Foster was excellent! Eric Bana strong support.Wahlberg was very good, He does injury and pain well, but not so much when he need to be vulnerable.Lastly a truly well made brilliant movie that is an extremely satisfying watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intense firefighting scenes lift this film,"""So if you're feeling froggy, then you better jump, because this frogman's been there, done that and is going back for more.""Lone Survivor caught me completely by surprise considering I wasn't expecting much from director, Peter Berg, whose films I tend to dislike quite a bit. ""From the director of Battleship and Hancock"" isn't exactly great marketing campaign for a film. This personal and passionate project of Berg's ended up being by far his best work to date. Saying that this was the best war movie of the year is also an understatement considering I really can't recall another one, but I can tell you that despite having its flaws some of the action scenes do recall moments from Saving Private Ryan (and that is very high praise for a war film considering I'm not really the biggest fan of this genre). I tend to get tired with overlong firefight action scenes, but it wasn't the case with Lone Survivor. These scenes felt real and gruesome while building a lot of tension. Not once during the two hours did I feel like the film was dragging. The pacing of this film was solid. Berg actually did his homework here and having spent a month based with an actual SEAL team payed off because the screenplay felt believable. Ultimately the film is about brotherhood and fighting for survival, and that is accomplished very well by Berg who decided to make a narrow minded and focused movie instead of a large scale war film.Lone Survivor is based on a true story that took place in Afghanistan in 2005 involving a SEAL team's mission to kill a Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah. Berg adapted the screenplay from Marcus Luttrell's book of the same name. Lutrell (played by Mark Wahlberg) was one of the four SEAL members involved in the mission ""Operation Red Wings"" taking place in the Afghan region. The others were Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster). Their mission becomes compromised when a group of goat herders run into their hideout in the Hindu Kush region and the four have to make a quick ethical decision. They can either kill them or they can let them go knowing that they will warn the villagers of their presence. Despite knowing the risks involved they decide to let the herders go and quickly try to reach a better location to communicate back to their base before the Taliban catches up with them. It's not long until they are surrounded by enemy forces and are forced to fight for survival despite being heavily outnumbered.Despite knowing where the film is heading (considering the title gives away the story), it still maintains the audience's interest and build tension really well. The performances from Wahlberg, Foster, Kitsch, and Hirsch are all pretty solid and they each bring some unique trait to their characters. We sympathize with these characters and understand the quick moral decisions they have to make considering their lives are on the line. In a way Berg is trying to pay some sort of tribute to these soldiers who put their lives on the line every day and makes us appreciate the risky work they do even more. Perhaps many people found this film a bit heavy handed in that it does try to deliver a patriotic and courageous message about macho soldiers, but I didn't have an issue with that because at the same time Berg is also portraying the ugliness of the battlefield. Perhaps the easiest moment to pinpoint this film as military propaganda is the opening SEAL's training montage, but I thought it worked to help set the characters better and in a way sort of pay homage to these soldiers.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This Has to Be the Dumbest Group of Navy SEALS Ever Put On Film,"1: Let's stand around and debate what we're gonna do with prisoners we already have tied up. 2: Then, wonder why the enemy is ""faster than us!"".I don't know about you & I do not care about the book, but military personnel, especially elite groups are all BUSINESS & QUICK THINKERS. There would not have been any lengthy discussion on what to with the captives. They would've been gagged & tied down. End of story.Also, elite groups are PREPARED. All that gear and not one of these clowns have rope? Not one is smart enough to use the belts or clothing of the captives to tied them up with???This is stupid film making at it's best.

Very well made movie with a couple of quibbles that I will not bring up,"I've always had a lively interest in combat. I've even cornered those who have seen it in person to get a better handle on it. After much contemplation, and a stint in the Army that did not involve combat, I've come to a rough, but accurate, notion of its reality, only to have it all superseded in one fell swoop by this brilliant movie.My wife doesn't like war movies, and I, therefore, had to offer to see it by myself. At the last minute she changed her mind and we both went. I feared she would spend most of the movie turning away but that didn't happen though there are some harrowing scenes that she disliked. I had explained that the story was essentially revealed on '60 Minutes' and was able to prepare her a bit. However, the story as told on that TV magazine was only a sketch. In the end she appreciated the movie and the adherence to duty depicted in it and that's as much as I can ask for.The story is about a small group of Navy Seals tasked with abducting or killing an Afghani who was a Taliban leader with many American deaths to his credit. Their intelligence wrongly informs them that the small village in which the target has been spotted has only about 10 soldiers. In fact the number is quite a bit larger. We follow the mission from its insertion to its bloody end but not once does this movie fall into an excess of movie pyrotechnics to make its point.Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch and the others all honor the men they're portraying by not over-doing it and staying real. But it's probably the director that deserves the most credit. Peter Berg does what I've always wanted to do, create a highly accurate picture in my mind of a single battle in all its inglorious mess. I was particularly happy to see and hear how they handled the bullets flying around. There's no sign of Clint Eastwood shooting a cigarette out of an opponents mouth. It's more like an evil shower of deadly metal.I could visualize myself there in the firefight having to force myself forward and that is something every war movie I've ever seen has dearly wanted to achieve. I don't know about others but this is the only one that's done it for me and I highly recommend it. It's an education you'll not soon forget.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The ""Black Hawk Down"" of this Decade","Lone Survivor Spoiler Free reviewLone Survivor is another brutal portrayal of war. It may not be the best one but it is still an intense movie. Lone Survivor is the story of 4 NAVY seals trying to survive Afghanistan terrorists. The result is a touching and intense movie. The action scenes are well shot by Peter Berg who had directed Battleship. Whenever a soldier gets shot, you feel it. The movie does a good job of giving a good portrayal of how war is. It's not all explosions. Our heroes are being surrounded, taking all the shots and just trying to survive. The first 45 minutes is the set up which isn't really that good. There is no development for the characters. You know how they look like but you may not know there names. Sometimes you just don't care for them. All the performances are good. All the actors do a good job of portraying the real life soldiers who were in that dangerous situation. Lone Survivor is a really good war movie with intense action scenes and good performances. The character part of the movie may disappoint some people. Just like Black Hawk Down, an intense movie about soldiers in Somalia but also suffers from lack of character development.Overall rating 9/10 Intense portrayal of real life events.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful Film,"I saw ""Lone Survivor"" during a matinée showing on opening weekend, and the theater was just about full. It was one of the few times that I can remember a movie ending and there was complete silence from the crowd – nothing at all. People just quietly got up and left, the movie was that powerful.I had read the book prior to watching the movie, and I think they did a good job following the story in the book. I am also a big fan of Peter Berg, Taylor Kitsch and ""Friday Night Lights."" The soundtrack to the film was reminiscent of the music used during the series, and I felt that it was the perfect backdrop for the various scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
My Two Cents,"Anyone who knows me (a silly thing to say on an anonymous message board) would probably be surprised that I'm about to write a review defending this movie.It seems that the majority of these reviews cannot give an objective perspective on the quality of the movie itself, but instead focus on using the review to lecture on their personal views of the war in Afghanistan, to comment on the sensibility of the soldiers making decisions most of us will never have to face, or to question the authenticity of Luttrell's story itself.For the record, I am about as left wing as it gets and don't agree with many US military decisions. I am also, generally, a fan of indie and art movies. I think that film, as art, should teach us something about life and leave us with questions to ponder.With all of that said, to the previous reviews, I would say JUST SHUT UP AND ENJOY THE MOVIE FOR WHAT IT IS. Is the movie jingoistic propaganda? Yes, of course it is. The ""good guys"" are almost super human. They rarely miss a shot and make heroic decisions in the face of staggering odds. The ""bad guys"" couldn't hit the broad side of a barn and act as if they've never been in any combat before. Did the soldiers endanger themselves with their decision-making? Probably, but you are not capable of judging that until you are in that situation. Does the story seem exaggerated? Yes, some things seem implausible and glorified.I am admitting all of this and still saying, just enjoy the movie. As much as I have my opinions of the subject matter and as much as I am generally a fan of more intellectual material, I can still sit back and enjoy an action film now and then, which is exactly what this is. This is no SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or PLATOON. Is it as far to the fanatical as RAMBO or RED DAWN? No, but it's probably somewhere in between. To me, this is the modern equivalent of a John Wayne movie. The good guys always wear white and will always triumph in the end. War was never something to critique in those movies, it was a backdrop that created heroes, which is what this movie does. Once the action drops, it's non- stop and I never found myself looking at the clock once. I rooted for our characters, though I knew their ultimate fate.So go ahead and over-analyze the movie, but if you're capable of getting out of your own head for a couple hours and just enjoying a movie, there's a lot to enjoy here.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

You will even feel been inside from what happened to them.

Intense every minute,"A good word to summarise this movie is the word ""intense"". This must be one of the most intense movies I have watched in my life. Period.What makes this movie good in itself is psychological. The narrative of being surrounded by enemies, outnumbered, and out-firepowered compels us to watch the movie's developments intensively. Furthermore, since this movie is based on a true story, it makes the whole narration even more engaging. What you really need to give to this movie is the sheer minute to minute actions, which the protagonists are trying to fight their out. There is simply no let up to the intense level. What I am saying is not just some mindless shootings in movies that perpetuate for the reason of only prolonging the shooting scenes.

One of the best war films,"This is one of my favorite ""war"" films inspired by true events. I really liked the dynamic between the four main actors lead by Mark Wahlberg, all who play the real life service members who were ambushed and left to fight for their lives. There were some factual liberties taken by the filmmaker that deviated from the best-selling book that the film was based on (Marcus Luttrell's, Lone Survivor). Despite that, it was still an exhilarating film and let's be honest, it's par for the course with these biopics that have to be told in 2hrs. The lead up to the ambush sets the stage nicely for our main characters and the intense battle that ensues. The action sequences were very intense and heartbreaking, which only further solidifies what heroes these brave men were. Prayers for their families.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Gripping Tale of Courage and Survival: Lone Survivor Review,"Lone Survivor is a stunning tribute to the brave men who serve their country with unwavering loyalty and courage.

His portrayal of the pain, anguish, and determination of a soldier fighting for his life is truly remarkable.The cinematography of the movie is breathtaking, capturing the beauty and danger of the Afghan landscape. The musical score is also noteworthy, adding to the intensity and emotion of the story.Overall, Lone Survivor is a must-see movie for anyone who loves action-packed thrillers and gripping stories of survival.

'You are never out of the fight',"Director/writer Peter Berg has translated Marcus Luttrell's and Patrick Robinson's fact based book into a film that is as spot on accurate as far as the training and extraordinary skills of the Navy Seals. The casting is excellent, the degree of uncomfortable banter is balanced well with the sheer terror of a covert op in a way that few directors and actors have been able to accomplish. This is a bloody, crude, harsh film to watch but the audience must be ready to accept that this is the way things were and remain in the multiple wars in the Middle East. And for what? The film begs the question. It is a story of survival and profound comradeship and it jolts us in just the right way.The film opens with a training camp for Navy SEALS, a fine way to set the tone for the story. The time is 2005, the place Afghanistan. Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg and his team – Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt 'Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster) set out on a mission to capture or kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami After running into mountain herders and capturing them, they were left with no choice but to follow their rules of engagement or be imprisoned. Now Marcus and his team are left to fight for their lives in one of the most valiant efforts of modern warfare. Cut off from back support team (Eric Bana, Alexander Ludwig, Rich Ting, Jerry Ferrara, Scott Elrod, etc) the four struggle to survive against insurmountable odds. But is many ways the acidic cruelty of war is somewhat offset by the compassionate benevolence (Pashtunwali) by a group of Afghans who offer the lone survivor Luttrell succor and safety. Food for thought after the battle of the film is over.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
'Lone Survivor' Is A Ball-Breaker of A Film!,"War is a lot of things, but it's useless to pretend that exciting isn't one of them. From an adrenaline standpoint that might well be the case, but in every other respect, from every other possible viewpoint, it's an inescapable waking nightmare that you'd never wish upon anyone. If that doesn't ring true for you, go see 'Lone Survivor'.Adapted from a memoir by Marcus Luttrell, it tells the story of a special unit of the U.S army comprising of four SEALs led by Marcus himself, who are sent on a mission to kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan. The four bunker down in the mountains in search of their target, but when the squad silently moves within sight of the compound where the besieged commander is seen training his men, they realize the mission is going to be far different than anticipated. Soon they find themselves outnumbered, pinned down on a scraggy hill. With phone signals going out in the mountainous terrain, barring them from calling in an exfiltration, a fight for their lives begins. Pursued through inhospitable mountains by several hundred Taliban and cut off from their support, a wretched retreat follows, where the exploits of those four soldiers quite simply defy belief.Mark Wahlberg, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster and Taylor Kitsch play the four imperiled SEALs, and from the moment they elect to abort the mission, 'Lone Survivor' becomes a ball-breaker of a film, as you slowly see shock and fear overtake their bodies. Each actor sells the utter terror of the situation and there is a visceral element to the performances as each character is mutilated beyond recognition. They give an incredible amount of emotional weight to the moments where their characters must face their fate, even though the plot is shackled to a definitive outcome.Director Peter Berg captures the raw intensity of combat and carnage on both sides of the battlefront and the heroics that forge an indelible spirit in combat. Working with a crutch of a title, there is an incredible amount of pressure on Berg to implement the 'how' element of the story and he overcomes the challenge with the precision of the army commandos he's portraying. He takes his time getting to the conflict and the anticipation of the skirmish is extreme because you're expecting the worst and that's exactly what you get. The skirmishes are gut wrenching in their brutality and Berg puts you in tight confines of makeshift foxholes and rifle sights to amplify the claustrophobia of the situation. Shot in furious sweeps and featuring smashing sound design, it is heart stopping watching the soldiers scramble across rocky outcrops and tumble down cliffs with their bones crunching against trees and boulders; the stunt work is astonishing. Berg trips up a little on a few slow motion edits that break the gritty realism but when the unit take stock on their ghastly wounds you're jolted back into the hopelessness of the situation.This is a war movie at its most confronting; it terrifyingly captures the confusion, brutality, chaos and intensity of combat in a way. It's a suffocating sort of tension - with all its bone-breaking, blood-splattering, white-knuckle skirmish - and whilst there's no question the movie suffers from some clumsy jingoism, the experience is so palpable, you frequently find yourself ducking in your own seat.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Movie.... Wrong Star,"I had the privilege of attending an advance screening of Lone Survivor and I must say that it is one of my favorite movies of 2014. So far, it is currently in my top 10. It's a movie based on the true story of Seal Team Members that went on a failed mission to capture a Taliban leader.The beginning starts off slow but once it picks up, you are left on the edge of your seat... biting your nails... squirming (falling down the mountain scenes)... and then overall emotional. I was highly impressed by the performances of Emile Hirsch and Taylor Kitsch. Emile played hard and tough but when the defying moment came for him, he turns into a softhearted human that captures the essence of the role. Taylor remained strong in such a tumultuous ordeal and his courage really inspired me. I could never imagine what the real soldiers went through but Taylor's commitment to the role brought tears to my eyes.Again, the movie has all of the thrills that you expect from a war film and it's doesn't sugar coat anything. Some scenes are gruesome but nothing you would lose your stomach over. The only misstep was MARK WAHLBERG. Don't shoot me because I think that he is a good actor but he plays the same character in all of his movies (personality-wise). Not once did I feel like he was playing another character but he was the typical Mark that we have all seen before. I must applaud his commitment to the role though because I'm sure that it wasn't an easy task. He was sorely miscast. Just a minor bump in a great film.If you're emotional, bring the Kleenex because the movie does pull at your heart strings. If you're a strong man like myself, you'll be okay but you're not human if this movie doesn't move you.It is a must see because it reminds you of the hard work and the sacrifices soldiers have provided for us. This is powerful a film and I am in debt to all of the lives that were sacrificed for our country. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Action Flick,"""Lone Survivor"" does not disappoint in its depiction of a group of Navy Seals who fight off scores of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Confronted at the beginning of their mission with the dilemma of letting three goatherds go and risking the compromising of their mission or killing them - they let them go. The subsequent loss of all of the four Seals but one, Marcus Lutrell, and the killing of 16 of their comrades in a helicopter crash trying to rescue them is the crux of the movie.The movie is fast paced and well acted. It is very difficult to become a Seal. They put to use all of their special training trying to survive. The physical wounds of war are excruciating to watch. Mark Wahlberg is good as the Texan, Marcus Luttrell, who grittily clings to life after being given sanctuary by a group of friendly Afghan villagers and who is still pursued by the relentless Taliban.Adults and adolescents will like the film, but small children would be well advised to give it a pass.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
best true story ever,This movie is the best true story movie that I have seen. Lone Survivor is one of the most gripping and compelling movie I have seen in years. I have never been in a sold out theater that was so quiet because people were getting so involved with the action. I knew and had met Marcus Luttrell in 2008. I knew him as a remarkable man but to see what he had to go through 3 yrs prior to our meeting was to say the least heartbreaking and eye opening. To walk through hell and lose those close to you and still come out on the other side with such a positive outlook on life is amazing to me. I think every American needs to see this movie to get an idea of what we ask of these soldiers. We take for granted the lives lost and/or changed forever just so we can enjoy our freedoms.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I'd like to say that the movie is 85% accurate compared to the book. 10% of the movie did not show things that Marcus had done during the time when he was crawling to the village, and the book is obviously more descriptive than the movie, but that is the same for all movies based on books. I think that the movie is 5% dramatized, but it is a Hollywood movie. it is definitely a must see movie. I am 13 years old and in 7th grade and this movie was perfectly fine for me as gore is concerned. I'd recommend any one over the age of 10 to see it. There are some morbid scenes in it, but they are trying to make it as realistic as possible. GO WATCH IT!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice Chevron commercial,"I give this movie 2 stars only because I reserve 1 star for the actual REAL US presence in Afghanistan. At the end of the day ? it didn't do a thing for US foreign policy short of generate more anti-US sentiment and leave families in these regions wondering why their loved ones were killed by drunk renta-soldiers from Defense Intelligence Agencies Whackenhut rentals, or the Predators in the northern tribal regions of Wazyristan, or Kazakhstan (to this very DAY Jan 11th 2014). To those who confuse 9/11 WTC attacks with Afghanistan, the pilots were Saudis. Usama Bin Laden was a Saudi.This piece of propaganda really takes it over the top with the emotional manipulation through acoustics, somehow ? making you feel 'good' watching people blow each other to kingdom come.The Taliban was invited to Sugarland Texas in 1999 - and they came. Cheney of Halliburton as well as what is now Chevron asked if they would be a problem for the Kazakhstan-Afghanistan-Pakistan pipeline. The Taliban opted NOT to take Chevron's money.The Taliban didn't just show up overnight hating America, no, corporate oil provoked these people.This movie is a commercial for Chevron period.I have to seriously wonder who funded it.A movie showing that Pat Tillman was killed by friendly fire and that the US Department of Defense covered it up and Bush ? ironically USED Tillman's death to rally support FOR Afghanistan.In so many ways Tillman's death may very well have paved the road for these unfortunate souls to even find themselves in the hills of Afghanistan with rattlesnakes and tribal elders armed with ground to ground stinger missiles provided by Casey era CIA.There is a HIGH probability the ground to ground missiles being used as depicted in this film would have been provided by the US CIA in a different era, and era where the very men here being painted as evil ? Were actually allies and used by Reagan, Bush, Casey era.I do not recommend watching this rally around the flag garbage. In no was did US presence in Afghanistan help matters, if anything ? There is now an entire generation that only can know the United States as if it's there to blow peoples heads off.DoD should have had US troops building schools, and protecting them, we'd have an entire generation now of kids nearly 12 years old - young adults - who would have a very positive view on the world, including the United States. So ironic that in Sugarland Texas ? The Taliban expressed they didn't want western oil money, they just wanted schools, roads and power lines.This movie fails to value life first before ideology. The only thing worse than this movie is the truth - and that is- US presence in Afghanistan was about securing the IN PROCESS RIGHT NOW - Kazakhstan- Afghanistan-Pakistan pipeline. It seems over 200 BILLION barrels of oil have been validated in Kazakhstan. That's 20 trillion dollars at $100 a barrel. 20 trillion dollars is enough to 'just have to get elected in 2000'.It's all oil - and this movie fails to show how human lives have been disrespected on ALL sides here - all in the name of power. With 20 trillion dollars ? You could buy the next 100 US presidencies, in fact ? ALL land mortgage contracts in the United States used to total only 12 trillion before the regulatory failures - the FBI financial crimes unit warned the Bush White House admin of the forthcoming mortgage crisis and they opted to do nothing about it, in fact, Bush took over 500 FBI FC unit agents and put them on 'terror' assignment. The money to be harvested in adjacent Kazakhstan ? is enough to buy the ENTIRE United States over TWICE.These Navy Seals are as brainwashed as the North Koreans. They haven't figured out they're just RENTED by the oil corporations.If it wasn't for what is now Chevron ? We wouldn't have had WTC attacks. Cheney threatened to destroy the Taliban in 1999. It seems he found his excuse through WTC.And in the end ? ISI who the CIA was been doing business with for some time ? turns out to be housing Usama Bin Laden in a nice abode in Pakistan under ISI protection.Too bad the US Naval Intelligence command couldn't get BETTER intel from the CIA. Clearly Porter Goss could care LESS about US Navy renta-seals.US should have been building schools and protecting the next generation to break the religious extremist's hold on the next generation. I sense in the West the extreme Christian right is analog to the Taliban.The absolute worst would be would be if there is some pro Christian message in this movie. So far, I've not seen any. Remember, former CEO of former Blackwater Erik Prince stated Blackwater's contracting with the DIA and DOD was a 'crusade for Christ'. It doesn't get much sicker than that. I PRAY religion isn't part of the US Navy Seals morning rituals, seeing it on Alaska Gold Rush and US Marines in Iraq is short of wondering who's been brainwashed more into a phony pretense of a religious war.At the end of the day the LAST thing you want to see US presence in Iraq OR Afghanistan turn into is a religious war. Who knows, maybe that's why the 'war on terror' just seems - misdirected. Perhaps OTHER than oil profiteering and abuses of third world nations driving it ? Perhaps there really ARE people who decorate the conflict in religious context.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Riveting. Our Navy Seals are BADASS.""","Saw Lone Survivor tonight at Regal Cinemas staring Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell and Taylor Kitsch as the late USS Michael Murphy. Great movie! It just goes to show you the sacrifice many American people have made for/to the United States to preserve our way of life, including myself! Secondly, the film depicts the importance of radio communications and air-support from the The U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, United States Air Force, and we can't forget The U.S. Navy in the Theater of Combat Operations!The movie has strategic moments but it mostly features very intense/violent scenes including a beheading and several gun fights with the Taliban in Afghanistan and traumatic injuries to members of United States Navy Seal Team 10 who took part in Operation Red Wings (June-July 2005). Crazy movie, but as Justin Timberlake tweeted via Twitter: ""Go see #LoneSurvivor now... Riveting. Our Navy Seals are BADASS."" Indeed! I give it a cinema score of 9/10!

Not Every War Movie is Propaganda,"This is one of my favorite modern-day war movies. The fact that it is a true story not only makes it much more emotional, but also impacts the film in that these guys are really some real life heros. Mark Whalberg is amazing in this film, the action is amazing in this film, and the stakes are really high as well. The action has even been described as some of the most realistic action that looks at combat scenarios since Saving Private Ryan by former members of the military. It's claustrophobic and doesn't rely on crazy explosions or an abundance of CGI.People say that it is nothing more than army propaganda and for those who do it honestly, shame on you. This actually happened. There are a few cheesy lines which definitely make the viewer wanna go ""America! Fuck Yea!"" but this is the exact type of movie I would expect to hear things like that. The scene with the kids and where they debate what to do is really compelling and makes your heart race. Seriously, what can you do in that situation?Overall, I think Lone Survivor is a great movie. It is an awesome action war movie which also happens to be a true story. It is emotional, inspiring, and super intense. The movie manages to keep you on your feet despite the spoiler in its own title. Great film.Mike Murphy grew up in the same town my Grandma lived in.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The morals of choices,"A tale of morality and war.A team of American soldiers on an undercover mission in Afghanistan. They are well trained, prepared and have all the necessary equipment. As they advance towards the village of a high ranking Al-Qaeda they take cover in the woods. All seem to go according to plan.Then everything changes. An old man with couple of children, all goat herders, arrive on that very spot. Ideally the soldiers did not want to be seen but they are and thus capture the passersby. Whilst on some level it would make sense to kill them, the captain of the team decides to let them go knowing that their cover will be blown.Little did those soldiers knew how swiftly their situation will reverse. The released captives informed the fellow villagers in a matter of few moments and the US soldiers become utterly helpless and overwhelmed.The training and sophistication of the American soldiers proved futile to the street wise gut instinct of the Taliban.Moral choices and reversal of fortune become very intertwined.

Powerful and Intense,"As a combat service veteran, I can relate to the intensity and chaos surrounding the close range fire fights depicted in this film. Rather than emphasize large scale attacks with countless deaths, this film focuses on four Seal team members from a personal and professional perspective. The action scenes are realistic and very well done. I read through some of the negative reviews and they are either by people who are biased against the war or have never seen the film. When the closing credits scrolled, everybody in our theater was in tears or stunned silence. Neither I, nor anybody else in the world except Marcus Luttrell, can attest to the accuracy of the film but it doesn't matter. No film can be 100% accurate for a plethora of reasons.

"Lone Survivor has Peter Berg and a great cast behind it, it's a suspenseful and memorable war film - My Ultimate Review","Lone Survivor is set during the war in Afghanistan, it dramatizes the unsuccessful United States Navy SEALs counter-insurgent mission Operation Red Wings, during which a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team was given the task of tracking down the Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. Though dramatized, it's based on the nonfiction book by Marcus Luttrell with Patrick Robinson, by the same name. The four-man SEAL team is played by Mark Wahlberg as Hospital corpsman First Class Marcus Luttrell, Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Michael P. ""Murph"" Murphy, Emile Hirsch as Gunner's mate Second Class Danny Dietz, Ben Foster as Sonar technician Second Class Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson and Eric Bana as Lieutenant Commander Erik S. Kristensen.The film was written and directed by Peter Berg. You see how it's a passion project of his, the producers and the cast. Wahlberg was the first actor to sign on during its early stages of development, Eric Bana had read the book and done research to do the character justice. The cast went through some serious training to portray the characters to their best. Lone Survivor isn't about being 100% accurate, it's about making an entertaining and great war movie whilst also doing justice to the Navy Seal's. Though some inaccuracies could have been made more accurate as they wouldn't have hurt the story. I still like Peter Berg' script and storytelling in the movie, his direction is absolutely fantastic. The research he did shows, there's so much thought on authenticity. Regarding costume department, set locations and just everything. There's still some historical inaccuracies as I said before. What I didn't know until this viewing is that Luttrell moved into Berg's home for one month while Berg was writing the script. He acted as a consultant, detailing to Berg his eyewitness account of the events that unfolded during Operation Red Wings.Tobias A. Schliessler served as the cinematographer for this film and he have worked on several of Peter Berg's films, their cooperation is felt throughout the film. But he's a terrific cinematographer, bringing some incredible shots and making a war film that you want to come back too. The director wanted the audience to be as close to our characters and as close to the action as possible to experience the extreme circumstances our war heroes had to go through emotionally and physically. Tobias makes it so easy to get immersed in a scene. Fantastic camera work throughout the entire film. So why does the action sequences work so well? Peter Berg and Tobias A. Schliessler, but also the real events. Everything regarding the action sequences is perfect in my opinion, only thing I'm a little sad about is how it wasn't longer... Which it was. It's still fantastic, on the technical side and how it was written. Those two really know how to shoot a immersive, realistic and just entertaining action sequences. The sound editing is truly superb, from the smaller things like environment to bigger things like the guns and vehicles. The sound editing is award worthy. The musical score was done by Explosions in the Sky and Steve Jablonsky, it's great but far from the same level as other war movies. I still really like it though. The editing is also quite perfect, every scene flows so well and the story never slows down. Suspension and tension from start to finish, almost.Lone Survivor isn't the best war film out there but it's among my favorites. I've watched it 4-5 times now and I still find it incredible and worthy of coming back to. The actors: Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Eric Bana, their performances are truly terrific. They play well together and I could never see other actors play the roles after seeing them, they do the historical characters justice. Best performance has to go to Ben Foster, brilliant. Mark Wahlberg comes on a strong second place, giving us a a brilliant performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Beyond just a war movie,"This is not a film to be enjoyed. Moved, rattled or stirred are more appropriate descriptions of experiencing this movie. As a war movie on it's own merits it is very engaging. Like Titanic and Apollo 13 it is not engaging from a perspective of wondering how it will turn out. The title of the film leaves little doubt there. When the fighting begins it is very intense. Although it is similar depiction of military-style engagements, the feeling is much different. The big difference in this movie is that you know for sure that each character represented was a real person. As only four soldiers are the main focus, each death is particular emotional. The depiction of these events can get quite graphic. We saw a couple leave the theater. Our assumption was that the male was a vet or active service. I can't say I relate from that perspective. But just knowing that these were real people made it a bit uncomfortable to sit through this movie. It does however open your eyes to what some soldiers face. Not just the extreme battle and survival elements, but even impossible decisions. Knowing the outcome, you almost wanted to yell at the screen when they made the decision that led to events in the movie. Kind of like those horror movies when you want to tell the person to not open that door or go up those stairs etc... Only this was much different. You want to tell them to do differently but you realize that the decision made makes you proud that men like that represent the US. The end of the movie helps a great deal in dealing with what you have witnessed. The sequence before the credits is very tasteful and moving.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lone Survivor Movie Review,"Jake Wallock ENGL 110 MA 1 Kopplin February 17th 2014 Lone Survivor Brings Tears to TheatersImagine yourself crashing down the side of mountain in Afghanistan to avoid the ultimate sacrifice and lose your own life fighting for your country. Lone Survivor attacks the hearts and souls of its viewers as it recaps the true story events that took place in 2005, as four Navy Seals set out on, ""Operation Red Wings"" to kill Taliban leader Ahmad Shahd. Director Peter Berg brings you into the personal lives of each seal before they embark on the unforeseen disaster of a mission. Your heart will not stop pounding, as the Seals retreat down the mountain while fighting off the infuriated Taliban. The film brings the patriot out of everyone in the theater as well as a few tears as the thought of these hero's families burns in the bottom of your heart. Director Peter Berg doesn't use much film time to give you background on the Seal's lives. But it is used to capture your heart for these men. The movie opens with real footage of recruit Seals in boot camp. The sight of the mental and physical toughness required to become a seal drives home the sacrifice these soldiers make to defend their country. Mark Wahlberg stars in the movie as Marcus Luttrell, a hard-nosed fighter with a love for his country and his brothers that fight along side him. Peter Berg quickly makes navy seal Michael Murphy a fan favorite at heart by portraying his love for his fiancé. What woman doesn't love a man willing to spend 10 grand on a wedding gift? Matthew Axelson and Danny Dietz, the other two seals from the four-man team, are introduced at the base camp. Here the viewer has a chance to witness the family mentality that these men have with each other as they argue like children and compete like brothers. The movie shifts quickly into action as the men find themselves on a mountain in Afghanistan. The special effects of booming gun fire, horrifying explosions, and the sight of soldiers tumbling down the rocky, unforgiving mountain is painstakingly realistic. The filming of the movie was flawless. It captured the terrifying reality of war and took the viewers on an emotional roller coaster of thrill, hope, and grievance. The camera shifts from third to first person perspectives of the seals, making the viewer feel the fear and determination that is flowing through the veins of these warriors. Not to mention the slide show paying tribute to fallen soldiers that concludes the movie to send you out of the theater with a heavy heart. This film could not have been complete with out the ingenious acting performed by Mark Wahlberg. He makes the audience cringe at the though of his unbearable pain, and cry at the compassion he shows for his friends. Wahlberg's performance is supported by an outstanding script written by Peter Berg, filled with patriotic quotes that send shivers up any American's back. Perhaps, the character Matthew Axelson played by Ben Foster said the best quote of the movie. While his back was against the wall and it seemed all hope was lost Ben says with determination, ""You can die for your country, I'm going to live for mine"", Cleverly twisting George S. Patton's quote and sending a shock of pride through the theater. Lone Survivor is a must see movie for any action or patriotic movie enthusiast. The film will have you questioning humanity, and with a whole new respect for our veterans. Bring a box of tissues to this one folks, because Lone Survivor aims straight for your heart.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Beyond bullets,"Movies based on heroism on the battle ground are not an unfamiliar territory for the movie fans. And once in a while a movie comes out which strikes so hard that you realize that somewhere out there some people risk their lives for the betterment of many more sleeping at home. Lone Survivor is indeed a brilliant movie of that kind seeing seldom from Hollywood. And to make it even better it's based on actual events taken place. Lone Survivor is the cinematic adaptation by Peter Berg of the book of same name. The plot is based on a US failed mission Operation Red Wings taken place in Afghanistan. The mission objective was to track a high priority Taliban leader Ahmad Shah and a four member covert operatives team was sent out. The story unveils their mission starting from base camp to a remote village in the Hindu Kush mountain range through a tough terrain on foot. While the team is equipped with latest technology and experienced personal an unexpected incidence pushes them the deviate from the plan. And they find themselves surrounded by enemy insurgents and hope of getting out alive becomes thinner and thinner.Some call this the best after Black Hawk Down and I pretty much agree with it. But then there is the Special Forces (2012) a French movie that comes very close to this in my opinion but seems many Hollywood critics despise it (Well that's their problem). But what's the best movie is not the fact to highlight here. It's the fact that Lone Survivor is filled with brilliant performances, action sequences and top of all mind blowing amounts of heroism, courage and patriotism.Lone Survivor has good production quality and direction. Though there are no surprises to the plot or anything never seeing before in a war flick, this runs right through predictable points without sweating much. Relatively there is not enough character building done throughout but the lack of that kind of drama is barely noticed after the guns starts to fire. It is quite right to say that Lone Survivor has one of the best battle sequences that do not include heavy artillery. And it's pretty obvious that many stunt actors have broken bones performing it.A good war movie is not in terms of how bloody it is but in ways of how successful it is in justifying a war. It seems like Lone Survivor has done a decent job at it while the whole war again terrorism is at a questionable point.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Yet Another War Flick. ♦ 46%,"The use of word ""flick"" in the summary instead of ""film"" seriously shows how Lone Survivor depends solely on the clichéd war elements coupled with sympathetic emotions. Well, I respect the original fighters behind the failed mission, but I still cannot understand why it had to be brought to celluloid in the first place. Too damn terrible!Letting us know the happenings through a book is a fine thing to do. But, as a film, Lone Survivor fails because: the plot heavily showcases the action scene, rather than focusing on 2 main things, characterization & the dot to dot fact file as to what went wrong. Yes, the screenplay tried hard to give us the reasons, but they either seemed ridiculous or foolish, thus giving us another reason to doubt the whole plot line-up. Unless I read the book, I might never believe this film.Next, the characters die so fast, the story gasps for life. And as the title so dramatically proposes the climax, I had no specific adrenalin rush throughout the 2 hour period. ""Pushtanwali,"" a code of honor for wise Afghanistanis is something new I learned of and it is because of this, the soundtrack, make-up and Wahlberg, why I rate it 5/10.Cinematography is below average and I am not happy with the direction even. The guns are good, the action sequences jaw-dropping, but performances aren't that great and BTW, what was Eric Bana doing in this preposterously inappropriate role?BOTTOM LINE: Easily forgettable, a very cold flick.

",y,jvkjvugfou","Lone Survivor is a thrilling and tragic movie about the navy seal going into Afghanistan on an army mission to knock out the Taliban leader. Mark Wahlberg is excellent as always in his action/dramatic acting as well with his fellow actors and actresses that play in the movie. Lone Survivor is an American war film. The teams members are heroes, the Taliban are enemies, and the heroes are able to fight on like in video games or movies. For the opening 40 minutes, it is a somewhat cheesy show of soldier's bravado and training, but it works. Incorporating real footage of the Navy Seals mixed with the actors lets viewers feel for the real life persons and their portrayed characters in the film. Soon after though, they are dropped into enemy territory on an operation to take out a Taliban leader. The mission goes awry when they encounter a small group of locals there, and they are faced with the decision of killing them and letting go. From here, the intensity begins to climb. What is the right thing to do? What would you do? Faced with that moral situation, they decide to cut them loose - soon after, Taliban forces are hot on their tail. Lone Survivor further goes into the war genre; however it being a true story adds emotion and further intrigue to this film. The sound and music played throughout the film is captivating as well as the story unfolding. The story is inspiring and will appeal to large audiences however; the way the movie was presented was in a way where I myself and many people have seen before in a war movie. The story is touching and really shows the nature of the cruel Taliban as well the grit and fight of the American Army.

Lone Survivor is about a Navy seal team who is deployed on a mission called Operation Red Wing and things go for the worse.,"Personally, I believe this is the best book I have ever read. There was never a point in time where I didn't find what was going on interesting. Each chapter was full of very exciting events and I could not wait to keep reading. It is about the Operation Red Wing of a Navy Seal team where things go for the worse. It is told by a great perspective and I think that is what makes the book so good. After finishing the book I have a whole new respect for people in our military, the things they go through everyday just to defend our freedom is truly incredible. I think this book is a very good read for anyone. The text is not hard to understand at all and I believe it is a book that everyone should read.

This squad of Seals has now been done too much and it's tragic to see the same old thing again and again. A major problem is - the actors are well-known and they are for the most part well into their 40's. MUCH too old to be doing this sort of thing any more. This group of actors is NOT believable. These guys are too old, and would simply know better than to participate in this kind of mindless-robotic conduct. The actors do not fit the roles. Even their hair cuts are unrealistically long. I have never seen a navy seal without a high and tight crew cut. These guys are 'long-hairs'. It's also VERY difficult to watch this kind of military action and not feel like what a total and complete waste of time all of this is/was. What are we doing over there? Why are our country's soldiers being sent to a conflict that has zero national interest? All this does is cement the viewer into the position that George 'Dub-Ya' Bush was the absolute WORST president of my lifetime, and what a terrible, horrific, useless waste of resources in human life, and in money for a task that we had absolutely no business being involved.

I wish the Congress, our President with his family and Ms. Clinton would be forced to watch this movie before they commit our young men to war. I wish all of us in the world would practice Pashtunwali. Maybe it's too much wishful thinking? We all know the outcome but at the very end, as the credits roll, the actual pictures and videos of these Heroes was tough, really hard to take. They were like any of us; wanting to just be happy and grow old with our spouses and kids. God Bless them and the loved ones they left behind.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wow!,"Wow! Wow! Wow!What a movie. What a story.I'd read the book some time ago and generally find adaption to be really poor cross overs however Lone Survivor was incredibly well done.Great action scenes, great acting, great cinematography, great soundtrack. Mark Wahlberg has excelled yet again- his acting is really growing on me and he's shaping up to be a favourite and must see. Having said that, I can't detract from the others either- they all handled this movie really well.This movie ticks every box for me especially given that it's based on real life experiences.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Really Does These Heroes Justice,"When I was still on active duty in the Marine Corps, a situation involving a recon team, an isolated mountaintop, a targeted Afghani warlord, and a couple of innocent goatherders was posed to us as the perfect ethical dilemma. A room full of officers wrestled with the theoretical frying pan and fireself-preservation (or, more importantly, the safety of their Marines) vs. morality. I knew then that I had to read Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10. I was not disappointed. I couldn't put that book down, and I recommended it to anyone who would listen.I've said this before many times, and I'll say it again: I love sports and movies, but my heroes aren't athletes or actors. I was fortunate enough to serve this great Country alongside my heroes. When I heard that this movie was being made, I couldn't wait to see what a team of talented filmmakers dedicated to bringing proper glory to the brave men of Operation Red Wings could do with this amazing story.Again, I was not disappointed. As a pure action flick, this film is top-notch. But it's more than that. It's a glimpse at what some patriotic, determined men and women do for other Americans (and, more importantly, for each other), in far off lands, under uncomfortable conditions, for a mediocre paycheck and little recognition.It took some effort for me not to get choked up during this film. Afterwards, my girlfriend marveled, ""It's amazing how much the human body can take."" I agreed, and added, ""Even moreso, the human mind."" Make this the next film you watch, especially if you need to get motivated to do anything remotely tough.What would you do in the situation involving the goat herders? I always say that if the first time you consider an ethical scenario is the moment that you're facing it, you're much more likely to compromise your moral code.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A propaganda movie for dumb target audience,"I was expecting a really good war movie, principally due to the IMDB rating. Instead I discovered a propaganda movie to the glory of the SEALS members and US army.The plot, « based on a true story », is as binary as possible : four good american soldiers from the SEALS face dozens of hateful muslims during undercover operation called Red Wings.During two long hours they are injuried by bullets, schrapnells, and even rockets, they fall twice over precipices and crash hardly into rocks, but as they are SEALS they are of course unbreakable, so they survive against all odds and keep fighting and killing a lot of muslims with ugly faces and long beards...Is it a caricature ? No, it is a just a very self-sufficient movie with an overdose of all the ingredients of a good war movie. There is too much heroism, too much courage, too much sense of sacrifice, too much tears and blood, and ultimately not enough real emotion.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very well done,"I used to live in Albuquerque and never realized how much Sandia mountain looks like Afghanistan. I loved the cameos of Marcus Luttrell in several of the early shots. The look on his face says it all ""Let's do this right folks"". The stunt men earned their pay on this one. Accurate portrayal of how the team messes with each other during down time. Would like to have seen some of the practical jokes they are so famous for but realize it's hard to get so much into a 2 hour film. What these guys do in real life as far as decision making is literally life and death. Unlike politics where a bad decision not only has no consequences to the decision makers they are usually covered up or denied. I was happy to see that unlike most productions out of Hollywood this one had no political spin in either direction, left or right. How the liberal critics can compare this to Saving Private Ryan is beyond me. SPR was pure fiction with a huge liberal spin done by a huge liberal cast. Lone Survivor is the real deal just like the men that it honors.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Survivor's Tale,"Operation Red Wings is a botched attempt at trying to capture/kill the Taliban leader. After letting a group of goat herders go free, the four men on the mission find themselves between a rock and dozens upon dozens of Taliban.Lone Survivor right off the bat tells you one thing if you are not familiar with the story. Only one of these men survive. I'm putting my money on Marky Mark.Peter Berg, who helmed the disastrous Battleship, somewhat redeems himself here with a realistic take on a poorly planned Navy Seals operation. Berg uses restraint in some much needed areas, which builds tension. Little to know music, dead silence is used to escalate the fear and it works to great effect. Then he goes an kind of ruins it with some melodramatic music cues at other areas, but for the most part, this is an excellently directed film.I point to the sequence in which the characters literally throw themselves off a cliff in order to get away from the gunfire. The stunt coordination for them tumbling down the cliff side is some of the most brutal things put to film. How many times have you seem people jump off a cliff side and tumble down the side in a nice choreographed sequence that has them ""hurting"" a bit once they hit the ground. These guys are thrown around, break bones, cut skin, bleed, cough blood and worse. Watching them being thrown like rag dolls heightens the realism that was needed in Lone Survivor.The film begins and ends with real footage of the men in the Navy Seals. Berg's nod to patriotism for the film. The dramatic parts are too concerned telling the story of these four fellas fight for survival to be bothered with the American flag waving propaganda. The film is small, intimate and personal.All four men give great performances. They all have genuine chemistry with each other, which is what is needed for you to root for their survival. You'd think because they're American and the enemy is the Taliban that it would be automatic, but you'd be surprised. Eric Bana has a small role, anyone could have honestly played that part.The film takes its time to build up to the action sequences, once it hits that note, it never lets up. These men are in the fight for their lives, a fight most of them lose.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliantly directed film,"Peter Berg really did an excellent job at conveying a sense of isolation in the atmosphere of this film. Coupled with great cinematography, excellent performances and great action (albeit exaggerated) you have one of the best war films ever made... despite the low budget.The camera never leaves the pinned down Americans most of the time and that gave me a very claustrophobic feeling as I watched this film this morning. All the action was shown in the perspective of the main characters and just like them, you didn't know when the next bullet was going to be fired, or the next rocket launched.Unlike films like Black Hawk Down, Lone Survivor was a bit more personal and even more emotional than the Ridley Scott classic. It made me think about karma, and the reward for acts of compassion. And I was in tears by the end of the film. Not many war films choke me up like that. And I can't think of one flaw in the film.Final Rating 8/10. Despite being without flaws, it is a B-movie. I would've rated it higher if I wasn't comparing to the larger war films out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Show no mercy while hunting or it may hunt you back,"'Lone Survivor' tells the true story of a US navy SEAL team and their failed mission called Operation Red Wings during the Afghanistan war. As the title says there's nothing to hide or secrets behind characters, only one survive from a team of four soldiers. How it all going to happen unfolded in an unbelievable manner.It was Mark Wahlberg's show, though Taylor Kitsch, Eric Bana and others appearance gave strong grip to the story. This movie takes place mainly in three locations, one from US navy base, two from mountain range and the third one from a small village. The US navy base was okay, but the mountain range and Afghan village were looked clearly fake. Failed to recreate those middle-east atmospheres where the movie was shot (in Mexico), but the movie was breathtaking by the story and performances make you forget the technical side flaws.In a few areas, it makes you to feel it was overdone. Especially after soldiers were wounded by multiple bullet shots. But then it was clearly explained in the opening scene itself like the soldiers were trained to stand tall in any given harsh situations. The director of 'The Kingdom' crafted this movie awesomely in a similar fashion to that. One of the Oscars talked movie, but did not do well, though got good responds from the movie goers around the world. It is like this year's 'Zero Dark Thrity' based on US war against Talibans. Knowing truth is always good for knowledge and if it comes through a movie, then it will be a thrilling entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The Best Movies of the Year Are in Theaters, But This Isn't One of Them","Going into this movie I knew that with Peter Burg writing the screenplay and directing it was going to be a mess but with all the good reviews I thought that I might be mistaken. I wasn't. I mean if you just want to see a movie where all the good guys have full beards and all the bad guys wear eyeliner with very questionable special effects then it's... well it's still not great. The thing that bothers me the most about this is how everyone swears to its authenticity. A quick Google search will not only show that the movie and book are glaringly different (with almost the entire last 30 minutes of the movie being fabricated) but that the book also has been criticized heavily for its inaccuracies. Most scenes in the movie will leave you thinking, ""Really? There is no way that happened"" and you'd be right. Even if you completely ignore the inaccuracies its still a spotty movie at best. I haven't seen a movie where the effects stood that far out as fake in a long time. Every time someone gets shot its so poorly done that you cant even try to pretend that its real and the ""RPG's"" are so inconsistent and fake that it hurts. Most lines in the movie seem unnatural and forced. Mark Wahlburg seems a bit off but gives a decent performance considering the horrible directing. Bottom line, there are fantastic movies in theaters right now that are far better for and more deserving of your money.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emotionally and Physically Draining Film,"Wow, I cannot recall being this moved by a film in a long time. The story depicts a real-life story of a team of Navy Seals sent into a Taliban area in Afghanistan to take out a major leader. Based on the title of the film, you already know something is going to go wrong, so that's not a spoiler.The days-long battle scenes are gripping and intense. You cannot take your eyes away as little by little, you feel things are slipping away for these guys. Yet they don't give up. Ever.The training scenes at the beginning give you a hint, just a hint, of how tough you have to be to be a Seal. All that training came to bear in this ordeal. But the strongest part of them is the brotherhood they develop, and keep, forever, through whatever happens. Man are they tough, which comes through loud and strong in this film.The acting is taut and spot on. The story is unrelenting. The climax builds and drags you into an emotional roller coaster. Some beautiful music in the final credits, with a special David Bowie song, and real life clips of these people - had me in tears sobbing. It's an emotionally moving movie that stands out as an exceptional war film, and a fitting tribute to brave troops fighting against terrorism worldwide.Well done, and thanks for bringing this story to life.

Intense and Touching,"Phenomenal! That's one of the many words to explain this movie. Based on a true story, which is the saddest part of this film. The audience already knows what the inevitable ending will be because of the title.The characters were spot on. The Navy Seals: Wahlberg, Kitsch, Hirsch and Foster played their roles brilliantly. They acted so well that it seemed as if they were actually there, experiencing the action head on in real life. They all play their roles very carefully. Knowing that they have to play someone who was real and endured all of those events. Although Wahlberg was the lead, Kitsch took all of the stardom from playing the fearless captain.Although outnumbered by Taliban forces, the men put up a tough fight, all the way through to the end... Well of their lives. They all died with honor. The shootout sequence was filled with brutality, gore and heartbreaking scenes. It had the audience at the edge of their seat. Made them feel as if they could feel their pain through the screen.By the end of the film, it makes you appreciate not only the Navy Seals, but the other military people who are out there risking their lives as we sit here and not think anything about them. This was a heart racing film that will have an everlasting effect on myself personally.When the pictorial came at the end of the movie, it kind of brought the audience back to reality. To let them know that these men were real, they had families too, and they risked their lives to save their fellow Seals.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Action scenes that should thrill any war film junkie!,"'LONE SURVIVOR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Peter Berg's new war film, based on the book of the same name by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson. The book is based on Luttrell's real-life experiences as a Navy SEAL during the War in Afghanistan. The movie focuses on a (failed) four-man mission, he was involved in, to capture a Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah. Berg wrote, produced and directed the film (as well as has a cameo in it, like most of his movies) and Mark Wahlberg stars as Luttrell. The film also features Taylor Kitsch (who also worked with Berg in 'BATTLESHIP' and the TV show 'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS'), Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, Eric Bana and Alexander Ludwig in supporting roles. It's an exciting action movie and a nice tribute to our soldiers; another impressive achievement from Peter Berg (after a slight misstep with 'BATTLESHIP').The 2007 book 'Lone Survivor' begins with Marcus Luttrell's enlistment (in 1999) and also focuses on his training and deployment to Afghanistan (in 2005). Berg decided the movie should only detail the failed Navy SEAL mission he was involved in, called 'Operation Red Wings', to capture Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami), a notorious Taliban leader. In that assignment Luttrell (Wahlberg) was part of a four-man reconnaissance team which also included LT Michael P. Murphy (Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Hirsch) and Matthew Axelson (Foster). In the film the men must take on 50 Taliban soldiers (in reality it was a lot less, some say as little as 8 to 10).Like most of Berg's movies the film is action-packed for most of it's running time (at least the entire second half) and the war scenes are brutal and violent. They're of course filmed in a very cinematic way but Berg did have multiple war veterans as technical advisors (as he usually does), including Luttrell. The cinematography is beautiful and the acting is all more than adequate. The character development is very minimal and there's not really much of a story but it still drives home it's message of camaraderie and brotherhood. It has a lot of heart and action scenes that should thrill any war film junkie.

A movie of half-truths and glorified violence.,"Between the undeveloped characters and glamorization of war, the Lone Survivor wouldn't even be in the top 20 of best war movies. The film is nothing but a series of half-truths. The entire ending of the movie is a falsification of real world events. It's existence is purely because of the need for a better climax. Ever little moment is subtly twisted from its real-life counterparts to cast the Americans in good light.The movie is also overwrought with clichés. How many times do I have to hear about brotherhood in a war movie? Am I suppose to care for these characters the second they utter the word; brother, cause the first five minutes of the movie where they show a few family photographs didn't work. In fact, it came across as nothing but a shallow attempt to make these people human, just like the rest of this film.The action scenes are well done, but if you're looking for a movie that's more than a string of gung-ho American bull-crap, look elsewhere.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not to be missed! This one.,"This movie is just so good that it'll blow your mind away in the opening sequence itself.It shows the training sessions of United States Navy SEALs not only is it a very cool footage to watch but it also makes you think is this all really worth so much pain and sacrifice ? Halfway through the movie you would understand why they are pushed so hard and that every drop of sweat during training is accounted for in the battlefield.It is so rare to see such a big star cast to come together and make a movie where all they are given equally strong characters and they all play it beautifully .A delightful cameo by the actual 'Lone Survivor' Marcus Luttrell makes it all even more special.The tension during the action sequence was nerve wracking previously felt during 'The Hurt Locker' .But this one has enough action to keep action movie lover satisfied. Very satisfying to see Mark Wahlberg in such a brilliant performance .Don't you just love it when a macho dude can do a heart warming performance .Director Peter Berg (Hancock, Battleship)has ensured that he didn't get carried away with the opportunity of explosions & mindless action, what we get is just the right amount in the right way. Special mention to the stunt doubles of the four soldiers for the sequence in which they are falling down the rocky terrain that would make the hardest of us go Oucch!! Overall this movie is a pleasure watch .Do not miss it. The film not only shows the grit of the American soldiers and the determination of a motivated soldier .It shows us what courage can overcome and shows us the Good present in an Ugly place the world is right now.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A realistic depiction of modern combat, with a little flag-waving on the side","LONE SURVIVOR is an incredible experience: a tale of bravery and camaraderie, and one of the most realistic depictions of war that I've ever seen. The story is about Operation Red Wings and takes place during the (still-ongoing) Afghanistan War. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, a Navy Seal Petty Officer who was the lone survivor of the mission. Early on, the movie establishes the characters and gives the audience a sense of who they are, although it doesn't really delve too much. However, it gives enough of a baseline so that when the fighting ensues you care when they're injured and killed. If there was one area where the movie doesn't quite stand up to scrutiny, it's that they could have had some more character development. Still, that's not quite the reason for this movie. It's mostly about the intense firefight that Luttrell and his three other team members enter into when their op is compromised. And it sure was intense and brutal. It was filmed in a way to maximize the visceral nature of the experience and, while occasionally chaotic, was still comprehensible. There was also a lot of well-done special effects with injuries, kill-shots, etc. Here, the filmmakers did a great job putting you in the moment and making you feel the pain these soldiers went through. Overall, I liked the movie which, while never questioning American involvement in the region, does differentiate between friendly Afghanis and the Taliban. There was a touching moment towards the end between Luttrell and a young Afghani boy that was quite moving. Also, before the end credits they have a slide show of the actual people involved in the operation, which I thought was a fitting tribute to their sacrifice. Is it the greatest war movie ever? No, but it is very effective at what it sets out to do, and I applaud it for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Signed, Sealed, and Delivered!","The gripping ""Lone Survivor"" has that ""eye of the tiger"" as a surreal cinematic experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This adapted true story stars Mark Wahlberg as Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell who is sent on a mission with his three Seal compadres to kill or capture Tabilan leader Ahmad Shad. When the mission turns into a nightmarish experience, Marcus and company have to fight for their lives by combating a full army of Tabilans. Director Peter Berg, who has not been much of a Berger Directorial King in his past work, does surprise here by brilliantly capturing the authenticity of the misery of war through Marcus' & Co. unforgettable experience. Wahlberg was on target as Marcus, and Ben Foster also fostered in nicely with his work as Navy Seal Matt ""Axe"" Axelson. There are many scenes that are a bit too heavy-handed for some viewers, but ""Lone Survivor"" is a must-see and a true valiant lesson of overcoming insurmountable odds. And I don't think I am the lone critic (or pseudo-critic better stated) that has the same sentiment. **** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I have also lived in NA for more than a decade so I know what mountains and trees look like here. And they look very different. That's why I was confused. Otherwise, the action looked good.

A film for middle America,"Following making Battleship Peter Berg needed to redeem himself, so made his dream project, an adaptation of Lone Survivor, serving as his love letter for the Navy Seals. Based on the true story of Operation Red Wing, Lone Survivor tells a similar story to Black Hawk Down where a operation to target a Taliban goes wrong, leading to a SEAL team of four have to fight for their lives against large force of Taliban fighters.The war action is brutal and bloody as Berg delivers a relentless firefight between the SEALS and the Taliban. The action was the best part of the film as Berg and his cinematographer use a hand-held cameras and a liberal use of blood packs, making the war scenes seem like Saving Private Ryan. But the SEALS goes through a lot of punishment, getting shot up, getting their parts of their bodies blown off and still keep on fighting.There is a good cast and they do a solid job in their respective roles, being believable in their relationship. But the actors have little to work on: there is no characterisation, we do not know much about the men we are following and the main reason to support the Americans simply because the Taliban commander was worst, beheading people readily. This is a film that does not go into the complexities of the War in Afghanistan and simply made as a film about surviving in impossible odds as everything goes wrong, from the lack of support from outside and the radio going wrong early on.The battle scenes were expertly done and fans of war films will enjoy that aspect of the film.

One Long Visceral Combat Scene,"There is not much of a storyline to Lone Survivor directed by Peter Berg. Just based on the title alone, we are already fully aware of the film's ending. A Four man team goes into battle. Three of them die. Only One survives.The pre-action first act is pretty weak. It's the same old ultra-patriotic, Navy Seal prestige banter complete with a rookie giving a front-of-the-class speech defining his role as a Seal Diver. In the mission briefing the target Afghans are portrayed as cliché plot devices. Never is there a mention that these Afghan's are actual humans whose country the Seals are currently occupying, and are currently planning to kill. Scenes like these are not usually later redeemed, but as soon as the four Seals drop into the field, the tone of the film changes.What makes the film Lone Survivor a good film is 100% in its execution. The performances of all the actors, the special effects and stunts, the lighting and the sound, the fancy camera work and exotic scenery, the violence, equal the actual enactment: a very powerful, non-partisan, grim portrayal of modern ground combat.Once dropped in the field, the Seals encounter innocent civilians. Faced with the ethical decision of whether to execute them or free them, the Seals let them go. This is truly a controversial choice. Acting differently surely would have produced a different, less deadly outcome (for the Seals at least). Any logical viewer will afterwards struggle to justify why the Seals made the choice they did. Why would they sacrifice themselves for the innocents? It is almost nonsense, but in war decisions are made on the fly, and this is what happened.Within minutes the freed civilians alert the troops, and an army of hundreds of heavily armed men surround the group of 4. This when the action starts.It begins with the exchange of long-range rifle fire but soon the Seals are surrounded and flanked fiercely. As the battle shifts positions we encounter scenes where Seals must make split second decisions between particularly gruesome tasks. Which is less likely to kill me? Pushing forward and engaging in fire where I am extremely outnumbered, or throwing myself down this 50 foot rock face? The unfolding of this battle, and that is to say two-thirds of the film, really cannot be described in words. The battle truly is the film. It is an attempt at the depicting the intensity of real combat, and myself having zero experience in real combat, I think Peter Berg is very successful in portraying it.Their radio signals having been lost, their back-up firepower having failed them, and every other piece of bad luck imaginable having occurred, the battle ends. The Seals literally having fought to their deaths.Getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Run-of-the-Mill Representation of American Warfare in Afghanistan,"I wish I could get enthusiastic about LONE SURVIVOR. Peter Berg's direction is both terse and non-partisan, portraying the sheer hell of Americans trying to fight in an alien territory against an elusive opponent. Led by Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), a small group of troops are left alone to fight for their lives in an atmosphere fraught with danger; this is memorably evoked through fast cuts and the use hand-held cameras emphasizing the peril that they are faced with. The actors are excellent, especially Wahlberg and Taylor Kitsch as his fellow-soldier Taylor Kitsch. On the other hand LONE SURVIVOR is inscribed within wearyingly familiar binarist terms; the Taleban are represented as both savage and ruthless, as opposed to the more humanist American forces. The fact that the Americans are invading another territory is conveniently overlooked. The motive for the mission - to kill a notorious Taleban leader Ahmad Shah - is justifiable (from an American perspective), but experience might demonstrate that a so-called ""terrorist"" from an American perspective might fulfill a quite different role in other contexts. Nor does the film actively question why the American forces are in Afghanistan; what their motives are; and what the final outcome of their occupation might be. The focus instead is on the bravery of a few men rather than looking at the broader political implications of their action. Director Berg opts for a thick-ear approach, with the script regularly peppered with curses and/or gunshots in familiar war-film mode.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Jingoistic Passion of the Christ,"This will be a quick-and-dirty review of the film, setting all personal political views aside. And please keep in mind that criticizing a film portraying real American soldiers in no way means that I am criticizing the real life soldiers who do these types of things for which I have the utmost respect.As for the movie, the first 30 minutes is a straight military recruitment video, full of prospective SEALS training, running bare- chested in the sand with iconic American drums rolling in the background, and rah-rah speeches of military bravado.Once the action starts, it turns into a jingoistic Passion of the Christ. The soldiers are used merely as human meat puppets with no subtext to it, like Berg's only point in showing the excess was to convey the amount of damage the body can take.The most glaring weakness of the film is that there is no depth to any of the main characters, they are basically macho military male cardboard cutouts with no substance to them, which other than the fact that they are Americans leaves an emotional disconnect between the viewer and the emotional response Berg was looking for.On the most superficial of levels I can see the average moviegoer finding enjoyment in this, especially the battlefield/COD first-person- shooter demographic.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lone,"I thought this movie was great. I loved how it told the story through action. The suspense was thrilling and I thought the director did a great job of showing the passion of the Seals that were being portrayed. In all, I think this movie does a great job of honoring those brave men who lost their lives fighting for our country. It was very entertaining, and even though I'm not a huge action fan, It kept my attention the entire time. I also appreciated the fact that the director made sure to emphasize the kindness of the man who aided him. It is a step in the right direction to stop prejudice in our country.

Firefight for the ages!,"I just saw LONE SURVIVOR! This movie is about the true story of Operation Red Wings, a military scout mission that turned into a massive firefight between four Navy SEALs and a small army of Taliban soldiers and the heroism the SEALs displayed during the battle. The movie is directed by Peter Berg stars Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Taylor Kitsch and Emile Hirsch and is without a doubt one of the best war movies I've seen in the last 10 years. First of all, the acting here is superb! Everyone in it does a masterful job especially Ben Foster who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. The story is tight and simple but is well told for the most part. The Cinematography is unique and really creatively shows each and every excruciating aspect of real war situations. Lone Survivor is fantastic but some of the violence is really tough to watch at points and a lot of the characters are shown in a too often seen let-me-show-you-my-girl-back-home kind of way and we all know what that means X_X. Overall I would say Lone Survivor sits somewhere between Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan and is highly recommended to anyone looking for their action movie fix. Lone Survivor gets a solid 4... out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overall,"This movie was not only inspirational, but left you wanting more. Throughout the whole movie you were wondering what would happen. It was enticing, intense, sad, and vigorous. This is arguably Mark's best movie yet, even though Planet of the Apes and The Other Guys were hits to me as well. I completely recommend seeing this movie. Overall rating: 8.5/10. Not as good as BHD or a Saving Private Ryan but it was great. It. Made me feel as though I were a navy seal, even though that will not happen. It is an adventure that no other movie gives you. It allows you to truly observe the Middle East and how they treat their population. He terrorists truly have a choke hold on that region. This movie was exceptional, however I do not recommend showing this to anyone who is not too fond of blood, or vulgar phrases. Overall age group (14-15+).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Truly miraculous,"Anyone being critical of the authenticity and accuracy of this movie clearly has never read the book Lone Survivor written by brave SEAL member Marcus Luttrell.Sure there are some obvious Hollywood exaggerations, but the meat and potatoes of the movie are backed up first hand by the lone survivor himself.The casting of this movie is fantastic, as you see at the end of the movie, side by side comparisons to the real life SEALs and their Hollywood counterparts. Each actor looks very similar to the real guys. Wahlberg is the one who is the furthest from being accurate as he is much smaller and doesn't really look like Luttrell in the least but he does a fantastic job of acting and in his portrayal of Luttrell.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty lazy stuff,"not a lot of effort at all to make this realistic the portrayal of special forces was flabbergasting and to be frank they deserved more to be called speshul feces. The film is neither on purpose over the top like the expendable or harrowingly accurate like saving private Ryan or the hurt locker. The effort put into making this realistic was atrocious in one scene you see uncamoflaged men ""hiding"" under pine trees that offer very little in the way of protection from being discovered and indeed these supposedly elite troops come across as complete morons. This and the action sequences are also pretty poor. I'm a massive fan of Mark Wahlberg and I was very disappointed with this it just seemed so half arsed.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thank GOODNESS they didn't hurt the lovely goat herders...,"What pisses me off most? Between the 6 of them, and despite knowing that village is at best a 20 min jog by that little Tali hustling down to sound ze alarm. Why not take them all? As detainees until they get picked up ... and just release them from wherever??Why release them such that they only got a 20 min head start before being hunted by if not a company of talis, a BATTALION!? When they already knew comms were bad before they left? And confirmed it on the mountain?And wouldn't you love to know the size + range of the Taliban force the Apaches abandoned covering the QRF to help an Army TIC..? Was it some harassing fire from 800 meters in which they could barely make out who was doing it? Or were they ambushed and outnumbered?Of course, now it sounds (per Marcus Luttrell) that some amount of it was if not embellished ... fabricated. I hope the real story is less annoying, but, knowing how stupidly the military was doing things for the last 15 years, I'm sure logic and reason were the exception, and the rule was progressively stupid decisions that was more & more befuddling.

Gritting and to the bone,it was a toss up between grand piano and lone survivor. the latter won due to movie timings as well as the fact that mark wahlberg and emile hirsch was in it. from the time i sat down to the roll of the end credits it was a movie that transported me to the throes of humanity and how we see situations differently. no one is painted an enemy but we adapt and thus the same people we let go at times comes back to haunt us and if we don't have friends who have our back we are just forgotten. the cinematography and the background score was mesmerizing. the fact that it is a true story and well depicted by the four band of brothers as well as the other casts. hats of too peter berg for yet another star.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too many reviews by people...,"...who have no idea WTF they're talking about. If you haven't served as a SEAL, then you have zero business even commenting about any special forces aspect of this film nor any knowledge about what is and is not accurate, proper, or relevant in that arena. Further, if you haven't served in the military and in any armed conflict, then you have zero business commenting about the military and war aspects of this film.As for the quality of the movie from a cinema, acting, and story - fire way - but otherwise, contain your comments to what you know.That said, I served in the Navy - I love the Navy and the SEALs but I hate war and much of what we've done, as a Country, for the last decade or so WRT the military, our troops, and other citizens of this planet. Those feelings have kept me from embracing tales and movies that I suspect may glamorize the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and with this one, I felt especially that it might go down that path. However, I took the plunge and was not disappointed. This story does nothing to glamorize anything about war but does center squarely on the brotherhood and what hell can and will become your reality when Murphy (the law - not the SEAL) rears his ugly head. It is also about survival, dedication, and most of all - honor - both with the SEALs and the Afghanis. All in all, this movie is well done - has good acting and story-telling - and is an incredible story even if part of it is not 100% accurate.If you're looking for real-world SEAL depiction, then this may or may not be it - real SEALs know far better than I.

The Hollywood Insult to True Stories,"I had no problem with the entertainment value or performances but have a big concern over what is being implied with these Hollywood versions of very serious history (Zero Dark Thirty, Cpt Phillips, etc) which exploit real life situations for profit and ratings.If a true story has to be rewritten in any way to better a Hollywood movie, made for profit and awards by already millionaire celebrities; Why even use the real names of people? Why not base it in truth but openly make it clear you are changing details Hollywood didn't find juicy enough while exploiting serious situations for money and awards?It's like a bible. If it's so important and sacred, why sell it for money and why ever rewrite it? There's no reason to if you want to be taken seriously.I don't care if the people involved in the real story support this garbage. Rewriting history with changes that DID not happen, regardless of how cool it looks, is dishonest and does a disservice to those who died and can't cash a book selling check or shake hands with rich movie stars.If you care so much about truth, don't sex-up the story to have dramatic elements for the sake of an audience. Make it for the history channel and swallow your pride.Impossible I know but just a thought to get back to honesty and what matters most.

Marcus Luttrell is a liar.,"Both his account of events and its depiction in this film are heavily embellished. They are contradicted by the accounts of Mohammed Gulab - the man who rescued him - as well as commanders of the Marine and Ranger units operating in the area before and after Operation Red Wings.There were a maximum of 30 Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM; not Taliban) in the area - according to Luttrell's own initial after-action report - with other sources indicating as low as 8. Not the 200-300 as claimed by the filmLuttrell claimed to have fired ""round after round"" at the encroaching enemy. Mohammed Gulab stated that when he rescued Luttrell, he still had his full combat load of magazines on his person. Axelson, however, had fired all of his rounds.Shah (the ACM leader) was not responsible for killing 20 Marines in the preceding week. There is no record of any such event.As a film, on its own, if these events were made up - it'd be fine, a 6/10 - even in that context, there are some inaccurate details (unrelated to those of the narrative), some dragging scenes, borderline cliche'd writing. The fact it attempts to promote the acceptance of extrajudicial killings by military forces - ie war crimes - is also concerning.And the firefight sequence still breaks suspension of disbelief; SEALs and other special forces operators from around the world are still just as human as you or me; their training and expertise does not magically imbue them with the ability to put up a fight against 80 times their number - without fire support, fire superiority, advantageous terrain, knowledge of said terrain or any other such advantages or mitigating factors. Each of these advantages that existed, belonged to the ACM.Given it's a historically revisionist propaganda piece that portrays a grossly inaccurate, exaggerated and overly-favourable narrative of one of the United States' biggest military disasters in recent history, in which many real men lost their lives - in order to fluff the ego and celebrate a man who lied about one of the most traumatising and defining moments of his life in order to profit from it, give himself and the US Military a positive image - spitting in the face of the men who died with him, who died trying to save him, and in the face of the man who did save him - it instantly loses any goodwill I might've had towards it.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Afghan Attack,"Peter Berg seems to be trying to hard to imitate Michael Bay. Whereas Battleship was effectively a Bay version of a film based on a toy, here we see the same type of bombastic and patriotic tones that Bay likes to indulge in.Based on true events, Lone Survivor follows Marks Wahlberg and his Navy SEAL team try to hunt down a Taliban Leader. However they encounter some goat herders and decide whether to kill them or not. However these scene itself causes discomfort as the herders are civilians and therefore killing them is in breach of the Geneva convention, yet the film wants to enter a debate on war ethics. These are professional soldiers, surely this was mentioned in their training? Hold on it was mentioned in the mission briefing a few minutes earlier!As they have to abort the mission the SEALs encounter the Taliban forces and get involved in a brutal and visceral gunfight in the wild Afghan terrain which suspiciously looks like somewhere in America.Mark Walhberg, Ben Foster and Taylor Kitsch give strong performances but the film although starts off slowly then becomes scenes of constant blood-soaked fighting and running or more accurately falling down the mountain from the Taliban.There is an element of war porn in this film with the prolonged battle scenes as the SEALs are repeatedly getting shot. It starts as soldiers goofing around but once the action begins there is an emphasis of a band of brothers but there is something hollow about this film even with the latter storyline of getting help from Pushtun villagers does not overcome.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gripping but don't claim 'based on a true story',"I tend to gravitate towards movies based on true stories. As you watch there is this strong ongoing emotion that the narrative is based on what really happened. I felt that same with this movie, until I started reading reviews and comparisons with both the book and witnesses. The fact that Luttrell came back with all his ammo throws the main story thread into question. Perhaps the 4 seals were ambushed by a handful of Taliban fighters and Luttrell managed to hide, then crawl a few miles to safety. That doesn't make for a jingoistic story so it would appear that both Luttrell and Hollywood both upped the plot.Don't get me wrong, these guys are all heroes for participating in incredibly dangerous missions, but declare this as a work of fiction.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

WAR/ DOCU DRAMAAdapted from a book called""Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10"" by Marcus Luttrell and assistance from novelist and ghostwriter Patrick Robinson. Co-produced, written and directed by Peter Berg. The first of five movies he did with actor Mark Wahlberg who is also credited as co-producers, he plays the ""lone survivor"" Marcus Luttrell recounting a particular moment when him along with three of his SEALs unit of Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), and Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster) were up against a mountain of Taliban fighters.

Unmasking Fiction in Lone Survivor,"Lone Survivor, directed by Peter Berg, takes viewers into the 2005 Operation Red Wings, where four Navy SEALs find themselves in an intense firefight in the mountains of Afghanistan. While it presents itself as a tribute to heroism and sacrifice, the film's inaccuracies detract significantly from its credibility, transforming real events into a dramatized Hollywood spectacle.The combat scenes, while skillfully choreographed, are deeply misleading. The movie depicts the SEAL team heroically fending off hundreds of Taliban fighters, a portrayal that exaggerates the scale of the actual conflict. In reality, the four SEALs encountered around 14 Taliban fighters-not the overwhelming force shown on screen. This choice of exaggeration isn't just dramatic flair; it's a deliberate misrepresentation that skews the viewer's perception of the challenges the SEALs faced, elevating them to an almost mythical status while ignoring more grounded truths.Adding to this distortion is the omission of a crucial aspect of Luttrell's rescue. The movie implies that the village where Luttrell took refuge was under Taliban attack and that the villagers fought off these assaults to protect him. However, there was no Taliban attack on the village during Luttrell's stay. The film further omits the role of the village elder, who was instrumental in protecting Luttrell by invoking the sacred Pashtunwali code, which mandates that guests be protected. This key element in the rescue story is crucial, as it highlights the bravery, integrity, and compassion of the Afghan villagers-qualities sidelined in favor of an inflated narrative of American heroism.The film's selective storytelling doesn't just sideline Afghan voices; it distorts them. Muhammad Gulab, the Afghan who saved Luttrell's life, and his village elders displayed incredible courage in upholding their moral code, even under Taliban pressure. The decision to downplay the contributions of Gulab and the villagers in protecting Luttrell paints a reductive picture of the Afghan people, robbing them of agency and depth. Furthermore, Gulab's later disavowal of Luttrell's narrative and his exposure of its inaccuracies were ignored by Hollywood, leaving him sidelined and abandoned. This disregard for an Afghan perspective reveals a troubling bias in how the story was adapted, reinforcing a skewed image of Americans as saviors while erasing the crucial role played by the locals.These deliberate inaccuracies raise questions about the motives behind the movie's portrayal. By exaggerating the dangers faced by the SEALs and downplaying the heroism and compassion of the Afghan villagers, the film not only caters to a Western audience but also subtly reinforces imperialist undertones that paint the U. S. military as noble defenders of freedom against an undifferentiated ""enemy."" This form of storytelling feeds into Hollywood's frequent tendency to promote narratives that justify and glorify American intervention abroad, furthering a narrative that aligns conveniently with global imperialistic agendas.Ultimately, while Lone Survivor may satisfy viewers looking for action and patriotic fervor, it fails as a responsible historical account. Its compromises on truth in favor of heroism and spectacle come at the cost of a deeper, more honest story. This is a reminder of the need to scrutinize Hollywood's portrayals of real events, especially when they shape perceptions of war, heroism, and the people in countries where such conflicts take place.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Lame, completely forgettable war movie","I don't want to re-hash everything some of the one-star rating reviewers have already said, but this film was a huge disappointment. I will throw a bit out there, though; Totally lame hero dialog that never once strayed from the ""Chuck Norris"" formula, characters I never cared about for a moment (we're supposed to care that one of the guy's fiancé wants an expensive horse as a present??), enemy soldiers who just run up one and after another like complete dopes and get shot, US soldiers who somehow fall off cliffs at least three times and land on back- breaking rocks and get up and still run around, the sappy doe-eyed little boy and the ""hero"" local who saved him, and the list goes on and on. The only time I was interested was in the first couple of minutes when they were showing how tough SEAL training was- now that would have made an interesting movie.Now don't get me wrong here- I absolutely love war movies; 2 or 3 are in my all-time top 10. My message is simply this for people who have grown up during our current conflicts. If you think this is a great war, fine, but I hope you have taken the time to see the real greats; Platoon, Apocalypse Now (original), The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan, and The Band of Brothers. Sometimes I get the feeling that today's younger movie goers never bothered to watch older movies, when they fawn over a dreadful film such as this one. Hell, even a western like The Good, the Bad and The Ugly had more memorable things to say about warfare than Lone Survivor did.Now I get this is based on a true story and that these guys were heroes and brave and gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country, but that doesn't make the film great. I do hope that someday, maybe when our current wars are long over with, a worthy film is made about the Afgahn and Iraq conflicts. Sorry, but Sniper and Survivor ain't it.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It can't decide if it's a tribute to a story, or an OTT action flick","I Went into this film with no expectations, just a spur of the moment thing with friends (We flipped a coin between this, and RoboCop.)

Admittedly, I hadn't heard of this story beforehand, but some parts are just far too unbelievable, lack of continuity, tired clichés, bad dialogue and lack of character development or investment, makes it seem an empty action flick, instead of what it should have been. However, there are good parts to it, the action sequences can sometimes work, and the tension created works well.

It's an action movie,"If Lone survivor had been labeled ""Action Movie"" I would have given it 6/10 instead of a mere 4/10. Because that's what it is, an action movie. Anyone who thinks this is close to what infantry warfare is like has been playing too much Call of Duty. If this was what it was really like the US would have beaten the Taliban easily. The four Seals literally take down dozens of insurgents like it's nothing, which is far from accurate, even for the most highly trained soldiers the US armed forces have to offer. It's closer to Schwarzenegger's Commando than it is to Band of Brothers and that was a disappointment. It's not a bad film, on the contrary, it's quite good. Solid acting and macho cockiness like one would expect from Navy Seals and cheesy American patriotism are al acceptable for me, it's just that the action is too much Arnold and too little realism. If they had made it an honest realistic film in which the four Seals are ambushed and basically never stand a chance that would have had my preference, because that's what really happened. These are not killing machines, these are men of flesh and blood and a single bullet is enough to end their lives, that's why Seals act largely like regular soldiers because like regular soldiers they too want to stay alive. They don't jump and run around like crazy, shooting mindless Taliban canon fodder left and right just like that, it just does not happen. But I guess this film inspired many American teen boys to try out for BUDS training only to find out it's actually not quite like in the movies.If you see Lone Survivor for that it is, you will enjoy it somewhat I think, just lots of cringy patriotism and pew!

Realistic?,"I have to admit that this movie tries to engage audience into vilifying the Taliban as a very amateur Army, but the truth is not so many Taliban fighters died in the real battle and it was almost like a one sided battle for Taliban and there was hardly any resistance according to sources of Taliban during this mission, people say this is realistic which I fail to understand because as far as I am concerned the US soldiers seemed to be robots that would fall the cliff over rocks get hit be tree trunks so hard that it would break any bones at the same time I don't see chances of survival in such falls, let alone everyone surviving during such falls, which is very unrealistic...It is also important to note how good the Aim of US soldiers was very sharp when they were in such pain and torment, shivering of fear, in reality the case is completely opposite, Taliban were shown to come out without any proper cover and understanding but just shooting and marching, but in reality the Taliban has undoubtedly beaten The US and NATO forces in every Stratagem of war, the casualties that Taliban takes is mainly because of Air Support, otherwise they are very strategic to take much less damage, and very sharp to inflict more damage.I don't see this as a realistic movie as I have seen some real fights of Taliban and US forces on Youtube which are more powerful and real and create the sense of understanding what a real encounter is like, it creates fear and certain atmosphere that is unmatchable that your heart starts pounding and every gunshot you hear creates certain vibrations in your heart. But I have to say this movie does however do justice to Hollywood standards which have been much more unrealistic usually but no we cannot call this movie realistic and it should be considered as fiction because there is lot of fiction involved.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

If US soldiers would serve in a conscript army, all the blame for this failure would rest on a shoulders of US government and army commanders.
