Disappointed.,"Trailer was better than the movie. To me this movie just never takes off. It's a shame because there is some fantastic imagery and a wonderful theme lying underneath but in the end it can not overcome its plot holes and failed delivery of the message its trying to speak. It truly believes it's deeper than it is, but left me unfulfilled. Kind of lazy/rushed writing in my opinion. Kind of just throws a bunch of mediocre stuff at you without any real substance and expects the audience to give it purpose and deeper meaning in there own heads. Which is fine to do but to me this movie wasn't worthy of that merit of thought. You keep waiting for it to evolve but it just never does. Honestly can't believe critics are putting this on such a pedestal giving it such rave reviews.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Did I watch the same movie as the people that are giving this a 10/10???,Was excited to watch this movie with all the hype surrounding it. The first 20 mins or so was on par with my expectations and then it just fell flat on its face. Not nearly as good as Get Out. Way to many plot holes and un answered questions. Acting was decent and writing was average. Some funny parts and the soundtrack are the only thing that really saves this movie from being a 3 or a 4.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great idea, questionable execution...","I am torn on whether or not I like the story of Us. Part of me really likes the originality of the idea and the subtle social commentary the film delivers; however, I felt that despite Us having an interesting idea, the execution led to a disjointed story that felt a bit scatterbrained. There were definitely parts of the film that were suspenseful and horrifying, but at the same time, other parts felt too over-explained or tropey. This leads to me having many unanswered questions about certain aspects and feeling like other aspects shouldn't have been explained at all to keep the mystery. I think the story is hard to talk about without spoiling it, but overall, I expected more from Jordan Peele's writing but did enjoy some of it.Despite my indecisive feelings of the film's story, many pieces of the film were exceptionally well done. One aspect that stood out in Us was the soundtrack and the usage of music. I think the original soundtrack was memorable and used appropriately to accentuate the feeling of horror at some points in the film. On the flip side, the soundtrack was used to perfectly contrast what was going on onscreen. This led to some great sequences (the Beach Boys scene) that utilized the soundtrack in an interesting way. Another part of the film that I really enjoyed was Lupita Nyong'o and the child actors' performances. Nyong'o in particular is the most terrifying part of the film. She plays both a horrific monster and a badass mother, making it easy to forget that the same actor plays them.As a whole, I think Us is an enjoyable horror film that has some missteps with its story elements and structure. I would recommend this film to horror fans, but don't go into the film expecting anything like Get Out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A lot of hype, but not fully satisfying.","I hate saying this, but this film is the product of when you've got incredible everything and an underdeveloped script. The concepts are great, but lose their value and appreciation because there is so much with so little explanation, leaving me with the impression that they were not completely thought-out.
Acting was incredible, cinematography, lighting, set design, and sound track were wonderful too! It's just that the script and story does not fully deliver. It's so conceptual that it loses horror, yet so rushed in execution that it loses coherence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Just because you want it to be good, doesn't make it good.","Jordan Peele is at it again!Hard to say too much about this one without spoiling, but here goes.
The acting is good, especially considering many of the actors plays two roles. They all do a bang up job in that regard. So no trouble so far.
The movie looks good. I have no complains here either. It's technically very well made. We always see what's going on, no shaky cam or anything like that. Some nice shots too.
The humor works pretty well, the dialogue comes off as natural.
I like the beginning of the movie, the family is pretty likable.
The movie is sort of a mystery, and when the mystery unravels is when we get to some slight problems. The scrips seems to be based on a pretty good idea, that was never thoroughly worked out. It just isn't thought all the way through.
I am left with several questions, and not in a good way.
This is spoiler terriroty, so I won't go into detail, but it didn't sit well with me. Doesn't seem to make sense. The plot has more holes than a swizz cheese. (that almost no critics talk about this is very strange)Now, in the movies defence, the sub-genre it turne out to be is very far from my favorite, so others might like it better. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and this is just not one of the best ones. It is mediocre.
Not a weak movie, but definitely no classic. Will not be watching it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Get Out"" of the mindset that this is a straight-forward horror film","People thinking this will be a straight-forward horror film will be disappointed;Us (2019)is a complex, mind bending experience that tests the limitations of what a horror film can be. What's great about the film is how differently people will interpret what they've witnessed. I left the theater tonight to the sounds of people passionately discussing theories, different explanations and thoughts on it all - and that, to me, is one of the great joys in leaving a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A really interesting Horror movie with a great premise but big problems,"Whilst not just as good as Get Out, Us is a film I really can't stop thinking about. I kind of liked it, I kind of didn't and honestly, I'm a bit conflicted. I think the cinematography and concept are absolutely fantastic. The acting is pretty good and the score is great. The editing is probably the weaker parts of a really damn good film and really lets down the script and a lot of the execution.I think some of the script is half-baked with plot-holes but what it does with the concept itself feels like something out of a great short story. The main actress is fantastic honestly, she does a great job and what happens at the end really turns the plot on its head and I'll definitely be having a different experience in the next watch which is great.I really love how bizarre this film is, I love the ambiguity and the direction. I love the style and execution. It's a sort of creepy style which I've loved in other short films which hasn't really been explored until now. There are some great unlaying themes in there as well but it still definitely has its problems especially in the sound editing (the soundtrack is great but it is overused in parts where it didn't need to be) and the editing itself especially in several cuts between the past and the present.In the end, though, I see myself really coming to love it on a second watch, I honestly can't stop thinking about it even though there were some things that could be better but this film really shows that Jordan Peele is a force to be reckoned with especially in Horror. I would love to see him tackle other genres or Horror sub-genres. If you liked Get Out, you'll probably like this film too, it's a really interesting film and it will be talked about for years to come. I give this movie a Not Perfect but Very Interesting/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disappointed,"I wanted to like this movie, I was so excited about the trailer and I like the idea behind it, it's very original... but it simply didn't happed. Although we can say that Jordan Peele is a filmmaker who thinks outside the box and brings important and strong subjects, I thought the movie was poorly developed. I need to believe in what I'm watching, but there are so many plot holes and inconsistencies that the whole experience was damaged. The metaphors are confusing, the explanations are flat and forced, the writing felt really lazy to me.
And to add, I thought the mix of comedy and horror, that can be made in very harmonic ways, was unbalanced. All the time the comedic moments came up to break the tension, so I was not able to get scared at all and I wanted to be.
Nevertheless, I'd like to point out the amazing acting of Lupyta. Her delivery is always intense and strong, no matter which character she is playing. And I hope Peele keeps his originality, but learns to develop better narratives in the future.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Trading Symbolism for Logic,"I was excited for ""Us."" Following Jordan Peele's ""Get out"" and a phenomenal first trailer; I was pretty excited to see where this movie was going.
After watching the movie in full I was confused. I was confused whether I thought this was an entertaining/eh movie or if it was a spectacular movie. After deliberating in my mind I believe this movie is pretty great! There are admittedly some logical issues that don't really add up in my own head, however, I think Peele wanted this to be a talking point. He instead focuses a lot on symbolism and honestly it's beautiful and a bit scary.The character dynamics are really cool to watch. Especially Adelaide/Red. I was kind of obsessed with the creepy-like leadership motions of Red. I can only imagine this was a fun role for Lupita to play!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Could have been so much better.,"A family take a trip to the beach, and soon after their lives take a deadly twist as doppelgangers begin to appear.I didn't care for it when I saw it at the cinema, but I thought I'd take another look, based on the various awards, and some of the many good opinions about it.Once again, I'm of the same opinion, total frustration, what a totally frustrating mix of ambiguity, good acting, good ideas and poor storytelling.I loved the initial premise, and those scenes where the family are terrified by their doubles, brilliant, so creepy, but sadly after that it just descends into nothing.I felt like I was just left to scratch my head wondering exactly what was going on, we're only given a snippet of the story, I wanted to know more.There were a couple of good scenes, and a few good jump scares, but nothing to really register or keep you awake at night, they could have gone so much further.I will commend the acting, I thought Lupita Nyong'o in particular did an excellent job, especially playing the two parts.Overall decent, but a little disappointing.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Funny Games,"Us is a puzzling film that slowly reveals its layers but then becomes more illogical and confusing.It is better to not think about too deeply and just enjoy the ride. It means you lose any subtext the filmmaker had about a society of us and the others.The film opens at the funfair in the boardwalk of Santa Cruz in 1986. A small girl, Adelaide is on holiday and wanders off while her father is playing whack-a-mole. As she enters a funhouse she sees a doppelgänger of herself in the hall of mirrors. This encounter left her unable to communicate for some time and still affects her in the present day.We then cut to the present day when Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) is vacationing at their summer home in Santa Cruz with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two children Zora and Jason.One evening the Wilsons see another family that looks exactly like them standing outside the house decked out in red overalls. They look like they mean to harm them and they are somehow tethered to the soul of the individual Wilson family members.The doppelgängers all grunt except for Red, Adelaide's double who speaks with a raspy voice. Red tells Adelaide that both of them are tethered together and share a soul. These doubles live in a subterranean underground world.As an home invasion horror it is very effective and chilling, we find out that other families are being slaughtered by their doubles. It leads to a problem. Why are the Wilsons being toyed with when other families are being brutally killed and the violence is spreading as the doubles attempt to enact their own Hands across America.The moment the film broadens its premise it starts losing it logic. Even when the family try to get away from Santa Cruz and head down to Mexico, after driving all night they are somehow still in Santa Cruz. I've been to Santa Cruz it is not that big!Jordan Peele tries to underpin his film with some kind of explanation and symbolism but it is half baked. He also wants to tie the film together by making it all about Adelaide. Unlike Get Out there is little humour in this film although Gabe is meant to be a dorky dad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good, not great","It's got some originality but it lacks the hook you want. The trailer is worth watching more than the movie in my opinion. I give it a 7 for the acting and comedy throughout. The main character is wonderful and her husband is the comedic relief in tense situations, even the kids played their roles well. The movie however, was all over the place. I don't think anyone in the theater really understood the premise until it was over and even then you're left shrugging. It's like the reverse of an early M. Night Shyamalan twist.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Us: The concept saves it,"I enjoyed Get Out (2017) but I wasn't aboard the hype train, it was good but I didn't understand why people ranted and raved about it being incredible.Upon seeing the trailer for Us I was excited, I loved this idea it looked positively chilling. As always however I assumed the worst, I've long since learned to keep my expectations low when it comes to Hollywood films.Well, I class Us in the same category as Get Out, namely it's good but it's hardly anything special.It tells the story of a family who come under attack by their own clones. The concept works and the film turned out to be miles above the home invasion film I expected it to be. In fact the scale is far greater than I assumed, this was really quite good.The cast do a great job, but for a movie that tries to come across genuinely scary and chilling there was a lot of comedy thrown in and I'm not sure that was a great idea.The story is decent, it's well paced and it all comes together in the end. However something didn't feel quite right, something I can't quite put my finger on but whatever it was kept the movie from being anything beyond enjoyable.Peele has delivered another enjoyable film, but don't believe the hype.The Good:Great ideaFitting soundtrackThe Bad:A couple of plot holesInconsistent tone",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
intriguing but flawed,"In 1986, a girl wanders away from her father in a carnival fair. She is shocked by a doppelganger. In the present day, the Wilson family is on vacation. They are shocked by their own doppelgangers wearing red overalls and armed with scissors.I like the comedy when they happen. The horror isn't that horrific but it is intriguing. What I love most about the horror is its unknowable premise. That it is unknowable until the movie tries to let us know it. It's actually a lot more creepy when these unknown doppelgangers appear out of nowhere without explanations. The problem starts with the opening text. The knowledge of tunnels is unnecessary. It's a piece of a puzzle which is better left unsolved. The present day story should really end after the news report on the TV. It can then go back to 1986 for that surprise reveal but it's not necessary to try to explain the world beneath. I do like the final twist but it doesn't need more than that. Jordan Peele has a pretty good concept but it's not as clever as he thinks it is. That's why the harder he attempts to explain, the less interesting it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Feels empty,"To be honest, I don't even feel like I was watching anything because everything seems really out of place and the characters didn't really have a backstory. Except for the main character, of course! I was hoping for some exciting things to happen but it wasn't really there. The film didn't have any climaxes, it felt really rushed and unfinished. It was not up to my expectations, if they had more time and better plot then I bet they could have lived up to it and to it's true potential. I didn't feel much like a horror movie because it wasn't really scary at all, also a bit of comedy which seems kinda out of place. Overall, it was not like 'Get Out' but it sure has many hidden meanings. But meanings that require researches on the Internet. Also it didn't make me think much about what was happening and it was a mess.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror and Comedy are proven to be two sides of the same coin,"It's weird to think the dude who made A-A-Ron and LIAM NEESONS is one of the best horror directors of this generation, next to James Wan (in my opinion). Jordan Peele is a definite film auteur who knows his stuff, and I'm excited to see his movies for years to come.
Peele creatively walks the line between horror and comedy while offering a story to chew on that's sold perfectly by the cast (From what I remember, only 10 people get on scree speaking credits this whole film). While not perfect, the movie easily warrants a second viewing alone to appreciate the numerous Chekhov's Guns placed from start to finish.
Peele has proven himself an amazing director and I couldn't be happier to see a creative like him in today's remake and sequel filled film industry.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Bold Ideas, Great Acting but the Final Product is Decidedly Mixed","The movie you think you're going to get with Us and the movie you end up getting are two different things. Normally that's a problem but I think it works
in their favour. If the movie was too formulaic or too obtuse, that would be one thing but it's clear that Jordan Peele has his own ideas and they're original enough to catch your attention. I wasn't a fan of every one of them but this movie isn't afraid to do its own thing and I have to credit Peele and his team for trying something new and being confident enough to bring it to the screen with a lot of fanfare.One of the things I was more surprised by was the amount of comedy in Us. The trailer billed it as more of a straight horror movie. This movie is actually pretty funny when they try to be, from Gabe's corny jokes to the Tyler family's selfish behaviour, I laughed more than a few times. They also have a couple of choice references in there that made me smile. However, I don't think the movie is as carefully balanced as the best horror/comedies are. There were a few times where the audience I saw this with were laughing through some of more tense moments (the ""Tethered"" largely speak in grunts and the theatre I saw this in was giggling whenever one of them had to communicate) and it came of as unintentional. Us is never particularly horrifying but it is an effective thriller. So the team were able to play in both genres effectively but the tone of the movie shifts and its not always an easy transition.The best thing about both of Jordan Peele's efforts as a writer/director is that he knows how to get great performances out of his actors. Lupita Nyong'o was excellent in her dual roles here. She's best known for her turn in 12 Years a Slave or as Maz Katana in the Disney Star Wars movies but there were moments in this where I was astonished at the job she was doing. She shines the brightest in a cast where everyone pulled their weight. Winston Duke was a lot of fun as a dorky dad, I thought he was pretty funny and he pulled off the physical work in the part. I thought the two kid actors, Shahadi Wright Joseph as Zora/Umbrae and Evan Alex as Jason/Pluto were both capable and did solid work. Elizabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker were decent as the Tylers, they're characters were jerks but they played them fairly well.Now I've got to get to what didn't work for me. I have a hard time with movies where the story turns or the creative team make decisions where they are deliberately obtuse for the sake of creating a ""metaphor"" or leaning into some ""symbolism."" People make excuses for filmmakers saying ""it doesn't have to make sense"" or ""you get what you want out of it"" but there has to be an effort to make things palatable or to try and bring the audience in (I had the same problem with the 2018 Suspiria remake). The fact that they wanted to do different things is admirable but several moments in the climax and the denouement of Us don't add up. I can't go into spoiling the movie and I do think that a movie that encourages debate is something that we need more of. I also think that no movie is ever perfect, you can always find something to nitpick or whine about. But I couldn't always just take what Us spoon fed me, there's so much to question and the film doesn't even try to answer or provide a way to the audience so they can figure it out. Maybe you'll feel differently but to just tell me to shrug it off is lazy and just an excuse (Peele has also done this better in Get Out, there's no deep explanation into the procedure but the way they presented it, I was fine that there wasn't a point by point explanation). I'd also note the final note in this movie is decidedly dark and while I liked it, I don't know if it's going to hold up to further scrutiny.I wanted Us to be something special, I liked Get Out but I also thought the praise that movie got heaped upon it was a little excessive. It was really good but to call it a ""masterpiece"" seemed a little hyperbolic. So I went into the theatre hoping that this would be that striking and bold movie that I could fall in love with to hop on the Jordan Peele train. There's a lot of big ideas in Us and I thought the acting was very impressive (especially from Nyong'o) but this movie seems to play by its own rules only when it wants to, they explain so little without providing the requisite bread crumbs to follow along and while the movie has its share of funny material and thrilling moments, I didn't think they meshed well together. Peele is an exciting new filmmaker who isn't afraid to take chances or try something different. I look forward to more movies from him but I still haven't got that can't miss, have-to-see-it film yet from him (that's only my opinion). I liked Us enough to give it a 7/10 but I can't go any higher than that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This sophomore effort from the talented director unfortunately fizzles in the end,"Jordan Peele has lately been heralded as the suspense master of our era, a claim I would have love to support after the successful 'Get Out', a smart, timely and immensely entertaining suspense thriller. Unfortunately, after viewing the highly anticipated 'Us', I'm sad to say that I have to hold off on my enthusiasm. While all the elements that Jordan Peele use to implement 'Us' are there (strong performances, good build up sequences, dark humor, etc), the weak storyline inevitably fails to hold the movie together. I really want to like this movie. I consider myself as the kind of audience that is willing to stretch my suspense of disbelief a lot more than normal, but even so, the movie loses my interest half way through and I find myself no longer rooting for it's charaters. There are moments of humor as expected from Peele which I see as his trademark and always a plus as he does know how to incorporate it well with the horror genre. But ultimately, it's hard to hold interest in a movie when the storyline is not tight, no matter how posh the production is. There are plenty of glowing reviews of this movie out there, but I suspect they are motivated by money. I still have not lose hope on Jordan Peele. He is a very talented director and has a flair for the horror genre, a genre I love. I see this as a step back for him, but let's hope he realizes he has a lot of room for growth so that he can continue to learn to make great, if not better as movies as 'Get Out'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

What More Could One Ask For In A Film?,"One of the common themes on my ""favorite movies of all time"" list is the ability of a film to be genre-diverse without being generic (or in other words, do everything it bites off well). ""Us"" is one of those rare experiences, as it expertly combines horror, drama, comedy, and social messaging with equally strong cinematography, acting, and music. In short, one more could a single film hope to provide the viewer?For a very basic overview, ""Us"" opens with young Adelaide (Madison Curry) having a traumatic experience at the Santa Cruz beach boardwalk. Flashing forward years into the future, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) and husband Gabe (Winston Duke) are vacationing in the same area with children Jason (Evan Alex) and Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph). What starts as a pretty typical middle-class family vacation quickly takes a dark turn when a family shows up in the driveway of their getaway bungalow in the middle of the night. The Wilsons quickly discover that this mystery family is a doppelgänger of their own unit--but in a dark, twisted way.No matter what setting writer/director Jordan Peele uses in ""Us"", it is a joy to behold. He is a master at not letting a single moment go to waste and very much knows how to balance intense drama with subtly-placed social messaging while also featuring some humor to break the tension when necessary. There was never a moment during my viewing where I was not engaged by either the plot or characters.Besides those landmark tenets, the atmosphere created by the acting, visuals, and music/sound creates even more immersion. Many shots in ""Us"" are iconic (girl with the red apple, doppelgänger with the scissors, etc.), and the music's swelling orchestral riffs and utilization of hip-hop's ""I Got 5 On It"" are also unique. The acting across the board is exceptional, with each of the leads portraying dual roles with uncanny precision. Talents like Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker are even used in supporting roles, if that says anything about the star power here.It is somewhat ironic that Peele would go on to helm a Twilight Zone reboot, as the plot of ""Us"" plays out like the best of Rod Serling's classic originals. Supremely entertaining in all fashions, with a revelation at the end that makes one re-contextualize the entire experience. Peele does not hammer home the social messaging here at any specific point, instead opting to seed the entire film with it and then provide the watering can in the final moments. Pure genius, from a storytelling perspective.Overall, I consider ""Us"" to be one of the most well-rounded films ever made. It engages all the senses, is extremely entertaining, and also makes one think on a deeper level than most movies of similar ilk. Cinema at its finest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well-executed Stupidity,"This movie does well a lot of the same things that Get Out did well. The characters are fleshed out and interesting, the dialogue is compelling, and the humor hits hard and at terrific moments of tension. Unfortunately, the plot of Us is really weak. It grows weaker as the movie goes and you start seeing ways that it just doesn't make any logical sense. I had a lot of ""Then, how would this work?"" moments in the latter third as the plot revealed itself. There were also some just plain silly choices with the ""scary"" aspects such as the way the main antagonist speaks (in inhales) and physical mimicry by non-speaking characters.I had the misfortune of sitting next to one of those easily frightened, jumps at everything viewers. The first twenty minutes or so, I thought I'd go mad having her next to me. But, she loosened up considerably as the movie went on and became much less scary. And that was my feeling with the movie too. There is a lot of potential for terror with random people that show up bearing scissors in the middle of the night.

Get Out!,"Like many whom saw the movie I was quite intrigued by the trailer released last December. It provided a great preview for what I thought would be a rather unique viewing experience. I went in with high expectations and was met with a poor storyline and poor character selection. Luckily, the actors and actresses in the movies, especially the lead, were able to carry the film.
I am not a movie snob. I expected a horror movie that would be a new entry to the genre. But even horror movies f9r the most part have a plot and characters upon which to build around. ""US"" felt like an experiment in the horror genre for Peele. In my opinion, he took his shot and missed.
To sum it up, please don't put this movie on a pedestal based on the success of ""Get Out"". They are two completely different movies.

Good not great,"This movie being touted as the follow up by the director of Get Out, did not do this movie any favors. Excepectations were too high. Get Out is fantastic, but I think people judge too harshly expecting follow ups to be as good or better than past work. Then proceed to judge with one stars. Just look at M. Night Shyamalan. This is in no way a 1 star movie. Not even close by horror standards. It will keep your attention. There is some fun dark humor, gleeful gore, with a twisty ending. You end of liking/empathizing with characters (a skill only good horror movies have, making an audience relate and grow close to the main characters). The complaint I will agree with is that the doppelganger voice is ridiculously annoying. Seriously. We're not all just being picky by mentioning it. I dropped a star for that stupid voice. It was over the top and grating while adding nothing to the plot. Do I understand why it was that way? Yep. Still bloody annoying. This is worth a watch by horror afficianados.

Us,"Us has a great premise to the film but executed poorly, mostly through jump scares and at times feels like a cheaply made horror film featuring some good guys fighting off bad guys. So much more could have been told about the idea, but unfortunately that is only done in the last 10 minutes or so. Even the comedy that is supposedly Peele's calling card is very weak and is very much overshadowed by the horror side of the film.

Decent horror film with great acting,"Us is a horror movie with a story plot not fully realized. It's not the kind with stupid jump scares and well-executed. But the story doesn't explain a lot of it. When they tried to do it in last 15 mins made it weird and exhausting. I think horror can be generated leaving the story in ambiguity. The twist at the end is actually revealed in the trailer which took away the surprise element. Like Get Out, the comedy come pretty naturally.
The focus of the movie is Adelaide (Lupita N'yongo) and her doppelgänger. Lupita just hits the ball out of the park as her doppelgänger feels like a different individual. Other actors were good too. Acting and music is the best part of the movie.
It might be one of those movies which can be much appreciated on second viewing after reading the subtle commentary Peele leaves under the story. It is a decent movie and original compared to all the recycled and sequels content out there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A slightly below average comical horror movie!,"I walked into the cinema with an open and neutral mind because I didn't really know what to expect from this movie.The first 15 minutes weren't the best imho.

Horror genius Jordan Peele,"This movie is amazing!
Disclaimer you should not compare this movie to get out, Just because it is from the same director. Jordan Peele knows what it takes to create an original movie. While watching the movie you can see how much he loves the horror genre himself by all the references and little easter eggs he put into the movie. This movie plays with your mind and I love that because the movie doesn't end in the theater but it makes you think about what It all means.
It can be interpreted in a lot of different ways. I feel like if you don't like this movie it's a matter of taste, but If you look at it with a critical eye this movie is simply amazing!
The comedy is also perfectly implemented into the movie and it doesn't feel forced at all
The lead actress (female protagonist) was amazing in her double role. (So is the rest of the cast)
Im looking forward what the future wil bring with this horror genius, Jordan peele!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Started out nice and then it just turned into rubbish...,"I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. But I just couldn't get into it.Whereas ""Get Out"" was mildly interesting at least, ""Us"" is just downright laughable.The movie starts out well enough with writer and director Jordan Peele actually managing to set a good atmosphere and slowly build up suspense. But the entire setup came crashing hard when you find out what is going on and the mysterious looming strangers are revealed.Now, the acting performances in the movie were good, but it was so hard to take the Red character serious with the way she was talking. It just fully destroyed everything that was even remotely interesting about the character.I enjoyed the movie up to the point where you find out about the strangers in red, then I just went blank and watched the movie with half of my attention on the screen and the other half on social media on my phone. Yeah, the movie ended up being that unappealing.I managed to endure this ordeal to the bitter end, and I can't claim to have been entertained in a memorable and satisfying manner from this movie. And this is by no means a movie that I will be watching ever again.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disappointing ending,"The film can be roughly divided into 3 parts: 1) A presentation of the protagonists. 2) A very, very, very! close encounter of the third kind with doppelgängers. 3) An explanatory conclusion. The first two parts are rather successful, but the third one turns the film into a disappointing post-GetOut entertainment.Pros: 1) The whole cast is excellent; in particular, Elisabeth Moss and Lupita Nyong'o are both amazing. 2) Sequences of dark and wacky humor ('Call the police' for instance with Kitty Tyler, the alcoholic blonde). 3) The photography and the aesthetics.Cons: although the script is innovative and 'looks' smart, did I get goose bumps ? Definitely not ! Why ? I spent my time complaining against the flaws and the plot holes; thus, the script seems unfinished and/or big-headed. The last scene is pathologically cheesy and retroactively gives to the audience a new look at the movie, with a global picture which is desperately and painfully moronic. I even almost cried of despair during the very final scene that I imagine with a French song of Sheila, L'école est finie (1963): ""Donne-moi ta main et prends la mienne. La cloche a sonné, ça signifie: la rue est à nous, que la joie vienne. Mais oui, Mais oui, l'école est finie"". Left to be pathetic, it is better to be thoroughly pathetic.As a synthesis, 5/6 of 10, because of a big-headed scripting, Jordan Peele having invented a new concept with the ""pop-corn 'n horror"" movies, i.e. turn your brain off and then, be scared.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I wanted it to be more,"Around 90 minutes in I think I still enjoyed it. After that, the story flip-flops from the campy horror it was to whatever it becomes. Either way, worth a watch and I want to love it because of Peele but could of been and wasn't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A novel approach to horror, but too much left unsolved","I like that Jordan Peele has been trying to think outside the box with his latest releases: Get Out was a decent flick, and I am excited to watch his reimagining of The Twilight Zone. Us stays true to this theme, exploring the duality of people through the Wilsons' ""evil halves"". Visually, this film is excellent, representing both 1980s and the present day strongly. Moreover, the use of colour (primarily red) and set design allows this film to smoothly work across different environments without feeling forced. Easter eggs and hidden clues are featured throughout if you look hard enough, which is an enticing proposition for the more hardcore film fan.In terms of acting, the strong cast is brilliantly headlined by Lupita Nyong'o, who is perfect as both the cautious mother and estranged doppelganger. Credit must also be given to Elizabeth Moss, who demonstrates more of her range than most fans will be accustomed to (a very different tone to The Handmaid's Tale). Nyong'o plays the only truly serious role, with most others being utilised more comedically. The score for the film allows serious tension to build in some of the scenes - ""I Got Five On It"" is the key tune, used both in lighthearted and menacing scenarios to keep a constant flow to the film. Similar techniques have been used successfully in other movies, and to great effect here as well.The only real drawback for me is the lack of clarity the viewer is left with after the credits roll. I respect that Peele spent more time on the story than on the scares - this simple but often overlooked point explains why the horror genre is oversaturated but underwhelming. However, too much is left to the spectator to decide... (without spoiling anything, rabbits?). Some may find this freedom to interpret beneficial, but I would prefer conclusion so as to make a proper judgement on the film's core principles, without being clouded by other mitigating factors.Overall, Us is a fine addition to the horror genre, breathing new life into a category cluttered with the same plots and tropes: Peele seems to do no wrong at the moment, and I will be eager to watch anything he directs in the near future.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Senselessness Is The Most Terrifying Thing,"Middle-class Winston Duke, Lupita Nyong'o, and their two children vacation at Santa Cruz with their friends. Things turn weird and scary when dopplegangers come out of the sewers and attempt to replace them.Jordan Peele's second movie as writer and director is even more terrifying than GET OUT, in large part because of the absolute senselessness of the situation. Like Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, there is no explanation offered for the situation. Borrowing as Peele does, from classics like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and zombie flicks, the ""reasons"" offered have no rhyme or reason, save absolute hatred. Miss Nyong'o is terrifying as her doppleganger, Duke is purely bourgeois, and the situation malign. I'm no fan of horror movies, but this is a great one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Tonally Inconsistant, But Entertaining Horror Pic","Everyone wants Jordan Peele's follow up to his breakthrough smash, Get Out, to be equally as brilliant. Us has some great ideas and performances, but ends up a bit shaky due to odd tonal shifts.Us lays on the mood fairly thick during its first 20/30 minutes as our heroine, Addie (a terrific Lupita Nyong'o) is plagued with what she describes as a ""black cloud"" over her family's vacation to a beach where she had a traumatic incident as a child. Fairly soon, Addie's fears prove to be well founded when a family of scissor-wielding dopplegangers break into their vacation house and terrorize them.Oddly enough, the moment the dopplegangers break in is the moment where the film's tone starts swerving in and out of the horror and dark comedy lanes. Granted, a few of the jokes do land because they feel like something a real human being would say/do in this same situation, but a lot of them feel far too goofy and this leads the film into a fairly bizarre 2nd act that feels more like a feel good/kick ass zombie-killing movie from the 80's, destroying the somber tone conjured in the film's first half hour.This isn't to say that the 2nd act of Us isn't a rollicking good time - it is, but it seems so far removed from what the film had originally been building towards. Imagine if you switched the channel midway through The Innocents and happened upon Night of the Creeps or Waxwork. They're all great movies, but their styles couldn't be further from each other and, if you tried to mix them together, you'd probably get something like this.Us wraps up with a fairly odd twist that'll probably leave you scratching your head. Perhaps if the film had been more goofy from the start and carried this tone throughout, one could laugh it off and just chalk it up to a fun, cheesy time, but it seems like Us wants us to be scared sometimes, too. It wants us to laugh at the strange, inhuman growls of its antagonists and be petrified of them at the same time and that's just not going to happen.Don't get me wrong - Us is far from the dreaded sophomore slump for Jordan Peele. He still has an eye for great shots, tongue in cheek humor, and creative storytelling, but it doesn't come together the way it should. It's still worthy of a watch, though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Brother's gonna freak you out!,"The most interesting thing about 'Us' is the fact Jordan Peele doesn't just play with the themes of humanity, American society, and ""Nature vs. Nurture"", but I feel that he also plays with the audiences' and the critics' expectations of him as a filmmaker. Peele clearly wanted to prove that he wasn't just a funnyman who got lucky with 2017's 'Get Out' and he does so by coming back to the director's chair guns blazing with his naturally-terrifying and a surprising-funny second helping of Horror; complete with a chilling score and a cast of excellent actors. At this point, Peele has proved that he could hang with the big boys with this perfect modern-day Horror classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I'm frustrated!,"Well, the movie is very exciting and unique that's why as you are watching you'll feel uncomfortable and frustrated because the ideas are not very well organized or lacking things.

Sound effects are great in movie Theaters, actors weren't that good, and I didn't think they're acting for a horror movie as some scenes are so stupidly directed for such a good movie, expect all of that, Lupita preformance was extremely good. I'd give this 6.9/10 just because the beginning and the end of it, plus Lupita performance.

"Great concept, great execution, so many questions","Peele's sophomore release has a lot to say. Although significantly unique in style, which will likely provide an entertaining and captivating viewing experience to most audiences, many are bound to leave disappointed. Us is far from a traditional horror film, and is an attempt to make a statement on individuals' role within themselves, society, and the United States (Us). This concept is intriguing, and the statements the film make are sure to keep individuals contemplating it far after it's over. In this regard, the film is successful, containing many interesting concepts, metaphors, and possible interpretations.However, with Peele's attempt to represent so much comes the difficulty of putting it all together. Us is filled with plot holes and irrational moments that almost seemed to be caused due to laziness during scriptwriting. To worsen the matter, rather than providing a logical and simple ending, Us keeps piling more and more new information on until it reaches its abrupt ending. It almost feels as if Peele was on the verge of a masterpiece, but decided to send the rough draft of the script into production without proofreading or making logical changes. Due to this the flow, roundedness, and perfection that Us could have had is unfortunately absent.7/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Still don't know what I got five on it means,"I really enjoyed this movie. The cast was great playing double roles. The pacing was great. The score of this movie was amazing and it fits perfectly in the scenes, especially when Adelaide and Red (Lupita's characters) face off against each other for the final time. The movie was a great mixture of horror and comedy. I didn't think I was going to be scared but some moments were very frightening. The cast was amazing and the story lingers in your mind long after you leave out of the theater. It was hours after viewing the movie did certain moments finally click with me. This is one of those movies that the more you view it, the more you find something different. The only thing some people may be a tad bit of a complaint about is the ending. Some like it ambiguous. Others liked it as is. At first, I was the former and thought the final twist was an unnecessary add on which told away from the movie. But later on, the final twist made moments from earlier on in the movie finally click with me. It's still a great movie, but it would have been stronger with an ambiguous ending that we'll be talking about for decades later like American Psycho or The Prestige. It's a refreshing horror movie to us horror movie fanatics who have grown tired of the myriads of mediocre movies in the dying genre which needs fresh blood every once in a while. US is that fresh blood. Finally, don't go in comparing this movie to Get Out. That's equivalent to comparing Prince to Michael Jackson, The Truman Show to Dumb and Dumber, Unbreakable to The Sixth Sense. If you're going to judge this movie, then judge it on it's own merit.

As far as the rest is concerned, I didn't like the contrived acting, the ridiculous, far-fetched plot, and, worst of all, I didn't find the movie scary for a single moment. I think the problem with ""Us"" is that Jordan Peele is trying way too hard to come up with something original that will set him apart and justify his growing popularity within the horror genre. The overall result is just a weird, confusing mess that makes no sense whatsoever no matter how much you try to spin it. An example? The lady's double who speaks in the guttural voice is supposed to be scary and disturbing, but in reality she just sounds like she has a bad sore throat and ends up being annoying.

Us and...,"...Them. The rich and the poor. The wealhy and the impoverished. The ones and the others. The people and the puppets. The living and their shadows.Us is the second movie directed by the highly-respected Jordan Peele, who made ""Get Out"" 2 years ago. This horror film manages to do so many things in its limited runtime. It succeeds at being a fun, scary an entertaining ride without losing its social and political themes.The film talks about disciminations and class diferences in a fresh and exciting way and proves that such social problems are still present. We have our luxurious houses, our well-cooked meals, our comfortable lifestyles and because of our easiness we tend to forget about ""Them"", the ones who suffer, who are in pain or the ones who help and try but never get a reward. ""Us"" is parltly about all these intriguing themes, but never forgets that it is also a film and a dark and fun experirience and not just a politically driven story.Its nicely shot, some of the shots actually ahve hidden meanings and clues or the development of the story. The acting is spot on, with Lupita playing 2 really demanding roles giving her most shocking performance yet. The soundtrack is great and some of the songs are used a contrast to the events of the film and make for a good laugh. The movie has its humor too, but sometimes I felt that it was too much with it.The script is really one of a kind. It might not be 100% original, but it is presented in such a way that the point it tries to make are clear while being such a good cinematic experience. It is of a bigger scale and has a lot of plot points that are clever.Now, the bads. Firstly, like most films of its genre, it has a banch of forced moments and some characters take really stupid decisions. Sometimes, during the 2nd act, it loses its weight as a story and has a lot of ups and downs in its tone. One joke comes after the other and I kind of forgot that I was watching a horror film. And the twist in the end is sooooooooooooooooo predictable and I'm still not sure if it is really important. They could have just go for something more ambiguous or give a hint or something.But, overall that's a good horror-social commentary-comedy! Jordan Peele makes his own kind of movies and tries to explore and talk about global and ""US "" issues in startling, new ways.

I did know this was Jordan Peele's follow-up to the great Get Out, *may be* horror and I saw one movie still. I avoided everything else and SOOO GLAD I DID. Incidentally, I did the same to Hereditary, and both that movie and this were two fantastic horror-movie going experiences.So, I would suggest doing the same here. Go in cold and I am refraining from giving a synopsis like I normally do. This movie is SUPER hard to describe without giving too much away, anyway.I will say this: this movie is fantastic.

I freaking cannot believe how great Get Out was and as I think more about Us, I do believe this is actually better.Once again, he writes an amazing and absolutely original script - even when he takes from so many horror subgenres. While I was watching this, I was writing my review in my head and kept comparing this movie to (this) movie and then I thought: Oh! It's also like (that) movie. Once again, to tell you which movies I saw within this one would be a spoiler.I know I'm being vague here and you don't know me from Adam (but, I hope you do, by now.) This film is for both film and horror lovers. It's a wonderful throwback WITHOUT that forced nostalgia Hollywood has been cramming down our throats. And *that* is another praise for Peele.So, buckle up, go and see Us. Also see Get Out if you haven't already and be prepared to pre-purchase a ticket to Peele's next feature as this guy's got an incredible future ahead of him.***Final thoughts: Warning: Do NOT drink beer before or during.

It's OK,"This movie thinks it is the bomb. It thinks it's outright clever. It thinks itself a heart wrenching satire, or social commentary, disguised as a modern horror film.Only problem is that it's really none of those things. Because it fails to know what it is, and because it tries to be too many things, Us! Ends up short of being a movie about anything. And it excels in no department, really.To give you the gist; Us! Is a little bit of Funny Games, a spoonful of The Devil's Backbone, a pinch of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and a more than generous amount of social commentary.I don't know what else to say.Meh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Horror movie with some strange twists,"I would like to first state that the horror movie Us, is a lot better than the Candyman remake. This movie is focused on telling a scary story. This movie is very entertaining, but there are some problems with it. Firstly, some of the Tethered people who can't talk and only moan sound like dinosaurs and creatures. This makes some of the movie laughable, and some viewers will be scratching their heads. The second one is some of the twists, one twist was scary and shocking, but the other twists didn't make much sense. Jordan Peele did and awesome job with he special effects, makeup and costuming. The cinematography reminded me of the 2008 movie, The Strangers. This movie is well paced, and has a purpose as a horror movie. But this is one of the movies where you like it or don't like it. I was able to get passed some of the movies flaws, and was able to enjoy it for what it is. It's well made, but it can't compete with other horror movies out there. But as horror movie it will entertain the vast majority of viewers. I give this movie a 7 & 1/2. I can't give it a full 8, because even though the directing and scripting is done well, the movie has flaws that some viewers won't be able to get past. Jordan Peele is a great filmmaker, and I do recommend that he does more horror movies. The more horror movies Jordan Peele does the more he will improve on the horror filmmaking craft.There are a lot of brutal killings and scary scenes that will probably give people who don't like horror movies nightmares for a few weeks or 2 months.Bailey Giannini - movie buff and horror fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Jordan Peele is a filmmaking force.,"Riding on the wave of success Get Out has provided him with since 2017, Jordan Peele returns with Us, a psychological horror that promises to get under your skin even more than his debut effort managed to. Peele showed innovation aplenty with Get Out, the social commentary apparent in the film providing it with much more to say than it seems, a trend that could make its way into Us as well.When Adelaide and Gabe Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke) take their family on a break to the beach, they are faced with a fight for survival when a group of doppelgängers begins to terrorise them.Watching Jordan Peele's Us comes with the pleasure of trying to work out what is happening and why, much was the case with Get Out too. The film is packed with symbolism and foreshadowing that further viewings will only become more rewarding, not that this initial experience wasn't in any shape or form. This is another twisted treat from Peele, the tropes of horror executed brilliantly with the perfect amount of humour littered throughout, meaning you should probably try and see this with as big an audience as possible.Coming to the performances, the beating heart of Us is an utterly spellbinding Lupita Nyong'o in a dual role that showcases what huge talent she possesses. As Adelaide she encompasses the dread and fear of someone haunted by a childhood experience that leads to her crossing paths with Red, her doppelgänger, who she portrays in such an effectively creepy manner. Winston Duke is great as her husband, getting the majority of the comedic moments and making them really work amongst the sheer terror the family are facing. Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex are both pretty good too as the younger members of the Wilson family, as well as excelling as their doppelgängers too.Peele manages to hold the audience in the palm of his hand, from the masterful opening to the closing sequence when revelations have been made, and he uses music so well in his film, Michael Abels' score aiding the tense moments to great effect.While I think Get Out is a better film, Jordan Peele does enough with Us, his sophomore effort, to show everyone that he is a filmmaking force to be reckoned with. Whatever he does next, whether it still be in the horror genre or not, I'll be there for it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Complete Nonsensical Garbage,"This movie is miles and miles away from Jordan Peele's directorial debut - 'Get Out', in every aspect. So much so that one can question if it is actually the same person who wrote both.The story is so juvenile and over-stretched to the point that it just becomes tiresome and annoying to watch. It overflows with illogical chasms - not gaps, but chasms from the beginning to that laughable idiotic end which erases whatever was trying to be build up in the last 2 hours.Where one could clearly discern humor and horror in 'Get Out', it is not the case here. This movie comes across a failed attempt to mimic the magic Peele had achieved before. It tries to put on the comedy and horror hats but neither fit. The music although good barely matches what's going on the screen. The audience isn't really provided with any answers to what's the reason behind what's going on until the end, and man, it's really bad.The whole storyline is just a half-baked idea which seem rushed, or as if from the imagination of a 10 year old.The one star is only and ONLY for Lupita Nyong'o's effort.Save yourselves from wasting two hours of your life. The critics praising this are just as absurd, do not believe them either.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Peele excels with a perfectly crafted dark tale of identity,"As a fan of Jordan Peele's comedy work before Get Out made him into a household name as a director, I was very excited see him continue to explore social politics through horror in Us (2019). And Us (2019) is so much more complex and energetic then his last movie that only came out two years ago, that I had to watch this movie two times before giving my complete thoughts.On the surface Us (2019) paints a very straightforward survival horror premise of a family called the Wilsons forced to fight against homicidal versions of themselves called the Tethered. But Peele doesn't rely on the gimmick of the killer or monster being our copies to hold it together. He merely uses it as an opportunity to go deeper into very questionable and existential ideas about human identity.A large part of what holds Us together is Lupita Nyong'o dual performances as Adelaide and Red. When we first meet Adelaide she is this paranoid mother worried about her family's safety and is driven to extreme lengths to keep them safe from her Tether copy Red. And with Nyongo playing Red as well, she makes every single uncanny bodily movement and every word from her rasping voice to feel both terrifying the as film's villain but also evoke the harsh reality she comes from. But as the story evolves, Nyong'o brings more dimensions to both her characters that go beyond the final girl and slasher villain in a horror film. Adelaide becomes more assertive and aggressive in her actions and we then see the tragedy that Red has been carrying for decades that acts as fuel for her violent revolution. It's a difficult challenge for someone to bring this much depth to two characters in one movie but Nyongo's deserves as many awards as possible for achieving it.Now that Peele's gets to play with a larger scope, we see that he gets to have more fun within horror and comedy. While Get Out was a slow burn to the horror's reveal, Us immediately sets it in motion within the first 30 minutes. The sequence of the Tether breaking into the Wilson's home is probably one of the scariest sequences I have seen in recent years. From there the movie never slows down to make you feel like the Wilsons are safe from this threat. But the horror never becomes overwhelming thanks to Peele's expertise in comedy to be used in the right moments. A lot of it comes from how well the humour is written within the characters themselves from Winston Duke's surprisingly hysterical portrayal of an ignorant nerdy dad and husband to the son played in a breakout performance by Alex Jones unintentionally being self-aware of the crazy situation they are in.While Get Out made it very clear from the start it was about racism, Us plays it more subtly with its social messaging. Using the creepy imaginary of mirroring and contrasting visuals and sequences of repetition (just like last year's The Favourite it make flocks of rabbits evoke dread), it not only foreshadows the darkness that is to come but also reinforce the themes of dual identities. And examining closely through certain lines of dialogue and scenes, Peele is very much making a commentary on America's economy and class-system. Through the Wilson's middle-class perspective of what to them seems like twisted versions of themselves invading their home, Us reveals the misguided views society has on those that lack the upper-class's benefits and awards. And when the Wilsons are forced to breakaway from their carefree identities in order live; it only proves they can be just as savage as their own Tethers.
Particularly reflecting on the refuge crisis happening today during the Trump administration, Adelaide and Red's conflict becomes less about the duality between good and evil and more about whom deserves the better life and what is it worth to gain and keep that life.Easily the best movie this year so far and is defiantly made be to watched more then once.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Incredible horror,"Us is a bigger, bolder, and weirder follow up for Jordan Peele that allows him to escape the shadow of Get Out as soon as possible. Its internal logic may not hold up to scrutiny but it offers plenty of deeper meaning and grand themes that are designed to be talked about long after its conclusion and they're undoubtedly enhanced by repeat viewings. Plus there's a neat twist at the end that's not weakened if it's guessed ahead of time.Most of the cast is on double duty as they play their characters and the really unsettling tethered versions of them. Lupita Nyong'o is incredible as a horror protagonist who is satisfyingly smart and capable which is contrasted by her tethered performance where everything from her movement to the way she speaks is meticulous. Winston Duke has never been more loveable as he brings an endearing quality to the worst dad jokes.As writer & director, Jordan Peele creates something original whilst still filling it with plenty of homages. The humour is so well placed as it always has the desired effect without undercutting the bountiful scares and once it reaches its climax, Peele and cinematographer Mike Gioulakis are just showing off. His use of music has only gotten better thanks to some all time great uses of Fuck tha Police, Good Vibrations and I Got 5 On It.The score by Michael Abels is superb, continuing a wonderful creative partnership with Jordan Peele. From the moment the opening credits start it's firing on all cylinders by setting the atmosphere beautifully and making everything feel suitably uncanny and creepy in equal measure. It doesn't sound like the usual score that accompanies a horror film, making it all the more effective and distinct whenever it's employed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Just okay,Was expecting much more. Get Out was a lot better. This was ehhh....I mean I will say it wasnt terrible but it definitely wasnt good. It was a great concept but poorly done . Could've been a lot better,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Major Disappointment,".To start with, I thought that Peele's previous film Get Out was okay, something not necessarily warrant of a high score, but it was a fun watch. With Us...it was..okay. I feel that this is another example of hype killing a film. For the most part, I liked the performances of Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o. The kid actors were also pretty good, not annoying as most cases are with child actors. The Tylers' actors were fine. The double performances that the actors had to do when getting into their Tethered role was impressive.As for anything else...I'll just admit it, the writing was not good for this movie. While I appreciate that it wasn't going to be about race as Get Out was, there is always a meaning to a film even if it's unintentional. The problem here is that Peele was juggling too many plot ideas. I mean you have the numerous allusions to Jeremiah 11:11, the rabbits, the fact that the Tethered lived in tunnels that were abandoned. The Tethered is an interesting concept on paper, but the issue is Peele seemed to not know what he exactly wanted when making these creatures. I've heard theories that they could represent second-class citizens who were wronged by society among other alternate interpretations, but the Tethered's nature is hard to process. There is an explanation given to the doppelgangers' existence, but the problem is it borders on the realm of absurdity. Get Out had its out there premise of brain transplantation but it was still in a relatively realistic setting. Us on the other hand goes so far pass the point of believability, it takes me out of just accepting what the film is.Another issue I had was the comedy. While Get Out had comedic moments, they never eclipsed the horror. With Us, there are several moments that are meant to be scary, but they are undermined by comedy. Winston Duke's character for instance doesn't work so much for me. He is supposed to be that stereotypical hip dad that embarrasses the kids, but with Gabe, I felt that he was more annoying to an extent.Lastly..the twist. I won't give away what it was at first, but when it happened, it irritated me. While it doesn't ruin the movie, it is utterly predictable. From just the first trailer I saw the twist coming from a mile away and I hoped that Peele would wisely opt out of it. But we got it, and it is forever instilled in the audience's collective brains.It's not a bad film. On the contrary, it is entertaining. The soundtrack is good. However, I feel that the writing has too many holes in it, which is a shame because Peele received an Oscar for his screenplay of his directorial review. The Tethered could've been interesting and probably gone up there with the likes of Skarsgard's Pennywise or the Babadook. Instead, it is a major disappointment. This film should not be compared to Get Out as it is its own thing, so when you decide to watch it, try to keep the lingering comparing it to Get Out film at bay.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

All over the place,"This is a movie of two halves. The first half is a pretty decent suspense thriller, in a confined environment, where you don't really know what's going on and then, just when you think it's ending, there's a whole other half in a different setting that's significantly less good where they make the fatal mistake of trying to actually explain the highly unlikely goings on.As a result it feels like the film has about 6 acts instead of the usual 3, and by the time it ends you don't really care anymore as instead of being a tightly plotted thrill ride, the writers continue to throw all sorts of ideas at you in the hope that some of them will work, each less well thought out than the last.If they stuck to just the initial setting and maintained some mystery it could have been awesome, but as it is it just goes on too long and loses focus at around the half way point.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Jordan Peele transcends horror to new heights and tests the audience,"This film is what a lot of horror movies are missing today. The deep messages in this film. Each single shot of each single frame by Jordan Peele symbolizes everything. The film is very in depth and it's a conceptual horror film. It's what scares me the most. Jump scares and tension isn't enough and that's almost what every single predictable horror film does. This film captures the uncomfortable feeling of not knowing what to expect while adding layers upon layers in the process. The fact the movie doesn't have a predictable bland jump scare fest that moviesgo for us amazing. This film is honestly comparison to the shinning. So many details layers upon layers spreaded around. The real horror is us, as people. Can you trust that you can count on us? I left the theater thinking about it so much. So many horror elements that crept me out. This is the type of film that will be looked back at years and years to come by now. Jordan Peele trancends horror yet again. Hands down the greatest movie of 2019 so far. Lead actress deserves an Oscar. Not to mention the whole casts acting was insane. Screenplay was amazing. Sound crept under my skin and made me terrified of my favorite rap songs. I will not be listening to them the same way as before. The script is amazing. The plot twist. This movie has it all and more. It can be too much for people and it can be confusing. And that's fine. Because with Jordan Peele ever since Get Out... not everything is everyone's cup of tea (pun intended) but in all honesty, US Is a film that leaps boundaries and Isn't afraid to embrace the tricks up its sleeve and Jordan Peele proves it. I honestly believe this film is a masterpiece and Jordan Peele pulls it off yet again. I'm over 20 years old and I left the film terrified. The conseptual horror is always more terrifying than almost any other horror movie that Hollywood tries to give us. It's like audiences don't want to be challenged. They want a predictable story some jump scares and a happy ending and they'll give it a good review. This film was completely off the wall and challenges the viewer with so much. 10/10 and that's my honest opinion. This movie has so much rewatch value. Just like the shining had. I will be watching this film in years to come. Movies like this holds up compared to other horror movies because you can't run away from the conseptual horror. But other films you can. Once you timed the jump scare and know the plot and figure it out the rewatch value is 0/10. US on the other hand has so much rewatch value. If I watch it again I'd probably end up with much more questions than answers and that's even more terrifying. So much conversation and things going on.

US is the reason why I love Horror movies,"A true horror movie is one that grasps concepts and ideas like the recent Hereditary or Babadook and provoke thought well after the film like Get Out or even Martyrs (the original).US is a masterclass of cinema. It's very well shot, well acted, well written and it's thought provoking. The idea of dopplegangers didn't really appeal to me but after the initial meeting of the characters, it really worked well. The audience was fully engaged and the movie worked on an entertainment level. It was pretty fun.After watching the film, I spent the next hour with friends discussing ""what was Us"" really about as it isn't as obvious as Get Out. Is it about xenophobia, America, identity, government conspiracies etc....?Not a mainstream horror film, which I can see why there are low ratings as the majority want to see something a bit more obvious in terms of the underlining message.

An effective socio-political thriller looking at issues of class and privilege,"There's a detail to be found in writer/directorJordan Peele's second feature, Us, which gives you a good idea of the amount of thought that has gone into the film. In the opening scene, set in 1986, a young girl walks into a hall of mirrors, with a sign outside proclaiming ""Find yourself"", and a picture of a Native American above the door, with the words ""Shaman Vision Quest"". Later in the film, now in the present day, the same hall of mirrors is seen, the same ""Find yourself"" is seen, but now the picture of the Native American has been replaced with a wizard, and ""Shaman Vision Quest"" with ""Merlin's Enchanted Forest."" This change, easily dismissed as representative of everything that's wrong with PC culture, is actually much more telling. It represents a meaningless and superficial attempt to tackle society's discomfort with its violent history. It's like putting a plaster on a severed limb; ""sure, the white man slaughtered the Native Americans, but if we do things like change signs on amusement parks, everything should be forgiven, right?"" This, in turn, speaks directly to one of the film's most salient themes - the US (or us) is a country built on violence, racism, and oppression, but as long as such things are swept under the carpet and no one talks about them, then there's no need to worry. Peele very much wants people to start talking about them.I wasn't the biggest fan of Peele's previous film,Get Out (2017), although I certainly admired how he reformulated the tropes of the genre so as to suggest that just because the US gives the appearance of being a pseudo-post-racial society, it doesn't necessarily mean that that's true behind closed doors. With Us, he is working in a similarly metaphorical mode, using the tropes of the home invasion thriller to probe issues of class and, especially, privilege. The plot is an allegory for a nation divided into those above and those below, the haves and the have-nots, those with opportunity and those without. Essentially, Peele suggests that when social/economic/political inequality is so pronounced for so long, sooner or later, the only recourse available to the have-nots is to make a grand statement, a statement that will almost certainly not be peaceful.The film opens on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in 1986 with young Adelaide Thomas (Madison Curry) seeing something in a hall of mirrors that deeply traumatises her, resulting in her not talking for several years. The film then cuts to the present day as the now adult Adelaide Wilson (an astoundingLupita Nyong'o) travels to Santa Cruz with her family - husband Gabe (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex). The family is comfortably middle-class, although much to Gabe's irritation, they are nowhere near as wealthy as their neighbours, the Tylers - Kitty (Elisabeth Moss), Josh (Tim Heidecker), and twin daughters Becca and Lyndsey (Cali SheldonandNoelle Sheldon). Uneasy at being so close to the scene of her childhood trauma, Adelaide becomes convinced that something terrible is going to happen, and that night, when the power cuts out, Jason reveals that there are four people standing ominously in the driveway.It's not a spoiler, of course, to say that the people in the driveway are the Wilsons' doppelgängers. However, one of the problems with parsing the film is that so many of the socio-political themes are tied to who the doppelgängers are and what they want, that it's difficult to discuss them without spoilers. So, small spoiler ahead - the doppelgängers are called the Tethered; essentially, they are an underground-dwelling race of lookalikes, spiritually tied to those living above. Although partly inspired by the 1960 ""Mirror Image (1960)"" episode of The Twilight Zone, the main influences for the Tethers appear to be urban legends surrounding ""mole people"" and, more specifically, the conflict between the Morlocks and the Eloi inH.G. Wells's The Time Machine (1895).Setting out to probe both economic and societal divisions in the contemporary US, Peele introduces the theme early on with Gabe's jealousy at the Tylers' nicer house, fancier car, and much bigger boat. Later, after the arrival of the Tethered, the theme becomes more explicit; through no fault of their own, they live in an underground realm, deprived of the opportunities those above the surface have access to. The allegorical dimension couldn't be clearer; the film is essentially a parable about class division. The Wilsons represent a middle-class all-American family; the Tethered represent the underclass, those without access to the privileges enjoyed by the wealthy, despite possessing the same capacity for happiness and success. This similarity is driven home when Adelaide asks Red (her Tethered) who they are, and Red seems confused by the question, answering (truthfully), ""we're Americans.""In this sense, the film is very much about marginalisation. Adelaide is not smarter or more capable than Red; rather, the main difference between the two is just that of the difference between a poor person and a rich one; fate of birth. This speaks to perhaps the film's most important point - the marginalised, destitute, and discriminated against can succeed just as much as everyone else if only they're given the opportunity to do so. This is also alluded to in the powerful final shot, which reveals that the Tethered have accomplished something which the surface dwellers once attempted but failed.The Tethered are the ignored, those swept under the rug of society, out of sight out of mind, just like the alteration to the picture above the hall of mirrors, with Peele allegorically examining what could happen when the marginalised and ignored can be marginalised and ignored no longer, whether they be the economically impoverished, the racially suppressed, vets suffering from PTSD, non-Americans xenophobically regarded as the Other, really any group of people that society at large has shunned. True, the deeper he explores the Tethered, the more insurmountable logistical problems that are thrown up, and the further he strains credibility. However, it's a testament to both his filmmaking acumen and the strength of his thematic concerns, that such straining is not as detrimental as it may sound.Even more so than Get Out, Us is exceptionally accomplished from an aesthetic point of view. The opening scene, for example, features extraordinarily impressive photography byMike Gioulakis, designed to place us as close to young Adelaide's consciousness as possible. As she wanders along behind her parents, the camera sticks primarily to her height, with everything towering above her, whilst the candied apple she holds is hypnotically red and shiny (one could say Edenic). Another fine scene features the rare use of a split diopter, a tool favoured byBrian De Palmathat allows both foreground and background subjects to stay in focus simultaneously. Using it in a crucial scene towards the end of the film, it is the only time we see Adelaide and Red's faces in the same shot at the same time, with Red shot in BCU, facing away from Adelaide, who stands behind her.In terms of acting, Nyong'o's nuanced work as Adelaide and Red is especially noteworthy as a study in contrasts. Apart from their appearance, nothing about the two is similar; their posture, their facial expressions, how they talk, how they walk, how they react to things around them, how they use their hands. Adelaide, a former ballet dancer, is graceful and elegant, whereas Red is automaton-like, her movements almost staccato and splintered into sudden bursts. It's a clinic on how to convey individualised psychology through body language, and at times, it's hard to believe it's the same actress playing both roles.In terms of problems, there are a few. Aside from the insurmountable practical issues with the Tethered, my biggest issue was that every time the Tethered want to kill someone, they do so immediately, without ceremony or pause. However, they pass up multiple opportunities to kill the Wilsons. At first, this seems as if it's because they wish to keep them alive for some reason, but later in the film, we find out that really, they just want to kill them. Never once do they attempt to do so with the ruthless efficiency with which they kill others, which is an irritating inconsistency. Additionally, the final twist, of which I will say nothing, doesn't really work, feeling like something of a twist for twist's sake that was never fully integrated into the narrative.These small problems notwithstanding, Us is an impressive film that improves on Get Out in almost every way, and which serves as a more complete artistic statement. The Tethers are monsters because they have been left with little choice other than to become monsters, imprisoned by a system they had no part in creating and in which they are not allowed to participate. Both visually accomplished and thematically complex, Us once again finds Peele examining the kind of social oppression that no one wants to acknowledge, but this time he widens his scope to move beyond issues of race. In Get Out, he took a story of bodily possession and moulded it into a story of black/white relations. In Us, he demonstrates that oppression can easily cross racial boundaries. And the real horror of this isn't to be found in monsters or jump scares. It's to be found in humanity's frequent inhumanity to one another.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Curious movie, filmed in Santa Cruz.","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. Not my wife's type of movie.This movie had generated a reasonable amount of hype, plus it has Lupita Nyong'o in it, so I was anxious to see it. I found it very well made with many interesting visuals, but with one difficulty.When a writer/director makes a movie with lots of symbolism he or she sees very clearly what they want to convey. However each viewer comes away with different degrees of comprehension of what his/her intent was. I read a number of ""professional"" reviews and most of them have praise for ""Us"" but each with different takeaways.I'm not sure what points the movie was trying to make, something about our shadows always getting the short end of the stick. Something about thousands of miles of tunnels in the USA. Then the twist at the end, when we find out what really happened to the young girl in the hall of mirrors in 1986.So, while I mostly found it an entertaining viewing I don't come away with some new revelation about people and their lives. I mostly enjoyed seeing scenes of Santa Cruz where we vacationed just a few years ago, walking the same streets where the car fire scene was shot near the end of the movie, plus the beach and the pier.I think many viewers, who are not professional movie critics, will not enjoy seeing this movie because the themes and messages are mostly obscure.Edit: First I want to say no movie should require ""extras"" on a disc to explain the movie. But I DID watch some of the extras on the BD afterward and in particular the filmmaker talking about what motivated him to come up with this particular story, and that is interesting. Part of it is we think as if we somehow earned being in an affluent position, as the featured family was, when in fact it was just luck of being born where we were. And the idea that meeting your doppelganger can be scary. But he also admits that it is just a popcorn flick, not to be taken too seriously.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A film with dodgy voices.,"What a great film ""Get Out"" was. Jordan Peele's classic which unpeeled (sic) race relations in a wholly novel and horrifying way. Yes, the story was a bit 'out there' and unbelievable, but he pulled it off with great chutzpah.With his follow-up film - ""Us"".... sorry but, for me, it just didn't work.It all starts so promisingly. Young Adelaide Wilson (a fine debut performance by Madison Curry) is on a seaside holiday with her mother and careless father when she wanders onto the deserted Santa Cruz beach at night. There sits, like some gothic horror ghost train, the Hall of Mirrors. ""Find Yourself"" it taunts. She makes the mistake of entering and changes her life forever.Spin forwards 30 years and Adelaide, now a married mother of two, is back in Santa Cruz with a terrifying feeling that things are about to go pear-shaped. And of course they do!Why oh why oh why those voices? This film had me gripped until a particular point. Having people stand still and silent at the end of your drive is an incredibly spooky thing to show. But then, for me, the wheels came off big time. The ""reveal"" of who these people were I could take. But the manner of their behaviour and - particularly - how they talked was horrifying; and not in a good way. When ""Red"" started speaking I couldn't believe my ears: Joe Pasquale after swallowing Donald Duck.From there, the film became farcical for me, descending in progressive stages to a tunnel-based apocalypse: a plot element that was just so paper thin it bore no scrutiny at all.This was, no doubt, an attempt at a satirical dig at the class structure of America (""We are Americans"" adding a double meaning to the name of the film). If it had been played as a deliberate comedy farce it might have worked. But otherwise no.This is not to say that there are not positives in the film. The excellent Lupita Nyong'o gives the whacky material her all, and the other adult female lead - Elisabeth Moss (from TV's ""The Handmaid's Tale"") - is good value as Kitty Tyler: a diabolical incarnation in either form!Peele also delivers flashes of directorial brilliance. The ""hands across America"", disappearing into the sea, is a sight that stays with you. I also liked the twist at the end, although in retrospect it's difficult to relate it to the rest of the story and strikes of desperation in the storytelling.I know there are some who really like this movie. Each to their own, but I was not one of them. After ""Get Out"" I was hoping for something much better. I hope that was just Jordan Peele's ""difficult second album"".(For the full graphical review, please go to ""One Mann's Movies"" on t'internet or Facebook. Thanks.)",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
FUN.,"If you go in to this expecting it to make sense like some spoon-fed equation of plot then you're setting yourself up for disappointment. But if you want to have fun riding on a fresh genre-bending thriller with some wacky twists and unashamed quirk then you may find it to surprise you. I went in as blind as possible, with low expectations to simply be entertained and it delivered for that to me. First of all the cast is EXCELLENT. Fresh terror on their faces. Beautiful acting. By every single one of them. Even the younger cast was impressive with some thrilling scenes. And next that music score. Dense, fresh, fun, chilling. Wacky. The cinematography and pacing/unfolding of events was edge of your seat anticipation. I forgot I was watching a movie, it did what it was supposed to. The experience was more than sub-par for me.

Some of it was over the top silly and far-fetched. But I do not expect to go in to a Jordan Peele film and not get that wacky unreality feeling. I have come to understand his style with it's low-key fantasy and scifi motifs and elements that are never fully explained.

The characters were great as well, however, I did find it somewhat irritating that the comedic relief via character dialogue seemed to be a bit in excess.

But all the tension built up in the beginning quickly fizzled out. The concept was great, but didn't feel fully realized and was full of plot holes no matter how you interpret the movie. If this movie had remained a metaphor, instead of clumsily trying to explain where the shadows came from and what their plan was, it would've been a much better film. Initially i left the theater feeling disappointed. All the symbolism and metaphors don't feel well thought-out and lack any true meaning. I expected better from Peele but there is still some room for intelligent discussion after the movie ends.

A step back from 'Get Out',"Jordan Peele's work is immersive. A few minutes into watching his movies everybody sitting in your vicinity seems to disappear and all that remains is you and the gripping story unfolding on screen. He achieves this effect by allowing his films to breathe. Sometimes the camera lingers on scenery. Sometimes it lingers on a person. Either way, it demonstrates a patience in filmmaking that is rare for a first or second-time director, meaning that Peele undoubtedly honed this skill throughout the 53-episode run of his comedy show and was able to successfully apply it to horror.This duality-comedy and horror-is perhaps the most striking (and successful) component of Peele's new film 'Us,' the follow-up to his Oscar winning debut 'Get Out.' There are just as many laughs littered throughout the film as there are moments of shock and tension.Yet there's a hollowness to 'Us,' as though the burdens of being one of the most prolific creators currently working in Hollywood stunted the overall development of the film. Peele likely took years to write 'Get Out' and the astounding density of the story shows. Peele had perhaps half as much time to write 'Us'-while being twice as busy-and the product speaks for itself.For example, there's an interesting red-blue dynamic applied to the costume and set design, but its intended meaning doesn't always feel consistently applied. Furthermore, one of the on-screen deaths is needlessly unrealistic, while a particular shot setup towards the end of the film tries to be artistic but just doesn't work ... at all.As a result, it begs the question of whether 'Us' is disappointing compared to 'Get Out,' or if it's disappointing entirely on its own.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The conflicted territory of class, race and privilege is convoluted with too many ideas and not enough answers e.g. why the rabbits?Nevertheless, an interesting film, not as enjoyable as it should've been. I wouldn't see it again. Only a 6/10 from me.Please bring back Key & Peele - the best writing, directing and comedy series that puts SNL to shame",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The strangest thing about Jordan Peele finding his voice,"There's nothing more cringey to me in film when a Director over-explains everything in interviews or behind-the-scenes. Sure there are complicated, or layered or esoteric films to which I would love to know the answers, or what was in the Director's head, however knowing it is like a spoiler; I want to know, but I never ACTUALLY want to know, I want to be surprised, I want to come to it on my own.Jordan Peele, by doing this, doesn't put the elements he likes about his film, in the actual film. By having to explain it means that he hasn't worked well enough or hard enough to fold the themes and ideas into the film sufficiently. If I can't read some theories or speak to some friends and come up with the answers ourselves (a sort of unique and magical thing) and instead I find that the Director has to tell me, then the film isn't as good or as clever as it is dying to be.That's my most painful comment on the film; Jorden Peele, you don't tell me what i'm supposed to see in your material - thats not how films work - the material should have all the components for discovery in there.Aside from that, it's got an absolute orgy of half-baked but tremendous ideas, scenes, dialogue, character moments and horror homages. As a home invasion and doppelganger genre flick it succeeds spectacularly, unfortunately as a message-movie, or a science-fiction, it fails mostly. Despite the race and identity politics and the smatterings of post-Trump themes; the most interesting elements of the story are untouched here; it's clearly the experiment that the government did, all that stuff we didn't see; how the clones are born, the horror of it, the discovery of a soul and how it affects those without, the people who feed them and make them, the corporate and government conspiracy elements of it, which could have been a scathing commentary of now, how the tethers work etc etc. All of that is the most interesting material.Us also has a million stupid ruinous plotholes - even if you can put most of them away to enjoy the true wit and verve and confidence of the picture, and the cleverness of how it uses its cost-effective budget, the plotholes are so supermassive, they derail the flow at every opportunity. i won't even detail them here because they're all so blatant and numerous.So I appreciate this film, I appreciate Peele's gonzo Black Mirror but bonkers vibe, I appreciate what he's trying to do. It's no Get Out, but it's a well shot flick with a genuinely tremendous performance by Lupita Nyong'o, it's oscar-worthy, it's deeply scary, it's clever and dedicated.Us has got an Alexa gag that works, a Shaun of The Dead-worthy conversation about kills in the car, and a scene involving a remix of I Got 5 On It that's an elegant and beautiful and memorable and ballsy scene, one of the best.So Us is a good ride, it's a fun horror, horrific, tense, surprising - just don't look at the nuts and bolts that hold it together. And even though I called the twist at the very start, I'd still re-watch this film in the hope that I'm able to 'get' it better next time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not what I expected but still really good,"After watching the trailer I expected the movie to be full on horror and much more blood. But it's more thriller. It also has a lot of comedy in it which was okay for a few scenes but I think it was too much. I thought the movie was pretty predictable BUT I did Not see the ending coming. Huge plot twist. Me and my dad we're discussing the ending for 15 mins trying to figure out what exactly happened. (In a good way). The acting, soundtrack, idea, and camera were incredible. But the script was not thought out throughly enough I don't think. Sorta rushed.Overall it was a pretty good movie. Get out was definitely better but the concept of this movie was super original. I recommend this movie... even to people who are somewhat scared of horror movies. Because I am and I don't think it was that scary. Only jump scared.

Pretty decent,There's hidden meanings that people don't care to look into. They just give it a 1/10 without thinking about it. Yeah it's not a classic but it's different and I like that. 7/10 for me mainly because yeah while it was original you still had to stupid decisions by the family that didn't make sense. It's tough sometimes making a horror comedy because when I went to see it people were laughing when it was serious situations when no jokes were being told which takes you out of the moment but overall pretty solid,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Effective horror although the underlying subtext requires too much reaching and doesn't come off as smart as it could have been,"A lot of hype leading up to this film, the second film from Jordan Peele, and with a lot of expectation on it. I admit I too was looking forward to it after seeing the very strong trailer for it. Mostly the film met my expectations. It was not as relentless or as frightening as the trailer had suggested it may be, but it did still have its share of tense, horrific, and intense moments. The pace and style of the delivery makes it work well, and it builds pretty nicely in terms of scale. It is very much a genre film, but that in itself is not a measure of anything, because you can have good genre films and bad ones, and this is a good one.While it is a horror, it also manages to have a good streak of dark humor running through it. The political element I think was less successful; some have been full of praise for how smart and daring it is, while others react negatively to what they perceive as a 'woke' film pushing an agenda. Personally I found interesting ideas in here but they don't hang together, unfold as the film progresses, or really give you something 100% concrete to then think back over. The ideas are not nothing though, and it is still interesting to read thoughts and theories about certain points, because they are 'interesting' but in the context of watching the film I didn't feel they were there in a meaningful way, and afterwards it did feel like I was reaching a bit to find them.The direction and performances make a big difference in this. All of the leads are good in their own ways, mostly playing it strong in their two different characters. As everyone else has said, Lupita Nyong'o is by far the strongest in not only her two characters, but the range in which she plays the main one. I wonder if the various industry awards can look beyond the genre and see the performance(s) because it is certainly more worthy of awarding than some which are given to performances of 'worthy' characters. Whether she does or doesn't though, if there are other levels in this film, it is her that finds them more than any of the various political allegories in there.So not as smart or as brilliant as the hype would have you believe, but it is still a well-crafted, interesting, and engaging horror that works mostly as a genre film, but has plenty in the style, direction, and performances to make it a quality one.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The movie at first start as a home invasion movie, then it goes into a slasher movie, then it goes into a horror chase movie and as the plot progresses, it evolves something bigger than you could have imagined.I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to the end.

"Less tightly-crafted, still enjoyable","Us is the second film by Jordan Peele, the writer and director of Get Out. While this film is more of a straightforward horror/slasher movie than a 'Social Thriller', it is unmistakably a Peele movie, featuring his signature reincorporations and sardonic wordplay along with the added claustrophobia that comes with the home invasion genre.While I believe that Get Out is the superior film, there are still many aspects of this film which are an improvement over its predecessor. Firstly, the soundtrack is much more memorable and used to great effect. The blending of humor and horror is also more effective; Get Out alternated the more dramatic and serious scenes with comic relief scenes, but Us manages to have some genuine laugh-out-loud moments in the middle of extremely tense and horrific moments while still maintaining the feeling of constant dread, making for extremely entertaining scenes which are the perfect mixture of horror and comedy.However, the script and concepts, while genius at times, seem slightly disjointed overall. The logic in Get Out was completely sound, and rewatches would always reveal more hidden details which strengthened it even further. The logic in Us can fall apart if examined too closely, and the numerous ideas struggle to complement each other at times. I feel that Peele had less time to fully think this idea through, perhaps because he felt the need to release a second film as quickly as possible in order to cement his place as a noteworthy up-and-coming director.Nonetheless, plot holes matter much less than overall themes and symbolism, which Us handles very well. While the social commentary of Get Out was very clear and left little room for debate, Us is more open to speculation and theorising, presenting the audience with a variety of ideas and statements which can be brought together in numerous valid ways.Even when forgetting the symbolism and commentary, Us still shines as a supremely enjoyable slasher/home invasion movie with striking images and very well crafted sequences of prolonged tension. However, the more squeamish among you may want to give this one a miss.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The third act is Lupita Nyong'o creeping you out and keeping you at the edge of your seat as things are kindda being explained.Here is when this breaks down. Although the idea is interesting, the actors individually are great (even the child actors) I don't buy them as a family. The best parts are when they each get separated and get the chance to creep you out. The third act is an exposition dump that contradicts the main idea of the movie itself so doesn't really work and brings the whole thing down.That being said the hour and half that came before the third act are amazing with both humor and action as well as great atmosphere making it easy to ignore the failings of the third act.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Sometimes it's hilarious, others it's bone chilling, but overall it's a great blend of both","After months of waiting since the first trailer for Jordan Peele's second feature film was released, I was finally able to see ""Us"" in cinemas on the films opening night in my city. While it was not necessarily the film I was expecting to see, after 3 days of non-stop reflection I can confirm that this was a film that I really, really enjoyed, and would even go as far as to say that I loved.Let my just reiterate that the trailers that were released for this film are not as spoiler filled as those for Jordan Peele's first film, Get Out, were. The film is filled with so many layers, not only with the main plot itself but also within the films subtext, which I must say while it is still there it would not exactly be as easy for general film audiences to determine in comparison to Peele's first film. In saying that it is still a deeply enjoyable film for all types of film goers, as long as they are able to accept that Us is not your typical horror film, and is probably not going to be the film they suspected it would be from the trailer.Technically Us is outstanding. In terms of cinematography, the film excels, particular in its opening scene. Every time that something appears in the frame of this film you can tell it has been purposely put there for a reason, whether its excellent foreshadowing, or even just a fun reference from Peele, it carries significance and will undoubtedly make this film excellent for repeat viewings. The score for this film is marvelous. While many would be concerned whether the trailers extremely popular rendition of, ""I Got 5 On It"" by Luniz would make it into the film, don't worry, you won't be disappointed. I must give a special shout out to the track, Pas De Deux. It is so chilling and eerie, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it. It also plays in one of the films best scenes, which I of course won't spoil.The acting in this film is great. All of the actors do such an awesome job acting in two very different roles, which I'm sure would have been very difficult. It is because of this acting (and of course Peele's writing) that helps make all of the characters, especially the Wilson family, so likable. Special shout out to Lupita Nyong'o and both pf her chilling performances as Adelaide and Red, as well as Winston Duke, who plays the goofy and lovable father of the Wilson family, Gabe, so well.In terms of criticisms, it is difficult to talk about without spoiling the film. There were multiple points in the film where I felt that the comedy seemed to undermine the suspense and horror. While the comedy in itself was not weak at all, the comedy throughout the film was all fantastic and most of the jokes landed, its just that if the film was a bit more horror focused in some of these scenes it would have made the horror more effective. There were also a few plot holes with the film and its ending which could have been explained a bit better, which I of course won't go in to detail.Apart from these few small gripes however, Us is a great film. Its sometimes hilarious, and sometimes bone chilling, and for the most part provides a good balance of the two. I had an excellent time watching Us, and can't wait for a second viewing!Us (2019) - 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Jordan peele is the best new horror director in a long time,"After watching the masterpiece that was Get out I new that Jordan Peele had talent as a director. But it was possible that it was just beginners luck. After watching US I can gladly say that Jordan Peele knocks it out of the park again. US is a amazing mix of suspense, comedy, and action. I cant think of another Horror movie that has ever balanced all three of those categories so beautifully. Starting with the comedy, it was really shocking how many times this movie made my whole theatre laugh out loud. I can remember at least four different moments that had the theatre dying. the horror/suspense was used with great care. zero jump scares all about the atmosphere like some of the greatest horror movies ever mastered. The movie reminded me a lot of the Strangers: prey at night, but much better. they both handled the action the same, as making it a top priority along with the horror and at some times it feels you are watching a action based horror film. That might not be everyone type but it sure as hell makes it a more diverse and interesting movie.

Thank you for all the negative reviews that I struggle to understand,"OK, so all those 1-star reviews broght me a much needed realization. For a long time I've been wondering how to assess if a movie is worth watching. Up to this point I thought there was some merit to reading people's comments and generally avoid movies that get a lot of negative reviews. This movie proves that's a very incorrect approach.For me 1 star designates a movie that does some kind of harm to mankind - that's so bad it should be banned just because of how absolutely awful it is. I can imagine, I don't know, some features that glorify negative tendencies or some misguided movie-like experiments that failed badly - those I would rate 1 out of 10. And yet I can see a ton of 1-star rating for a movie that does everything right.The acting is great, the concept is refreshingly original (which is an achievement in itself) and the movie is really enjoyable to watch. We can discuss if the plot-holes (yes, there are some, irrelevant for the experience in my opinion) significantly reduce the joy of watching ""Us"" but this is a difference between a 6-star or a 7-star rating. How could anyone give this a 1 is beyond me. The movie isn't even that ""strange"" - it's just slightly smarter and more self-aware than your average horror flick.Up to this day, if I saw a comment ""The ending ruins the movie"", I would feel highly discouraged to giving it a chance. I see plenty of such comments here. And guess what? There's absoultely nothing wrong with the ending - it compliments the movie in a satisfying way.All in all, I need to thank you again for all the nagative reviews as they let me finally realized that reading such reviews is pointless - don't make them affect your decision of whether or not to watch a movie as you might miss out on a real gem, such as ""Us"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Just like many horrors, I prefer the beginning when there is mystery surrounding the problem, as the story goes on, it gets more and more farfetched and less scary. But only few horrors can have a climax that lives up to the initial chills that the reader feels at the beginning, when the problem is new and exciting. As the film progresses the problem seems to get less scary and daunting.The horror aspects are well done in the film, with some very tense as well as simply terrifying moments in the film, especially towards the end.The film is definitely more interesting than many other horrors out there and I would suggest watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I loved it!,"This movie has been hyped and I really liked it. I had questions at the end and watched all the way through. It was kind of a slow start, but after it picks up it gets very interesting.

Us,"Satisfactory creepy entertainment. Jordan Peele's ""Us"" is by no means a failure, but it is not as perfect as some would like to believe.The picture begins rather well; it sets up the central conflict with Peele's usual style of tricks; suspense, humour, originality, good dialogue. This continues up until two-thirds or so when the story begins to overwhelm and quite possibly confuse the audience with its constant output of ideas. It begins to feel more muddled and less grounded in the world Peele has established. It almost feels like you are watching a different film in the end from the one you initially intended. All you're left with is Peele's version of a Shyamalan twist.In the end, Peele ignores the ""bomb theory"", eliminating real suspense at a point where the film should have used it to its maximum potential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Plot holes sink this otherwise well built ship.,"The person playing the ""real"" father in this movie sums it up himself with the comment: ""Is this some kind of F'd up performance art?""There were things to like (really liked Nyong'o), but the WTF light in my head just kept glowing brighter and brighter until the bulb burned out at the end.Not that a planet overrun with flesh eating zombies makes perfect sense, but once you accept the premise you can go with it.

I am disappointed,Get out was one of my favourite movies of 2017 so of course I was hyped for Us I was ready for a great thrilling experience but I was ended up disappointed the only parts I found scary was Red and her voice and that scene where there underground moving weird and eating bunnies only someone who has watched Us will hopefully understand what I'm saying other then that it wasn't scaryAnother thing was the actors other then the female lead that I always forget the name of she was amazing other then that the rest are serviceable and bad the little girl was horrible playing her evil counterpart and the dad was even worse with his screaming all the characters are unlikeable and bad other thn the female lead and her counterpartIf you didn't like how Jordan Peele lightly used comedy in Get out that ruined the tension in a scene you will hate UsThere are quite a lot of things I like though the idea and concept is great the themes are great the female lead is amazing the writing and screenplay is good not as good as Get out but good and the switcharo twist at the end blew my mind,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

What a Great Premise!,"There are no spoilers here. :D The premise to this film is wonderful. The first 30 minutes before the ""threat"" shows up are great. Unlike some people on here, I prefer 2hr films, more time for the characters and story to be fleshed out. I also am a fan of slow burns, I can enjoy a fast-paced film but slower films, again, allow for more exposition. Unfortunately, that just didn't happen here.I love psychological films of all stripes, and mind-bending films are some of my favorite films. It would be lazy to write me off because I don't totally share your opinion. This isn't a horror film, it is a thriller, and unfortunately, as a thriller, it falls under the weight of it's own plot holes, and lack of suspense.""Get Out"", while effective, is overrated and overblown. It is, in some ways, just as illogical as this film. Here, however, what is lazy writing and lazy plot devices, is being described as ""genius"". ""Get Out"" was a pretty racist film that was supposed to be critiquing race issues, okay, than don't have ALL of your white characters be evil, theirs a start for you. Despite that, it was still a well-made film, it had a good build up, held your attention, and had a good solid final act. It didn't deserve Academy awards, especially since ""Hereditary"", a superior film in almost every way, didn't get a single nod. ""Us"" is not so lucky, as to have the positive side of ""Get Out"".The acting is wonderful, the cinematography and direction are very well-done. From a technical standpoint, outside of the script, this is a great film. Unfortunately, a good script, even if the story is simplistic, is one of the most vital elements, if not the most important.Why does the script not work here like it did in ""Get Out""? ""Get Out"" had a superb finale, it was tense and suspenseful with some good kills. ""Get Out"" created mysteries in the same way ""Us"" does, but ""Us"" not only doesn't answer most of them, it offers up allegory that is nonsensical, and too many plot threads that make no sense. Other reviewers have already expounded on this issue. They could be overlooked more if the film was more presented as a 100% fantasy, or the ending was something along the lines of ""The Signal"", or if the focus was solely on the people experiencing, and not on the issue itself. Meaning, no answers would have been better than the answers it gave.Overall, it had good atmosphere in some parts of the film, and again, the first 30 minutes were superb and had such a wonderful buildup, that unfortunately was totally dropped after that point. This will rightly become, a forgotten film in 10yrs. It isn't very memorable save a few scenes, and it squandered so much potential. Was it not made by an over-hyped film director, this film would have languished in development hell, and been likely bombed, if it even made it to theaters and wasn't straight to VOD. Maybe it would have become a cult classic, and maybe it would have been a better movie since it wouldn't have to deal with the MPAA, but given it's current iteration, and with the expectations it had on it's shoulders, it is barely above average.God Bless ~Amy",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't put it in a box,"A highly entertaining, scary and exciting film, with excellent music and superb cinematography.I see many reviewers who are disppointed that it doesn't fit in the little box they have arbitrarily chosen for it.

To me, it's an open concept and it reminds me of those glimpses of scary dreams we sometimes remember in the morning as a feeling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Too ambitious home invasion movie,"Like Peele's last film ""Get Out"", Us also not provide a remarkable originality, but its acting performance and how the climax is served, manage to redeem the flaws. However, Us also leaves a confusing story of a home invasion movie with an ambitious twist and underlying mega plot that explained in only one scene. All's good in other departments (including lots of jokes), but the unexplained nature of ""Us"" bring a simple plot (which actually can be resolved in one twist nicely), into somewhat awkward apocalypse movie that I am hesitate to see.

"""Us"" chooses social commentary over a cohesive narrative","Color me shocked that it has taken me three years to review Jordan Peele's second film, ""Us."" Why is that, you may be wondering? While my semi-consistent alcohol intake has ridden my mind of any specifics, the most likely conclusion is that I just didn't really enjoy this film the first time I saw it. So, after a long hiatus, I decided to give ""Us"" another go to see if my opinion has changed. Unfortunately, it really hasn't.Sitting firmly at a six out of ten on my rating scale, ""Us"" does have its moments. Advertised as a horror film, ""Us"" can certainly be creepy; Jordan Peele has a real knack for visuals, and so this movie is appropriately atmospheric, especially as it mostly takes place during the night. Basically a slasher film, ""Us"" also contains plenty of slicing and dicing, though Peele keeps things restrained - this isn't the gore fest that you may be expecting, and as such, the movie doesn't sacrifice its tension for cheap blood and gore. And while I am always a sucker for cheap blood and gore, this more moderate approach keeps viewers engaged in the onscreen happenings without distracting them with sensory overload. So, while I did find myself enjoying ""Us"" from a visual perspective, I found myself underwhelmed by its plot, which I can only describe as sloppy; Jordan Peele is a master of coming up with excellent concepts - he just seems to have trouble with executing the landing. So, let's break down where ""Us"" falters.No stranger to the slow burn, Peele takes his time setting things up here - with an effective and moody opening scene, ""Us"" then takes about 35 minutes to finally kick into high gear. While I typically enjoy slow burns, and especially when it comes to horror films, the problem here is that, by the time the action starts, ""Us"" is virtually half way through. So, with around an hour of run time left, Peele has to figure out a way to wrap up the plot in a satisfying manner, explain to the audience what's happening and why, and, in typical Peele fashion, sprinkle in a bit of social commentary. Jordan Peele tries to juggle it all, and only ends up dropping everything on the floor.With only around an hour left in its run time when everything starts to kick off, ""Us"" simply doesn't have enough time to be effective. The house invasion shenanigans can be entertaining, but they're over so quickly that I didn't feel like I was being delivered what was advertised to me. And when the house invasion is over, the movie spirals into an agonizingly uninteresting direction, full of unbearable exposition that sucks all mystery out of the film and replaces it with confusion. Peele, in an attempt to answer the questions this movie sets up, only succeeds in creating numerous plot holes that only create more questions than they do answers. Why? Because Peele is more interested in social commentary than he is in delivering a cohesive narrative. ""Us"" devolves into a message film, one that throws logic by the wayside in order to preach to its audience. These are my absolute least favorite types of movies, so you can imagine my disdain.That said, there is still enjoyment to be found here, if only in small spurts. The house invasion sequences are genuinely thrilling, the movie looks great, and in terms of performances everyone seems to be bringing their A-game. There is so much to like, in fact, that I wish Peele would have reigned himself in to make a more focused picture. By no means do I hate this film, but I find myself disappointed that it is only okay when it had the potential to be one of the horror greats.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hit or miss depending on which version of you watches.,"From Jordan Peele who gave us 'Get Out', the latest horror film nominated for an Oscar Best Picture comes his latest offering 'Us' starring the stunning Lupita Nyong'o. We follow her character Adelaide and her family's vacation which she's been dreading, going back to the place where she was once traumatized as a kid having been lost in one of the carnival's attractions. Her uneasiness comes to fruition when intruders show up on their driveway and they try to maneuver their way out as the suspicious but familiar-looking characters that seem to want to take over their lives.Now due to some loopholes in the story-telling it was hard to make sense of what was going on, even after the reveal near the end. I had to read up about the movie to understand it a little more and it helped me appreciate it a little more. Because of that it's easy to assume that maybe part of the fun was sucked out because the movie was juggling too many ideas up in the air and that it failed to come up with an ending that measured up to what it heavily referenced to, Thriller by Michael Jackson and Jaws by Steven Speilberg. Just the same, Jordan did his homework, Lupita committed and delivered and Winston Duke (Black Panther's M'Baku) was a treat to watch.I have so many questions that were left unanswered and to avoid spoilers I will not enumerate them here. One that I can bring up though is I still don't get the 11:11 reference. Every time I see it I mutter ""make a wish"" under my breath. As for the bit about Hands across America, the director said that it represents ""American optimism and hope - it's a great gesture but you can't actually cure hunger and all that."" That I get. it actually resonates with the current landscape of social media, what with it's keyboard warriors woke and cancelling culture that may be getting people to discuss about topics not usually talked about but at the end of the day still fails to change anything.So if you're looking for a pure horror movie where you want to be scared  for no reason, look somewhere else because this will leave you more with puzzled looks than fear in your eyes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disappointing,"After being surprised by Get Out a couple of years prior to this, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately it failed to live up to expectations.
I think the film is trying to be too many things at once & fails to hit the mark on all fronts.
Is this film scary?
No, aside from the occasional loud noise, there is nothing in this movie that unsettles you.
Is this film tense?
Yes...for the opening 10-20 minutes perhaps. Once we meet the films antagonists, any tension that has been built, quickly dissapates.
Is the film funny?
No. Despite the occasional chuckle, Us never really hits the high notes I was hoping for. I felt the occasional poorly timed comedy quip, or unexpected character reaction detracted from the tension of the film.Very rarely am I tempted to leave a movie screen, but this, sadly, was one of those occasions. I stuck it out until the credits, hoping for a satisfying conclusion, but despite Peele's failed attempt at a surprise twist, was left underwhelmed as a whole.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not the Best,"To put my review into perspective, it took me 3 viewings of Get Out before I really started to appreciate it.

Like Get Out, the premise is a little too random and high concept. I would probably get more out of it if I see it again, which I wouldn't object to at some point. Without a doubt, Jordan Peele is a very talented filmmaker but I just didn't connect with this one. Nevertheless, I give it 6 out of 10, because it was well executed.

Hmmm... Okay, perhaps it was more of a psychological thriller than actual horror.And it kinda was until it wasn't. It was also interesting, funny, horrific, thought-provoking, and perplexing.It wasn't what I expected but lots of things in life delight me with their unexpectedness.Of course, others' mileage may differ.Like those who are saying that anyone giving 10 of 10 stars are ""bot accounts"".

Peele The New Mastermind of Horror?,"Let me start this off by saying HORROR does not have one meaning. Just because a movie is classified as HORROR does not mean it has to be like all generic HORROR films that include jump scare, gore, etc. Horror can be psychological and scare you from your own thoughts rather than what you see. With that being said, I went into this film wanting a psychological horror/thriller as that is what this film seemed like, based of trailers, and that is exactly what I got. A lot of people might be disappointed with this film mainly because they are expecting generic horror (jump scares, gore, etc..) which this movie is far from. People should also go into this film not expecting another Get Out. I've been hearing people complain this movie is terrible and so forth because they its nothing like Get Out. Us is more of a full fledged horror film with comedic elements throughout. While Get Out was more of a Social Commentary Thriller. In Us, Peele grabs your attention from the opening shot and keeps it throughout the film. This film has great acting by the whole cast especially since they are playing both the protagonist and the antagonist. The cinematography is well done as it leads you into some nice shots throughout the entire movie, some of which reminds me of the original Halloween. The stand out in the film is without a doubt Lupita Nyong'o. This might be her best role I've seen her in. The way she is able to keep the audience on edge as the antagonist and keep you rooting for her as the protagonist with ease is mind blowing. The score is outstanding as well, it completes each shot terrifically. The script is were I can see people having some issues. Peele's script does have some plot holes but ultimately I thought it was remarkable. Peele has this incredible tendency to make the audience think and reach deep within their mind for answers. I love filmmakers that can do that. To fully understand this film you will need to watch it multiple times. There are so many little details and lines in the film that if you miss them you might end up confused. I myself will be seeing this film at least 1 or 2 more times. All in all, Us will not be a film for everybody, if you enjoy a film that will get you thinking and reaching deep down in your mind for answers then this is the film for you. If you do not enjoy those kind of films then you might not enjoy this film as much as others. Us is going to go down as one of those films people will be talking about for a while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Extremely hit or miss.,"Acting:
This film was hilarious to me in unintentional ways, the delivery of the main villain
was so hilariously terrible. Although the acting was quite good most of the time.
Cinematography:
The best thing by far was the cinematography, it was stunning to look most of the time.
Plot:
while the premise was interesting the execution and writing was quite average. The most notable poor plot point being the twist at the end, it was predictable and awful.
Tone:
The balance of comedy to horror was by far the most poorly handled part of the film. The tone was never consistent and just as I was on the edge of my seat someone cracked a joke or something so stupid happened that ruined it. I left the cinema wanting a consistent horror atmosphere similar to what Peele created in Get Out.
Overall:
I would recommend this for the casual cinema goer or someone who loves good cinematography, but don't expect much more than an average horror film. If you want something better by Peele watch Get Out. If you want something better than both of these films check out Suspiria (2018) for some good horror, or The Lobster (2015) for some great tone balancing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Entertaining, but not what most people will be expecting.","I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie, just like I have mixed feelings about movie reviews. I think to understand my critique of this film you'll have to know a bit about my tastes, but if you don't agree, just skip to the next section, otherwise here goes: I love movies, good movies, bad movies, low budget, blockbuster, every genre from every corner of the world. The two types of movies I tend to enjoy least are romantic comedies and blockbuster ""horror"" films. I don't understand the hype around the Insidious series or the Annabelle series or really most big budget horror flicks since The Grudge. I am a huge fanboy and therefore I have an innate appreciation for fellow fans and the amount of heart they put into their passion projects. 'Nuff about me.About the movie: Us shines most through the performances of it's actors- each one of whom was well cast- and it's myriad references to the decade from which it's creator got his inspiration. The latter, might in the end actually hurt Us in terms of mass appeal, because if you are not a big fan of 80's cinema, I feel much of the films charm will be lost on you. I think what actually hurts Us the most though, is Jordan Peele's passion. The movie feels like a freshman project, and I would be surprised if this wasn't something Jordan had been cooking up in his head since childhood. There's no nuance to the congruent themes throughout the film, most of which are shoved in your face, and even mentioned in dialogue at one point. The last act of the film is half exposition used to lend a backstory that's not really wanted or needed, it's actually not unlike a lot of the good sketches on Key and Peele that don't seem to know where to cut it off. Like, you had a good thing and then you drove it into the ground. Ultimately it's a movie I would recommend, I would just caution people to adjust their expectations and understand that Jordan Peele is a nerd who won an award for a movie ha made, and was given the freedom to do what he wanted and so now he's made the movie he's been wanting to make since he was 12, and you can tell.

Not A Homerun but Still a Hit,"Jordan Peele's sophmore scary film may not have quite the seamlessness and uniqueness of his first but what it lacks in the mastermind department it makes up for in the creepiness department.A family of four, while vacationing in Santa Cruz, are attacked by their more feral clones. It's a desperate situation as the family tries to figure out how to neutralize the attacking family.""Us"" created a lot of questions and don't expect them to be answered. Not that it's necessary for questions to be answered in order for a movie to be good, it's just that Peele set that bar with the movie ""Get Out"". I stilled enjoyed it and I'd be lying if I said that the movie starring a black family didn't matter.

Our Own Worst Enemy,"I truly love that someone like Jordan Peele is out there making original films like this. Get Out was a near perfect horror/satire and Us, with all of its flaws and possibly plot holes, is an inventive, chilling, and creepy entry into what has become a real resurgence of the horror genre these past few years. Like any great film, I still have tons of questions following my screening, many of which are spoiler territory. The film's insistence on staying ambiguous was great until it decided to reveal some answers that we didn't necessarily need. But I'm afraid, those only made my questions exponentiate. Lupita Nyong'o is expectedly incredible as the mother of the family being tormented by their own doppelgangers, and Winston Duke follows up his beloved turn in Black Panther with very good balanced performance here. With a movie like this, seeing it with a packed audience on a Friday night sometime can make the film less scary, but it certainly makes it more fun. Though the film is never truly terrifying, it's always unsettling, and those unsettling thoughts will not leave your brain until long after you've seen it in theaters. Peele's direction far outshines his writing this time around, with his music and shot choices making for some of the most memorable in recent years with horror. The only thing bringing this movie down is the amount of suspension of disbelief you have to obtain to buy into what Peele is selling. It's a double edged sword when you start to read into Reddit theories that could either make or break your opinion on this mind-trip of a thriller.8.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Ok, ok, fine, I'm sorry, come back. If they're in their teens they should be a fine. The younger ones might get spooked. Definitely don't take grandma though, she won't top talking.The Long, Boring and Pretentious Review:
Oh sure! In 2017 Jordan Peele came out of nowhere with one of the most original, suspenseful and entertaining horror thrillers in recent memory, but, can he do it again? Well, yes, of course he can.
But this is not it.
I'll try to explain. Ever since ""Get Out"" blindsided audiences with its well-constructed tale of ultimate indentured servitude we all have been waiting for the next film from the former half of comedy duo Key and Peele. After two years we finally got our wish. With 4 times the budget of his first film Peele wrote, directed, and produced his next offering.The good news is that Peele continues to mature as a director and shows an expertise than even seasoned veterans can envy. He is not just a skillful storyteller but also proves to be an expert behind the camera. Watch him as he makes a simple shot of rabbits feel unsettling. He is aided by a solid cast all pulling double duty as a normal American family on vacation and the deranged doppelgangers who torment them for some reason.
Lupito Ngyiong'o gets the best parts with the plot being anchored around her story. Ngyong'o's worried mother Adelaide Wilson exudes a sensuality that contrasts sharply with the barely contained lunatic madness of her counterpart. What does she want from the terrified family and why does she seem to know Adelaide? Along for the ride is Ngyong'o's Black Panther co-star Winston Duke as pater familias. A man who finds himself out of his depth in trying to protect his family.The bad news is that while all the pieces are in place to make a compelling narrative the story never comes together and the film as a whole never quite decides what it wants to be. While ""Get Out"" gave us a satisfying payoff after all the weirdness, ""Us"" never fulfills the promise of its storyline. It doesn't help that at times the film decides it wants to be a comedy before pivoting back to suspense.But Peele manages to pull one last rabbit out of the hat. Even if it takes a long way getting there the film comes up with a final surprise ending that would make M. Night Shyamalan jelly. The intriguing finale saves the entire thing from being a wasted effort and Peele from being a one-hit wonder. While he may not be the next Hitchcock just yet he has shown that he can make interesting and complex work and I'm still curious to see what he will do next.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An Instant Horror Classic,"Us Review:A family's serenity turns to chaos when a group of doppelgängers begins to terrorize them in Jordan Peele's new nightmare. After the success of Get Out and the creepy looking trailers, I had to see Us. I actually saw it twice: once on the Thursday opening and the second being tonight. Needless to say, I really liked this movie. Jordan Peele is one of the best writer/directors out there right now. His story is very interesting. It starts out as a home invasion movie like The Strangers, but then turns into something new that we haven't seen before. There were some chilling scenes throughout but he has a way of putting humor in it. What's great is it's not forced and it just comes off naturally. I would say Get Out wasn't as scary and more funny than Us. Though Us is more creepy there were more laughs at the humorous parts since most of the audience needed a way to cool down for a sec. The climax of the film is hands down one of the best scene I've seen in a horror movie in a long time. It wasn't scary or anything but it's the way Jordan executed it and made it into art. That's all with the help of Oscar winning Lupita Nyong'o. If she doesn't at least get a nomination for both the Globes and Oscars I'm going to be furious. She plays two different characters and does so well that I forgot that it's just her playing both. The two contrasting personalities make her performance on par with her Oscar winning role in 12 Years a Slave. Winston Duke provided most of the humor in the movie and I loved him. He's turning his fear into little one liners that made the audience roar in laughter. Their two children were very good for being children actors. Evan Alex's other person named Pluto was literally the creepiest part of the movie. I think it's great that he did that well. Once again this is all with the help of Jordan Peele. You can tell he's been writing his scripts and analyzing them for quite some time. Michael Abel composed the score and I think it's creepy and pretty at the same time. It's surprising that it's only his second score, Get Out being his first. I think his score will at least make the Oscar shortlist. The cinematography was really pretty. There's highlights with reds and blues and whites contrasting with dark surroundings which I liked. Mike Gioulakis's cinematography also better make the Oscar shortlist. The editing was pretty good, again especially with the climax of the film. I just really liked this movie. It was original and gripping. One thing I will say is the first time I saw it I felt anxiety throughout and my heart was racing. For the second I watched it I only felt that once. Really good horror movies keep that anxiety and will make your heart race every time in my opinion. I'm not saying this isn't a really good horror movie but I wish I could feel that every time I watch it. Also there's a twist at the end that I called from even before I watched the movie. I liked the twist and it's interesting to watch it from a different point of view the second time if you didn't predict it. I have some questions still with the film but I kind of like that. Still a few things could've been explained. I think Us is a very good movie. It is currently my favorite movie so far of 2019. I like it just a little more than Get Out. I think this will go down in horror classics with Get Out and would definitely recommend seeing it!My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Am I missing something here?,"I saw ""Get Out"" recently and was very, very impressed with the film. Writer/Director Jordan Peele did a really nice job and the film left me wanting to see more of his work. So, I rented ""Us""...hoping it would be as engaging and clever as his first film. Well, unfortunately, I was left rather cold after seeing ""Us""...and after reading through many of the reviews on IMDB, apparently many others were also disappointed in his second film.The story sets up a very scary mood...that is the best thing about the movie. As for the plot, there's no explanation for any of what happens and often I found the characters behaving oddly or irrationally...particularly the mother.A family goes for a vacation near Santa Cruz Beach in California. Out of the blue, identical copies of the family members appear and while they look exactly like each family member, they are freaky copies...and some speak much like DoodleBob (from the ""Frankenbob"" episode of ""Spongebob Squarepants""). They also are complete psychos and at first, completely inexplicably, the family just sits there as their tormenters threaten them. Eventually, these incredibly passive folks attack...killing off their evil twins. But in this film, it turns out this sort of thing is happening everywhere AND after they die they somehow return...making them a lot like Energizer bunnies!My biggest problems with the film are that there is no real reason for any of this. At least with ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" the doubles were put there by alien life. WHY is a question I kept asking myself. What I also kept wondering is WHY the family (particularly the mother) acted the way they did. The mom was incredibly inconsistent in her actions. One minute she just does what the evil replicants tell her to do (the copy of her told her to handcuff herself to a table AFTER the copies began tormenting and hurting her family...and so she did!!), and other times she fights back, and other times when it appears her family has escaped, she gets out of the car...apparently, only to give the copies a chance to kill her and her family. Clearly the mother never saw Peele's film ""Get Out""...otherwise she would have just gotten out! Overall, a big disappointment and I hope Peele's next film ""Nope"" is a return to the greatness I saw in ""Get Out"".",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

An unique plotline.,"I was pretty surprised when I read some of the reviews on here, because some people seemed to really dislike this movie, and though I didn't think that it was that bad, I have to say that I was a bit confused after watching this movie. I had to read several articles; interpretations in order to understand some of the messages that this movie was trying to portray, and the logic behind the twist/ending. I'm not exactly sure if a good movie is supposed to convey its meaning in a pretty obvious way, or if I'm just clueless, but after having watched this movie, all I thought was, ""That's it?"" The ending came and went pretty abruptly, and I couldn't help but feel that I was missing something.

A solid sophomore effort.,"Jordan Peele, primarily known for his work in comedy, made waves throughout the horror scene in 2017 with his directorial debut Get Out; a tightly written, intense horror/thriller that impressed both audiences and critics alike. Peele's sophomore effort, Us, centers around a family as they retreat to their lovely beach house in Santa Cruz for a holiday. Adelaide (Nyong'o) remains trepidatious about the getaway, plagued by an incident from her childhood that occurred there. Gabe (Duke), her carefree, fun-loving husband, encourages her to just relax and enjoy their time there, oblivious to the threat Adelaide knows is out there somewhere. All hell then breaks loose when a family of twisted, murderous doppelgangers arrive outside their house, standing on their driveway hand in hand. What begins as a fun family holiday morphs into a horrifying night of unexplainable terror, in which Adelaide and her family must fight and kill their evil doppelgangers to ensure their survival.With Us, Peele cements his status as a director to watch. There is a lot to like about Us, but there are several things that hold the film back from reaching the heights of Get Out. Front and centre of the film is an outstanding lead performance by Lupita Nyong'o. She's absolutely fantastic and nails both performances excellently, capturing both the twisted malevolence of Adelaide's doppelganger and the frightened desperation of Adelaide herself as she strives to protect her family and end the terror once and for all. Winston Duke is great fun as Gabe, too. Unlike Get Out, Us is a straight up horror film that falls more into the league of the slasher subgenre, abandoning the thriller aspects rife in Peele's debut and going for straight up murderous mayhem that, once it gets going, rarely stops. As for the doppelganger family, they're certainly a menacing screen presence, especially the brother, who's face is obscured behind a mask that appears to have been riffed from The Orphanage (2007).On the other hand, there were elements of the film that I felt did not quite work as strongly. Humour in horror is difficult to pull off (1998's Bride of Chucky is a perfect example of horror-comedy done right), and in Us, there are sometimes moments of comedy inserted in places that rob the film of its scare factor. There is a particular plot point introduced in the film, roughly around the half way point, that frustratingly diminishes the unnerving, sinister mystique of the doppelganger family that was constructed so brilliantly in the films first act. As that plot point develops, I found myself slowly losing interest in the overall premise of the film. Ultimately, it all leads to a twist that, after some thought, doesn't quite stick the landing as well as it could have done. It is during the third act in which it all begins to falter. Peele displays plenty of interesting ideas here, but they're not as cohesively executed as his concepts in Get Out were, resulting in a rather muddled finale.Us is a solid second film from Peele, though it's not as strong as his debut. It is an interesting film, for sure, and may be a film that benefits from repeat viewings, but it really is Nyong'o's outstanding central performance that holds the whole film together.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not as good as Get Out but still enjoyable and creepy,"In preparation for Jordan Peele's next horror flick Nope I am rewatching Us and Get Out.Jordan Peele's second film Us like Get Out is a real mind trip. Great cinematography, writing, acting, music, original score, and at times a thought provoking story. Peele really fills this film with thought provoking imagery and allusions it's all very well done. I can't write this review without mentioning Peele's unique talent in really being able to get under the audiences skin with truly creepy, horrifying moments and these moments are heightened with amazing sound design.While this film like Jordan Peele's directorial debut Get Out features all the things that made his first film great.

The Scariest Movie Ever?,"It was a really good movie. I think the media kinda took some away from it though. I'd classify it as a suspense thriller, but I don't wanna focus on the media hype. It was a great original idea that kept you guessing throughout. The actress Lupita (Adelaide Wilson) did great and the acting of the remaining cast was decent. It got pretty brutal in regards to some of the scenes in the middle of the movie which I appreciated. The score of the movie was good and unique in sprinkling some well known tracks and the dark and ominous tones. The comedic relief was a bit much I thought. I understand it is Jordan Peele and they kinda go hand in hand but to become a ""master of horror"" I think he needs to use it more strategically. The cinematography was pretty straightforward. I feel with the plot of the movie they could have gotten a bit more creative. The ending still has me thinking which is good but i don't want to give any spoilers. I understand the idea of people existing without a known purpose is a theme but I'm definitely gonna see it again to draw examples and correlations emphasizing that point.

I don't get the hype...,"Great concept and I liked the twist at the end, but throughout most of the movie it keeps going from thriller-type movie to comedy. It has a good buildup up until the home invasion but afterward it just feels watered down.People keep saying there's so much symbolism in the movie like the concept of duality, how meaningful is having a soul, references to the Bible eg Jeremiah 11:11, keeping up with the rich at the cost of your identity, etc. So I watched it a second time but there just isn't much to reflect on. You have to dig realllly deep to ponder about the aforementioned themes, but I just find that grasping at straws to put more meaning in the film. The only big theme I was left thinking on was (without spoiling), Can a copy of a person without a soul be considered a real person?The more I think of the plot the more I disliked it due to the plot holes, hence the 6/10. Both times I watched it I heard others in the theater mumble ""wait, that makes no sense,"" ""what?"" etc. Without spoilers, how do the other people escape underground? How do they get organized so damn well before and after their escape when one person does all the planning without electronics? How does an entire city let alone the nation fall to these people armed with nothing but scissors? How does *she escape with mimicry when the elevator only goes DOWN??? Why is she always being kept alive after being caught? Who feeds the bloody rabbits and how is that a viable way to feed them all?I guess it's worth a rental to see an interesting concept with a good score and cinematic ending, but overall with all the hype and $$$ it's been getting, I find it disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
US IS PHENOMENAL,Jordan Peele is going to be here for a while I see making films like this. A very well crafted ride of an experience,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fun and terrifying,"For a movie with such a shocking twist ending, Us is surprisingly re-watachble. In fact, I'd go as far as to say it has gotten better each time I've seen it. There's so much packed into its 2-hour runtime, including sprawling metaphors, social commentary, symbolism, humor, and most importantly - horror. But what I enjoy most about Us is that you can ignore almost all of those things (because it can be frustratingly obscure) and just enjoy the bleep out of the ride. Also, I think that the theme song ""I Got 5 On It"" perfectly captures the ominous and uncanny vibe the entire film possesses. Stellar acting, and Jordan Peele is simply an excellent director. Ultimately, Us explores the duality of humankind in a manner that is simultaneously fun... and terrifying.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"The ideas were there, but the execution was lacking","The sound design was deceptive and played mind games, it was great. The soundtrack complimented the movie as well. The hall of mirrors scene was well done, it felt pretty original. Lupita looks too young to be the mother of those children lol, it was hard for me to believe that. Her acting was kind of off too, felt kind of cringe at times. The chemistry between the actors felt a bit off as well, it didn't feel organic. But overall the acting was fine. The tone the movie was going for was the most confusing part, it didn't know what it wanted to be. There were moments that felt unintentionally cringey & comedic, then there were moments that were dark & disturbing and gory, then there were moments that felt silly. It felt like it was all over the place, kind of a mess. It just feels very weird, and not in a good way. Once the family invaded the home, that's kind of where I lost interest. It became kind of ridiculous. The movie was supposed to be a horror movie yet not once did I feel genuinely scared. It just felt like one big ridiculous silly joke.I will say, Jordan is really good at building tension and doing the unexpected and thinking outside the box. He's definitely a creative mind that knows how to bring his ideas to life. Sadly, this movie is not one of them. It's unfortunate because Get Out and Nope were fantastic movies that were beautifully fleshed out. It's just this one wasn't one of them. I will give it props for the twist ending. The idea for the movie was there, but the execution wasn't. It's still pretty entertaining but I would heed a word of caution to any future viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Finally, an Original Horror Movie","I watch a lot of horror movies, and there is a certain kind of sameness to them all. They seem to be copies of each other (or copies of Asian horror, but that's another topic). Sure, there may be a twist thrown in here and there in some of them, but overall, there is no originality shown in any of them. Basically jump scares, gore, leading music that tells you when to be scared, but no originality in theme, production, or plot. I could go on and on about the themes that have been beaten to death (no pun intended) in most modern horror movies, but I don't want to make this particular review longer than necessary. None of them leave an impression on you that lasts longer than it takes to get to the parking lot of the theater or to turn off the disk or TV.Here, we have something that is completely different. Finally, some original writing, some original production values, some original direction, some original ideas. A film that holds together right through the end, in spite of the many reviews here from people that obviously didn't see the obvious continuity that held the film together throughout.I have to question the motives of the people here who have written so many negative reviews. Are they so locked in to the standard horror movie technique that they can't step out of it long enough to recognize something different? It makes me wonder what today's audience would think of ""The Shining"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"".And no, I won't even get into the significance of 11:11. That seems to be too much for most reviewers here to deal with. They just want your typical horror movie plot style and ending so they don't have to think about what they've seen.Many of the reviews here nit-pick about plot holes. Sure, they are here, but are you kidding me? Most modern horror movies rely on plot holes from the beginning. Without them, they wouldn't be able to exist at all. So why focus on the relatively minor ones here, while ignoring the fact that other horror movies consist of nothing but one big plot hole right off the bat?Anyway, if anyone reads this, don't let the reviews here deter you. Watch this movie. You will see a horror movie unlike any you've seen before.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Wow, Some of the Dumbest Reviews Ever","I am a big fan of horror films and Jordan Peele's work, and from the beginning, not when people saw Get Out and suddenly realized he existed. I was fine with being satisfied with my enjoyment of the film but then saw all these bad reviews that said consistently the same thing - people didn't understand the film, or that it wasn't logical. Really? IT'S A HORROR MOVIE! Is Freddie Krueger logical? Jason Vorhees? Pet Semetary? No. Most horror films start and end in fantastical terms that are based somewhat in reality in order to scare us. That's why Freddie Krueger scared the pants off people in the '80s because that was the first time a villain attacked us in our dreams. Fantasy meets reality. That's what horror is.A lot of Jordan Peele's work is based on his obvious love of '70s, '80s and '90s films, and general geek culture. Get Out, as he stated, was inspired by the '70s version of The Stepford Wives. And, if you've seen the film, like I have, Get Out is basically a clever reboot of that film replacing racism with misogyny. I wonder if all the people who thought Us isn't logical think you can put people in a deep hypnosis and they become robot slaves. Nope, Get Out isn't logical either cause it's a HORROR MOVIE.I thought Us was a superior evolution of Peele's career because, as I said, Get Out is pretty paint-by-numbers to Stepford Wives. Watch it, you won't see much difference other than the theme. Where, Us is a generally inspired by Peele's love of '80s films, and I'm guessing he saw Three Identical Strangers, and he took that inspiration and created something wholly original and intriguing. Maybe this movie isn't for everyone, there was one guy laughing in our theatre when Elisabeth Moss showed up as the Tethered, but every one else in the packed theatre was scared AF. It was a very tense film with little breathing room. I haven't been that scared in a film since Freddy Krueger. When I asked my partner what she thought of the film she said, she was scared, traumatized, ruined from horror movies for all time, and would take every second back if she could, and she had her face covered through most of the film. She said what she was able to watch was very good. And when I used the creepy voice all night she was jumpy and irritated with me. That is a good horror movie.For everyone that has their theories, here's what it's about: in the opening scene when the camera is zooming in on the '80s TV, talking about Hands Across America, there are video boxes on both sides of the TV. The three films to the left were C.H.U.D. (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers), Goonies, The Man With Two Brains. Little Easter eggs of what the film is about. All are campy '80s movies that are considered cult geek classics. There's not some attached, deeper meaning like people are trying to assign to Peele's work. This is the same man who's first film was Keanu, a story about a gang kidnapping a man's kitten. Like Tarintino, Peele is just a man deeply passionate about film, and what he likes, he's just more into '80s cult films, while Tarintino likes Korean action films. And many think Tarantino is a genius, but a lot of his career is based on stuff he ripped from Korean films and other places that most Americans don't recognize so it seems fresh and completely his own. But both Peele and Tarintino take their inspiration and create fresh, interesting ideas of their own.Aside from Peele's job well done, the actors performances were excellent. I've definitely jotted Lupita in my book as actors to watch out for and see their films. I've seen her in several films, but she hasn't had something that I've seen that let her shine in the way this film did. She was usually there merely to support some man's role, rather than shine on her own.Though there wasn't as much humor inserted into this film as Get Out, probably because it would have slowed down the bullet train of tension, but my favorite moment was when Elisabeth Moss told her ECHO to call the police and it played N.W.A. instead; very funny. I love how Peele plays between both worlds of horror and humor, kind of like his own modern take of '80s horror/comedies. He's done a good job of modernizing that genre. I look forward to his take of The Twilight Zone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Over Rated,"This movie is given more credit than it deserves because of Peele's previous horror film, Get Out. while Get Out is also overrated (though still a good film), Us is overrated and isn't very good at all.While the acting and directing, for the most part, do what they can to save this movie from completely falling apart, the writing is in shambles. The movie makes the unforgivable mistake of long episodes of exposition, telling and not showing. I believe it does this because Peel doesn't know how to show the story, because he doesn't know what the story is. I can almost see his thought process, ""If I feed just enough allusions to cultural imagery into this movie, people will fill in the blanks that I can't."" However, even that idea fails, because there isn't enough ammo for the viewer to use to fill in the blanks. Another unforgivable mistake Peele makes is showing the ""monsters"" too early in the film. Once the monsters are in the house, and especially once they start dialoguing like bad super villains, I am no longer afraid -- just bored.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Scary, chilling, head-scrambling, funny, satirical, profound, technically brilliant.","Early in Quentin Tarantino's career it was hard to tell what type of film-maker he'd turn out to be. His early films were so soaked in pop culture references, sly allusions and dialogue about comic book characters and the like, that the task of decoding what, if anything his films were about was a largely fruitless one. It could be argued that we still don't know; we do know that he needs a more ruthless editor, but there seems to be little (if any) thematic consistency. Two films in to Jordan Peele's career, we know rather more. His films so far seem equally replete with pop cultural references; there's little sign of the ill discipline that has come to define Tarantino (though in Quentin's defence, Pulp Fiction was just the right side of baggy. Just.); and whilst we can see the fingerprints of Tarantino in, for instance, Peele's use of music, we can also see the larger themes he's reaching for. It helps that Peele is sticking to the horror genre; but taking Peele's calling card of Get Out and his second film Us together, it's apparent that he may well be one of the key film-makers of the era. He may also, it seems, be the prophet our times need.Whereas Get Out was clearly and obviously about race, Us could be about any number of things. Peele has been articulate about how this is in itself a breakthrough - a major film by a black film-maker with black leads that isn't about race shows, he says, a development in the conversation. The way Us appears to light up like a forcefield whichever of a number of themes you bring near it could be a weakness, and lead to a game of decoding that causes viewers to lose the power of the film's concerns; for me, that would be a mistake from the viewer rather than Peele, but I can see why it may be a problem.Let's be clear; Us is scary, funny, technically brilliant, stuffed with standout performances, and profound. Is it better than Get Out? Who knows. That seems a daft game to play. Like Get Out, you can decode any number of cultural and genre reference points; I'll throw one in to the ring I haven't seen mentioned (yet) - HG Wells's 'The Time Machine', the science-fiction book that more or less created the time travel sub-genre. The influence here isn't in time travel; but rather, to me, in something hinted at in the film's opening shot that becomes a central part of the film's plot. I'll say no more on that for fear of spoilers.It's an adrenaline ride, for sure. A home invasion movie, a doppelgänger movie, a family in crisis drama, a slyly satirical/comic take on and deconstruction of the American dream, consumerism, capitalism, celebrity charity drives (prefiguring the Insta-charity brigade); it touches too on animal testing. Like many horror movies it looks at the consequences of early trauma on later life, throwing in a dose of imposter syndrome for good measure.For me it says most about privilege. During apartheid in South Africa, the governing party banned any art that would be deemed to subvert their rule. Sometimes they missed the point. Bright Blue's song 'Weeping' snuck through, because it appeared to be a song about a man with noisy neighbours. It was, of course, a parable; a parable about the way white South Africa kept the rest of the country at bay. In the words of the song, in the quest for peace and order, the threat of the angry underclass was stifled. The mistake made was that what they thought was anger, wasn't; it was weeping. But if the weeping remained unheard for too long, it may well turn to anger.That's the thematic territory that Us seems to me to tread. As the moneyed classes bury themselves in consumption and comfort, an underclass is increasingly alienated, and increasingly desperate. The underclass might be seen as angry; in fact they are weeping. But when the weeping is unheard, and instead patronised and then forced to continue to pay the price of the privileged's comfortable life, we watch it eventually turn to blood-soaked, murderous anger.It should go without saying that, controversies about accents notwithstanding, Lupita Nyong'o's central performance is remarkable; each cast member who's asked to play two versions of the same character is similarly terrific. Elisabeth Moss is superb in her supporting role, which does not give her enough to do (but in fairness, no film gives an actress of her remarkable talents enough to do). There are jump scares to rival most, but it's the chilling, creeping dread and the final, head-scrambling twist that lives in your (sub) conscious for days after. It has what may be the bleakest final shot since Frank Darabont's The Mist, made bearable by the film's well-judged wit and laugh out loud tension-breaking.As with Get Out, Peele is tackling one of our era's most urgent issues, calling us to listen and act before it's too late. Whilst churches squabble, politicians drown in self-interest and celebrity culture demands its tribute, Jordan Peele may well be the prophet our times urgently need. Maybe many won't give credence to that, soaked as his horror stories are in blood and fear; but therein lies the challenge. Prophets rarely invite us to comfort.Have we ears to hear?",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

And then they stopped and left them allone With a couple of rabbits..for hundreds of people??!! .. and what ???! the only thing between them and the whole world is a elevator??!! That s only a Few And there are even much more craters in the plotline...When I left I asked myself ""what the hell did I just watch!""",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Near Perfect Horror Film,"I preferred Us to Get Out as it was more of a traditional horror film. To start, some of the issues in a lot of horror films are present here, ie characters making poor decisions. But I guess if they weren't to make those poor decisions, we wouldn't have the film. I like the comedic elements and the way they were interwoven into the story, although I did think there was a bit too much comedy present in the film. But those are my only gripes. Lupita, Winston, and the children all give a remarkable performance as both the good and evil side of themselves. I don't think I've ever seen a better performance from Lupita in fact. I will definitely be watching this one again soon. I feel it will be even better after a second viewing. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Peele is a visual artist but lacked a story for Us,"This movie is definitely flawed but entertaining nonetheless. If you get past the gaping plot holes, the cinematography was excellent and pulled the movie through the end. If you are a fan of horror and go into horror movies expecting a number of plot holes, Us will be an above average thriller to sink your teeth in. However, if your opinion of movies rely heavily on story execution, this movie might not be for you. Have fun with the movie and try to take every scene with a grain of salt.

Doppelgänging mole people,"I went into this knowing absolutely nothing about it. I hadn't ever even seen the trailer. I ended up being pleasantly surprised with what felt like a moderately original experience...This was an interesting combination of horror thriller and comedy. The concept was riddled with plot holes and it takes a hearty helping of suspension of disbelief to enjoy. However, if you can get past that... it was a very interesting concept, fun twist, excellent acting and solid spook factor (in the beginning). The creepiness wore off after a bit but when it was first introduced it was pretty strong and cool.Overall I found it to be an entertaining experience and I appreciated the originality. This landed at a 6.5 for me and rounding up to 7. Would recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An ambitious scent, a metaphor-crammed comedy-thriller.","Jordan Peele's projected second blockbuster coup slowly distends with a puzzle of philosophical devices in a hall of mirrors disguised as your average thriller.After the narrative crosses its crest, audiences might want to take time to digest and appreciate its bizarre concept that at first may appear funny, trivial, and difficult to follow. Give it time and let the brewing process happen, with its substantial hints in numbers of scenes that even in the eye of its characters' emotions is a thread that connects to the major plot details.Lupita Nyong'o is eloquent with her extremely expressive and lucid acting. She portrayed two characters with a big gap on personalities and still manages to display intricately the distinctive characteristics of both. In addition, there is a conflict between her craft's subtle actions and monumental expressions that materialized two characters and appeared different but ""tethered"" or connected at the same time. Probably one of the best performance in a horror movie so far. 👏In the midst of the film's note-worthy aspects, the cinematography is a stand-out. For instance, at the beach scene, there is a distinctive contrast between bliss and uncertainty - that establishes comfort, at the same time provokes hesitancy while building-up thrill. In complementary, the music score that circulates with style between classic jazz and modern music radiates emotions designed to establish intensity.Too bad those thrills and intensity, were simply destroyed by the film's fillers and misplaced comedy. In every established thrill, there are snaps of fillers that breaks the anticipation. The nonessential comedic comments were designed to conjure relief and freshness from the film's already complicated narrative, but also consequently made it hard for the viewers to get back on track and follow its story-labyrinthine - an inferior move for a film that is full of symbolism.Nevertheless, it was a decent movie, a great comedy-thriller, and does not scratch on Jordan Peele's Get Out-established name on pop-culture.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Peele provokes so many good questions,"...about society and American life as we live it!! This Peele movie's message is not as ""in your face"" as Get Out's was, but it still is offers a great perspective about American culture and class distinction.

this movie has made me lose faith in IMDB.,"I have been a fan of imdb now for 15 years. I regularly say to my wife or kids ""hey this movie has an imdb of 7.7....must be good!

"Intriguing, action-filled horror-thriller","A family on vacation is confronted outside their home by a family who look identical to them.Written and directed by Jordan Peele, of Key and Peele fame, Us follows in the same vein as Peele's previous movie, his debut offering 'Get Out': a reasonably clever and engaging horror movie. He's now carving out a name for himself in horror, which is a far cry from his comedy roots.Us doesn't have the same coherent social messaging that Get Out had, but makes up for this with a compelling-viewing horror-thriller plot. It takes a while to get going, but once it does it is an action-packed roller-coaster ride.Does falter towards the end though. Some plot developments are nonsensical and inconsistent with what came before and the ultimate revelation is pretty tame. Conclusion is also quite weak. A pity, as the first 70-80% was great.Overall, worth a watch, just set your expectations for the ending quite low.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
If you are a cerebral thinker.. you will enjoy the thriller that is US.,"Based on some of these reviews, it seems as if we all watched two different movies... and that may well be the case seeing that there was a movie bout ""Us"" , the family that meet their doppelgänger family and then there was the other movie called US that was a satirical narrative of America.
Or you may have been a viewer such as myself who was able to see the duelling factions and integrate them into a really well done movie.If you were hoping to see Get Out II then you will be disappointed. Its not Get Out. There is equal opportunity killing. There were no nods to Get Out other than one lane scene resembled the lane scene in Get Out. Other than that... the two movies were not comparable.I watched this in a Magic Johnson AMC in Harlem, NY and I was not disappointed. This movie was made for us and we were all engaged laughing at the right moments, scared at the scary parts and yes screaming at the actors to "" get in the car , yo!"". This was made for us and we understood it. It felt like it was meant for us and the only way I can describe this movie without spoiling it is by saying it was like the Purge, Childish Gambino's This is America and a whole lot of messed up emotions.
The scene where Director Peele takes us from comedic highs to terror depths in one actor's expression was amazing.He got something out of these actors that I haven't seen in their previous body of work and I appreciate it.Whoever that little girl is who played the young Mom character.. I never want to meet her in a dark alley. Im just saying.
The political message... you have to find that for yourself but I was satisfied and based on the conversations that I overheard; we all had different theories.

Fantastic concepts but the piecing it together never happened,"Honestly ,the only thing I can say is go see the movie yourself with an open mind. I'll certainly be going to see it again even though it was more disappointing than exceeding for me. No doubt in my mind that Peele is a genius, however some of the great ideas were not fully developed in the film ,which left many holes in the film. The acting couldn't have been any more amazing. The cast was perfection. If anyone else was casted for the lead role besides Lupita, this movie would not stand a chance. The chaotic script provided called for expert level interpretation and that's what it got. The plot itself was not generalizable enough for everyone to get exactly the point Peele was aiming for. It's not as simple as ""we're our own worst enemy."".
Get out had a loud and clear theme with various subtle hidden tie ins that seamed together perfectly. US again was full fantastic concepts ,but putting all the layers together just didn't seem to happen as well. I'll give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great potential, Poor execution","A wonderfully thought out concept that has the potential to be a powerfully horrifying experience to the viewer, but it falls short of greatness due to flaws in logic that will have you screaming at your television. For example, there are a great deal of scenes where the main characters defy basic fight or flight reactions. Too many scenes where I found myself saying ""well you put yourself in that position, dummy"". The film makes our protagonists seem like 6 year olds with no perception of danger rather than grown adults with children. It reminds me of corny 1970s slasher films where the first victims are just complete idiots who were too dumb to live in the first place. Get Out had plausible characters with a twist that viewers could believe. This film had unbelievably stupid characters with a plot twist that you'd have to be blind and deaf to not see coming.

Us Movie Review,"Hey Movie Lovers! Just saw ""Us"".Storyline: America is terrorized by doppelgängers of the residents. In my opinion, the storyline seems intelligent and purposeful but it could not come off clearly to the audience. The audience is left guessing far too much and it takes away from the film.Characters: This is not a character driven film, you do not form any emotional bonds with any of the characters. However that is the purpose of the thriller, for the characters to remain 2 dimensional while serving the thriller as three dimensional. However, the star cast nails it and I will be very disappointed if Lupita does not win all the oscars for her outstanding performance. 👏🏽Production: The production value is very high, so nowhere does the set, costumes or surroundings overpower the main idea of the movie.Final Thoughts: Let me be very clear and say that this movie is never boring and keeps you engaged throughout. It is a thriller so it keeps you guessing with a few great jump scares throughout. The climax and ending seem like unfinished thoughts with not enough for the audience to connect the pieces. You will leave this movie slightly confused but that's gonna make for some great after movie conversations and some great movie conspiracies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wow. Just wow.,"So mind-blowing & well-made. Jordan Peele is such a gem. He is like the Orson Welles of our day crafting nostalgia into gorgeous wonderful stories. The tone is pitch perfect. It will scare you. If it doesn't I worry about your imagination. Especially if you grew up anywhere in or around Santa Cruz, Ca & it's Boardwalk. Which by the way... he nailed from 1986. I was 11. I was there & it looked exactly like, that tables with umbrellas & all. Well, except for the mirror maze- that was all story device - but damn it was a great story device.
Jordon Peele is 40. Seems like he found the perfect recipe of those feeling all of us who grew up in the Eighties. Awesome nostalgia we can all relate too. Along with a lotta suspense, anxiety, terror & style that all build to a frantic pitch that had me squirming. He has a modern touch that shows us - that we are all US. If you think about it.

Who would have thought such a rousingly good film at this time of year>,"""They look exactly like us. They think like us. They know where we are. We need to move and keep moving. They won't stop until they kill us... or we kill them."" Adelaide (Madison Curry)You thought Jordan Peele's Get Out was a smart person's horror film; well his Us is even better because the intelligent themes are there, but the horror elements are amped up, quite reasonably I'd have to say. A sweet family is terrorized by its doppelgangers, who seem to represent the dark side of themselves and humanity.The thrills are more than the usual horror tropes like jump scares and scary rooms. Each character must face his twin and fight it as if his life depended on it, and it does. When the opening scene has young Adelaide strolling away from her parents at the Santa Cruz beach into a fun-house hall of mirrors, you know she will face her twin, Young Red, and be forever changed for that brief 15 minutes.Writer Peele lets the growing family prosper slowly until the twin family arrives, when baseball bats and fireplace pokers can do only so much to dispel those creatures. One of the nice touches is that the good guys can be effective against the home invaders but only with cunning and a ton of courage. As with most of this genre, no creature dies easily or quickly.If like me, you take your horror lite, in Us is plenty of small asides that give a chuckle and also add to the suspense. When dad (Winston Duke, physically resembling Tyler Perry and Jordan Peele and therefore likeable if not at times schlubby), comments that mom has just left the car, the dark humor is that she's left to find one of the twins and armed only with the now iconic scissors. We want to tell her not to go there alone because we know the tradition of a loner going into a forest.As for star of Us, mom Adelaide/Red (Lupita Nyong'o) kicks butt most of the time because dad is debilitated, and women in general are more apt to take over these days.

It is good but not perfect,"A family comes under attack from doppelgangers who intend to kill and replace them. You may think you know a lot about this film from the trailers but you don't. There is so much more to this film than than one family being under siege.While it is a horror, it also manages to have a good streak of dark humor running through it. The political element I think was less successful; some have been full of praise for how smart and daring it is, while others react negatively to what they perceive as a 'woke' film pushing an agenda. Personally I found interesting ideas in here but they don't hang together, unfold as the film progresses, or really give you something 100% concrete to then think back over. The ideas are not nothing though, and it is still interesting to read thoughts and theories about certain points, because they are 'interesting' but in the context of watching the film I didn't feel they were there in a meaningful way, and afterwards it did feel like I was reaching a bit to find them.The direction and performances make a big difference in this. All of the leads are good in their own ways, mostly playing it strong in their two different characters.Overall, I just wanna say that, don't get your hopes up after watching JP's ""Get Out"" cuz it is good in it's own way, but not better than ""Get out"".

The bad things about this movie are the negative reviews.,"It's always funny to read all those negative reviews from haters. Those basically come from people that are very hard to please or that are never satisfied. You could make the best movie ever, they still would feel the urge to bash it. Not that Us is the best movie ever, far from that, but as a horror/thriller/mystery it's sure as hell entertaining. Okay the story contains flaws, things that don't add up, and that's why it could have been better, but it's still good enough for a nice intriguing movie night. The acting was not bad at all, especially from Lupita Nyong'o when she played Red. Some haters hated the twist at the end, maybe it wasn't necessary, I thought of it, saw it coming, and still was satisfied enough with Us.

"Perfectly watchable, just pales in comparison to what it's up against","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs a young girl, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) visited the beach, and took a detour into a hall of mirrors, only to find herself faced by a creepy doppelganger of herself, an incident that scarred her through her childhood. Years later, she's married to Gabe (Winston Duke) and has two children of her own, Zora (Shahadi Wright) and Jason (Evan Alex.) To destress from their heavy lives, the family take a trip back to that same beach, only for Jason to head to the same place that Adelaide did as a kid. After that, they find themselves accosted by a group of doppelgangers of themselves, who have plans of their own.I was a latecomer to Get Out, director Jordan Peele's directorial horror debut, and dodged all the hype surrounding it when it was first released, but was certainly very impressed with it when I did get round to seeing it. And so, on learning of the existence of Us, his follow up effort, I felt somewhat more compelled to go out and check it out, even though from the offset it was living in the shadow of GO. It's received mostly quite positive reviews, and it's certainly worth seeing, it just struggles to live up to the quality of what went before it.Revelling in the current diversity agenda sweeping Hollywood, Peele helms an entirely black lead cast, in a film deriving much of it's humour from subtle references to African American culture. The main concept is certainly intriguing, and creates a decent air of mystery to what could be behind it all. It's also strongly acted by the lead stars. But it lacks the surreal inventiveness of GO, simply revolving around a concept without having much deeper beneath the surface. While the mystery is suitably resolved at the end, it just comes off as far fetched and outlandish, not helped by moving from the containment of the family's predicament, onto a worldwide epidemic.In a modern horror climate dominated by CGI, cheap jump scares and shaky cameras, it's great to have a director like Peele around, who keeps things story centred and at least attempts to give his work a cerebral edge. Us in no way represents a downward spiral, it just can't quite match the standard Peele previously set. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Jordan Peele is a master at his craft, a black pioneer!","When the trailer for this movie came out, my excitement could not be contained. I forced everyone I know to watch it. I memorized the entire thing by heart. I've read rave reviews (as well as the not-so warm reviews), and I was ready to see this masterpiece.it's been two hours since it ended, and nothing could've prepared me for the psychotic mess this movie is. I've been unable to keep my mouth closed, and my hands are literally shaking. am I being too dramatic?no, because Jordan Peele has made a masterpiece that has transcended the limits of what horror is, and what it should be. it's pointless comparing this film to Get Out, because they're literally on two ends of the genre spectrum. Us may feature black leads, but it's no commentary on racism, nor is it a satire of society. this is a pure, unequivocal, spine-chilling horror film. it is filled with jump scares, unrealistic coincidences, and cheesy what's-behind-the-door sequences. but Peele is masterful in the way he uses these tropes, presenting them in a fresh way that I've just never seen before.at first, the film feels very slow. it feels like nothing is going to happen. it's funny - maybe too funny. but when it picks up, it goes all the way there, until the very last scene, leaving you no room to breathe, nowhere to turn, nowhere to look. the score is breathtaking. it has this chocking effect that is hard to describe. Michael Abels' work here is even more eerie than his score for Get Out.and don't get me started on Lupita. you can play Toni Collette's Hereditary dinner table scene on loop forever and cry over her snub, but Lupita is on another level in this, especially when playing the doppelgänger. Evan Alex is also surprisingly good, and Shahadi Wright Joseph takes it even further. oh, and Elisabeth Moss? yes.see, your regular horror film is filled with demons, dolls, and an abandoned house. but it's also filled with white people. and although Us probably foreshadows a lot of things, it feels really nice to see black people front and centre in a horror film that is not about race. it's nice to see black people open the door you know they shouldn't. it's nice to see black people scream. catch this in theatres, right now. don't wait another second. but, be careful - Us may not make you scream nor pee your pants. but I promise you, it'll leave you restless, with a pounding in your chest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Same Missteps as ""Get Out""","Jordan Peele's follow up to ""Get Out"" recreates both much of what worked about that earlier film and the missteps that ultimately made it less than satisfying.""Us"" ratchets up the tension nicely as it introduces us to a loving family on vacation in a cabin in the woods. It then explodes into an invigorating blend of visceral horror and very funny comedy as that family is attacked by a group of doppelgangers bent on doing them harm for unknown reasons. But as the film draws to its obtuse conclusion, Peele feels the need to over explain, and the creepy mystery at the film's center instead turns into awkward and literal plot exposition. How much more satisfying everything might have been if left unexplained.Still, most of this film is wildly entertaining, and Peele is one director who makes films that feel completely plugged into our troubled times. He really does have a unique style, and both ""Get Out"" and ""Us"" bear the stamp of a formidable originality. It's just his storytelling that needs some work.The acting in this movie is fantastic, especially by Lupita Nyong'o, who's fierce in a double role as the mom and the mom's frightening twin.

"""I have the highest kill count in the family""","And that's about the only ""joke"" in the movie that made me smile for a moment. ""Us"" definitely did not aim at a horror comedy, and for a serious horror it is too frivolous. Technically well-done, it has some very nice cadres, good atmosphere, and the performances of the leading four, and especially Lupita, are on a high level. I won't go into the story itself, because even a brief summary would be a spoiler. The idea is original and very interesting, but it seems that they have not thought it through to the end. The film starts slowly and gradually introduces the characters and the plot, and builds up the atmosphere. Everything indicates excellent horror. But when the mystery begins to unfold, it does it quite amateurish. There are holes and illogicalities, and some moments are plain stupid. The final twist is good, but although it is not predictable from the start, you will anticipate it just enough before it happens to spoil the surprise effect. Although the premise is so bloodcurdling that it itself should send shivers down your spine, the movie simply isn't scary. To me, it felt like six out of ten, but I have to raise it, at least slightly, above the stupid slashers of the eighties.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Solid and interesting thriller,"'Us' is the second film from Jordan Peele, after 'Get Out', and is similarly a psychological thriller, with moments of violence thrown in. It takes a little while to set everything up and provide some backstory (& rabbits!?), but then the doppelgangers show up and the film turns into a home invasion/survival film. The main cast - Mum Adelaide ( Nyong'o), Dad Gabe (Duke), Daughter Zora (Joseph) and Son Jason (Alex) - are all great and clearly have a lot of fun playing their dual roles.Josh (Heidecker) and Kitty (Moss) also have significant supporting roles, but it really comes down to how the family of four handles their terrible situation. No spoilers, but Peele does well with building tension, using a creepy girls-choir score, colour motifs and flashbacks. It's not a typical horror film, but it certainly has scary moments.There's an almost Shyamalan-like twist at the end, but the whole thing's probably 15min too long and runs out of steam a bit.

In my opinion, you simply have to read it as an allegory. And if you do so, you may, like I, find that it has a cornucopia of food for thought. In most ways, this is almost as good as Get Out, Jordan Peele's directorial debut. We again have actors delivering incredible performances as creepy, off putting ""not quite okay"" types. A lot of the cast here actually have to play both regular versions, and their sinister, cruel counterparts, and they are all incredible. In some ways this is like a zombie movie, and in others, a slasher. It's delightfully subversive, playing with cliches and tropes. You never know exactly what is going to happen.

Plot incoherence is used to fuel deeper allegory,"If you need your horror or sci-fi to have a pretty straight forward plot that can readily be explained from point A to point B, even if the viewer needs to reshuffle the pieces a bit, this film will annoy you. There are some fairly large questions that are left unanswered. Moreover, I don't think there is any way to truly piece the film together entirely. The plot is frayed at the ends. Personally, I don't have a problem with this largely because I think it opens the film up to have many things read into it.The central metaphor and allegory seems readily open to discuss the following topics: racism, classism, trauma/mental health, American tendency to try to gloss over the past and/or the current ugly social conditions, parenting styles (!), the divided self and how divide the US currently is. This ambiguity in subtext is maddening in the way good puzzles are. I suspect there really isn't one definitive answer but several plausible ones. The writing is crisp enough that this seems intentional. Regardless of the question of deeper meaning the characters are utterly engaging and the surface plotting (i.e the gags) is great. Horror characters are often extremely stupid people. Peele has a knack for writing them so they don't seem stupid and the vast majority of the behavior is reasonable. I will also warn that there is a pretty big ""twist"" that seems obvious to me. (I guess it within 10 minutes) While I found this added to the tension others might get annoyed by that.The 2nd act of the film is utterly intense and Peele's direction is remarkably sure handed. I am sure there is a mirror beat in the 2nd act for every development in the 1st and 3rd act. It adds to the overall unnerving effect of the film. Peele mixes comedy, horror and dark humor with ease and the middle hour is more creepy and messed up than Get Out. (I consider this film slightly better than Get Out). If nothing else horror junkies will love the 2nd act.The acting is very good but Lupita Nyong'o gives the first truly striking performance of the year. So much of the film depends on how you perceive each of the two characters she plays. She nails the terror and the horror. She nails the duality of humanity. She carries this film entirely and utterly elevates the material. I think she is better here than in 12 Years a Slave.

"Terrifying, Funny, and Thought-provoking","Us is the new horror horror film directed by Jordan Peele and stars Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Evan Alex as a family who was attacked by their doppelgängers.Like Peele's previous debut film Get Out, it's a blend of horror and comedy with some political themes. But on the contrary, Us is more of a pure horror film than the director's debut. But it doesn't mean that it's a bad film.Us creates the tension well while also including comedic scenes. Winston Duke as Gabe, the father of the family, is initially portrayed as a comedic relief but became a well rounded character throughout the story, as with everyone else.The story creates a unique sense of what the family, and the world will do if we are facing the ones we can't, which is ourselves. The characters in the film decide what they would in real life, with real dread and fear. Each character uses their own abilities and advantages to go against their doppelgängers. As the plot unfolds, the exposition may be a drag but what comes next is very mind blowing as the film comes to an end.Get Out is a more satirical film while Us is a pure horror film with a theme that may be timely depending on the people's future. Other than that, it's still a great horror film for horror fans and movie fans alike.

Their expression and gestures are not so different from Jordan previous film, Get Out. Unlikely Get Out, this movie had some jokes, well at some point this movie can make you laugh while getting scared. The performance of Lupita is so impressive, she's playing two different characters. Adelaide is a protective mother of two children and Red is a lunatic person.From the beginning to an end, it shows us a lot of foreshadowing and getting more complicated also appalling. It's been a hell of a ride and insanely good. The story does an outstanding job of building up the tension for the story and building the character developments. There are a lot of symbolism and meanings throughout this film, like Rabbits and Scissors. The script of Us is so structured and detailed, but still a lot of plotholes and some logical issues.The sound editing and music of this movie is so terrifying and creepy, and make this movie even more perfect! Bravo, Michael Abels! The cinematography of this movie is the next level, there are a lot of stunning and intense shots in this movie that I can't wait to share. This movie is well-edited with the shots, the story, as well as the pacing.This movie will make you think deeper not only a minutes after watching this but also the next day. Overall, Us is an amazing movie that different from any kind of Horror Thriller movie and Jordan Peele is a hell of a genius. Totally recommended and worth a watch for a thousand times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

What the f* did I just not watched?,"I rarely review anything. On the other hand I really enjoy watching movies (especially horrors).

I went through many bad and great disappointments. There are movies that stroke me from the beginning and the ones that grew up slowly on me.
This one (Us) is another lesson of how not to trust any of the reviews. I have no idea how this title could score such a tempting and inaccurate ratting. This movie has no tension, not even a trace trace of a captivating plot. It' boring, dull and offensive to the imagination.

An incredible concept that is slightly let down,"There are two things which this film does exceptionally in my opinion - firstly, is the concept itself as there is nothing scarier then people who look like you trying to kill you. Secondly, the comedy in this film is really well done and all the actors in this film possess an excellent delivery or the writing allows them to deliver comedic lines perfectly. The negative to this film is how ridiculous some of it is and it becomes slightly silly after a while - this lets it down as up until the second half the comedy is well done and balances the horror nicely. The second half seems to force the comedy more and the horror itself becomes fantastical leaving the viewer not worrying for the characters' welfare or particularly enjoying the humour.

"Despite a predictable twist, Peele still delivers","Jordan Peele has already proven his directing and writing abilities with 2017's horror breakout 'Get Out.' If he really wanted, he could have sold his director's chair and retired to a private Caribbean island having left a lasting legacy on the genre. But that would be a waste of talent.In 'Us,' Peele returns to a story that becomes increasingly unsettling and sinister the longer it goes on, and the formula once again works. As the Wilson family embarks on a beach vacation to Santa Cruz, old secrets begin to emerge that threaten not only the family of four, but society as a whole. Led by Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke and supported by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex, we get to see a lot of stalking from shadowy strangers to harrowing escapes via car and boat. It's not your typical horror film - there's plenty of action built into it, and it's actually well done. Even smaller-scale appearances from Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker do not go wasted in 'Us.'But the best aspect of the film is without a doubt the underlying current of psychological fear throughout. Regardless of how things unfold and build, 'Us' never loses its edge, even though the major plot twist can be seen from a mile away. It may not be quite as groundbreaking as 'Get Out,' but it's not fair to compare the two - 'Us' should be viewed as its own film.Whatever you think of 'Us,' it's clear audiences will wait eagerly for the next offering from Peele.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Extremely Original Horror/Comedy,"""Us"" is the best horror movie I've seen in several years. It rides the line between horror/thriller and comedy effortlessly. The packed theater I was in was going back and forth between laughing, silence and screaming within the same scene. Lupita N'yongo's performance is just insane - literally feels like two completely different people. All the other acting is amazing as well, especially Winston Duke and Elizabeth Moss. But the true star of the film is Jordan Peele. Even though he won the Best Original Screenply Oscar for Get Out, I think this script is far superior. The character building, the world building, the plot structure and the dialogue is so well thought out and creative. But the true impressive feat here is the directing by Jordan Peele. The cinematography, lighting and direction of actors is absolutely incredible and adds such a unique and unsettling atmosphere. There is also much more under the surface than there appears to be.

Social horror,"Jordan Peele's sophomore film consolidates his captivating mixture of socially-conscious black humor and eccentric horror infused-thriller.

It's an intriguing and ambitious concept, but it felt at times like the film lacked the subtlety and sophistication to pull it off. As a horror flick, it's constantly entertaining and well structured, but at the same time, I couldn't help noticing the sudden bumps into shameless B-movie camp.It also looked like Peele insisted on leaving too many hints, visual cues and explanations to make sure that his message is going through (we got it, rich people are dumb!!).

Worth a watch for genuine horror,"This film rolls out a little differently to Get Out (which probably set the level of expectations for most viewers), I found Get Out to be more of a thriller that created an air of suspense and sat with you, and while Us still has those lingering moments; it's got a little bit more attack a lot earlier into the film. Get Out sort of had the more horror-esque moments closer to the end while Us gets that started earlier.If you are expecting Get Out levels of performance, creativity and direction; then you're in luck, because it is just as phenomenal in those required areas, there is also well-placed comedy to be found in it, just as there was in Get Out.I also have to say; it's been a while since I've genuinely been scared by a horror movie, probably not since the 70s, but this film really has some well-shot terrifying moments, I don't want to spoil but something happened in the introduction that just had me on the edge of my seat in fear, it was such a well-shot scene, looking at the same scene broken down from behind the scenes; it wasn't as remotely impactful but in the film it definitely goes up there with some of the best classic horror scenes of all time à la The Shining (that wasn't an intentional reference to the Key and Peele show but I'll take it).That's really one thing I love about this film; Jordan Peele understands how to create genuine horror without relying on Jumpscares or gore (though there is still gore to be had in this film), something that's inventive and not at all formulaic and very unpredictable, makes you feel genuine fear like something's not right with the picture.Also want to give a hand to all of the actors involved; not only because of the quality of their perfomances, but also because they technically had to play two people simultaneously.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Good Follow up to 'Get Out',"First off, this film is not that scary but the tension is high for most of the two hours. The words that I would use to describe this film are 'interesting' and 'creepy'. Lupita Nyong'o is especially brilliant as the protagonist of this horror, backed by a talented Winston Duke and a well rounded ensemble.
From my interpretation, this film explores ideas of duality and rivalry. What I mean by this is how we define an enemy, is it a part of ourselves? Or is it when you see the negatives of yourself in another? Jordan Peele (the director) does a great job of making us question these ideas.
I do enjoy how bits of comedy are interwoven nicely throughout this film, rather than feeling forced, the comedy feels natural, mostly at the hands of Duke.
Nevertheless, I was not a huge fan of the 1 hour 15 mins - 1 hour 35 mark. Whilst it was not particularly bad, I felt that parts of it were out of place and the tone of the film at this point was off.
On top of this, some of the logistics of the film don't add up, this is never a major deal in the movie but it does bug me, a bit, personally.
To conclude, 'Us' is a good horror/ thriller, whilst not terrifying, it is intense and explores new ideas that are ambitious and for the most part, pay off.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Tonal mess,"Nice premise, great start, a good attempt at building a sinister atmosphere, yeah, up to around 40 minutes. Then the movie shifts towards slasher comedy, providing a couple of genuine good laughs here and there, but in the long run, it just kills its own atmosphere. It slowly starts making less sense up to a point when it becomes clear that there is no way this plot can hold up or have a somewhat satisfying resolution.At around 1 hr mark the movie slows down and really starts to drag. At this point, you're just waiting to be disappointed and forget about it. The ending doesn't make any sense at all. The twist was so lame and predictable I was actually surprised they still went for it and it barely really changed anything.I guess the ending was supposed to provide social commentary about how community and environment make you what you are, about people's shadows being their dark sides (there are even a couple of creative shots). Even so, this was done in a very simplistic manner and in the end didn't matter much. I mean, I can come up with some ideas on what they were trying to tell, but the movie feels more like the writers cornered themselves and just came up with whatever stuff that first got into their heads.I enjoyed the first act though, nice music, fewer jump scares. The acting ranged from really good (Elisabeth Moss was amazing) and misdirected/confused (Evan Alex can't act scared at all).I think I'd still recommend this movie since it had some good scenes sprinkled throughout the movie, some good acting, two or three misplaced but actually funny jokes, even some tension. Well, at least I can surely recommend the first 40-50 minutes, after that you can just stick around and witness the nonsensical ending yourself :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Peele doesn't dodge the sophomore slump,"Well this was a massive letdown. I'll do my best to avoid any spoilers, but I need to vent a bit haha. Us was such an infuriating movie for me. It was one of my most anticipated films of the year, and I wanted so badly to love it, but it was so frustrating and dissapointing I couldn't believe it. It definitely was not all that it should have been. The setup in the first third was amazing, and even afterwards there were bits of brilliance sprinkled throughout as well as a lot of genuinely funny sequences and lines (Peele's talent is undeniable, and his roots in comedy are easy to recognize). However, (mild spoilers) from the moment the tethered sat down with the family in the living room, and Lupita Nyongo's doppleganger started talking in that stupid af voice, the movie took a sharp turn for the nonsensical and stupid from which it was never really able to recover. The ending was all kinds of bad and seemed determined to make no sense whatsoever. The twist was obvious from the first scene (which maybe was intentional but probably not) and was actually super poorly handled and then beat over our heads. In fact, at times it honestly felt like Peele thought the audience was stupid.That said, I'll give some credit where it's due, this film is much more interesting than most typical mainstream horror films we get these days. It's also far more ambitious and undeniably original (though it still does fall back on cliches now and then). Peele is exploring some very clever ideas, but unfortunately they are never paid off in any satisfying way. It seems to be trying to say something about class warfare and the United States, as well as the mistake of not pursuing one's dreams, but the messages/takeaways never become even remotely clear. They're quickly abandoned in any case for what turns into a mostly rudimentary survival thriller (with much better than average comedy). It utterly fails at being either a horror film or a sci-fi film, as it's not scary and the sci-fi elements are laughably contrived and mishandled. With that said, even though the film isn't as accomplished as it should be, it still might have worked, or at least been more effective, if Peele had either explained more to the audience or made things much more ambiguous. As it stands, the plausibility of the several of the key reveals that shape the foundation of the story don't hold up for a second, and as a result the whole movie ends up failing in a big way because you can no longer take the premise seriously. Even worse, the few throwaway lines that do attempt to explain away some of these issues feel like afterthoughts, and instead of providing compelling answers they really only make things more confusing and less believable. This really hurts the film because we are expected to just accept them and move on but they're much too distracting and ultimately ruin an otherwise engaging and exceptionally well crafted movie.All in all, Us was a major let down and I can't say that I enjoyed it. However, while Peele's reach clearly exceeded his grasp on this one, I'll still be first in line for his next movie because I honestly really liked Get Out (seriously, Get Out was amazing, borderline flawless. I can't believe he immediately went on to make this).Even with the flaws of Us, Peele continues to show a ton of promise as a horror filmmaker, and since horror is my favorite genre and I admittedly think he's a chill guy and have been a big fan of his since his Comedy Central days, I'm being honest when I say I would actually love to see him succeed at making solid horror movies for decades.Maybe he really could be this generation's Hitchcock. Time will tell. Unfortunately, the chance of that may be diminished by the perplexing and overwhelmingly positive response to this movie, as it seems to have a seriously bad case of the emperor's new clothes going on. I'm hoping the hype dies down around this film and people start seeing it for what it is, a well intentioned misfire littered with pacing and structural issues and a bunch of underdeveloped ideas that have no payoff. Though with the tidal wave of praise and positive validation Us is recieving, I worry Peele won't feel the need to course correct at all and won't learn from any of his mistakes. Let's hope this isn't the case and his next film is a return to form.6.5/10(Get Out was an easy 9/10 for me).",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Crazy ride,"A creative synopsis and a fine yet not flawless execution. The film is a crazy ride, that is for sure and one ride that offers its audience many great twists and turns. The film has many good aspects, some great and some so-so. The great of all aspects is for sure the performance of Lupita Nyong'o. What a tour de force performance... and I am talking Toni Collette ""Hereditary"" - tour de force. A fantastic turn in her double role. First the traumatized mother on the one hurt and then her crazy ""twin"" where she is so fantastically freaky and gives you constantly an uncomfortable feeling. I haven't seen many 2019 films yet and this is hands down the best performance of the year so far.
I also liked Winston Duke who brought a lot of self irony to his role.
The kids were also truly great. Jordan Peele had a great idea but I think towards the end he lost a little bit the route to the conclusion. Because the explanation for the happening is rather a bit poor-is. But that is the only flaw I found with this film. Generally it a very scary movie that often brings you on the edge of your seat... also the score and especially soundtrack is fantastic. Not sure if I love or hate the final twist, I saw it coming but still feels that it causes some story holes ... however I will look closer on my second view. What I really dogged was the self irony Jordan Peele from time to time brought to it. Really a good film. Entertaining for sure and the characters are very likable (well.. some of them ;-) )",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Waste of time and money!,"The first 20 minutes are solid. Great atmosphere with good potential to grow into something interesting and scary. Unfortunately, after that, everything became stupid, irritating and time from time very tiring, but not scary at all. For me, this is a kind of director who has no vision or style to make an excellent horror that will keep us tense from beginning to end. The same problem he has with his earlier movie Get Out.

"Good for some fun, think the purge but not as good","The story has a lot of potential, but is very underdeveloped, it leaves more questions than answers and not in the good thought provoking way.

In typical ""horror"" movie fashion there are too many plotholes and ""don't go down there"" moments. The most annoying part is Lupitas inability to move a table!

A sore dissapointment,"""And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together."" - Samuel I 11:11Seeing the trailer got my hopes up to no end, incepted my mind with theories and expectations on how Writer\Director Jordan Peele would re-imagine the Doppleganger trope that was his inspiration from TwilightZone 1x21.
The movie played it's concept well in matters of characters, musical setting, and the visual themes involving duality in both scissors and bunny ears (as well as the whole hands around america paper-men being cut by scissors)
the creepyness vibe was highlighted in the third act when the protagonist entered the secret passage of madness beneath the surface...
...down the rabbit hole.and that's when it went down the toiletsuddenly the movie went from the unexplained to the soft SciFi boring-mystery of faux-conspiracy that has made no sense in either writing, theory, execution, alternative world-building and hypothetical situations.while the previous cinematic work of Get Out (2017) was worthy of praise for it's surprisingly intriguing psychological thriller aspect that subverted contemporary ideas of racism and privilege... US (2019) destroys it's own premise by trying to explain itin interviews, Peele wanted this movie to act as an allegory to the idea of privilege, and thus certain leaps of logic were used as bridges for the flow of story-line that ends with a twist so moronic that it almost seemed like it was conjured during a bathroom break.overall, this movie is wonderful as a horror movie, capable of causing a chill when not being taken with the same seriousness of Get Out (2017), and with that, the social commentary it was intended to explore fails miserably, as a worthless sacrifice on an altar that prefers substance over flavor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A Dark, Intelligent Thriller","I understand why some people gave this movie a low score, but I personally loved it. It's not a straightforward movie, and some parts are ambiguous-which was certainly done on purpose-so if you don't want to watch a movie where you really have to think about, this isn't for you. This movie is chock full of symbolism, mostly subtle, about marganilization and the people who are more or less forgotten or treated differently by society. This movie has gotten a lot of flack on here for having plot holes and a somewhat confusing ending, but if you read up on some of the symbolism Jordan Peele used, a lot of that starts to make more sense. Personally, the ending made sense to me though I didn't see it coming. I thought the gory scenes were well-done and not over the top like so many horror movies before it. Also, I know there was an outcry over how one of the characters speaks, but if you actually watch the movie it makes sense.

What kind of crap is this...?,"Ok, so Jordan Peele directed 'Get Out', which caused quite a stir among critics. He is back with 'Us'. I remember not wanting to watch 'Get Out' but eventually decided to see it due to the media hype. It was better than expected, but nothing special.Again, due to the media hype and box office success, I decided to watch 'Us', a film I wasn't particularly interested in seeing. There are very few films I can't sit through until the end, even if they are bad. 'Us' is one of those rare films I simply couldn't handle any more, and finally hit the eject button.The film seriously suffers from lack of intelligent dialogue. In fact, the dialogue is incredibly standard - below standard even. And then there's annoying diaoluge like "" The first 35 minutes were incredibly boring. When things started going wrong, the film wasn't scary because the acting was so comedic. (Not sure whether this was the intention or whether the actors were just bad).

I feel like people who left the theater feeling confused went in with a mindset that the movie was going to be straight forward but it's not. This is a layered psychological thriller. It's not simply about a family being terrorized by their clones. It's about social issues like discrimination and being fearful of something that's no different than you. I will say that I have questions about minor details but knowing the answers to my questions still wouldn't change the message in the movie. We as a society are used to horror films like ""Scream"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Texas Chainsaw""...where there's a killer and a victim and that's the movie but in the movie ""Us"", you have no clarity on who to root for and that complexity is what I find brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great second film by Jordan Peele that just confirms his talent in filmmaking.,"When I saw first reviews on ""Us"", I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it or not, mostly because the reactions were a little more divisive as opposed to Jordan Peele's debut. Thankfully, it was the former in my case.One of ""Us'"" biggest strengths is without a doubt the acting. Most of the performances are good, but Lupita Nyong'o definitely shines the most. For the majority of the first act she does a very solid job, but once the more emotional and disturbing scenes come in, she alone makes those scenes that much more tense. All of the main characters are likable and well-written, which is something I especially appreciate in horror films.The soundtrack made for this film is incredible. It captures the tone of the scene very well for the most part, which adds a lot to the overall feeling of the film. Michael Abels might just be another rising talent in the music department and I hope to hear more great stuff from him.The cinematography is solid, it was easy enough to follow up what was going on for throughout the film's runtime. Overall it was just another very well executed aspect of ""Us"".Like ""Get Out"", ""Us"" has its own social commentary and message it wants to say, which I definitely enjoyed, which can be interpreted in more than one way.There are only a few aspects in the film where I'm sort of torn in-between. One of them is the humour and comic relief. The comedy sometimes landed and was appropriate, and sometimes it seemed distracting and wasn't all that fitting. I would personally prefer if that comedy wasn't there in those cases, since it was ruining the scary aspect by quite a bit.Lastly, the ending is arguably the main reason why this film got such polarizing responses. It very much depends on how one interprets the whole story after the credits roll. For me personally though, the ending makes sense, even if the more ambiguous approach would work a little better in my opinion.Overall, ""Us"" is a great, well-made second film by Jordan Peele, that is worth the watch just for the acting, score and its social commentary alone, which already puts it above the majority of modern non-arthouse horror films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
As creepy as you'd hope,"When I think of the ""horror, thriller"" genre, I think of something unsettling, but too many movies today are missing atmosphere. This movie had it.
I feel like the ""subtle social commentary"" detracted from the creep factor by making it preachy, but luckily it's easy to overlook - or some people like that sort of thing, so either way it works. Throughout the film many scenes left me genuinely disturbed but in a thoroughly entertaining way and the overall concept is unique and thought provoking.

"Horror gem with sci-fi undertone, for some reason overlooked","This movie improves on its predecessor in most ways. It has a brilliant plot, more coherently put together and more pervasive. It is complex, and that word is often used to describe pretentious movies imo, but it's not the case here. I can only suppose that Get Out was more praised because of the novelty factor and because of the simpler plotline, but mainly due to the lobby, since Us doesn't address racism specifically.

Finally a horror movie I like!,"I saw the reviews here, and there were almost nothing but one star reviews..But I'm glad I saw it!I liked it from start til finish!
And for once, I was ""scared"" by not knowing what would happen, in stead of waiting for the next bloodbath or the next starteling moment when someone jumps out of the shadows. This had a little of both, but not just for the sake of scaring. There was a point to it.. In my opinion.A lot of things about it, was intriguing to me! But it almost all lies in the symbolisme of it.
I also liked the fact that it was a black family, and not another white-white movie! (I LOVE the poster with the girl! Both parts beautiful and ""scary"").
I liked that the hole movie seemed a bit different to the usual horrorflick..
I loved the filming of it, too.. And again the symbolism!I am not the big horror fan. I don't get blood gallore and starteling just for the sake of starteling.. To me that is just uninteresting!
But at the same time, I am drawn to the genre, but is often just disappointed.
I like the phycological horror/thrillers, over pure non sensical violence. And I am not into the hole monster horror themes..So this, to me, was different and gave me the things I like in horror: having to think about it!
I can't help thinking that the bad reviews is more that some people are not used to thinking for them selves.. Everything has to make sense EXACTLY as it is shown. Nothing underneath. Just pure violence and pure evil!
To me that is boring and uninspiring.I saw a lot of people saying the logic had failed.. To that I just want to say: zombies??People love zombies, the upside down and so on, but THIS is ilogical?
I don't think it lacks logic! I think the difference is, that American shows and movies have a tradition of overexplaining and overfeeling on your behaf, so you never really think for your self.
And I do think, if you don't like to think about symbolisme, and don't like to think about the themes in this movie.. Well then it must feel kind of empty (I guess).However, I don't think it's illogical.l, and I don't think it's empty! Things made sense to me!
I didn't even hate the ending!
To be fair I did have some questions about some things happening.. I understand that not everything does make sense. But they could make sense, even though we don't get them fully explained. I didn't have a problem with I understanding them, at least. Everything in the movie makes just as much sense to me, as zombies and monsters does to others.. I have no problem accepting the terms here..The ending: I thought I would, as I often do: get disappointed about the ending. It WAS a little bit explanatory, but not more than it made sense to me, still.I think that to really get all the symbolism and the understanding of the movie, you should probably watch it more than once.. At least that's how I feel! I am gonna watch it again to get more into the underlaying meanings.I think all the one stars are extremely unfair!!

"Don't think, just enjoy it","'Us' is the second film written and directed by Jordan Peele (the first being the awesomely-creepy 'Get Out') and I was pretty interested by what I'd heard online about his new film. A family goes on vacation, only to get stalked and attacked by an identical family - in every way!I was going to see it no matter what, but I never got round to watching it in the cinema. However, from various online sources, not only did I get the impression that it was one of those films that people either absolutely loved or really despised, but also I basically learned the entire plot - practically beat for beat. So, by the time it came for me to watch it on the small screen, I knew everything that was going to happen, including the overall premise as to what was occurring in this unsettling world I was witnessing.However, even though I'd deliberately removed all forms of 'mystique' from what was going on in the film, I still enjoyed it. Even though I sound like a bit of a hypocrite, I would recommend NOT finding too much about the plot before watching it. I've already given the briefest of synopsis and that should be all you'll need.'Us' is a bit of a 'mish-mash' of genres. Overall it's a horror and, if you're looking into more of a 'sub-genre,' you could call it a 'home invasion' movie. However, this 'sub-genre' then changes into yet more variants of the overall horror theme.The main cast are all believable as a unit and play off each other nicely and you won't question that these are a group of people who have lived (and put up with!) each other for many years.What I liked about the film was the premise. Yes, it borrows from many sources, but the overall theme of what was really happening was original enough for me to really appreciate as something new and not a topic that had been done before (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!). Of course it's not perfect. One of the main reasons I saw people online saying it was far inferior to 'Get Out' was its lack of answers to some questions.Like I say, the plot is pretty original, but with it brings many things you could ask yourself about how this all came to be. The film doesn't offer any answers and you could well not come up with any feasible ones yourself if you ponder too long on it.However, almost all films require a certain element of 'suspension of disbelief' when it comes to enjoying them. For any horror fan out there who wants something a little different, just make sure you're in a forgiving mood and settle in for a really creepy premise which is well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Like a bad dream...in a good way.,"Jordan Peele's sophomore outing really stunned me, especially as I wasn't the biggest fan of Get Out, and thought the symbolism was really heavy-handed. However by adding just a dash of ambiguity ""Us"" really shines as a surreal, but still very scary experience. I've seen a lot of people picking the plot apart on here, and this just isn't that kind of movie, nothing here is all that logical, but that's not the point. The film has a great nightmarish atmosphere that fits perfectly with the strangeness of the story. Grading a horror film really comes down to one thing: Did it scare me? It did. There's a scene early on the film that made me gasp out ""Oh my god"" and cup a hand over my mouth.

It may not make sense at times, but this movie is still a terrifying ride that's worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Amazing addition to the horror genre,"Us is another notch in Jordan Peele's belt in regards to being a horror movie master. I know he only has two movies but there are very few writer directors in the genre that accomplished two effective movies back to back. As a matter of fact, his second film, although undoubtedly won't garner the attention that his first did, could be a more successful installment within the horror genre. Both films are laced with social commentary but unlike Get Out, Us doesn't depend on it in order for it to be impactful.For example, if the lead character in Get Out was white then the thriller would have been a bit common and cliched. Us ,on the other hand, is just as good of a horror film without the social commentary. The scares are unique and well developed. The details are even better. Most horror films, especially modern American ones, forget about sound or language. Peele uses it to his advantage. Not only is the soundtrack and score placed perfectly, the use of the human voice is perfected. The main villains voice is truely horrific. The growls and grunts that come from the little evil boy is masterful. The mute yells from the fathers doppelgänger was primal and bone chilling.In addition to sound, the story was well written and well paced. The intensity increases as the scope of the film increased. I seriously thought the film was going to be more insulated, ie, the home invasion type,but when I realized it was going to be more, I was pleasantly surprised. The twist is minor compared to the final conflict. The reveal is well delivered but once again minor compared to the horror of the imagery and then there is the social commentary. Like I said, to me it's minor, but Jordan Peele does really know how to interweave complex topics like race and social class with horror. It's not done as well as movies like, The Babadook, The Planet of the Apes or Rosemary's Baby, but it's still intriguing and fits well within the jumps and scares.The only negatives I have with this film is the cinematography and the use of comedy. The first quarter of the film uses lighting and color to its advantage but once the scares leaves the first house, it becomes secondary. Also the use of daylight was wasted. I love films that make use of daylight as a scare tactic. Peele didn't do a good job here. Everything is too bright and would've been better if it was shot near dawn. Also unlike Get out, where the comedy fit, this time it didn't make sense at all. Why would a family who just had to fight for their lives sit around a table and crack jokes????Other than those small things, this is another horror masterpiece. I'm so happy that the horror genre is getting the respect it deserves and even more happy that a it was delivered by an African American writer, director.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR SECONDS...!,"Jordan Peele's much anticipated follow-up to his Oscar winning smash is a bit of a sophomore slump which is a shame given the fact a recent Rolling Stone article had him detailing how he watched other filmmakers second string outings to avoid the case but unfortunately his over-reliance on a world encompassing narrative falls short due to logistical problems & issues of character motivations which in total seem harebrained rather than organic in execution. Its 1986 & an African American family are at the boardwalk when the daughter decides to do some exploring finding herself in a house of mirrors where she encounters a doppelganger of herself which leaves her traumatized & unable to speak. Flash forward 30 years, the girl is now a grown woman w/a family unit of her own (hubby & 2 kids, a boy & girl) out on a vacation which finds them (you guessed it!) back on the same beach from years before which leads to series of events where twins of themselves appear to wreck havoc on the world at large & our family has to step up to meet this existential wrinkle to their very being. And this for me is where the film starts to fall apart where the lookalikes, who are imposing their will to survive over their originals, impart a murderous spree upon the populace but the motivations (especially after we find out who the defacto leader is) become specious & crudely drawn. When the film sticks to its chamber horror conventions (the 1 family being terrorized by their 1 set of duplicates) it works but when we see the global implications of the ending (ala The Birds) the ambiguous ending seems ill thought out & hard to swallow but seeing this movie will make its money back (it made $70 mil in its opening week & debuted at number 1) hopefully the filmmakers will use that knowledge to improve their next effort (storywise) instead of wallowing in the land of easy expectations & quick profits.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A layered, crowd pleasing horror-thriller","In Jordon Peele's Us, the writer/director gives one of the strongest follow-ups to a revered directorial debut in recent years. Although it will take at least one more viewing for me to fully solidify my thoughts on Us, it's safe to say that I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to getting to see it again. What stood out to me most after my first viewing is how talented a director Peele is; the man clearly knows how to make every frame pop and add layers to his intricately constructed world. Peele's use of reflections and color was the most impressive to me, although I'm sure more will become clear on subsequent viewings. In addition to Peele's talent behind the camera, the actors in front of it also bring their A-game. Not surprisingly Lupita N'yongo is doing tremendous work as both Adelaide and Red, but Winston Duke definitely stole the show as the quippy husband/father. In general, the entire cast is praiseworthy as they each are playing two characters, that move and talk completely differently from their counterpart. It speaks to how well-acted and cleverly-shot this movie is that at no point could I tell when it was the main actor on screen versus their body double. The only place where I can really take issue with this movie is with some elements of the screenplay. At points I felt like Peele was actually telling the audience too much, instead of letting them draw their own conclusions. Coming off of such a tightly-written screenplay with Get Out, the seams of the story in Us are a bit more noticeable, however, at the end of day, it's still a better written horror movie than most. Speaking of the moments of horror, from the beginning it's clear that Peele didn't want to make this movie be about the jump scares but rather about atmosphere and tension, and in my opinion I think he succeeded. Us isn't terrifying, but at no point did I feel like I was supposed to be feeling terror, just a building sense of unease and at times panic. In general, I strongly recommend seeing Us, especially in theaters, because this is a film meant to be seen with an audience. Jordan Peele has proved that Get Out was no fluke and he has met the incredibly high bar he set for himself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Get out! Get out!,"Once again Jordan Peele makes a movie that feels like an extened version of a sketch from Key and Peele. A little more flushed out but not as funny. More creepy and horrifying, but a little too artistic. I never quite got what was going on.
But I loved Lupita and Winston Duke in it.
Very strange follow up, but I like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Did we all miss that this is a parody?,"I get the feeling that this movie is a parody. First hint: Jordan Peele is the director. But to be honest, that was not the reason for me to think that. All of the characters are exaggerated. Gabe stays in the real world, no matter how crazy things get and this stays consistent until the end of the movie.I am pretty certain that this is supposed to be some sort of weird comedy. I couldn't take it seriously, almost nobody in the comments thought it was scary, the weird way things seem to resolve in some way? I am almost sure that this is somewhere in between satire and parody and most people just failed to notice :)No rating, intentionally, because the genre of the movie highly affects my rating :)",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Could've been better, but overall a good movie.","The concept of this movie is so interesting. It unfolds like a classic Twilight Zone episode and flows wonderfully between horror and humor. My only real criticism is that Peele clearly went for artistic ambiguity in some details toward the end that needed a deeper explanation, but throughout the film he payed attention to so many minute details that it makes the film worth watching again just to see what clues or nuances you may have missed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
rabbits and ballerina,"I quite like the director, Jordan Peele and his first film, the last one and hoped that it would be better. With this I thought was really good at the start, indeed for about half way. It was interesting and thrilling, and Elisabeth Moss was really good and I loved her mirror and lipstick routine but then when she was gone and it rather got a bit silly. Not just a little silly I'm afraid it was even so although there is some decent shots but it began to get rather too crazy. At the end it gets even more so and pretentious as well. I won't mention the rabbits and the ballerina is probably just as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It turns out a lot better than I expected,"To be honest after ""get out"", i did not expect much from Jordan Peele but this movie he actually did really well, it still has some flaws but overall still very good",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pop-horror: neither good nor bad,"So many reasons why I would call this ""pop-horror"". It's a 14A movie, but purely because of the blood. It tries to be funny but fails, and is funny when it's supposed to be serious. Nothing is really horrific, but the industry deems it a horror movie which proves once more how the industry knows nothing.Frankly, I'm scratching my head trying to find something to say about this. The experience left me empty in the wrong sense: I came in expecting nothing and came out...dry. Just like Get Out, Peele's previous and slightly more accomplished movie, the ending ruins it all. This is a serious problem for Peele: he comes from the entertainment circle with comedians and funny people... and he just can't seem to follow a good horror thread until the credits roll.Conceptually, Peele has some merits. He is undeniably creative and original, but he lacks the proper instruments to correctly weave his ideas into a cohesive story, which is a shame. He is still relevant as an african-american author, as his films dive deep into american psyche towards race. But, once again, his nice ideas didn't survive a filming process.This film will be remembered as a Lupita Nyong'o fest, as she steals everything that can be stealed from this movie. But an excellent actress is not enough to proclaim this an excellent film. I give 'Us' a 7/10 rating, as it is on the good side of what a passable film is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the greatest movies I have ever seen,"Sorry but what are these low reviews about!? No way we are watching the same thing. This movie was so creative, the cast was brilliant, the story was horrifying yet held me in the whole time with how interesting it was from beginning to end. The suspense has your jaw dropping and your mind wondering what the hell is going to happen next. The ending is amazing and so many movies out there are known for being good throughout until the end, well US isn't one of them. I have watched this movie about a dozen times and everytime you catch something you missed before and it always hits. Everything about this movie deserves 10 stars and higher. Jordan Peele knocked it out the park with US and the hype it got and still has is well deserved. I would watch this movie over and over again because wow, that was an incredible movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It was ok,"It was more creepy than weird. I didn't care for the story. The acting was good Lupita Nyongo, did an amazing job.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
