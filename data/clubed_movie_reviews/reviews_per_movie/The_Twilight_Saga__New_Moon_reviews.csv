"Beautiful people, big box office, zero story","Okay here it is, New Moon is not unwatchable (thought some parts come close). Twilight was a bit better mostly cause it had some direction. This one is severely unfocused, with a plot that denies motivation and has lazy acting across the board...well not quite.New Moon may have one edge over its predecessor which is that Taylor Launter puts more into the game than Rob Pattinson. At times, it feels like Jacob may be the better match for Bella. Their interaction which takes up the majority of the movie in fact, feels less broody than the Bella/Edward connection. Unfotunately, around the beginning of the third act we grow out of Jacob almost as fast as we grow into him. Wheras Edward is quite blatantly shy, Jacob by contrast is angry. The reasons for this however seem largely unjustified by the story. Like all bad stories, this one advances by making up its own rules on the spot, resulting in a movie that makes very little sense.I'm truly not sure what it is about the Twilight saga that demands such a plastic style of acting. Why is everyone so lazy about this? it actually degrades the quality of the material. If this is the kind of Romantic chemistry that sells on the market (a chemistry where two people act like kissing is more pain than pleasure) then Romance itself could be a dying genre.But perhaps that is an overstatement. New Moon gave me something to watch on TV when there was nothing else on, I wouldn't recommend it for any other purpose.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
inert and drippy,"We've all dealt with unrequited love before, but ""New Moon,"" the second installment in the popular ""Twilight"" series, takes it to a whole new level. Bella Swan, the moody high school student who found herself in love with a vampire - the brooding Edward - in the first film, now finds herself attracted to a werewolf, her long-haired Native American childhood pal turned cropped-haired, muscle-bound super-hunk, Jacob. Now, that's a love triangle you don't come across every day of the week.This disappointing, time-marking follow-up to the flawed but often imaginative ""Twilight"" is a tedious, slow-moving bore, consisting of little more than endless conversations about which of Bella's two ""monstrous"" beaus loves her the more and which is more likely to protect her from the danger posed by his rival and the assorted associates and kinsmen who come with him. In fact, so focused is the story on the romantic travails of the three main characters that the movie ultimately stalls out in a puddle of its own sappiness. And on a purely technical level, even the CGI werewolves are not as impressive as we'd expect them to be, given the massive amount of cash clearly lavished on the project.Actually, the thing that strikes one the most about ""New Moon"" is just how much of a rehash it is of the previous film, with Bella's predicament simply being played over, only this time with a lover from a different species (especially as Edward voluntarily removes himself from much of the action this time around).Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson return as the human/vampire lovers, while Lautner gets to run around with his shirt off a good deal of the time (despite the damp, rainy climate). That may be enough to keep the movie's targeted audience of teenaged girls awake and glued to the screen for the duration, but the rest of us will have no trouble snoozing our way through to the next installment.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very disappointing,"I loved the Twilight movie, that's how I started reading the books in the first place. I've read them about ten times each and I still like them. But New Moon's big screen adaptation was a huge let down.One thing that was improved was that many of the characters actually smiled or laughed naturally when the moment called for it, as opposed to the ""I don't crack a smile cause I'm a seriously deadly vampire"" routine in Twilight.I liked the portrayal of Alice, she seemed more like what she should be according to the book, Charlie and I also liked the wolves and the rest of the special effects.But I couldn't feel the bond between Edward and Bella. I couldn't believe that they loved each other. Hell, I couldn't believe they even liked each other. Even at the end, after their ordeal, after deciding that they would never let each other go, they were frigid. The actors just delivered their lines, they didn't feel them.The score ranged from awful to non-existent. It seems as though it was not written specifically for New Moon. Carter Burwell's score brings to memory specific scenes in Twilight. This one is an indifferent, generic one, I guess it would fit in whatever movie you threw it in.However, the most important flaw was that the entire movie seemed very rushed, like it was originally supposed to be much longer but somebody edited it heavily and really, really badly. For example, in an instant we are informed that Edward is going to commit suicide thinking Bella's dead, she drives off with Alice *bang* next thing you know you see a plane in the air, *bang* next thing you know Alice and Bella are already inside the stolen car on their way to Volterra and it carries on like that until the end.No character development, no bonds between them, no space to breathe, no explanation whatsoever of how things happened or how decisions were made, nothing but a hastily chopped up summary of the book.Is the actual movie coming out any time soon?",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Beast Within...,"What would you do, if a wolf should fall for you, when rejected by your lover, spending months under the covers, he wants more than to be friends, an outstretched paw he's keen to lend, scratch his back and he'll scratch yours, just be careful of those jaws, as the lupine are not supine, and returns from certain bloodlines, can increase the curdling pressure, and then you may just need a tether.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No as we expect,"I too expected this movie to be better. I read the 4 books. The thing is they cut out the best lines from the books which can add SO much to the movies. I was looking forward to some seens in the movie: Edward proposal for Bella, when they talk while they are waiting to get out the Volturi, very romantic and whilte they are in plane going back home. I think the scenarist must be replaced or the writer should oversee the script. The only reason movies are hit cause of the books only. Most people who did not read the books did not like the movies. Hope they'll do better in the 3rd one. But I really hope they'll do much much better in the 4th movie cause this is the book I'd like most. In general, if you read the books you must watch the movies, its nice to have the characters & seens a life.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wait--what?  People are upset??,"Ahh, what a fickle bunch Twilight fans are. I remember the release of the first film last year, and the incredible backlash from fans of the series--can't even remember the number of comments saying ""Stick to the book!"" Incredible liberties were taken with the plot (or did we all forget the butchering of the much-beloved meadow scene in the first movie?), and too much of Hardwicke's own film-making style was imposed upon a story that was not hers to fiddle with.Then New Moon comes out. Obviously, the screenwriter and director went to great lengths to painstakingly recreate the second book in film form, undoubtedly due to the response to Twilight. I am hard-pressed to think of any really pivotal plot points that were excluded from this film (and, no, the flights to and from Italy don't qualify as ""pivotal""). But suddenly fans come out in droves to complain on the Internet that the dialogue is cheesy? Hello, have you READ the books? Any actor is going to choke on the ridiculous dialogue that Stephenie Meyer came up with (I doubt even Robert De Niro could sell that tripe). Her dialogue only sounds remotely reasonable on the page. At least this movie didn't include such horrendous lines as ""I hated you for making me want you so much""). And people saying it's slow? Again, take a look at the book--the vast majority of the story is devoted to Bella moping over the imaginary hole in her chest. It wasn't exactly an action-packed thrill ride.I for one thought this movie was a vast improvement over the first, primarily because it stayed so true to the book. And Weitz, unlike Hardwicke, wasn't itching to impose his own style on the story by using crazy camera angles and other weird stylistic elements that were nowhere suggested in the pages of Twilight. New Moon was fittingly glossy and stylistically neutral, appealing to a wider range of tastes. It was filmed beautifully and, to my great relief, had a much wider color palette than the first film.As for the acting--let's face it, Kristen's never going to be an impressive performer until she realizes that scoffing doesn't qualify as ""emoting."" And Rob just seems flat-out wrong for this role, but I think he did tap into Edward's inner turmoil better than in Twilight. I thought the performances were, overall, a huge improvement over the first film, especially from Taylor, who fits the sunshiney role of Jacob to a T. The Cullens were, yes, sadly underutilized, but making the movie longer just to give them more screen time isn't going to appease complaints about it being boring and slow as it is.Hopefully this film will get the credit it deserves after the initial tsunami of unreasonable outrage. It's obvious that the filmmakers are trying incredibly hard to please the fans of the book by staying closer to the text. Here's hoping they don't throw up their hands in frustration upon discovering that loyalty to the book is apparently not good enough either.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Speechless.........,"Admittedly I have only in the last 2 days watched Twilight and New Moon and I am totally baffled by the popularity of these movies. Especially New Moon this film was TERRIBLE. Taylor Lautner cannot act to save himself, yet next to Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson he looked like he had the talent of Catherine Hepburn.Now, about the acting.... Kirsten Stewart has one face and that is the ""semi-sad"" look. For the most part ot simply looked like she couldn't wait for the film to be over. Robert Pattinson has one face and that is also the ""semi-sad"" look. I think he may be this decades answer to Luke Perry. There was a valid reason that the period between 90210 and Twilight had no ""Luke Perry types"". They can't act!! I fail to see the appeal. Taylor Lautner constantly does that thing where it looks like he is gazing about 20 metres away trying to read micro-printed reading cards and his lines come out accordingly.And did it bother anyone else that Bella is just so accepting of the fact that vampires and werewoves exist???Now I know these are movies made to be aimed at teens and tweens, but for crying out loud at least TRY and make a decent film. There are Werewolves and Vampires present. Shouldn't there be epic battles and much blood lust??Here are a few points that came to mind: 1) Twilight refers to the beginning of the evening between sunset and dusk and when Vampires and Werewolves get ready to come out to play. They ARE NOT daywalkers. If the characters are daywalkers then ""twilight"" is a pointless time of the day and had no reference to the story..... 2) Calling a movie New Moon where you introduce werewolves into the story would be OK, if the ""moon"" had anything to do with their ability to turn. Having them as daywalkers as I stated in point 1 defeats the purpose altogether. You may as well have called the story ""Cheesecake"", such was the relevance. (Mmmmmm Cheesecake).... 3) Vampires and Werewolves are creatures of legend and not a bunch of sorry ass ""Emo"" teens. They are vicious and bloodthirsty, not whiny and desperate.Perhaps Stephanie Meyers has them confused with Waaah-wolves and Vam-criers? Yes?........I am yet to watch Eclipse but it will need to be a vast improvement on New Moon because it was possibly the worst sequel ever....and yes I am including Police Academies 2 through 7!!!A very generous 4/10 at best.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""New Moon"" is an Overlong, Vapid, Pretentious and Painfully Boring Sequel...","There's a point in ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"", where our heroine Bella Swan (Kristin Stewart) and a friend emerge from a movie theater, and her friend begins to rant about how she hates the zombie sub-genre of horror, and then preaches about how she thinks it's silly and lame that a particular zombie movie (George Romero's classic ""Dawn of the Dead"", though it's never mentioned by name, you know that's what they're referring to) preaches about consumerism. At this point, I angrily pointed my finger at the screen and uttered some words I cannot repeat here. It's not that they were making fun of ""Dawn of the Dead""- that's fine. The problem is that this film is a glaring example of squandered potential and storytelling, and it's downright offensive that they should say anything about a film considered to be a classic, by both horror and general audiences alike.This film, directed by Chris Weitz, is a sequel to ""Twilight"", based on the popular novels by Stephanie Meyer. People who read my ""Twilight"" review know I actually thought it was decent. So I turned this one on a few days ago expecting another (somewhat) pleasant surprise.When I first watched ""Twilight"", I expected a mess. I was actually taken by how well the film worked. It had a lot of problems, and I only gave it a slightly above average 6 out of 10, but it wasn't bad...This was bad.We begin with Bella (Kristin Stewart again an enormous bore), who has grown worried about her future with vampire squeeze Edward- she is having nightmares about growing old, while he remains trapped in the body of a teenager, and she fears one day, he won't want her anymore.On her 18th birthday, she visits Edward (Robert Pattinson, who this time around, doesn't seem to be taking his role seriously, and just reads his lines flatly) and his adoptive family. However, when one of Edward's siblings attacks Bella from a sudden fit of his vampiric instincts, Edward decides it's too dangerous for him to continue to see Bella, and he vanishes, leaving her.Bella spends months pining and sobbing for her lost love, but finds a new romance with Jacob (Taylor Lautner). Things finally start looking up for her, when suddenly Jacob disappears, and all hope seems lost. Finally, she reconnects with Jacob and learns that he has become a werewolf, and similar to Edward, he feels it too dangerous to remain with her. She also begins to see ghostly depictions of Edward appear around her, trying to keep her safe from the dangers of everyday life. And soon some strange events unfold, forcing Bella to confront both of her lost loves, decide if she's strong enough to pursue them, and ultimately, see if she's strong enough to save several lives- her own included.The film does have some promises. The whole notion of the Romeo and Juliet-esque romance is interesting, some of the characters are likable, and there are some nice twists and turns through the story. Also, the direction was a lot better this time (Weitz does a much better job illustrating the visuals than Catherine Hardwicke did in the first film), and the music was fabulous.But there are just too many problems in this entry, and it's really just a checklist of what NOT to do in a sequel.For starters, the film is outlandishly boring. Running at 130 minutes, it felt like twice that. The story unfolds at a snail's pace, and absolutely nothing happened for the first hour. Everything seemed slow. It was a chore to watch. And the kicker? Anytime anything actually started to happen... the scene cuts. I'm not kidding, during the first big ""action"" sequence where two werewolves go at it (about halfway through the movie), we only get about 15 seconds of fighting, before we abruptly cut to the next scene- we don't actually get to see the fight, we just cut to another scene altogether. This happens repeatedly. Whenever something happens that promises to move us forward, we simply cut away to another scene. What?! This movie is a horrible tease.Secondly, the writing (courtesy of both the novel and the script by Melisa Rosenberg) was painful. Nevermind some lines and scenes that are quite misogynistic, but also, the dialog is outstandingly soap-opera-ish. Edward never speaks without dripping off cheese (""Bella, you breathing is my gift!""), Bella spends her time spewing revoltingly pretentious and clich√©d dialog, Jacob is basically a compilation of every corny ""bad boy"" ever, etc.Also, the film has no structure. As I said above, it takes almost a full hour for anything to happen. And once the plot picks up, the pace quickens to a marathon speed, and too much happens. We are also given a number of plot lines that don't make sense and don't go anywhere (such as new villain Victoria who appears all of twice in the whole movie and never does anything... at all.), and enough plot holes to sink a ship. It was just too darned sloppy.In addition, the humor is juvenile, the action is too brief (the climactic battle is cool, but over within seconds), there is no romance in the film (which is odd because this is a romance movie!), the editing is all over the map, the secondary characters are not developed... It felt like the first half of a larger story, with no climax. It was all establishment, and no pay-off.Even the things that worked in the first movie are ignored.I really am disappointed. I was expecting something that was at least decent, but this was just a waste of time, effort and potential. It is essentially a series of stitched-together sequences that don't contribute to an overall plot. There was no substance.I have to give this a 3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Warning: this is not a fan-boy's review.,"Have to say, New Moon the most anticipated romance tale of the year, is decently made. So allow me, a non-fan of the series to make this comment.First off, I know people hated it for what it is. The whole idea is like a coming-of-age story of several abnormal kids. I know it's a homage to Shakespeare; and I definitely noticed the similarity with Underworld series it began to show. But I also have to say that sometimes people hate it because they assume it's stupid, and despised the puppy love illustrated in such a fantasy scenario. But, it's the film-making that grabbed my attention.Throughout, New Moon demonstrates with superb pacing, sophisticated art design that overflowing with the whole story, and smooth special visual effects that well fit in. For a standard Hollywood production it should be like this, but allow me to say it adds points to the whole experience. It's not a movie you'd expect an awful lot of actions in it, but believe me you will see plenty of compelling actions that keep you entertained if not delighted. Some scenes are like TV-commercials, but allow me to say they are a lot more beautiful and more genuine than those outrageous built-in advertisements in ""2012"" or so.The other aspect I'd like to give a nod, is the professional attitude of the whole production. The story is about a bunch of teenagers, but the movie never fell amateurish or video-game-like. The actors all fit into their roles naturally, and again allow me to say there was not anything in performances amateurish or in-genuine enough to distract me from the story. Of course the movie is not Oscar-level, but it successfully captured the youngsters' ignorance, arrogance and all kinds of struggles between immaturity and responsibility. Shouldn't we be a bit more open to teenagers? I am not saying this movie is perfect in doing politics right, but it's not bad for a family ride that can make chances for some family talk.So, 7/10 is a fair score given the movie is not Oscar stuff, but admit it that so many people just gave it a 1 even before they see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A step in the right direction,"As an esoteric film, New Moon will not be enjoyed by those who have no prior knowledge, or even interest, of the Twilight Saga by Stephanie Meyer.It is a film purely for the fan base, and as a fan of the books, New Moon was immensely satisfying on screen. The plot was handled very well by Chris Weitz who must be commended for his fantastic work in direction and cinematography. There was no hint of excessively overbearing camera shots that so coloured Hardwicke's style in Twilight. It was clean and crisp, and quite visually stunning (two scenes in particular spring to mind).The lack of score in this film is not necessarily a bad thing, as it compliments the direction in which Chris Weitz took this film; which was far far away from the embarrassment that was Twilight.There was a noticeable improvement in the acting; all crass dialogue was quite bearable, and it seemed that the actors had a better feel of the characters they were portraying.Overall an enjoyable portrayal of Stephanie Meyer's New Moon.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boner fuel,"Similar to the videos of my mom getting ready in the morning, throughout the entirety of this masterful film, it was quite difficult to keep my hands off my peen. I am a straight white male, but after seeing Taylor Lautner so many times without a shirt in the rain I've gotta make some personal changes. The makeup on Edward through the entire film was just pristine and really made me question my decision to drop out of clown college. To say the least, this masterpiece is pure boner fuel and nothing less. At the end of the day, I'm ready to make my transition and be the vampire that Edward always needed.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Dim ""New Moon""","Ironically in ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) watch a movie of ""Romeo and Juliet"". Edward eloquently recites a passage from Shakespeare when called upon by his English teacher. Like ""Romeo and Juliet"" what had made ""Twilight"" so captivating the first time around was the star-crossed romance of Edward and Bella‚Äîvampire and mortal. So why does Edward (charismatic Pattinson) disappear during the prolonged middle of the movie? Instead we suffer through shredded Werewolf boy Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and rebounding Bella (Stewart), who have absolutely no chemistry. Granted Lautner bulked up and looks amazing, but he and Stewart have no sparks and this falls completely flat. Pattinson and Stewart have a genuine visceral chemistry which over comes much of the narrative misgivings and often time awkward dialog. Forgoing that for a good hour of the movie is puzzling. It seems like the movie is shooting itself in the foot.Perhaps, Director Chris Weitz (who replaced Catherine Hardwicke) and Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg are too beholding to the Stephanie Meyer's novel. I never read the ""Twilight"" series novels, but I am guessing this is the case. ""New Moon"" is awful. More precisely it is a horrendous miscalculation, and disappointment. I really liked ""Twilight"" which had a great Gothic romance; about heroes fighting great evil. Here the romance is displaced by the plot line, and the battle between good and powerful evil is ambiguous. Perhaps, again we are just catching Act II of the 5 Act play. None the less, this is not a satisfying experience. Pattinson and Stewart do their best, and almost salvage. However, here they are overwhelmed by the story.As ""New Moon"" opens Bella celebrates her 18th Birthday. She loves Edward, but fears what happens when she grows old, while he remains forever young. Edward confides to Bella, ""It's my job to protect you."" Bella's birthday celebration at the Cullen's turns horribly wrong, as Jasper (eerie Jackson Rathbone) nearly goes native vampire on Bella, who accidentally sheds her blood. Convinced his being with Bella will do her harm, Edward tells her, ""You're my only reason to stay alive."" He leaves for Italy to the Volturi‚ÄîVampire Royalty. He tells Bella, ""This is the last time you will ever see me.""Distraught Bella falls into depression suffering debilitating nightmares. Edward only appears as Jedi-like ghost attempting to protect his beloved. Slowly Bella pursues a relationship with childhood friend Jacob (Lautner). Jacob himself is going through a transformation‚Äîbecoming a Werewolf. Recall that Vampire and Werewolves are immortal enemies. New hero Jacob becomes Bella's protector from vengeful vampire. Soon like Edward, Jacob fears he too may inadvertently harm Bella. Bella is forever in love with Edward, and she and his sister Alice (spirited Ashley Green) fly off to rescue Edward, who may be sacrificing his life to the Volturi.There is neither compelling dramatic arc in ""New Moon"" nor any vanquishing of great evil. This is really disappointing given some of the amazing performances. Michael Sheen manifests a dark presence as Volturi leader Aro. Dakota Fanning is chilling as powerful vampire Jane. Kristen Stewart authentically embodies the anguish and wonder of teenager Bella. Pattinson is powerful and charismatic, but isn't on the screen nearly enough. ""New Moon"" is an unfortunate miscalculation that may correct itself in the next go round. At least one would think so.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Forgot Who the Target Audience Was & Needed More Werewolves,"I think this movie needed to be directed and edited by a woman because at no point could I sink into the emotions between characters. Woman love emotional stuff. But this just gave a dry account of the events, instead of developing believable characters.Not sure how the characters were portrayed in the books, but in this movie Bella and Edward were really annoying - I found myself rolling my eyes and making fun during many scenes. I found their relationship really depressing and unempowering. Instead of showing deep love, it just seemed like an unhealthy co-dependent relationship.The movie had nice filming and imagery (cool red cloaks in Italy). And I loved all the werewolf men - needed more werewolf scenes.So for the next film - slow it down. Think of what young women like: they like romantic words and feelings between characters so they can swoon and talk about with their friends. Women value the subtleties of characters, not a sports-desk rundown of a sequence of events.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
True to the book and reasonably fun to watch,"People who liked either the first movie or the New Moon book will probably have a great time at this movie. People who didn't like them still might have fun laughing at the moments of glorious teenaged awkwardness--Michael Welch returns as the hilariously down-on-his-luck Mike Newton.As a sequel, New Moon is excellent. It maintains the same tone as the first movie, smooths out some of the rough edges and builds from there. On its own it's mostly quite enjoyable to watch. There were lots of intentional and unintentional humor and of course the movie takes only a bit of the edge off the book's more than slightly unbalanced story structure.Things that impressed me? FIGHT SCENES. They actually let us see Felix toss Edward around like a rag doll. And they might have robbed us of the sight of spooky elder vampires petrifying in their old age, but they did let us see Edward's head literally crack like an eggshell as he gets slammed into the floor tiles.I also like that they expanded Alice's role and showed Bella actually missing someone in addition to Edward. I really wish that both the books and movies had gotten more into the Bella-Alice friendship. Also, the idea that a person's spouse is the only relationship they need is a relatively new one. If even a romantically obsessed book series like Twilight can focus on the fact that Bella is reacting to the entire Cullen clan and not just Edward, then maybe we're moving toward a healthier idea of what love is.Also, Michael Sheen is the champion of creepy. Sorry, Bill Nighy; he played Aro before you played Greyback! My final recommendation? Go see this movie with a big crowd for all the squealing and shouting at the screen. It's like a floor show but with body glitter.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Well ladies and gents..I lasted about 40minutes, I laughed, picked up my bag and walked out.... I say they need to start this all over with a new cast of actors and we need to sit down until someone gets it right. I have a BA in performing arts for theater and I smelled really bad BO tonight. WOW.. Please save your money and get the book at the library. It is better in your head. At the least the 1st one was not that bad and actually sparked some interest, including mines.

likely to disappoint.....,"I saw a preview screening today and I left the theatre feeling deflated.I am not a crazed Twilight fan, but I did really enjoy the books and I expected more from this adaption.I don't even feel passionate enough about this film to write a full review, so maybe that gives an indication of how I feel about it.The acting was bland, there was a lack of any real action. The story plodded along at a slow pace. It was just flat.I did really like the special effects, they were a vast improvement on the first movie. I especially liked the wolves, I thought they were quite realistic.I haven't seen too many films with Kristen Stewart, but my impression of her so far is that she is quite expressionless. I don't know if that is just the way she is portraying this character, but I always thought of Bella as someone with a little more fire. Kristen is just, again, flat. I can't get past her mono-tone.Oh and another thing to note, I'm not sure if people who didn't read the books will be able to follow the plot.

"A Great Movie for the fans, I think it's better than Twilight.","What is everyone complaining about? It's made for a genre of people like how football movies is only really only suited for football fans. I loved it and I am proud to call myself a fan. One of the best movies of the years for the people who like this kind of movie. I could watch it over and over again.Why go to see the movie is you hate the books, or the idea of the Saga? People who hate The Twilight Saga just because of what it is go see it, then go home, get on their computers and start telling everyone how bad it is.This is not right. What these people are doing is the same as when a person who hates football goes and sees a movie about football and then goes home and starts complain about how bad it is.And I am hating how people are saying the wolves are just eye-candy. Hello, have you ever gone to see an action movie made for men and some of the characters happen to be beautiful and sexy female fighters? (And fight each other while wearing tight clothing?) It's the same thing as in New Moon. All the men who are complaining about New Moon, go see the genre of films that are made for you.Because this one is made for women. Some guys might like it, like how some girls might like movies made for men and so on. But this movie is made for fans not haters.And for the people who are saying the Vampires are not Realistic, VAMPIRES ARE FICTIONAL CHARTERS! They can be any way the writer want them to be. The Twilight vampires are no different than other vampires as they both come from peoples imagination.Anyway onto my review: I loved New Noon, I found it much better than Twilight and a whole lot easier to watch. The actors and actresses did a great job and the special effects were wonderful. It is a great mix of humor, drama, romance, hot actors and actresses and action. I liked the screenplay, it was quirk and quirky.I'm fifteen, but I went with a whole bunch of people ranging between the age of nine and fifty. (Male and female.) And they all loved it as well.I want to go see it again. I think it's the best movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
New Moon...Bella is a spoiler for both films,"Kristin Stewart can not act...I realized that in Twilight. And because she can not act, she spoils every scene she's in. And the scripts should have given more lines and scenes to Billy Burke, her dad, and to Graham Green, two fine actors. The other actors in the two films must have rolled their eyes as they tried to interact with her or watch her...very painful. Read Roger Ebert's reviews of the two films--hilarious observations. For their third installment, let's hope Stewart has a firm director who can pull some type of performance out of her that resembles a living person, one with more than her limited expressions and mumbling delivery.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Neither better nor worse than its predecessor,"** out of (****)Chances are, your feelings toward the film ""Twilight"" will match your feelings for ""New Moon"". Mine sure did. This film basically did nothing for its predecessor, which is a shame since the trailer looked somewhat decent. I thought that maybe an above average Twilight flick would make its way, but I guess that's too much to ask these days. The characters are surprisingly more stale than before, although this movie is a little more interesting. For everything that is in this movie that was better than Twilight, there is also the opposite. However, the special effects improved slightly and fortunately we get more action than romance. Still, this movie is basically neither better nor worse than ""Twilight"". You can take that as a complement or a negative, and you know which side you're on.""New Moon"" revolves around Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattison). Edward leaves Bella in the forest and now Bella is all alone. However, she meets Jacob (Lautner) and gradually develops a crush on him. Although, Edward returns and Jacob has a secret: he's a werewolf.I think it's kind of humiliating that a director gets a better script, yet makes a film that's on par with Twilight. I mean how could this have not been good? You have werewolves vs. vampires. That sounds cool already and imagine the type of execution that Scorsese can make *faints*. Folks, if you think this latest installment is impossible to have worse acting and dialogue, then you are dead wrong. Yes, it might seem improbable, but the performances and dialogue have gone from beyond awful to officially the worst I've seen. Moreover, I thought the first hour was way too boring and a chore to sit through.Now, there are some redeeming qualities. The technical aspects have improved. Not by much, but a sufficient amount. Moreover, the last hour is actually watchable. The action here is also not too shabby. Also, I thought that the story was slightly more interesting.""New Moon"" is basically on par with ""Twilight"", but that isn't a complement. Both films boast decent technical aspects and interesting stories, but also boast terrible performances with an awful script. ""New Moon"" is neither a bad nor good film and compared with its predecessor, it matches its film quality. This weekend, I'll seek out ""Eclipse"" and see if that film can break the mediocrity streak. Hey, David Slade is directing. If the third installment is even just the slightest better than ""New Moon"", I'll be satisfied. Until then, this is my review of ""New Moon"".",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Yup. Emo girls.,"And I fail to see how it could appeal to anyone else. In fact, I fail to see how on earth this could have even been written by anyone over sixteen.Movies are captivating if you link with the characters.

Pleasant and Underrated Sequel,"Isabella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is worried about aging and asks Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) to transform her in a vampire. On her eighteenth birthday, Alice (Ashley Greene) invites Bella to a birthday party at the Cullen's home. When Bella accidentally cuts her finger opening her gift, Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) attacks her and the Cullen family protects Bella. Edward decides to leave Forks with his family to not endanger Bella, and the girl recluses herself at home. However, she finds comfort spending her leisure time with her friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner). When he disappears from her life, Bella seeks him out at home and discovers a secret about his genetic heritage.""New Moon"" is a pleasant and underrated sequel of ""Twilight"". The character of the gorgeous and talented Kristen Stewart seems to have the gift of getting attracted by freak creatures. After the romance without chemistry with the weird Robert Pattinson, whose face is adequate for the role of a blood-sucker but never for a romantic pair with Kristen Stewart, she gets close to a strong werewolf. I like this franchise, but the producers could have chosen a better actor to perform the stud Edward Cullen. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Lua Nova"" (""New Moon"")",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Recast Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan !!!!!!!!!!!!,The #1 complaint Twilight fans have is Kristen Stewart's poor acting. Summit needs to replace her now. Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner cannot perform to the best of their abilities with her as the lead actress. I loved the books and do not want to continue to be disappointed with the films. I realize production companies are in it for the money but Summit needs to slow down (even re-shoot Eclipse) and do justice to these books. I know many of you agree with me so please sign the petition in order for change.http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/kristinasbellaSummit please listen. Summit please listen.

Keep your expectations low and have fun,"This movie greatly exceeded my expectations, but that is because they were low. I've read and enjoyed all of the books but it is really an exception to my movie going/reading habits. When Edward enters the screen for the first time they film it in slow motion, while he gives a bit of a swagger, and super-cheesy music plays. Bwahahaha! Love it.It does not significantly differ from the books. The wolves, well, they're okay, not fab but not so realistic either. I recall seeing the Golden Compass (which Weitz BOMBED) and the daemons were similar. Fortunately they don't talk or tap dance.I'm disappointed in Robert Pattinson. He actually can act, but for some reason he decided to adopt a mono-expression of pain and suffering from the very beginning until the end. Stewart is okay, I have actually always enjoyed her Bella, who is very introverted. Taylor vastly improves upon the book character, who I find to be a cocky little git.So with all this bad stuff, why did I enjoy the movie? Because it was campy and fun, and I didn't take it too seriously. I recommend large amounts of audience participation and to go when there are a maximum levels of gushy teenage girls around you, so that they squeal when the trailer for ""Remember Me"" comes on.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a Marshmallow,"I was dragged to see this with my younger sister, even after telling her in no uncertain terms there was 'No way in hell I was going to see that stupid sparkly vampire movie' I had seen the first movie - found it okay if a bit ridiculous.New Moon definitely has a different look and feel to the series. From the music to camera angles - it's comes off as very polished. I personally preferred the grittier low budget feel of the first movie but with the CGI involved with this one they wouldn't be able get away with it.Some of the dialouge is horrendous. The classroom scene where Edward talks about suicide and Romeo and Juliet made me feel like gagging. But Robert Pattinson's slow motion walk through the parking lot kinda sorta made up for that.Kristen Stewarts acting has gotten better. I'm not saying she's good - but she's definitely improved. That is, until the scene when Edward is fighting one of the Volturi and her horrible scream 'NOOOO!!!!' left me embarrassed and ashamed for her as a person.Eye candy is aplenty, I wasn't the only one in the theatre that softly sighed when we're introduced to the shirtless wolf pack.There were quite a few unintentionally funny moments - where the director seemed to be painfully striving for seriousness. One memorable scene was when Bella gets a tiny cut on her head and Jacob whips off his shirt. Really? the whole shirt for a cut the size of a small pea? couldn't just dab it with the bottom of the shirt? Ugh and the slow motion running Edward and Bella do *cringe* - when you see it you'll understand. And Jasper's hair, something was going on there - looked like a dead cat flopping around up there.I didn't like the music, but that could just be me - my sister enjoyed it. I felt that the use of 'slow mo' was used abit too much.I did however, love, love, love the Volturi - so freaking cool. And a great montage scene leading up to Bella jumping off the cliff. And did I mention the wolf pack? Sigh.All in all a pretty decent movie for what it is. I was told by my sister that it was extremely faithful to the book. She also noted that movie Jacob is ten times better than book Jacob who comes off as whiney apparently.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could've been,"First of all, I haven't read the novels/books, so I can't say how close this is to the source material. I've heard that, the first movie (Twilight) didn't bring everything from the book onto the screen (which makes sense, because otherwise the source material would've been really slim/weak). While we had our introductions in the first movie (and I'm assuming you have either seen that or at least read the book), we should be able to have more ""fun"" with the characters this time around ... well if you thought that, than you are very wrong!!The things K. Stewarts character (Bella) has to go through, come across. But while some additional stuff has been made up (or so I've been told), that wasn't in the book, to have a ""special"" character with more screen time, this all adds up to a pretty dreadful experience.The acting wasn't really top notch from part 1. There is no reason for that. And I think the only one coming out of, mostly unscathed, is Taylor Lautner. And the girl who played in ""Up in the Air"", forgot her name. But that's more due to the movie ""Up in the Air"" than to her role in this one.While nothing much is happening (not only acting wise), the movie still tries to be as dramatic as it can be. The problem being, it isn't at all! And while there are a few nice action pieces, the whole thing feels utterly ridiculous, which makes it quite hard to really enjoy it. Again though, as with the first one, this was aimed at a female audience group and if you saw it in theaters, than you might have heard quite a few of them screaming. There is one ""special"" scene that really made them happy ... and some guys too (although they might have been cynical)! While the scene as it is, didn't excite me and influenced my vote directly, the impact it has/had, does reflect in my vote, as well as the fact, that the target audience seems to love it ...",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Twilight Saga: New Moon... Hmmm,"The first movie is better / fresher probably because it was directed by a woman... (maybe that's why the books are just SO cool) and as for the music, well Carter Burwell has genius and experience beyond his years, so that too would make Twilight an infinitely exquisite experience over and above the sequel. More budget doesn't always produce a superior movie, sometimes less is more, so I still prefer the first movie to this one. (I went into the hall and tried opening it. then i forgot what happened next and somehow) I actually couldn't think of enough things to say about this movie for the required minimum of ten line criteria by IMDb, so sorry about the random bracketed words in the middle.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So awful that I thought it funny!,"The most ridiculous movie I ever seen!I actually laughed at the ""romantic"" scenes! The lines are so poor and the actors so bad if you don't laugh at it, you can't watch it. The only good actress, Dakota, has only a couple of scenes! Why did she get into that after all? She can get better movies.The plot is childish. People said to me the book is nice, it is the kind of reading you din't stop until the end comes. Maybe it is. If it is, the movie completely ruined it. Bad jokes, bad lines, poor characters, weak story. That's all I saw about it. And, as a director, when everything you got is bad, what do you do? Explore actors bodies! as a woman, I have to say, the only good thing in this, are the werewolves bodies. Don't waste your money watching this.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terrible,"The movie was not worth the money to go and watch. I went to go and see it with my younger sister as a birthday treat, and had it not been her birthday I would have walked out.The acting was awkward and terrible, reminding me almost constantly that I was watching a movie instead of being engaged in a story. The special effects were overused, and the entire backdrop to the story was terrible.My sister and I read the books together so we could talk about it, and It's no wonder the movie performed so badly. As me and my sister could agree, there was no way that anybody could find this movie to be engaging whatsoever, besides the inclusion of a bland, vanilla-flavoured heroine who could easily be replaced by somebody with delusions of romance.Bad acting, terrible effects, and a bad storyline = 1/5",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
ZZZZZ  is it finished yet?,"Unless you are a 13 year old girl , it's not seen as a good thing to say you like the Twilight movies. I found out the hard way when i gave the first movie a good review. I really enjoyed the film having known nothing about the books and i was really looking forward to the second instalment - New Moon and to see what happens with both Edward and Bella. Sadly the answer is not a lot. New Moon is a bloated movie that drags , and drags and drags while not a lot happens.Just after Bella's 18th birthday, Edward decides to leave her behind in an effort to protect her. As the heartbroken Bella sleepwalks through her senior year, numb and alone, she discovers she can summon Edward's image whenever she puts herself in jeopardy. Her desire to be with him at any cost leads her to take greater and greater risks, including a new taste for high-speed motorcycle jaunts.With the help of Jacob Black , her childhood friend and a member of the mysterious Quileute tribe, Bella refurbishes a motorbike for her adventures. Bella's frozen heart is gradually thawed by her budding relationship with Jacob, who has a supernatural secret of his own.When Bella wanders alone into a meadow, she finds herself face to face with a deadly attacker. Only the intervention of a pack of extraordinarily large wolves saves her from a grisly fate and the encounter makes it frighteningly clear that Bella is still in grave danger. In a race against the clock, Bella learns the ancient secret of the Quileute tribe and Edward's true motivation for leaving her. She also faces the prospect of a potentially deadly reunion with her beloved that is quite unlike the one she had hoped for.I'm not convinced about a acting ability of Kristen Stewart. Having seen her now in two Twilight movies and Adventureland I'm starting to think that she flatters to deceive. After two hours of her constant moping and moaning in this movie and a similar performance in adventureland I'm not too impressed. Now with Robert Patterson , i feel completely different. I like his style of acting . Where Kristen Stewart looks like she is just going through the motions , Patterson puts everything into making Edward as mysterious as a Vampire could possibly be. New Moon isn't a total disaster . It looks great and there are a couple of really good fight scenes , one involving the Wolves and the other Aro's henchmen and Edward. The Problem is the story of whether Bella is to become a vampire is impossible to sustain throughout the entire two hours and it's difficult not to feel bored. The final scene is so anticlimactic and without giving anything away all i can say is , only a woman could find it in any way interesting . I just hope the next movie is a lot better otherwise i feel that the audience for these movies will just be the screaming teenage girls.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie for the Fans,"Just watched the early morning release of New Moon and came away with mixed feelings. While the movie closely follows the format of the book and tries to explain Bella's 'feelings' with the same type of narrative like in Twilight, I found that the scenes were a bit disjointed or stopped too short.Little extras could have given the movie more flow and it heavily relies on the watcher having read New Moon prior.I also feel it tries to quickly explain too many conversations and back up knowledge.I think that all the hype and excitement of the movies upcoming release left me a little wanting when I finally saw the movie and will try to refrain in future from watching too many previews of Eclipse.This movie is definitely a movie for the fans. Taylor Lautner comes into his own in this movie and I am looking forward to seeing Taylor and Rob in their scenes in the next movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Okay, but disappointing","The first Twilight film was pretty good, while not necessarily being my cup of tea. It wasn't a 5-star masterpiece or anything like that but it was watchable. New Moon was okay, but its many problems make it disappointing too. I am one of those who hasn't read the books, but I have friends and relatives who have and while some say the books are good and the movie keeps to the style if not the details of them others say both the books and films are not good. My sister belongs in the former category, though she remarks that the book New Moon was her least favourite of the series and yes she liked the movie. I didn't like the movie as much as her, it had some good moments but it felt dragged out and unconvincing.I will say there were some good things. There are some scenes in the film that are quite nicely shot, with some decent cinematography and lush scenery, plus the CGI wolves and the special effects in the fight sequences were fairly impressive to say the least. Secondly, Alexandre Desplat's score did have some pleasant parts to it. I will not say that it is particularly memorable or anything like that, and Desplat has done much better work before, but there are some themes that are very nice, particularly Hearing Damage. About Chris Weitz, initially I thought he was a curious choice for director, as I know him best from The Golden Compass, which I admit was a better film. But while he lacks the style of Catherine Hardwicke, he does a decent if not entirely exceptional job directing.The quality of the acting was uneven, at best it was decent, at worst it was wooden. Taylor Lautner was not bad at all as Jacob not to mention incredibly hunky and handsome, I could tell he was trying to bring some life and momentum into this film and it showed, and Robert Pattinson was a marginal improvement from the previous outing as Edward. Dakota Fanning despite her role being brief is fine as Jane even if it required a lot of staring. Billy Burke is also amusing as Charlie, his and Lautner's acting came off best. Michael Sheen is a great actor, he was perfect in The Queen, and while he has an intriguing and imposing presence he does have a laugh that is quite irritating, even more irritating than Tom Hulce's laugh in Amadeus. However, I wasn't impressed at all with Kristen Stewart as Bella, her facial expressions are limited and her delivery didn't convince.Other than Stewart's performance, there are other things wrong. One is that the dialogue is incredibly corny and disjointed. Second, the chemistry between Bella and Edward is non-existent, it is better with her and Jacob but it still feels awkward. Thirdly, the story drags so much, not much happens, and when you think something exciting is going to happen, it is just another dragged out scene. I think the most exciting the film got was some bike stunts and some werewolf-vs-vampire scenes. Fourthly, while the scenery is nice, the editing and transitions from scene to scene was rather choppy. Fifthly, the pacing is quite pedestrian, the first 20 minutes or so were so slow moving I almost bailed out but decided not so as it isn't really fair. Finally, the ending, way too abrupt. When Edward said ""Marry me Bella"", then pause, then finish, I was like ""That's it?"" I even re-winded to see if I had missed anything, no I did not.Overall, it was okay, but it wasn't really my cup of tea. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"New Moon, I give you a Full Moon!","I don't know if it was because it was overly exciting to get a true Sneak Peek at the New Moon before everyone else but the thrill disappeared when the movie started (just like drinking beer is no longer exciting after turning 21).Bring an alarm clock with you. When the movie starts, set it for 40 minutes so that when you fall sleep it will wake you up. Bella and Edward ""Moo goo goo-goo"" and other boring banter in the beginning. It gets slightly entertaining after that.Alice is the only one who brightens the screen not just because of how cute she is, but because her acting is good.New Moon offers what Twilight fans expect: It is written for teenagers especially teen girls and they will love this movie. The costumes, makeup and artistry in the film are excellent but cater to the teens as well.Most upsetting is that these Vampires would have had their butts whooped by any of the True Bloods or Bram Stoker's vamp. Even the Lost Boys make the NewMooners look like Lost Girls. Wolf Boy was kind of tough but the Vamps in this movie are really weak!The Volturi are introduced in the New Moon movie. Jane being played by Dakota Fanning, who will most likely use this paycheck to pay for further acting lessons.Of course, Stephenie Meyer wrote the 1st three books very well so I'm giving 5 stars for that (it's very difficult to mess this movie up with such good writing). I give 1 star for the make up and costumes. I give 0 stars for the Lifetime Channel dialogue between the teenage characters especially Kristen Stewart who is not acting but is just herself being overly dramatic at times.Of course, most everyone reading this is going to see the movie anyway but I at least state now ""You're not going to miss much!"" Read the book instead if you have not already.The next installment, Twilight Eclipse, will most likely have Teen Vampires from The Gap fighting Abercrombie & Fitch's Vamps!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wow, what a difference a director makes.","To begin, I am not a teenage girl, nor have I ever been. However, I respected the first movie when I saw it... Not as some masterpiece or any nonsense like that, but as a well directed movie that was extremely well targeted towards its intended audience.I might not have been on the edge of my seat, but I was entertained, and I deeply respected the director for making a movie that was thrilling for her intended audience.A year later, the sequel is made... The same book series, same cast, different director.""A New Moon"" was an absolutely worthless pile of drivel. Endless repetition of moaning and staring into empty space, dry dialogue with absolutely no purpose an nothing conveyed, and absolutely laughable sequences of terrible special effects, all took serious camera time while the plot (which was similar in depth to the first installment - take that as you will) all seemed to happen off camera. The relationship between whats-her-name and the werewolf boy was developed in 5-10 minutes with virtually no dialogue, while we were treated to 10 minutes of whats-her-name staring out a window and no less than FIVE sequences where she woke screaming (no different dreams, no dialogue, just whats-her-name tossing in bed then screaming).This movie SUCKED.If you were modestly entertained by Twilight, stand forewarned...

"New Moon: Good, Not Perfect; See It with an Open Mind","This movie, and the series as a whole, seems to be very polarizing. Many have an opinion before even viewing the movie, and this bias is difficult to shake.Compared to the first ""Twilight"" film, though, I would argue that ""New Moon"" is definitely an improvement. The dialogue flows much more smoothly, and has funny moments (Jessica's rant being one of my favorites), which lightens the tone of the film and balances it nicely with the darker elements. I felt Kristen Stewart's performance improved in this film as well (very possibly due to the direction), and I was pleasantly surprised with Taylor Lautner's portrayal of Jacob, which I was initially skeptical about. The special effects were done quite well, and Chris Weitz's artful direction was evident. It was beautifully shot. The scenes in Italy are lush and interesting to watch.I do agree, however, with others who felt the film moved a bit slowly at times. Sometimes the pace felt off. I think this may due to the effort in sticking with the book. The director had to balance making a great movie with pleasing the fans of the book, and I'm not sure those two things always mesh. Most crucial scenes from the book were included in the movie, though I can certainly see how someone not familiar with the book (or didn't like the book) might be bored.Yes, this is a film that primarily females will like (the male eye candy--in a nice reversal from the usual female sexual objects in films--does play a part of that). However, appealing to a female audience doesn't make it inherently bad, as some seem to think. I recommend anyone going to see this movie to try and keep an open mind, especially if you're not a fan. (We all know fans will love it no matter what.) Let go of any pre-conceived notions you may have about Twilight, and enjoy ""New Moon"" for what it is--a moody, sometimes humorous, sometimes suspenseful romance, and try and enjoy the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Two hours of my life that I will never get back,"If you want to see a vampire movie, just rent Lost Boys or Bram Stoker's Dracula. Better yet, watch the original Nosferatu.New Moon, much like the first Twilight, is complete and total garbage. The acting is horrid, the story is overly dramatized, even for Hollywood. Speaking of Hollywood, this is just another clich√© teen drama. It insults the intelligence of even the most shallow of teen fans, predictable to the end. And seriously... what's with the sparkles? Are these vampires or fairies?I propose a new story.

I could not have foreseen the horror.The dialogue is horrifically infantile, the acting is about as good as my elementary school play (not very good) and the overall plot seems to have been written by a 13 year old angsty goth girl with a bad case of borderline.All in all, this romance novel for early teen girls made me want to gouge my eyes out and I tried to pierce my eardrums with a drinking straw but it was a big straw so it didn't fit.

The introduction of the hairy piggy boys,"This is the second episodes of the love story between the vampire boy Edward (Pattinson) and his human girlfriend Bella (Stewart). One of the many problems of this movie is that it is not a standalone peace, and even if it is based on book it should be. The editing and the screenplay are so in-cohesive, that one can only conclude this movie was made dollar signs in eyes after teenagers (parents) money. If one is really a hardcore fan, this movie might be OK just having the word Twilight in it, but others including those who actually liked the book, it will leave cold. The only two good scenes are in the last part of the film, the Volturi fighting scene and that other in the end of the movie.This movie is very clinical, full of awkward moments and unintentional humour. When in the first Twilight one could smell the rain and moss, in this it is bleach and fish. The first Twilight movie had some sense-emotion-tempo element in it, but the New Moon has none of these; first it is too slow and in the end they had to rush to tell the tale. It is difficult to say if the director and actors actually failed, since the dialogue and original story were so bad.In the beginning vegetarian reptile eyed Edward and the Cullens leave Bella because of a small paper cut incident and blood. Yes, it is well known fact that in the world of vampires women don't menstruate. Think how awkward that lunch would be. The loss of love of her existence starts her depression and boredom of the viewers. The appearance of melancholic and sleep deprived Stewart actually fits in as a heartbroken Bella. Then comes Bella's chase for astral Edward, meaty puppy Jacob (Lautner), vampires trying to kill Bella, hairy wild hogs trying and killing a vampire, Bella trying to commit suicide, Alice, Edward trying to commit suicide, orange eyed vampire monarchs Volturi trying to kill Bella (because she knows they are really drinking carrot juice, seriously; there are more scary creatures hanging around subway stations), someone in the theatre thinking about committing a suicide, Edward protecting Bella, Volturi trying to kill Edward, The Fight Scene, Alice, Jacob trying to ..., nobody kills Bella and Edward...Saldo one dead not so known non‚Äìvegetarian vampire.The only emotion what is left from the book is Bella's depression. The other pivotal emotional cornerstones are lost in editing. Also Bella's help to hold on, the book's carefree and sunny, crack-up-a-little-bit-of-a-jerk Jacob is in the movie this overly serious bulked-up piggy boy turning into a werewolf,who talks about ever-nether stuff, pushes his jaw down and stares over the forehead, and takes off his shirt, and takes off his shirt, and takes off his shirt... supposedly this should have been a kind of a romantic-sexual chemistry. Instead it looked like a baby brother was trying to do his big sister in his hormonal outburst. Awkward.Same take-out of all the playfulness and replace it with muscles and angry-simpleminded demeanour was done for the werewolf pack. In spite of being a great admirer of the male beauty, it just went over the top. These guys looked like they have gone through clonal selection creating an association if Quileite men ever consider breeding with anyone else than they first cousins. This together with hanging around only pants on gives again one of the movies unintended humorous associations. If Jacob and others would have started to sing YMCA and sniff each other's behinds, it would have been relief of the monotony. The CG-wolfs looked more hairy piggies than dangerous werewolves, but this might have been intentional; the Christmas is good for the toy market and fluffiness sells more.There were just no surprises. All possibilities to keep the book's storyline and in addition to explore some other characters point of views than Bella's were not used. They could have made sneak a peek into Volturi ranks, or show the fear in Jacob's first shape shifting. Now poor Stewart had to be in every scene and eye and mind just would want to have a brake sometimes.Shortly, this movie is like a salad; some lettuce, one year old herrings and pieces of carnivore meat in it. If viewer enables to eat through the smell and awkwardness, s/he might find a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on the bottom.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"this ""new moon"" doesn't seem ""new"" at all!","not as perfect as the first one and also not as interesting as the book, it's all I can say about this new moon. why is that? firstly, I think people at first should read the novel to understand the movie completely. without background knowledge the movie is incomplete. secondly, the new moon novel has so many monologue and inner thoughts-Bell's. she explains her agony and pain so that you can sympathies with her easily. but the movie can't reproduce these thoughts- it's the priority of books to cinema. so most of the things seemed somehow irrelevant. my advice to who has not see the movie yet is: start reading the saga before watching it to enjoy both :)",,Anonymous,Fantasy
film totally fails emotionally - horrible score,"i was so totally disappointed by new moon. it has no soul, there's no atmosphere (that Hardwicke was able to create in twilight for example), there's no real suspense at all (and there would be sooo much potential!). one of the biggest disappointment was the score, which in my opinion completely fails to create any kind of the right mood... =( i mean it's supposed to be a deep movie, loaded with emotions, serious tone... people were laughing in the cinema (but not because it was supposed to be funny), the film just gets ridiculous too many times. it's just really missing the passion and the emotional load. =( if they could only do the score again - i believe this is one the major weakness of the movie. it totally misses the point of the story, in every single important scene - it's completely detached from the action, doesn't fit at all. it's more like a classic epic kind of music (totally flat and boring) - it really doesn't do the story justice. the soundtrack songs saved some scenes though, thank god. the overall impression of the film is its emotional emptiness. there‚Äôs no real coherence between the scenes, it‚Äôs cut off from one scene to another too abruptly too many times. you can‚Äôt really feel the development of characters‚Äô feelings etc. you can‚Äôt really feel for them. it just remains flat in all aspects. i just can‚Äôt ignore the feeling I got watching this movie that they just wanted to include everything they thought is important in the book, important for the story (providing all the facts) but not letting the characters to develop in depth ‚Äì which is most essential for the story ‚Äì to feel the emotional load‚Ä¶ the film just rushes through the story line. even in most critical and emotional moments of their lives Edward hardly even approaches Bella, they‚Äôre standing strangely remote and apart from each other, and when they do kiss, then the music fails, or, the previous and following cut destroys it‚Ä¶and so on. another thing that really bothered me was the bad taste in design of the birthday party and of the clothing of the Cullen family. it just doesn‚Äôt do them justice. Alice‚Äôs clothes are just downright ugly and the decoration of their house is just a disgrace. anyone with just a little taste would agree, i‚Äôm sure. it‚Äôs really a pity, cause the story is bursting with potential and the film just suffocates it. i think they should redo it. at least do a new score to bring some emotions to life!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thought it was great,"Thought Chris Weitz was a far better director than Hardwicke. Enjoyed the film, set up for Eclipse quite nicely. This review is probably more of a response to others negative reviews:Yes, it is cheesy, and goofy at times, but hello! The writing in the book isn't that great either! And I'm a fan! This is not a vampire movie in the sense of, ""I've come to suck your blood!"" This is based on a fantasy book whose main characters are vampires, and gives a different idea of what that mythical creature could be like. I think given the story they did a great job. It is definitely a bit different than the book, but if you don't expect that by now, you need a reality check. There were a few scenes that seemed.. choppy. As if they were missing something. I would definitely watch it again, and look forward to owning it on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Beautiful Adaption - Yes, it is an ADAPTION.","So, I am an avid fan of the Twilight Saga. I admit it is not high quality. I admit the books are poor quality. Yet, I still love it - I love the characters, the story, the romance.I waited with ridiculous expectation for New Moon, and my high expectations were mostly rewarded. New Moon is a weak book overall, and I thought the film did an excellent job making it appealing.The good: - The plot was well interpreted. Reviewers claim the film is 'boring', but I considered it to move along at a ripping, exciting pace. Much of the plot was crammed in, kind of like a checklist - but this did not detract, it enhanced. All the necessary elements were included and polished, and the weaker details were ignored - Overall, the cinematography was impressive and occasionally quite artistic - Special effects, particular the werewolf transformations, were very good - a HUGE improvement from the first movie (which is quite abysmal) - Kristen Stewart's acting had improved dramatically, even if I still dislike her acting style. She portrayed the pain and numbness of Bella's character quite well. - The Italy scene was almost entirely how I pictured it: Sweeping, melodramatic and intense - All additions were impressive: The wolf pack, and Volturi (particularly the gorgeously scary Dakota Fanning) - Stand out actors were Billy Burke, Taylor Lautner, Chaske Spencer and the humans in general, who added some nice comic relief. Oh Anna Kendrick, what beautiful zombie ad-libbing. - The gorgeous Ashley Greene as Alice - The ending make me smile - The soundtrack was beautiful, particularly the use of Anya Marina's Satellite Heart, Bon Iver's Roslyn and Lykke Li's Possibility. Perfection.The bad: - Kristen Stewart still manages to stutter and blink more than what is normal for a human - Bella's initial escapades in Port Angeles - really? REALLY? - Removal of a few minimal key moments, such as a few lines spoken by Edward in the book which could have been included - Cheesy dialogue - 'you're like your own sun'. Let alone pointing out Lautner's biceps. Don't worry, we noticed them already. - Alice's horrible vision. A nice idea, badly shown.All the bad points are very nit-picky points, so they can be disregarded if you desire.If you love the book and the series, you should enjoy the film. Chris Weitz has elevated the Saga to new levels of quality, and is a huge improvement on Hardwicke's initial disasters.If you haven't read the books - see the film, ignore the critics, and make up your own mind. I think it's worth it. It's not genius, but it's entertaining, devastating, melodramatic and romantic. What's not to love?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Disaster,"Chris Weitz is a Hollywood disaster. Everything he does is a tragedy. The Golden Compass, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, and many more of his projects could have been a whole lot better. This is a person who can take a book and ruin it. You think somebody who would tackle big literary works would do a much better job but no. He was just part one of the disaster known as The New Moon.The next part was the acting. You would think it would probably be better than the first one. If I had to choose between this and the Harry Potter movies..... I think the Harry Potter movies would win by a landslide. Honestly, the best vampire movie series to date is Underworld. I would like to see City of Bones as a movie. The only thing that tried to get the people not to think of the horrible acting was Lautner's well toned steroidal body. Even that couldn't distract how awful it was. I don't think they should make anymore of the series.The third part was the screenplay. Are you kidding me? A little child could have wrote a better screenplay than that. The dialog was skewed and the actions didn't make any sense. The whole movie was consistent in sucking. It wasn't any good.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No I did Not Read The Books!!!,"I love Vampire movies. i will watch any vampire movie out good or BAD! So reading the books or not, the fist two movies so far are the worst vampire movies EVER...PERIOD! I watch b movies all the time. find them humorous and don't expect, good anything. But billing this movie as a good one, no way.. should have gone straight to DVD(possible VHS)I mean at least bill it as a teen love story. unfortunately movies for 4 cost me and my family close to 100.00 bucks. If i were at a restaurant i would have not even come close to paying for something that bad. such a shame we don't have the same right to do that with movies.but i digress, bottom line don't wast your life or time with this series. unless you are 13-13 1/2. go to the dentist instead. at least that kind of pain is normally healing.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"disappointing, but","OK, where to start? I've read Twilight and New moon and I'm not a fan of the series, but I think they are OK. However, I have to admit that I was expecting something else from this movie and that I was totally disappointed by the bad acting of the lead actors and the cheesiness of their lines. Besides, I don't understand why the action sequences were so short. Every time there was an action sequence and I was beginning to feel excited it was abruptly cut and I have to stand Bella's expressionless face and depressing lines over and over again. I was also very shocked by the poor camera work in this movie. If we compare this movie with the previous one, we can easily notice that the previous director (Catherine Hardwicke)was more adventurous and did a great camera work and some of the shots were just amazing. However, I have to admit that Taylor Lautner surprised me because he was the only one who didn't look like he was just reading and delivering lines without understanding what he was saying. To sum up, New moon was too lame, too cheesy, too mediocre and absolutely overrated.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a let down....,"I hadn't heard of the books until I saw the first movie which I thought was pretty good. I then read all the books (twice) and was very much looking forward to New Moon as it was one of my favorites in the series and boy was I seriously let down. The film is clunky with absolutely no flow from scene to scene with a dialog to match. I was amazed that it was the same screenwriter. Weitz's spinning camera effects were enough to make you sick and the scene of Bella and Alice driving the Porche was so cheesy it was laughable. There was a reason why Hardwick turned down making this film which she said a quality film couldn't be made in that time frame - she was right. Summit is trying to rake in the dough capitalizing on the fan base without caring about putting together something of quality. Wake up Summit, your fan base will dry up pretty quickly when your putting out such crap.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
That's enough...,"No more movie critics. No more boys and girls who aren't fans of the books commenting on this film. New Moon is not meant to be a standalone Forest Gump. No more complaining about how bad a film is just because one doesn't see the appeal that others do. New Moon was first and foremost a Book. So that'll be enough complaining about 'too much eye candy and sexual Angst' because the writing is where details are. In the Books, Not the 2 hour long film, one will learn why it is such an epic struggle for the characters and why each long drawn out scene fits perfectly and is necessary.My question is how were so many people confused about this film. The Name is not deceptive. EVERYONE knows that this film is the second in a series. EVERYONE knows what the theme of this film was going to be... Who would STILL be ignorant enough to go to this film with expectations of anything else? So everyone needs to stop illuminating their idiocy by continually whining about how bad this film was. New Moon is for Fans of the Books - who like to go to the cinema as well....",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better then twillight,"I can see why many people get mad. I myself have read the books and love them. This movie does a much better job the the first, since I actually left the cinema when i watched it. New moon is more true to the book tho it still lacks huge chunks. I still wanna cut it some slack because the effects and make up was way better this time around. So the conclusion must be that it will never be as the books but this is a step closer and I would not, like others, recommend anyone to save their money. When it comes down to it the acting is also remarkable better and the problem is just that Bella is so stiff, as in the first. She has to show emotions and actually act.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Part of this Movie was the Trailer,"Where do I begin? Expecting to see some action as portrayed by the trailer I decided to go and see what I can now only describe as a very disturbed 12 year old girl's outlook on love.Firstly If you want to see vampires fighting werewolves don't waist your time with this movie. There is no werewolf for the first hour and a half and if there is 1 vampire sighting outside the first 10 minutes it's a lot.My biggest problem with this movie is that it is a movie about vampires and werewolves yet not 1 person is killed or even hurt in the whole movie. Dracula was a love story too and people die left and right. SO the whole ""it's a love story"" argument doesn't work.Vampires vs Werewolves??? In an argument maybe... There may have been a brief scuffle but nothing serious especially considering that there are 2 monsters 1 super strong super fast vampire and 1 GIANT wolf who are supposed to be FIGHTING over the love of a girl. Listen I'm not sure how it is today but in my day when I was in high school and 2 guys liked a girl we scrapped. Not saying the winner would get the girl but there would be a physical altercation not stair downs and threats and people walking away. Maybe that's why society is so sensitive right now. I'll tell you this much if this movie was made in the 80's-90's the body count would have been off the chart and the amount of fight sequences would have been ridiculous.Now that I got that off my chest let me just say the violence would have been a welcomed distraction from the absurdity of this movie. ""Oh no! I'm 17 and I've already found the person I'm going to be with for the rest of my life but I can't be with that person so let me try and kill myself while my father sits around listening to me having panic attacks and does nothing."" Listen I didn't have a sister or anything but if I did and she decided to act like this I guarantee my mother would have beat the living sh*t out of her. I mean I think my mother would of beat her just for watching this movie then she would have beat me for letting her watch it. THis movie was Lame!!! and at the risk of sounding lame myself, what type of message are you trying to send these kids now days that if you don't get what you want out of a relationship you should just kill yourself??? Get over it they're 17, they don't know what the hell is going on in life. IN reality the girl would have been upset for about a week then she would have hooked up with whoever was available at the moment and forgot about the other idiot.My final problem with this movie. Calling it a ""Romance"" or a movie about ""Love"" doesn't quite hit the nail on the head. It's more of an obsession and an unhealthy obsession. If your significant other throws themselves off a ledge, crashes a motorcycle and knowingly/willingly writes letters to a person who never gets them just to feel like they are close to you or to emulate some sort of feeling you give them your going to call the police and a psychiatric ward and have that person institutionalized. You may even want to get a restraining order on that person.This movie gets a 3 just because the werewolf looks cool.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
On Getting Dumped Without Explanation,"Disclaimer. I am a 66 year old gay male, not the intended target for this movie. I probably reacted to it in a different way than the average viewer will.Twilight The Saga: New Moon is a much darker movie than Twilight I.For many people, myself included, being dumped by a lover who you madly adored, unexpectedly, without explanation is by far the worst event of your life. This happens to Bella Swan. Usually, a movie would gloss over this bleakness in a few seconds of clich√©s. But Twilight sits on it for almost the whole movie, and explores the pain with some imagination. It also explores not wanting ever to be involved again, and forever holding back. It explores the way you hold onto the flimsiest shred of hope your true love will eventually come back and the imaginary conversations. It even tackles suicide. It may be a downer, but everyone who has been through this will identify.Often on-screen are a number of similar-looking, rain-soaked, muscular, shirtless young men who have the annoying habit of transforming into CGI wolves, followed by stock footage of CGI wolves fighting. These scenes could just as well have been realistic animations of suburban dogfights over unspayed females for all their originality.Taylor Lautner, who plays Jacob Black, has an astounding body with an eye-popping perfection that reminded be of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator I, though not as bulky. Lautner has a heart-meltingly handsome face. He is as lovable as a puppy, but he is too wooden. When he recites his lines in his urban nasal voice, I think of some awkward kid in a school play. It is like he does not believe what he is saying. He is just reading the lines. Further, his character is a bit like L'il Abner compared with the tortured complex Edward Cullen, so he is intrinsically not anywhere near as interesting. Joseph's shtick is being considerate, kind and gentle one minute and a rageoholic the next, like the Incredible Hulk, a cautionary tale for those who are attracted to the type.Bella often gets herself in trouble, but not with the nail-biting relentlessness of the first movie. The adrenalin level of this movie is much lower. It is more about heart-sickness than danger.The most amusing line in the movie, is from vampire, Alice Cullen, played by Ashley Green, about Bella ""I have never met anyone so prone to life-threatening idiocy"", as aside to the audience acknowledging the rather strained plot to keep Bella in predicaments.Like the original movie, it drifts back and forth between reality, magic realism and dream deliberately confusing you.The happy ending is so cruel. It will deceive so many into thinking if they but put their life on hold yet another decade, their heart's desire will be fulfilled.The most irritating feature of the movie: Bella drove me nuts with her juvenile concern with her relationship with Edward lasting forever and selfishly ignoring nurturing her relationships today.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well...not good!,"Well,i had read the books without being a huge fan or anything but i so far was disappointed from both Twilight movies. Twilight for me was one of the worst movies of 2008,maybe i had too many expectations from New Moon,i don't know and was disappointed in the end. Firsty i think Kristen Stewart is a terrible actress.She just stood motionless and boring throughout the film causing my constants yawning when she should have dazzled audiences with pain and sorrow.She had the whole movie on her back and wrecked it. Robert Pattinson was kind of improved in my opinion since Twilight but nothing dramatic...Awkward and indifferent. Taylor Laughtner on the other hand i think was very natural and cool in his role,especially during the period of his transformation.I wish they had him shirtless in less scenes so that he had a better an opportunity to be remembered for something else than his abs. Thank God for Billy Burke and Michael Sheen!!!I thought i would cut my veins without those two in the movie.Though i expected the role of Aro to be more...frightening? The screenplay was awful just like in Twilight,did not expect much anyway! However i liked the music very much and in my personal opinion it was a good call to replace the director.Anyway that's all from me. 4/10 max...",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Watch it, don't scrutinise it.","I'm not a serious 'twi-hard' fan, I only got into the whole thing in the summer. I put off reading the books because of the hype, I didn't want to jump on the band waggon. Four or five days and Breaking Dawn later, I can sympathise with the hype. The books after fantastic, even as a 22 year old female, they take you back to childhood fantasy, romance, lust and love.I of course watched Twilight, pretty much after I'd finished reading the book and loved it, it was fantastic seeing the pages of the book come to life. Yes the acting wasn't great, and some of the direction and script didn't really fit, but it was good. I watched it for what it was, a film, not a scene by scene take on how much it fitted the book.For New Moon I did exactly the same, went to our midnight showing with an open mind. I didn't think ""I hope the put this bit in, or this bit or this"". The film is derived from a book, a book and a film are two completely separate things, this is something I think a lot of people are forgetting. Bearing this in mind, I was extremely impressed by New Moon.My first big thumbs up was the direction, Chris Weitz has done a fantastic job. The cinematography, the locations, the colours, the soundtrack in particular were all just brilliant and fitted the film superbly. I actually think it stuck to the book a great deal more than a) I thought it would and b) Twilight did, but I do think you have to have a prior understanding of the whole thing. I can totally understand why somethings were left out, and some added too, like I said before if it was done page by page, it would probably be long, slow and un- enjoyable. I think New Moon is a more mature film, as in Twilight was a younger more inexperienced sibling, while New Moon is the well developed older brother.I honestly loved every second of the film, and couldn't believe when it was finally over. I don't think I've ever sat through a film with such a roller coaster of emotions, my heart pounded and bled, I shed tears and held my breath, which proves that all aspects of the film came together, flowed and captivated the mind. The actors I think have matured, especially Kirstend Stewart, she was just totally brilliant and I really connected with her, as I did with Bella in the book.All in all, I loved New Moon and am slightly annoyed it has only received 4.2 on IMDb. I know for a fact the people who gave it such a low rating will be the sceptics who hate Twilight. Also, I cannot wait for this to be released on DVD, watching it with in the comfort of my own room, as sitting in a theatre full of serious Twilighter going ooooo and ahhhh every time Edward was on screen or Jacob was topless ruined it slightly.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Director Chris Weitz screwed it up,"I am just coming back from the cinema... What should I mention first?Well, I think the first twilight is way better than this one. Because the studio changed directors, the whole ""twilight-feel"" that Catherine Hardwicke is gone... That is really a shame.Second, there is a lot of clich√© dialogue. People in the room where laughing at some points where it wasn't meant to... Of course the storyline remains strong, but i guess that is obvious.But there is some good stuff too. The scenes between Bella and Jacob are for the biggest part very romantic and sometimes even a bit erotic.There is also some neat CGI. The wolves looks realistic and there is good interacting with real life environment.For the fans of twilight this is definitely a must-see. For all who want just to see a romantic movie: watch the first twilight.I rate it 6 stars for the romantic scenes and the neat CGI",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
In hopes for something better & more alive,"As a starting point, i've read all the books (even though the last two were a bit weird and freaky)& seen the first film, which was indeed not very bad (probably that's just in my opinion but anyway)... As follows i wasn't waiting a lot but still hoped for something & i (in comparison to my little sister) really thought that it HAS to be good (at least because of the feelings all the characters are supposed to through - break-up, unhappy love etc.)... BUT back to the reality - film was very, very weak & mostly not even decent, what's actually a surprise considering all the money what's invested in it. & actually everything would be thousand times better, if the acting were at least good. Unfortunately, the acting was so bad (at least for some of the actors) that it made me sad & even sorry for them, because some of them seemed as to forced to say the lines and moved. OK, not all of them of course. I kind a enjoyed Jacob/Bella (acctually Taylor did pretty good job) story line (at least i believed them on the screen). To be honest, not Kirsten but just Taylor was good. I literally could not stand Robert (what is strange because i used to like him a lot in the first movie). The movie was the worst at the beginning (till he left) & at the end (when he returned). & this situation is a complete opposite to the book, because while reading it i felt vice versa. Robert looked either mad (completely nuts) or blank (most of the time). Kirsten was simply boring & without any emotions in the scenes with Robert. All the conversations between them looked as if they were talking about math or something even more boring. Taylor was surprisingly very good & he kind a saved the film (& Kirsten in some scenes). As about movie in general, i could say only that it was good that i was in the cinema, because otherwise i would have not watched it till the end or have skipped all the scenes with Robert & Kirsten on them...",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow,"The first movie was..OK..it was bearable..but wow the acting was terrible! Between the serious monotone speaking of Bella and Jacob, it would put you to sleep! My sister is a big fan of twilight and the books and she even stated that the movie was completely dull. Now if twilight fans are saying that the movie was dull and boring, its kind of a big statement towards the movie saying it was weak.Better wait for this one to come to your redbox in town if you want to see it, thats about all its worth.

embarrassing,"I am extremely bothered by the fact that the vampires in the twilight saga can come out into the sunlight. There have been many changes in vampire lore through out the years, but the most consistent component in a vampire story and pretty much the cornerstone for myth of vampirism is that they can't be exposed to sunlight. Once a vampire is exposed they die a painful and hideous death they don't simply glow and only come out when its cloudy. I feel that this concept is embarrassing to all vampire genres. I think Blade would even be upset at this silly notions.they incorporated pretty much all of the other components of vampire lore but left out or altered the main idea. I can't get past this and it. I think bells also accepts the fact that her love of her life is a non living night stalking creature. Even Sookie Stackhouse put up more of a fight before giving in. Thumbs down",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Review of New Moon by A Person Who Doesn't Hate Twilight and Is not a Teenager,"(Coming from a place where I read all the books, saw the first movie, and I'm not a teenage girl.)Light Romance and Light action mixed with Better than Narnia graphics,Teenage Romance, Angst, and Hunky actors make a decent movie experience, worth a matin√©e or student price.I did not like the first Twilight. New Moon was better, a lot better. The effects are better, the dialogue is better, the romance is better, the action is better. I think there are a lot of people who will give this a bad review just thinking about it from the hype, but that's not really what you have to do with this movie. It's pretty much like a lot of movies made for teenagers--but you expect more out of it because it's supposed to be a serious vampire film, and it's not one of those. It's never going to be Interview with a Vampire or Underworld.You go in expecting melodrama with a little action, cheesy teenage romance, and a lot of twitchy moves from Kristen Stewart--that's what this movie is. It's not worth 9.75 to me, so that's why I saw the matin√©e. I think it is worth it for the graphics and effects to see it on the big screen.My wish for Eclipse is that they use less camera movement between characters in really long dialogue scenes and tone down the symphony. I really didn't like that part and it gave me a headache to be constantly going back and forth--the scenes are already dramatic, let's not make it worse with wooshy camera moves and q.q violins.Taylor was easily the best character. Peter is as good as people are saying he is. Kristen did better this time, and Robert is Robert, I didn't really think the makeup team did him justice or Mike either for some reason--they all looked really bad compared to Taylor.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just a plain old bad movie,"They say this movie is aimed at teenage girls. Perhaps it is but surely this is an insult to their intelligence.I very often can get a good laugh at a badly scripted movie, but not this one. Ironically there is a scene in the movie of three characters going to see a guns all out blazing movie. One of the characters is displayed with a look of disgust on his face as he watches the nonsense on the screen. But how come I was saying to my self I wish I was watching that one.

"Still bad in a lot of ways, But this is better than Twilight!","I saw the first film Twilight when it came out and absolutely hated it. From the acting to the story and special effects to the script and dialogue. I promised myself I would never ever see New Moon. I broke that promise as I saw it at my university at the film society with friends who were girls who begged me to come along. I was bored at the time and it was free and thought I could just fall asleep or maybe laugh at how awful it is but heavens above! This was actually mildly enjoyable! What has helped maybe I don't know is the new director Chris Weiz who took over from Catherine Hardwicke. The main problem still with the last film that hasn't changed is the acting from Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. It's still really awful. There is still no chemistry between them and Stewart with her character of Bella is still boring and won't smile and just broods about. The two actors can't seem to finish a sentence without pausing awkwardly as though they have forgotten there lines. What Stewart and Pattinson need to do is eject more emotion into there voices that would convince me that they care about each other. Weiz has failed to instruct the actors more. The script and dialogue don't help as it is corny and clunked. Though less so than in Twilight that is an improvement. Another criticism is that the guys in the film always seem to have there damn shirts off. Have they heard of a shirt? Now obviously it's done because the teenage girls love it but logically within the realism that should be apparent in the film, it's just silly. Guys no matter if they are werewolves or vampires don't run about with there shirts off! But that is a minor criticism. Some of the music was also cringing, particularly one track that was played a couple of times when Bella was missing Edward, the girl couldn't sing!However one big improvement is those special effects, they were much better! Because more was spent on the film. When the guy Jacob and his friends transform from human to werewolf and vice versa was impressive to watch. I also did like some of the music as well. But the best thing about the film, which made the rating even this high was Taylor Lautner who played Jacob. His acting was surprisingly good. There was emotion in his voice when he talked to Bella and told her how he felt, which made me believe he really did care for her. (Take note Stewart and Pattinson) Other actors in it like Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Michael Sheen as the vampire Aro and Anna Kendrick as Jessica who is Bella's friend make the most of there tiny cameos. In the end New Moon was watchable but still too long. I would be willing to see the third one and hope that there will continue to be improvement, hopefully with Stewart and Pattinson's acting. If it does get better along with better dialogue and script (though in New Moon it was better than Twilight) I would give it a higher rating. This is bad in a lot of ways but there have been improvements and are some good things about it. Believe me I'm surprised I even mildly enjoyed it. Let's hope the third continues on the road to improvement.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad,"Great movie, go see it!Now for the other reviews above - what a bunch of wan*ers! I have not read the books and I only saw this flick today by a fluke of timing. The midnight viewing had only one ticket left when I asked, so I thought why not. I had been told it was just a chick-flick and I wouldn't like it, but I'm glad I did see it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm predicting it will make a truck load of money for all involved. Judging by the reaction of the audience, I'm sure I'm not alone in saying this will be considered the number 1 movie of 2009.True, it isn't really my kind of movie - True Blood is better, but the prior brainless comments prompted me to give my honest opinion, because IMHO they didn't!I haven't mentioned anything about the movie New Moon, because I don't wish to spoil anyones viewing pleasure, but if you liked Twilight this sequel will drive you crazy - it is a lot better!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
C'mon PEOPLE! Don't be so harsh.,"Holy crap, it really wasn't that bad! This book was my absolute favorite and I thought they did fine on the movie. I love Hardwicke so much better, but this movie still doesn't deserve a 4.5 out of 10. You people get so obsessed with making sure every detail from the book is in the movie- it can't work that way! Plus most people hate this book too, so of course you are going to hate the movie- and you can't just leave it out of the film series; it's too important! I thought it was funny, cute and entertaining. I hate chick flicks, but I enjoyed this! Yeah, the acting was horrible, but it did not detract too much from the movie. It's no academy award winner, but I would see it again and buy it. I know the movie was already 2+ hours, but I would've enjoyed more!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I just feel like crying...,"First of all, I am pleased to say that I may be the only Brazilian girl who's not in love with Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, and, of course, the Twilight saga (both books and movies)... I seriously think that the book is poorly written and definitely improvised, knowing that Stephenie Meyer has NEVER SEARCHED anything from VAMPIRES (the main topic in the books), and just pretending that she invented all the vampires mythology, she made a vampire that SHINES. A vampire that can HAVE SEX with someone... a vampire who's got a CHILD. And Bella, STOP talking about Cathy and Heathcliff. They're awesome, which you and Eddy will never be.OK, but that's not my point. Kristen Stewarts acting AND face just scares me. Taylor Lautner was actually good, although his character hasn't helped at all. Robert Pattinson was just fine in Harry Potter. But once again, Edward came into him bringing JUST AWFULNESS.And SO, SO bad directed! I really feel like crying. And WHY are people in love with that?! WHY?!(Sorry about the mistakes, as I said, I'm from Brazil)",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is what I was afraid of...,"I held New Moon to the utmost standard. I had very high hopes for the film and I put my trust into all of the professionals who produced it. Maybe all of this is the reason why I left the midnight show feeling disappointed. I saw Twilight without having any idea what it was about or what kind of affect it would have on me. I simply fell in love! I read all of the books in a matter of weeks, as well as drove through a snowstorm to pick up the third installment, and could not wait until the second movie was produced. However, considering the fact that the entire production seemed rushed, I worried it would not be all that I had hoped for. My nightmare came true...Don't get me wrong, I am a true fan and will always remain loyal to the Twilight series, whatever the faults. Any other fan of the series, who is willing to look past the character swoon-factor, is also going to leave the theater feeling empty, incomplete, disappointed, etc. For my complaints: New Moon had segments so awkward it was embarrassing. The audience laughed when it was not meant to be funny. Specifically, an incredibly corny scene depicting Bella as a vampire. As another example, when Edward kisses Bella outside her house on her birthday (*cringe*) many people around me perceived Pattinson's display of emotion as a sexual ejaculation.And don't even get me started on Pattinson's costume design and make-up. What happened to the Edward I fell in love with from Twilight? The breathtakingly beautiful creature who lit up the screen? I know he is supposed to look inconsolable and gutted throughout New Moon but he's lost something that used to make him sparkle (and not in the literal sense).The break-up scene: when I read the book I was crushed when Edward left Bella. I cried through the entire chapter and even some following. Watching the film, all of the emotions I felt from reading the book were summed up to a mere lump in the throat. I don't know if it was the acting or the writing that spoiled it but I truly believe the music, or lack-thereof, had a real effect. In fact, the music throughout the entire film felt unsuitable. Nothing like it was from Twilight which was a perfect fit and made you feel connected to the dialogue and character emotions. I was unable to connect with anything from the New Moon soundtrack.Lastly, the relationship between Jacob and Bella. If I hadn't read the book, I would have wondered where their sudden relationship came from. Producers compressed their months of bonding and flirting in Jacob's garage into a ten-minute time lapsing segment. From Twilight, Jacob's feelings toward Bella are implied but in New Moon, there are very few elusions to a romantic relationship until the movie scene.I was impressed by the CGI and how they animated the wolf phasing. I am glad that it was accurate to the book in that it is a true phase rather than a morphing process which can be depicted as creepy and unpleasant. I also enjoyed the wolf pack, few lines as they had. I was very excited that Michael Sheen from Underworld was casted as a leading member of the Volturi. I felt that he brought a higher standard of acting to the film and made a perfect Aro. It was also a little ironic that after playing a Lycan/werewolf that is now a vampire¬Ögo figure.Thank the Lord they let up on the blue/green contrast from Twilight. New Moon also includes reds and yellows which are easy on the eyes. Speaking of eyes, the contacts, both red and gold, were a little overdone in New Moon. I enjoyed the subtle differences between a human and a vampire that were depicted in Twilight.While I can't change the fact that Edward begins to rub me the wrong way in New Moon, that is due to the source, Stephanie Meyer. Overall, I thought the pace was good and I enjoyed the acting in such an indulging story. However, I feel that Weitz and Co. had so much potential to make the story something to swoon over. Regretfully, the swooning was nothing more than skin deep as the characters and dialogue lacked depth and heart. I am apprehensive to even see Eclipse, but maybe now that my expectations have been lowered, Weitz will be given another chance to make me fall in love again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love the book not the movie,Firstly i am not a hater as there is actually no bigger twilight saga fan than me and i loved twilight i thought the casting was perfect i love that they chose an English actor as i am also English. But New Moon was just badly directed it focused on tiny details that didn't need more than a few seconds of screen time and missed out some key plots which will now have to be missed in eclipse as they didn't happen in new moon it wasn't artistic or sensitive some of the camera movement seemed like it had been ripped from the Blair witch project it was so bad i was extremely disappointed.I hope that Eclipse will be better or i will just not watch any more and it actually pains me to say that.,2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great adaptation of the book,I wish people would stop trying to judge these movies as if they are meant to be some cinematic masterpiece to change the times. It's an adaptation of a young adult fantasy romance. Give it a rest. It's not meant to be realistic. the characters are supposed to be over dramatic. This movie does a great job representing the book and the casting could not be more spot on.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was exactly what I needed,"I had a cold and I was home alone with nothing to do. I didn't feel like doing anything but watching a movie.I wasn't in the mood for anything profound or challenging. And I didn't want to watch some masterpiece because i'd only be wasting it on blocked-nose me.So then I found this was on TV and it was just perfect. An unpretentious bit of fun. It's not funny but it doesn't have any pretence to the contrary (unlike most bad comedies).An engaging enough narrative with a heroin I could happily marry. (My god is Kristen Stewart sexy). All realized with professionalism and atmosphere.Sure I've forgotten most of its plots finer points but when I needed something easy, enjoyable, well made but disposable then this hit the jackpot.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Don't be blinded by the fad, this is the truth.","Don't count me as some ""Twilight, fantasy chick flick"" hater, because I loved the book series and enjoyed the Twilight movie. Realistically the only good acting was Taylor, he transformed physically to become Jacob and his acting was rather spot on for his role. Everyone else was disbelieving and in some cases a little annoying (Kristen/Robert)!The movie was a basic adaptation to the book but when it was off it caused you to wonder if it was still new moon or a different book movie all together. I understand why they added some action scenes because lets be realistic, if they followed the book word for word everyone who hadn't read the book would have left the theatre thinking, ""Where was the vampire vs. werewolf stuff?""UPSIDE: Great effects, good laughs, and good action at points.THE BIGGEST FLAW: This movie is an absolute horrible message for young girls. It promotes, and in some cases allows teen girls to completely break down and risk their life for someone they are ""in love with""! The reason I say this is a bad message is that all teenage girls think they are in love, and that if they were to have their hearts broken it's okay if they just break down till some other guy can help them get better... sorry but that just isn't healthy.I'll leave with... Parents be wary and boyfriends, if you sucked it up through Twilight sorry but life's going to get a little worse when she forces you to go see this with her.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My thoughts on New Moon,"I want to say that I have read all the books of Twilight. The books I feel were pretty good. I am all for fantasy. Anything that helps me escape the reality of my life. I had a very hard time putting the books down. Now for the movies I felt let down. Twilight was good but it could have been better if there had been more feeling put into it. Some not all of the actors showed more than a few emotions in their voice and expressions. Now in New Moon I saw the trailer for it and couldn't wait for the movie to come out. I waited for hours to see it due to it being sold out. I was more disappointed in this film than the first one. It doesn't even come close to the book. I was bored watching this film. When I left the theater I was felt unsatisfied. So a week later I went back to see it again thinking that maybe just maybe I had missed something. Nope, I hadn't missed anything. There were a lot of holes in the movie. Stuff that they shouldn't have left out. If I hadn't of read the books I would have been confused. I feel for the movie being 2 hours long there was a lot of the plot missing. Yes, I will give them the credit of having good graphics but that is it. I expected way more passion and connection between Bella (Kristen & Robert)and Edward than they gave. Their acting was soooo not up to par. I hope Eclipse is so much more than this one. I hope that maybe some of the actors and the director of the next movie read these comments and learn from them. I mean aren't they making these movies to connect and entertain the fans of the Twilight series? keeping my fingers crossed!!!!!!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Puppy love pathetic,"Twilight Saga: New Moon is probably the most pathetic film I've seen in these recent years. It's so mushy, filled with ""puppy love"" eyes and pathetic sighs that I think it may only be suited to those 14 to 16 year old girls that are helplessly in love with their senior colleagues that don't actually give a crap about them. The only thing that can actually keep you in your seat, besides your girlfriend :D, is this overly exaggerated drama that you can make fun of.So... my point is, if your girlfriend's dragging you to this movie because she likes that Robert Pattinson dude and you can't do anything about it, at least trick some of your friends in to joining you and make fun of those ""almost kissing"" scenes where little Meg Ryan wannabe(Kristen Stewart) almost has an orgasm :)",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kristen Stewart Still Can't Act,"It was too much to hope that a different director was going to be able to pull an acting performance out of Kristen Stewart. She is a beautiful young woman, which you acknowledge inwardly, but that's all you get for 2 hours. Whatever else she has performed successfully, or not, does not matter. I went to see New Moon, and I wanted to see acting in New Moon.She has virtually the same expression on her face throughout, which is boring, and that defines her performance: boring. She can't deliver an intelligible line to save her soul, which drove me to distraction in the first movie (the constant blinking tic is gone in this movie, small relief). She still mumbles the ends of too many sentences. If speaking at the speed of light is a skill, that she has. Maybe you have to be a vampire to hear her.She does serve the purpose of making her male co-stars look better talent-wise, and that gets everyone more excited to see Edward or Jacob in her scenes. However, she brings the movies down, and really makes them less than their potential, which is a real shame because the books held a lot of promise, but they do center around the feelings of Bella, and Kristen Stewart apparently has none that she can deliver, save ennui.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as good as the OG movie..!,"First of all, when I first watched the teaser of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it, but not as much as I did with the previous movie. The plot of the sequel was interesting, but not innovative because it was kinda similar to the previous movie. Unfortunately, the storyline wasn't well-written and it was very simple. The characters were the same as before, but they were very well-developed. The casting choices were the same and their performances were better. In my opinion, it wasn't an intense movie (except, the last 30 minutes) and there weren't any shocking twists. The opening scene was unpredictable, fast-paced and promising. The 2nd act was kinda slow paced and not really interesting. However, the 3rd act was probably, the best part of the movie and the fight scene was great. Moreover, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both well done. Overall, ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" was just a nice sequel, kinda intense and I would probably recommend it to my friends!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't bother unless you're a fan,"Well, this is 2 more than I gave the first movie.I haven't read the book - of the comments that I've read, if you've read the books you seem to give it a higher rating.I found the storyline incredibly hard to follow. Most of the special effects were really bad and were akin to the d-grade movies of the 50s.The scene where Jake turns into the wolf above Bella was great - except that all the wolves, which weren't meant to be scary, looked disneyesque. They all looked so cute and cuddly that they weren't remotely scary. When Jake turns into the wolf to threaten Robert Pattinson, it looked like it was a dog wanting to be patted.It got more interesting when it moved to Italy - the Voltari bit was the only bit in the movie that had any real tension. But how they got there was weird. One minute she's in Forkes, the next she's in a car in Italy with no explanation of how she got there.Despite it being done by a different director, it still has the same bad makeup. The vampires' faces are painted white,but their necks are normal colour. But the funniest is that they'd painted stripes on Robert Pattison's body to make him look more muscular (a common Hollywood trick) but instead of making him look muscular, it made him look like a skinny guy with stripes painted on his body.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I Like It In Spite of the Bad Reviews,"I wholeheartedly agree that Vampires don't sparkle and they and Werewolves are generally not day-walkers but in the Twilight universe they are this way - it's that simple. I like the fact that something different is added to the legends of the Vampires and Werewolves - and I'm a huge fan of classic horror!!There is something about Kirsten Stewart that reminds me of Lisa Maire Presley - those looks she gives at times. And her acting is alright... maybe not the best actress but she's certainly better than many other actors I've seen over the years (I watch a lot of B and Z films).As far as the New Moon story, it's fine... it's just leading us the next film, the story is building. And on that note, I like this film better than the first one.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Bad.  It's for the diehards.,I loved the books and first movie flaws and all. New Moon is not without flaws but enjoyable for a die-hard fan.The movie is long and rather slow paced but if you love the world of Twilight then you don't mind. Kristen Stewart holds the movie together. Luckily there's a strong actress for the part of Bella otherwise this movie would fail miserably. She truly delivers the pain of losing Edward. There were tears in my eyes during the break up scene.As for the wolves - Taylor was decent but the rest of them need to take some acting lessons.The Volturi - Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning were fabulous! I adore Robert Pattinson but his constant look of pain in the movie is overdone. I wish he'd stop scrunching up his forehead. It became distracting after awhile. He isn't on screen much but he was pretty good.Overall the effects are better in New Moon than Twilight as well as the acting. But I enjoyed the story in Twilight better than New Moon. Of the four Twilight books I enjoyed New Moon the least. Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy the movie as much.Definitely go see the movie though!!!!,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much ado...,"I had been waiting for this movie for all those months. I got my tickets early enough and now I just feel disappointed and fooled.The only truly good things in the movie was the acting and the effects.

So pompous that even the acting didn't save the situation.Don't get me wrong, I know that it is another think to visualize something in your own head and another to actually see it through someone else's perspective but again... It was just too much! I feel so utterly disappointed because I loved the books and for me they didn't even try to get the book's meanings through the movie. It was all just too SUPERFICIAL. Made only to satisfy the eyes and not the brain. And that is something I can't stand when I have high expectations from something. I mean, the book made me cry more than once.

"Drag, drag, drag, big face, soulful glance, red lips, slouch, pine, pine, pine, drag, drag, drag","The Twilight Saga [2]: New Moon (2:10, PG-13) ‚Äî Other: Romance, biggie, sequel, OSIT romanticsIn The Grand Jubilee (1981), the middle book of Suzette Haden Elgin's Ozark Fantasy Trilogy, we meet Responsible of Brightwater, age 15. Her far-future world is run mainly by the grannies, who disdain men as hapless tools of testosterone poisoning and who can think of no more contemptuous put-down of any woman than to say ""She just can't cope."" Young Responsible need not be concerned that anyone would ever think that of her, as she is highly competent as well as responsible.In contrast, we have Bella Swan, 3 years older than Responsible as this movie begins, a hapless drip, slouching thru life without direction or visible competence at anything except mindless devotion, mooniness, and wounded-doe looks. I kept wanting to shake her and say ""For goodness sake, girl, stand up straight! Get a grip!"".But no, Bella (Kristen Stewart) has been abandoned by her One True Love, the 109-year-old teenage vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) because (a) he fears that his presence will bring her danger, (b) he dreads staying young as she ages, and (c) the latter can be avoided only if she becomes a vampire too, but that would cost her soul. So he bails, and she spends endless hours pining soulfully away, interrupted only occasionally by phantasmal images of Edward warning her against the various stupid decisions to which she seems prone.Things brighten up for Bella a bit when she renews her acquaintance with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), a 16-year-old Indian lad who attends school on the nearby reservation. They spend a lot of time hanging out together in the most platonic manner imaginable. It gives away nothing you didn't already know to say that Jacob (like many other young men of his tribe) is a werewolf, and these guys have tempers that sometimes make them as dangerous as vampires around a paper cut.Drag, drag, drag, big face, drag, drag, pine, pine, pine, soulful glance, big face, soulful glance, overripe lips, slouch, big face, pine, drag, drag, drag.Bella finally reconnects with Edward in Italy, where he's gone to ask for death at the hands of the Vulturi (vampire aristocracy), having been misled into thinking Bella is dead. (Any echoes of the opening references to Romeo and Juliet being, I'm sure, purely coincidental.) Here we encounter Michael Sheen, the Alcibiades of the undead, moonlighting (heh) from his role as king werewolf in the Underworld series to switch sides and serve here as Aro, duke of the vampires.* Aro is suitably oily and sinister, and his investigation of Bella reveals that she isn't subject to any of the normal vampire powers (such as Alice's precognition or Jane's telekinesis, heretofore unsuspected talents in the vampiric repertoire). This is our 1st glimmer of any degree of competence on Bella's part.Director Chris Weitz and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg spend no significant time reintroducing the characters, evidently figuring (probably correctly) that 99.99% of the people attending this movie had already seen Twilight and/or read the books. But this leads to a curious distancing from the characters. They remain beautiful, but it's harder to identify with them, and the innate interest of the basic plot doesn't suffice to offset this tepidity, let alone the glacial pacing.FWIW, I gave Twilight a 7, and this one gets a 5 mainly out of inertia and good will, but the series is headed the wrong way; #3 (Eclipse, due out June 30 next year) needs to pick up the pace to avoid total snoozification.‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì*If the 2 vampire vs. werewolf franchises ever get into trial by combat over rights to Sheen, I'd put my money on Kate Beckinsale over Kristen Stewart any day; Kate can cope!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazingly bad,"I don't like the books. I read them and they are rubbish IMHO. Then I watched Twilight and LOVED IT.This movie ruined all that. The plot goes too slowly, and then too quickly. Some key scenes were so anti-climatic you really felt deflated, like you were melting into your chair trying to get away from the screen. Don't even get me started on how disjointed the plot was laid out. If you haven't read the books, you'd be completely and utterly lost, it doesn't stand on its own two feet.Kirsten Stewart gives us the same looks as in Twilight, looks like she forgot to act like her character had grown. The performances by Jackson Rathbone, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are commendable though, especially Rathbone, adding many more layers to his character whilst still portraying his true nature accurately and with flair.The only parts that saved this movie were the man candy, and the plot progression. I'm still really excited about where the story is going, I just hope the next movie does it justice.Don't wait for the DVD - its worth seeing those hawt men on the big screen, but lower your expectations first so you're not as disappointed as I was.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not as good as the first or third,"The Twilight Saga: New Moon is probably the the third best in the series. It's not as good or entertaining as the first or eclipse in my opinion. The cast and acting is pretty much all the exact same, it's a little cheesy at times but overall it's fair. The script is average, it's really what you would expect from this type of film. This movie explores Bella's relationship with Jacob (Taylor Lautner). After Edward leaves her because of an attack that nearly kills her, she copes some by her friendship with Jacob. I liked seeing her relationship with Jacob play out and what all that meant, and I think that Kristen Stewart handled this movie well. This installment is less entertaining though than the other ones because there are moments in the movie, long stretches of time where it's pretty dull, nothing much of any importance goes on. And that is why I'm not rating it as high as twilight or eclipse. The movie just becomes boring in places, and I wish they would've done more to make it more interesting in those places. The visual effects are done pretty well, miles better than breaking dawn. Overall, of you're a twilight saga fan, you'll probably like it. I liked it alright, I thought it was fair, but not to the caliber of the first or third, but better than the breaking dawns. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than you think!,"I watched the movie with a friend of mine who has never read the books; she watched the last half of twilight and didn't like it much. Basically, she didn't know much about the series at all. So from her enthused reaction to the movie, I knew I wasn't being bias because I'm a fan. The chemistry between Taylor Lautner and Kristen Stewart was much better than I was expecting-beating out what we saw between Pattinson and Stewart in the previous movie. The acting was not God-awful but could have been better, and I have to admit that I had a few ""I could have said that line better than that"" moments. However, even the acting is a big step up from the last one. Especially from Stewart who had me cringing at her deliveries in Twilight-I was embarrassed for her. Lautner however steals the show. Pattinson I think does well but was not given much to work with. His character requires that sort of constantly in melancholy, internal battle, unrequited love embodiment, and I think he does that well. The effects were very impressive. Chris Weitz does an amazing job. He exceeded all my high expectations, which is definitely saying a lot. The story is heartbreaking, and yet light humor throughout keeps the viewer's heart from being completely crushed to a pulp; this statement maybe more true for the female viewer-ship though. I loved it. Everyone who was in the theater with me loved it (though I wish they would have kept it to themselves while watching). If you have an open-mind for fantasy, and not a complete cynic then you should love it too. It stays true to the book for those who were upset over changes in twilight. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Long and lacks flow, great effects","Alright I'm 40 and a Dad, I read all the books because I monitor what my girls read. Thought the books were excellent.Watched Twilight very well put together and flowed well.Now for ""New Moon""...I was disappointed.I believe that switching directors in this case may have altered the personality of the film to much. (Maybe that was the goal) But the lack of genuine chemistry being portrayed between the characters was almost annoying. You can copy and paste the ""mushy"" sequences because they don't change at all. Same head tilt same lip curl. I believe as a director you have to notice those things in a movie to make it believable.First 35mins are long, good moments but long.The main interest points for me were the return of various characters from Twilight to move the story forward and the sequences regarding the high court of the vampires.This movie was built to please teen girls (and the three older ladies behind me yesterday) And it has lost some of it's general audience strength. To many no shirt moments and not enough story telling.Overall I think they took a fairly long book filmed what they could then edited it to the point of it being choppy and lacking real flow. Continuous shortened scene after shortened scene with no real smooth transitions to guide us through the film. Hopefully we get a director's cut that will need to be about 3 hours long but will be worth it, I hope.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Nice effects, shame about the dialogue.","Okay so I'll first admit that I am not a fan of Twilight. I haven't seen the first film or read the books. Neither do I indulge in any of the teenage-girl drooling over Robert Pattison.But I'm not one to judge without trying, so when a friend asked me along to New Moon I went along with an open mind, willing to pick up the story as it went along. Seeing all the hype around it, I hoped it would be an exciting ride.Oh boy.And here I can review without the taint of obsessed fan-girl love or by comparison to the books. I will just review New Moon as an independent film. It is weak with a capital W-E-A-K.The script sounds like it has been penned by a 12 year old girl who still fawns over boy bands and watches Disney movies. It is just a set of clich√© after clich√©, without any real character development. Unsurprising however, as the majority of the actors appear to have been hired based on their appearance rather than their acting credentials. The two leads especially did absolutely nothing for me, and the main male characters just spent as much time as possible with their abs on show to distract you from the lack of plot.The plot itself, without giving anything away, is just a weepy mess about a girl who can't look after herself without some mysterious guy running to her rescue every 5 seconds. Yawn.One thing. The special effects were pretty stunning, especially when it came to the werewolves. But I think that may have had something to do with the millions of pounds they threw at this film, shame they didn't spend more on the actual script.Not anywhere near worth the hype it is afforded.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
disappointingly predictable and lacking substance,"Twilight:new moon provides the viewer with an eye pleasing cast (especially for the females) that unfortunately give a callous, hard and feeling less performance. The director, Chris Weitz, will do well from this film not due to the quality of the film, as it is non-existent, but only due to the hype it has been given before hand. The long dragged film is all to familiar, pathetically predicable and ordinary. The film is flat and unsubstantial with no twists or turns to be surprised by. Due to the familiar plot the next step can always be predicted accurately before the sequence of events begins. The audiences minds remain dormant throughout this film with no imagination needed and no complexity to think through. Everything is handed to the viewer on a plate and fed straight to them allowing for the audience to sleep through the simplicity of the film.Who is Bella? she wishes to give her soul for a lifetime of love with the vampire she longs for. Well that is what the story suggests but Kirsten Stweart shows none of this through her act and as for Robert Pattison... I have seen more emotion on the face of a cockroach! Without all the vampires and werewolves this film would have been the simple love story seen so many times and quite probably the better for it however with the vampires the film tries to grow a new dimension. It seems to end up confused between a thriller and a a love story. Unfortunately due to this cross and confusion the film is unnecessarily extensive, slow and to put it bluntly BORING!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply Awful.,"Let's see, where to begin...I hated the first film and thought, hey I might as well venture along to see this one. I figured there was no possible way it could be any worse than the first with the budget and hype and all.Boy was I wrong. The film was probably in the worst 10 movies I have EVER seen, especially with the promotion and money put into production. The acting was HORRIFIC. The smaller roles actually did a fairly good job of developing their own characters with the writing constraints as bad as they were, but the main characters (the main 3) DO NOT KNOW HOW TO ACT! Why? I haven't the faintest clue, but I'm telling you, the only reason they are in the movie are for the whole ""sex appeal"" thing. Did they even have to audition besides taking off their shirts? Honestly, no character development, excessively cheesy one-liners, and NO EMOTION WHATSOEVER.The script was terrible also. The actors, even if they were outstanding, could not have saved the writing. No plot progression. It spend a good portion featuring her staring a motorcycle, then decided to completely skip any explanation and jump into a cheesy romance line designed for impressionable adolescent girls. I have not the books, so following the plot was quite difficult. It was altogether absent from the movie. Quick synapse of the movie: Kristen crying over Robert at one point, and showing no expression of emotion at the rest. Kristen staring at Taylor, Taylor taking off his shirt, Kristen blinking rapidly in Italy, Rob throwing out a few lines of how much in contrast of the rest of the movie he actually is, and then Kristen running back to him while he stands hunchback and glares at the wolf. Not much of a plot. And besides the obvious fact, that vampires firstly do not exist, but are in fact portrayed as creatures from h**l, it seems that the author and the screenplay writer are creating a sort of delusion amongst teenage girls. Whether they understand that this is NOT HOW LIFE IS or not, it's NOT HEALTHY to be that obsessed over a stupid fictional story.Women often say men are shallow, but I vouch that anyone who truly enjoyed this movie on the basis of ""romance"" (to which there honestly was little), are the shallow ones. Little girls screaming at Taylor taking off his clothing was about all the romantic content in this movie, apart from Rob existing for the majority of the audience.Any good points? The backup characters. They did what little they could to lend themselves to the film. Is it worth seeing? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Thankfully, I did not waste my own $10.00 viewing this catastrophe.I frown upon anyone who views these Twilight films with cult mannerism. It's one thing to love cult movies such as Anchorman, Fight Club, or even the recent Men Who Stare at Goats, but this is so poorly written I would hope and pray that all these spoiled, impressionable teenagers would open up their eyes and take a little look at what life really is.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's not right, but its OK.","Chris Weitz doesn't seem to take thesource material quite as seriously as Catherine Hardwicke did, so thedull, grainy trying-to-look-edgy photography is gone, and the filmmakers seem to be having more fun with the Volturi, who are immensely entertaining in a campy kind of way. There is also a wonderful sequence where Bella Swann is under water and in more danger than she realizes.Unfortunately, we don't meet the Volturi until nearly two thirds through the movie, and that little water sequence is a very brief scene in a movie that's more than 2 hours long. For the rest of the film, we have to deal with the supremely mopey Kristen Stewart as, who has turned in fine performances in films such as ""Into the Wild"" and ""Adventureland"", but here is playing below her pay-grade. After Edward breaks up with her, she decides her life is over and mopes for what feels like an eternity. This isn't particularly interesting or entertaining. In Twilight, Edward and Bella's romance seemed to be utterly miserable. THere were very few moments of happiness between them, making their infatuation harder to swallow. In New Moon, there are attempts to show that Bella and Edward actually enjoy each other's company, but for the most part they are horribly cheesy (such as a scene where they are jogging together in slow-mo) Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black is charismatic and sweet, but this is undermined by Bella's depression. It's hard (and depressing) to believe that such a ""winner"" would be devoted to anyone so self-involved. And the fact that he takes of his shirt at any and every opportunity, however contrived, makes it clear that this isn't a movie for discerning audiences, but super soft core porn for female audiences (not that that's a bad thing in and of itself, but it certainly detracts from the supposedly ""intense"" narrative). In conclusion, this is definitely an improvement on its predecessor and there are some good things, but they are too few and far between to merit a viewing in the cinema.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
MY ULTIME FAVOURITE MOVIE,"READ THE BOOKS AND THIS WILL BE EVEN BETTER. This is how some people are when they are depressed. They don't care about what other people think of them and they do dangerous things because they no longer care about life. I have watched this movie upward of 100 times. My friend and I when we are having a bad day or a hard week will binge watch the entire series and feel a thousand times better. The movie might have some flaws but that makes it all the more better. Bella is suppose to be that way, that's who she is. We all are not perfect. I think her character is way more relatable than most other movies who are ""perfect"". Read the books and you will love the series that much more. It is quirky and shows so much love at the same time. Things don't always go to plan. It's showing one persons life story, yes there are red flags but we all have been in relationships like that... Her and Edward grow together and make each other better for it. He does love her and the more they are together the better he will love her. This movie does not deserve the hate it is getting. Life is strange, let it go.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

New Moon--love!,"If you didn't like the books or twilight why are you watching New Moon? That is so irritating. The movie stays true to the book, and I loved it! Also-I'm not a tween or teen and hate being characterized in that group. This movie had a fantastic mix of all ages of twilight fans, and yes this may appeal more to women. When guys dominate the box office for action movies that's cool..yet many are cheesy, but if women like a movie it is boring? Give me a break. If you are a fan of the books, you will enjoy it. New Moon was the least favorite of the book series for me, but the acting was fantastic by the three leads. Kristen captured all the emotions perfectly. Taylor really stepped into the limelight to take a leading role in this movie. And Robert Pattinson--plays the tortured vampire to a T. Loved it! In regards to some of the critics reviews being poor--cranky old men just don't ""get it"", and it sucks that they are in a position that people will hang on what they say. When have you been to a movie that you loved and was poorly reviewed? We have all been there! Choose for yourself. Oh, and for all you people saying vampires don't do this and that? Really? Last time I checked Vampires were fictional and there is no right or wrong in fiction!!Twilight fans--things to look for: The Chapters in the book that were blank, Cliffdiving, and the ending.

Slightly Disappointing,"As a huge fan of the books and the first Twilight film I waited with baited breath for the release of New Moon, only to be slightly disappointed.That‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt enjoy the film but I personally felt that it lacked on the emotions side. I have a tendency to cry at everything and when I didn‚Äôt cry when Edward (the lush Robert Pattinson) left Bella (teen sensation Kristen Stewart) I thought something was wrong. Being such an emotionally written book, I was slightly confused at why the emotional side of things didn‚Äôt come over in the film. Then I realised, it‚Äôs because it was a male director who had the say. Typically as far as guys and films go, it‚Äôs all action and no emotion, everything just black and white, there‚Äôs no grey.The director of New Moon, Chris Weitz- Who is mostly known for his long list of producing projects, which includes all the American Pie films, did (true to his word) stay close to the book. Despite the fact that he was the director for two films I really enjoyed (About a Boy and Golden Compass) I really do feel that he didn‚Äôt do the film side of the twilight saga justice. Like I‚Äôve said already, I‚Äôm not slating him for anything really; I just think that some decisions could have been made better by a woman. And no, I wouldn‚Äôt class myself as a feminist in any sense of the word (not say feminist are bad in any way). So this idea that I bare is not because I‚Äôm ‚Äòdoing it for the girls‚Äô. My reasoning is this;I truly believe that Catherine Hardwicke (the director of the first of the twilight saga) should have been the director for the entire saga, after all consistency is the key. I mean god look at Mission Impossible (all six million of them) it‚Äôs practically the same thing in every movie. Okay maybe consistency to that extent is a little excessive, but you get my point. The first film: Twilight sets a bar. A bar that pushed my expectations and everyone else‚Äôs real high. I suppose that‚Äôs what happens when a film ticks all the boxes. The music was fantastic, the acting superb and directing brilliant. Slightly Disappointing In light of all this I came to the conclusion that, although I‚Äôve excitedly awaited New Moon like the rest of you crazy Twilighters, I feel slightly disappointed. The music for instance, did not leave a lot to be desired, unlike the first film. I‚Äôm going to give the music another go, to make sure I‚Äôm not just dismissing it. The lack of emotion really bugged me, again in comparison, the first film took us on Bella‚Äôs journey, we as an audience lived and felt what she felt. Whereas New Moon feels as though we are just watching and standing on the side lines. The only part of the film that made my heart race was the intense fight scene in Italy, and again I as a watcher didn‚Äôt feel Bella‚Äôs pain, I just felt as though I was watching an action movie.The acting was brilliant and I loved the new cast members (little Dakota Fanning!!), and the film over all looked great.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For teenagers,"Attempt to spend any intelligent analysis of creation of director is initially doomed to failure. Film ""Twilight. The Saga.

Money Grab,"I was really excited about the release of this movie. I read all four books, and ""New Moon"" was definitely my favorite. Even though I gave this movie low marks, I'll try to be fair. I thought the CGI was pretty impressive. There was plenty of eye candy in the movie, too. Now, for the cons. However, cramming all of book two into a two-hour movie just tried to cover too much ground. They counted on one-liners to fill in huge amounts of the story. It left me feeling like I was reeling... jumping from scene to scene just to cover everything. As for the ""love story"" in all this... it was pretty lame. I agree with other comments that there was no real chemistry between Bella and Jacob, or Bella and Edward... or Bella and anyone. Kristen Stewart spent the whole film looking miserable, petulant, and even a little whiny. The way they ended the film really bothered me, too. I won't ""spoil"" it for any readers, but it was a total set-up for the third film. I hate when I'm conned out of my money just so Hollywood can make MORE money. It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love it for what it is,"7 out of 10 for changes from the book that were unnecessary. Obviously the story does need to condensed, but outright changes are really annoying. A few cheesy moments that make you chuckle, but this is a story about teens. Forget the vampire trappings. The immortality bit is just the icing on the cake. Who doesn't want to live forever and look nice while doing it? The reason this story appeals is because so many people want to find a ""soulmate."" If you have ever fallen irrationally in love, then you get it. It is an old story wrapped up in a supernatural package. She sees him, she wants him, he appears aloof, he actually is madly interested, and they crash together like a couple of meteors. Wow. Who wouldn't find that kind of attraction exciting? Come on. As a middle-aged adult that got lucky enough to marry the guy she derangedly fell for at the age of 20, I find this story very appealing. It is romance - with teeth. It is not rocket science. Like for what it is - stop hating it for what it isn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surpasses Twilight in Every Aspect,"This movie was exactly what I had hoped Twilight to be. They cut out the annoying cheesy music and much of the awkward acting moments that just made me laugh in Twilight. So glad a REAL director had this one. Sorry Catherine, but you butchered the first movie with the jumpy scenes and awkward cinematography. I felt like I was watching an actual professional movie in New Moon, not a documentary. It was obvious that Rob and Kristen were much more comfortable this time around, and their scenes actually seemed sincere to the audience, contrary to the awkwardly laughable ones in Twilight. And above all, this movie actually had a beautiful music score. Hats off to Alexandre Desplat! I was relieved when I wasn't hearing that completely out of place grungy background music. These movies are based on love stories, not murder mysteries, so good ridden. Quite possibly the most important reaction that came from me after seeing New Moon was my want for more! It actually left me wanting to get home to pick up my Twilight Series books off the shelf again for another read. To me, New Moon really reflected what made all of us fans go crazy over these novels in the first place. Tween girls will be swooning over this movie, men will be bored to death with it, and true fans will adore its loyalty to the novel. 10/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not good but better than the first one,"first of all, i am a fan of the books and very disappointed by the first movie. after seeing the trailers of new moon, i have better hopes this time. i expected the changing of director probably might improve the acting, but well, obviously it is the problem of actors now i have found. the few that can act are Michael Sheen and Peter Facinelli; the rest were playing either the roles of stone or wood.i don't know what happened to kristen's eyes? sometimes in the movie she gave me an impression that she's stoned; and sometimes the way she blinks (very rapid) looked very annoying. she seems to have only one or two expressions in the whole movie. i can't see the joy when she's with edward again and the guilt she felt towards charlie.rob is as bad as the first movie, no improvement at all. edward in the books is funnier and ""livelier"", but rob, jeez, my advice is he should attend some drama classes before taking other jobs.taylor's acting is a bit better, but whose idea was it that every words he spoke was coming from his throat? maybe he was trying to be husky but hey, the way he delivered it just seemed unnatural and pretentious.i wonder why this production team would still give us crap with the hugely increased budget? are they putting most of the resources on cgi only? or was it because the major casting was set, can't do anything about it? with their poor acting skills, the poor performance will be in consistent no matter how much more money to put in? look at true blood and vampire diaries, they are also adaptations from books but are way way better than the twilight movies. even the songs are better.to be fair, new moon is better than twilight (most of the credits to Michael Sheen --- don't recall anyone can act in twilight), however, i can't give it a pass. it is a four out of ten.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I  thought it couldn't get any worse,"How does one describe a movie like The Twilight Saga: New Moon? The direction was amateur at best; the mood of the film changed every twenty minutes; the acting was terrible (except for Taylor Lautner but more on that later); the dialogue was boring and my little sister could have done a better job with the cinematography.New Moon is the sequel to the inexplicably popular Twilight (both of which were based off of novels by Stephenie Meyer). The Twilight series is about Bella Swan, a teenage girl living with her single father in the small suburban town of Forks, Washington. During the first instalment, Bella meets Edward Cullen and quickly becomes infatuated with him and discovers that he and his family are vampires.New Moon is the story of what happens when Jasper Cullen (one of Edward's ""brothers"") attacks Bella after she gets a paper cut. Due to this ""traumatic"" event the Cullens Leave Forks and Bella becomes disturbed with nightmares of Edward. After discovering that being reckless will bring her visions of Edward she rekindles an old friendship with Jacob Black (who is actually a werewolf) so he can help her rebuild two motorcycles. Eventually she develops feeling for him until Edward's sister returns to Forks to warn Bella of Edward's suicidal Intentions.It is difficult to describe just how bad this movie was without ranting. As most people who despised Twilight, the change of directors to Chris Weitz (American Pie and the Golden Compass) was a welcome addition to the crew. It was expected that he would re-vamp the terrible special effects from the first movie and bring an interesting view to the story (despite the terrible source material). Well to say the least, he did none of those things. The special effects were a bit better but still looked nowhere near as good as they did in the Golden Compass, and the way he styled some of the earlier scenes in the film completely wrecked the mood that the ""dream style"" intro had produced.Another disappointing part of this movie was the soundtrack. When the OST was released, it seemed as though the sound editors had chosen some excellent songs (including Roslyn by Bon Iver & St. Vincent). Unfortunately when being added into the movie, the scenes were incorrectly selected, which in turn created contrasting moods between what was happening on screen and what was being heard.The acting was downright terrible, not that you can really blame the actors. The dialogue was dry and boring which was caused by bad writers and bad source material. There was no chemistry between any of the characters except Jacob Black and Bella Swan and even their scenes were plagued with overly clich√©d romantic dialogue.With that, I can finally come to the one thing in this movie that impressed me, Taylor Lautner. After weeks and weeks of the screaming fan girls waiting to see Taylor without a shirt, I was convinced that he was there purely as eye candy. I was mistaken because at the end of the movie, the only character that elicited any emotional response from me was Jacob Black. I felt sympathetic for his character and felt bad about what happens to him in the end.Overall this movie ranks very high on my list of worst movies ever made. I recommend that no one go see it or at least that no one pays to go see it. If you like Vampires then watch True Blood at home but if you are so fantasy obsessed that you need Vampires and Werewolves then try Underworld. Just stay away from New Moon",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie was a dud,"I am not really a big Twilight fan and i have never read the books, but i thought the first movie was pretty good and something new so decided to check it out. Man, this movie just sucked so bad. Terrible acting, and a dragged out storyline and i dozed off a few times because some scenes were so uninteresting. I definitely think Robert's acting skills have improved since the first, but Kristen got much worse. I have to give the props to Sheen, he played The Volturi very well. This entire movie is just a soap opera; it's just way too dramatic and the hype definitely killed this movie. In my opinion, the first movie was much much better and i found the directing in the first to be better too. I won't recommend this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Don't judge a book by its cover, nor a film by its poster","Living in New Zealand can be very aggravating as most of the time we get to see films such as Die Hard 4 and 3:10 toy Yuma come out months after they have been released in the UK & USA, so you hear reviews for a film you haven't seen and admit it or not you go in with some level of bias. But once every so often a huge worldwide release will be showen here first due to time zone differences, my point is in seeing this opening day having heard no feedback on the film i was rather open (even though i hated the first).Chris Weitz I feel has done a good job on this adaptation of the terrible book as the in the first film the relationship between Bella and Edward felt very forced and fake which I blame on Cathrine Hardwicke to some extent. But Chris Weitz has had success in the past with teen relationships with his ""American Pie"" so he was able to make the relationship not only between Bella and Edward a lot more believable and interesting but also between Bella and Jacob and Bella and Her Dad. It was things like these that I felt the first film was lacking.As for cinematography, and i do realise that nobody goes to see ""The Twlight Saga"" for cinematography but the use of light and framing was fantastic in New Moon, this was my main problem with the first film. Light is a very important that vampires evade it but it was used terribly for twilight but in ""New Moon"" it felt like it had a purpose and did effect the look of scenery and the general mood of the film.Now for the bad bits and there are quiet a few. The screenplay was terrible, it dragged out areas that were unnecessary to drag out such as the Vampire family bit in Italy where Michael Sheen is talking about powers to Kristen Stweart this went on for a good ten minutes but the time spent between Bella and Jacob was not enough time to suggest a possibility between the two having a chance at a relationship. Dialouge is also a big problem but that is unavoidable in this sort of situation, That lead me to think ""Why was Cathrine Hardwicke blamed for all the problems for the first film? because they are the same ones in New Moon"". The culprit Melissa Rosenberg the screenwriter, she isn't talented and there are lots of people out there that would be willing and could do a better job than she is doing.Another thing was acting wise, ""New Moon"" is the sort of movie where it suits movie stars such as Rob Pattinson and Taylor Lautner who are good at what they do selling a film, but in ""New Moon"" they had Michael Sheen and Dakota fanning who are more actors rather than movie stars and it is obvious that they are more talented at acting as they blow everyone (bar Kristen Stweart) Off the screen which shouldn't happen as this is not their movie.But overall if you go in open to the new direction of the franchise you won't mind the unnecessarily hopelessness or idiotic screenplay or horrible soundtrack.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I don't think these films are very interesting,"I thought Twilight, the first film, was OK; however, I thought the plot to this movie was boring. The lead guy, Edward, is gone most of the film. And all we see is Bella being depressed and doing dangerous things in order to have visions of Edward. Then Jacob, the werewolf, doesn't do a whole lot. He spends half the film falling all over Bella and the other half telling her to leave him alone while being shirtless.As for the special effects werewolves, half the time they looked huge and in other scenes looked just a little bigger than a dog. Also, so much more should have been done with the werewolves.Then I thought the ending was horrible. Bella and Alice go from her bedroom to Italy in a few seconds to rescue Edward. It didn't make any sense. Maybe the book is clearer.FINAL VERDICT: I don't think these films are good and not worth the time to watch.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
New Moon has its moments but overall this is a disappointing follow-up.,"Not since The Dark Knight has so much hype surrounded a movie. Girls have gone crazy. Cinemas have sold out within minutes of making tickets available. Twi-hards have lived up to their name. I loathe to think what next year's Eclipse will bring. In it's opening weekend in the U.S. The Dark Knight made $158 million whilst Transformers 2 made $108 million. New Moon has already broken box office records everywhere. As far as dollars are concerned hype never lies. Shame that doesn't mean this film is any good.When Twilight was first released on a considerably less euphoria-swept audience it was for a lot of people, including me, a guilty pleasure. Teen angst, first romance, glittery vampires ‚Äì what's not to like? Actually the glittery part was a bit silly but overall it was easy to sit back and enjoy this tale of forbidden affection between human and vampire. New Moon is a much harder slog. The woozy-from-love atmosphere of the first is replaced with an exhaustively downbeat mood in the this sequel. What was simple has now become forced. And those 'pale-faces' are still glittery.When Chris Weitz was brought on board to direct everyone was cheering about how the special effects would be vastly improved. Well they are, but at what cost? The CGI werewolves are superb to look at and the action scenes are definitely more seamless, however the drama and tension that was elicited so well from Catherine Hardwicke's direction is now severely lacking. Not a price I would be willing to pay: the strength of the story will have people returning for repeat viewings much more then the action.Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are back as the on-again-off-again couple, only this time their chemistry seems to be missing. Stewart is solid as the dejected and melodramatic Bella whilst Pattinson is intolerable as the whiny, wimpy Edward. Hard to tell where the character starts and his acting ends, Edward / Robert may have girls - both young and old - whipped into a frenzy, however anyone who hasn't already sided with Team Edward will want to tear their eyes out when he is on screen. The added third party for this instalment, werewolf Jacob Black, is played well by Lautner; the 17 year old piling on 12kg of muscle and some extra acting talent for his bulked up role.New Moon has its moments but overall this is a disappointing follow-up.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilight saga New Moon: An Utter Disappointment,"Oh wow, where do I start? Let's see, the main things that went wrong with this movie:First of all, for a movie to be effective, there needs to be an effective beginning/middle/end. This movie DID have these, but they did NOT fit together. It was all over the place, for God's sake! I can't explain it very well, you just get the feeling that all the scenes were so unattached..you end up feeling that this movie was incomplete. Also, so many unexplained things! I can imagine that if I never read the book I'd be confused as hell. For example, they never explained Bella's ""visions"" (if you will) of Edward..how she saw him when she had an adrenaline rush. In the book they specifically said he wasn't actually there..she was just imagining. I can imagine being just a little confused if I never read that in the book. Now, the soundtrack! Ohhh the best worst part of the movie. During the most crucial, action-packed scenes (eg. Jasper attacking Bella for her blood) they put god damn Tom and Jerry music. It seemed like a joke rather than a very serious part of the movie, come on now! And the main twilight theme wasn't even in the movie! Not once! I don't know about you guys, but this is the song I was looking forward to the most..They played it over and over in twilight, which is why I assumed it was the main theme...nope, didn't even have it. Bummer. Some scenes just dragged on and on and were way longer than they need to be. It got boring, even the title took half an hour to show up as ""New Moon"". I hate to be a complete Negative Nancy, so I gotta say that this movie was not entirely bad- some scenes were very entertaining. I enjoyed every minute when the wolves were on screen, those were incredibly well done. I loved everything about them.But generally it still wasn't effective and was poorly produced...4/10.

We weren't so harsh to the Harry Potter cast on their first two films in the series and they were much more 'awkward' and 'uncomfortable'.Having never read the books (i understand that the books are most probably a thousand times better but what book/film combo isn't?) i urge everyone to follow the hype and go and watch it.

"Better then Twilight, but nonetheless bad","After watching 2008 adaptation of the first part of Twilight series, I hardly had any expectations from this film. This film has several new entries in the series - director Chris Weitz, cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe, music maestro Alexandre Desplat and notable production designer David Brisbin. But alas, these people were not able to improve the bizarre story of the franchise.New Moon, starts off with Bella's dream of herself being old, and Edward being young. She is worried that she will lose her beauty, and Edward, being a vampire will remain young forever. Anyway, I won't go further into the story as it is really very dumb and uninteresting.The film is full of cheesy dialogues, cringe-worthy scenes and over the top acting. Kristen Stewart can't act. Robert Pattinson's acting is as cold as vampire blood. Taylor Lautner is just present in this film to show his six-pack abs. Actors like Michael Sheen were like sunshine in the storm.Melissa Rosenberg's script is pretty weak. It leads to nowhere. The film itself ends without any conclusion. The new moon ends without turning into full moon.Only good thing about the film is better cinematography than the previous one. Alexandre Desplat music is too good to be in this film. Visual Effects were better than Twilight, but again, they were never 'very good'.Overall I think New Moon will be enjoyed by its target audience. Other than that, I think it will fail to impress other range of audiences. It is a film full of clich√©s, horrible acting and terrible screenplay.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horrible,"I am a fan of the books. I enjoyed reading them. However, I do not like the movies. I saw Twilight last year and thought ""Wow, Summit ruined it."" I was generous and decided to give New Moon a chance with the movie having a new director. I am giving up being generous.The Good: 1) Dakota Fanning as Jane was just how I pictured Jane in the books. Kudos to her. 2) Taylor Lautner, Peter Facinelli, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathborne and Elizabeth Reaser return and I was impressed with their performances.The Bad: 1) What was with all the extra scenes? They weren't in the book!The Ugly: 1) Why did Robert Pattinson take off his shirt? He's gross. When I saw New Moon everyone in the theater went ""Ewww"" when Pattinson took off his shirt. 2) Kristen Stewart CANNOT ACT! Why did they pick her as Bella? In the books, Bella has a personality, you know? Stewart portrays her as someone who is detached from this world. Emily Browning would have been a much better choice. 3) Robert Pattinson may be a heartthrob to some but he cannot act.All in all, Summit ruined the movies and picked horrible actors for the lead role. Stop with the movies! You're ruining the books!If you do want to continue the movies because you're not listening to the fans, pick better actors for the rest of the roles, please! Unless you pick better actors for the leads, I won't be spending anymore money on the Twilight movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A striptease movie,"Let's start. At the beginning of the movie it was interesting enough for me: I've seen the first saga's part. And of course as many girls throughout the world I fell in love with Edward a little. I wouldn't complain that the plot was awful and the actors seemed to be tired of the roles. I want to say that there were enough male striptease, so I was satisfied ;) But we must note that after Jacob's inflated shoulders the Edward ones looked skinny. At the end of the film I lost the line and couldn't even understand who was who. Can anybody explain me who were amazing people in the castle? To sum up, it's not very awful. The main characters were making stupidity during the whole film, and it's funny. The main actors received their honorarium, and it's not funny.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great graphics...overall good rendition..,"I thought the director did a good job of compressing the main meat of the story into a 2 hour flick...One thing I have to say though about the actors. Kristen Stewart is very limited in her range of acting ability. The two main guys, Robert P. and Taylor L. did a MUCH better job of conveying emotion than she did! Hell, R.P. had tears in his eyes when they broke up in the beginning of the story...I was waiting for Kristen to show some heartfelt emotion...or at least act like she had some....waiting...waiting...blink blink blink...bite lip, breathe heavy...that's about all she did!!! lol No tears..no real anguish...just the same ""safe"" zone that is characteristic of her acting...facial tics, heavy breathing, lip biting, blinking excessively...Aigh...Lautner was much more genuine than her also! Oh well...I guess at least the rest of the actors did a good job. Kristen demonstrates what many other actors have said about the biz...the good roles SHOULD go to much better actors, but yet they end up going to mediocre actors sometimes merely for ratings. lol Otherwise, it was a decent film..the gratuitous kissing scenes made me roll my eyes, but gotta put that in for ratings I guess. I'm too old for the mushy, teenage angst stuff, but I get it. lol The fight scenes with the wolves were cool!! :-D",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

not horrible but twilight was better,"being a huge twilight fan my self and yes i have read all the books i came into new moon knowing that it was most likely going to be the worst movie from the series. my prediction was true as the book was very dull to read compared to the others that kept me on my toes at all times. anyway for the review..the movie wasn't a complete waste of time the acting was good. i just didn't like Robert in this movie even before the ""split"" happens he is still way to depressed. Kristen acted her part well playing the depressed mopey mess that Bella was in this sequel but the top actor in this movie was Taylor with a very well understood character and an outstanding performance in my opinion. didn't like the fact that they made him take his shirt off at every possible moment but that's a teenage based romance for you.the directing was the down point to this movie. concentrating mostly on the effects and not the actual storyline. one of the secondary characters die in this movie yet in the book the way he died was different. also there were some pretty corny scenes chucked in as well which kind of ruined the mood. Bella in a white dressed running along side Edward both glittering in the sun while at the same time Bella is in a very tense situation. timing needed to be better.overall its a good film definitely worth the money but i still wonder whether it was a good idea having a new director bought in because in my opinion the first movie with such a low budget was excellent focused only on the acting and the storyline this movie is playing on effects and cheap comedy chucked in there at different times.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

bad and very monotone acting/script from bella-edward characters,"Never readied the books, but it‚Äôs enough to judge the horrible acting skills of Kristen Stewart (bella) and Robert (Edward)‚Ä¶.. Lot of blinking, lots of pauses and very monotone awkward dialogue, Kristen and Robert have no chemistry in this movie, their bad acting combined together was painful and laughable, however...The movie haves a good storyline (even if people said that it‚Äôs not even close to the book) Taylor (Jacob) acting was really good compared to Kristen and Robert... and he is only 17, however Kristen and Taylor had a lot of chemistry on this movie, I could tell that so easy the way she looked at him at his chest and face/body, with such emphasis,I think there is a lot of a characters conflict on this movie, perhaps they should dis Robert (Edward) because his acting skills are the same as Kristen (or even worse), and on top of that he is not that hot if you compare him with Taylor The movie was boring at certain points, but it was OK for me, I like movies with that kind of stuff The cgi animation was way too fake as well.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Review From The Middle,"I call this a review from the middle because i am neither one of the legions of twi-hards or one of the people who hate the series without reason. Yes i have read the novels but i actually found Stephanie Meyer to lack writing ability, although i still found the books enjoyable Personally for me this movie was better than Twilight, which i gave 6/10. Of the actors in the film i feel Kristen Stewart does very well in playing Bella in the darkest part of her life where she is abandoned by Edward, and Robert Pattinson also does well despite his lack of screen time. I also feel Ashley Greene is fantastically cast as Alice.My only problems with this movie really are Taylor Lautner as Jacob and the lack of fangs on the vampires. Firstly Lautner may be a very attractive guy, but his acting ability is almost non-existent, I hadn't noticed in the first film as his screen time was minimal but once he takes centre stage it becomes clear he is out of his depth here. The lack of fangs on vampires annoys me as this is the most famous feature of a vampire, right back to Bram Stoker's Dracula, and in having them missing to me we are just watching sparkly people, not real Vampires.Overall however i thought the movie was entertaining, but expect Eclipse to be the peak of the series.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Im a Film Enthusiast, Get me Out of Here Please","I am sorry to say that this was one of the worst films I have seen this year. If I had watched it on DVD instead the cinema, I would have switched off after five minutes. It is a very boring film indeed with very little continuity, though got to say that my 11 year old son loved it and he is reading the books. My guess is if you like High School Musical 3 and 17 Again, you will probably like this also. When people fidget with their handfones after only a few minutes, it is a sure sign. the love triangle of the human girl, vampire and werewolf is a curious one and I hope they explore that more in Twilight 3 rather than concentrate on Twilight 3 the Love Story. Many of the previous sentiments I echo. Bella as a young woman, should be portrayed as someone wanting to live and to represent moral and social values, not give herself to the afterlife with a vampire or a werewolf. Change of director, change of setting I think also needed, get the story back out of American hands and give it to the French who really know how to make a movie like this. I did like the scene in the town (French?) when all the townspeople were dressed up in red at midday and it helped to give meaning to the opening scene of the film but to contradict myself, the scene was an expensive overstatement to the film which is after all set in America not in Europe. The Jake actor has real potential but sorry Edward Cullen, you don't cut it for me",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Plan 9 of our Generation,"What is there to say that hasn't been said already? The acting is god awful, the ""special effects"" are poor, etc etc. Boy vampire decides he's just too dangerous for her and leaves, and human girl sets feminism back about a hundred years by moping around and jumping off a cliff. That's pretty much the movie. Oh, and throw in a shirtless werewolf to prance around and thicken the ""plot"". The plot, or lack thereof, is mediocre at best, but we have the wet dreaming, ""I got my degree in Literature but I still write like a six year old"" Stephenie Meyer to thank for that.There were moments during the film where I literally covered my eyes because it was just too awkward to watch(such as the make out scenes). Kristen Stewart is the Da Vinci of awkward, and not in the cute, teenage awkward sense. I mean socially retarded, ""I can't bear to look at you because I feel embarrassed for you"" awkward. And Pattinson wasn't any better; when in doubt: look intense and glower and mumble. I was hoping that they would take the chance to improve how they interact with each other since the first film was so abominable, but they didn't. I would argue it got even worse, actually. They can't...get through..........a sentence....without a huge....pause.One other thing that other people may not have minded so much but drove me crazy was the music. In lieu of a real score, which could have been artistically redeeming, it's just hip indie hit after hip indie hit that has nothing to do with what's going on. It's obviously just to get tweens to buy the soundtrack, which of course they did, so kudos on the marketing. It's basically the playlist of any depressed teenager set to a movie.The only thing that made this bearable was watching it with Rifftrax, absolutely hilarious.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best Twilight movie,"For me, this is the best Twilight movie. I like bonding between Bella and Jacob. And acting is much better than in first movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Went in expecting a guilty pleasure; it was better than I anticipated.,"I'm one of those Twilight fans that I think are more common than people guess. I enjoy the books for the emotional melodrama and the popcorn action and the humor (intentional or otherwise), but I don't usually admit to it in public. The extremes on both ends of the spectrum probably wouldn't want anything to do with me.I loved the first movie, flaws notwithstanding. I went into this one expecting to laugh and cry and cringe a little at the cheesier moments. I got everything I was hoping for, and ended up cringing much less than I anticipated.The humor of the humans in Bella's life is pitch-perfect. Her father and school friends have always been very well done. Bella and Edward both seem to have relaxed into the roles a little, and their dialog (while still very very teen-angsty) at least conveys an undertone of self-awareness. The vampires are better made up and articulated than in the first movie, and the wolves are great. The fight scenes were *much* improved.And I have to say Michael Sheen's Aro is FANTASTIC. In my imagination, I saw him as physically weak looking, a little too perky, and scary just because of his context. But Sheen makes him truly truly creepy. When he's looking at Bella and wanting to see if he can read her, I kept wanting to stand up and back away. He doesn't do the emo-stare most of the vampires succumb to, and he doesn't do a parody of the affably evil Big Bad. I really believed him. Very impressive.All in all - not exactly film as high art, but better than I thought it would be, and a good time. I'll probably see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good as Twilight But Better!,"New Moon is the first movie I ever watched in a theater and I loved it! I really enjoyed it.(NEW MOON AND TWILIGHT ARE JUST A MADE UP STORIES. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY! NOT ALL MOVIES HAVE A MESSAGE.) This one is about love.I have never read the book of New Moon or the other 1's in the Twilight Saga, but the story is good. I'm not a fan of the books but I'm fan of the movies and the lead actors (Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner, and Robert Pattinson). The reason why I loved the movie was because of the actors. They were just so good, all of them. The way they made the movie and the way the actors acted was wonderful and it felt as if they were reading the book too me. I know there were parts in the book that was not in the movie, they do that to most movies that were books anyway.People had been saying that Kristen Stewart can't act. Hmmmmm¬Ö. (Thinks) I wonder how she got the part of Bella? I think Kristen did well as Bella. I was wowed by her performance in New Moon and Twilight. I didn't think she could act like that, because she, in real life is different then Bella. She's a really good actress.Robert Pattinson was also good. I can't think of any one who could take his place as Edward. Taylor Lautner did really Well as Jacob. By Taylor's performance I felt Jacob's pain, but I wasn't wowed by it. It was fine.Out of all the good characters in the Twilight Saga my favorite one is Alice! She's just so sweet and nice. She's a very good friend to Bella. Ashley Greene did well at playing her. The way they ended it, I expected it to happen like that because how else could they end it? I wasn't disappointed, even though my mom told me how it was supposed to end. Just like how Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest ended I felt happy that it was going to be another one. I don't mind waiting.New Moon was good as Twilight but a just little bit better.^^ But both movies, I think are awesome!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Actually, it is more tolerable than ""Twilight,"" but not by much","As a movie-lover, I had to see what all the fuss was about, so I watched ""Twilight"" despite minimal knowledge of Stephenie Meyer's books. I didn't like it, but felt it could be done better, so with Catherine Hardwicke switched out for Chris Weitz, I decided to see if the franchise could back-up its hundreds of millions in revenue earned from ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon."" Weitz improves the action, but the romance is maybe even worse and the story still all over the place.For one thing ""New Moon"" is a long three-parter for a romance-centered story. To its advantage, you come in with knowledge of the characters, but the movie begins with a lack of momentous conflict. Edward (Pattinson), our vampire, tells Bella (Stewart) he's leaving because she's ""not good for him,"" aka he's a vampire somehow she's gonna pay for that. As this happens we're slapped with Romeo & Juliet references, which for tweens is effective symbolism/analogy usage, but not for anyone over the age of 16.Weitz could have cut 15 minutes at least from ""New Moon"" by virtue of erasing the pauses between lines of romance dialogue. If Edward and Bella spoke to each other like normal people do and without this weird attempt to understate the melodramatic tension through emotional sucker punch lines such as "" ...(pause)...you're not good for me,"" then ""New Moon"" could go under the two-hour mark and manage to feel like one film instead of three.When Edward leaves we're treated to indie-music montages of time passing and Bella being depressed and seeing blurred visions of Edward everywhere and wanting a ""rush"" because she's so completely devastated by his choice. It's too much internalized conflict for the beginning of a film. The franchise's constant, writer Melissa Rosenberg, probably had to fight over book loyalty or drawing out parts that would make the movie flow better -- not an enviable position, but either way ""New Moon"" is structurally terrible.The middle act is then Bella's budding relationship with Jacob (Taylor Lautner), her washboard abs Native American friend who also has his secrets: he's a werewolf. Poor Bella, she always attracts the late 19th/early 20th Century literary monsters. At least at this point the action starts to pick up when Bella realizes she's being hunted by the bad vampires from the last movie and werewolf Jacob tries to protect her. The movie lets go of the romance for about 45 minutes which is a breath of fresh air.But before all is done the story rockets back to Edward and fast-forwards at lightning pace through the final act that takes Bella on a plane ride to see the Vampire leaders, the Volturi. It's the dessert we have to cram down before we get kicked out of the restaurant because we've sat down for too long. ""New Moon"" really is a three-course meal that has one or two good items but regardless, lacks anything tying it all together as a ""meal"" until the final five minutes.Most importantly, Weitz manages not to do one thing Hardwicke did in ""Twilight"": make me laugh at the movie. I didn't find anything so cheesy that I rolled my eyes and that, as a total outsider to the Twilight books and Twi-hard fandom and such, is a huge victory in my opinion. The action, while abusive of slow-motion, at least has a sense of style, though certainly more budget flexibility existed with ""New Moon.""A lot more work would need to be done to give the Twilight Saga a film it could hang its hat on critically speaking, but money talks louder in this case, so what does Summit care? I still think there's a good movie in this franchise somewhere, but guessing about the books and knowing what Rosenberg has done adapting them, anything more than tolerable would be a surprise.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A New Take on Twilight: New Moon,"Let me begin by stating as emphatically as possible, I know what you're thinking. No, I'm not a thirteen year old Mormon cutter, and, no, I don't listen to My Chemical Romance, but please believe me when I tell you, these ""Twilight"" movies are a hoot.A good friend of mine mentioned, in passing, that she had had put the first one on the other day, just because it was in her 'On Demand,' and she wasn't above watching it. After I expressed my self-righteous indignation, she insisted that, contrary to my preconceptions, it was, in fact, thoroughly entertaining. I protested still, but after coming up short on reasons to deprive myself of what I was promised was an unintentionally hilarious movie (arguably one of my favorite genres of film), I conceded, and we watched Twilight. And it was incredible.Click here for the rest of the review: http://seriousstache.com/2010/04/04/serious-stache-film-in-review- twilight-new-moon/",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
moody visuals and stronger cast,"This movie took everything *Twilight* offered and cranked up the stakes, creating an even richer, more dramatic experience. In its moody visuals, the thrill of werewolves, and a noticeably stronger cast, *New Moon* elevated the saga beyond a high school romance, turning it into a dark, dangerous love story with layers of myth and conflict that gave fans something to sink their teeth into.The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is stunning. The rich, shadowy tones that permeate the film create a visual language that speaks of heartbreak and isolation, perfect for Bella's descent into grief after Edward's departure. Aguirresarobe gives Forks a new depth, amplifying the forested landscapes with shades of melancholy, especially in the scenes where Bella ventures into the woods, haunted by Edward's absence. And when Bella takes a plunge off that cliff, it's pure cinematic poetry-dark waters crashing, her weightless fall suspended in slow motion. You can feel the desperation, the numbness. Aguirresarobe's work transforms *New Moon* into a world of looming forests and silver-tinted moonlight, creating an atmosphere that mirrors the tension between life, love, and loss.Then, there's the introduction of the werewolves, and boy, do they bring an extra jolt of energy to the story. When Jacob Black begins his transformation, the film moves from moody romance to adrenaline-pumping action. Watching these towering wolves hurtling through the woods, protecting Bella, battling vampires-it injects a primal, feral excitement. The scenes where Jacob shifts into his wolf form are incredible, blending CGI with realism in a way that makes you forget you're watching something supernatural. It's a thrill to see Bella drawn into the mysterious world of the Quileute, where the stakes feel more physical, raw, and grounded compared to the elegant danger of the Cullens. The werewolves bring a new element of wildness and unpredictability, making *New Moon* feel bigger, riskier, and more dynamic.As for the performances, it's clear the cast found their groove. Kristen Stewart brings a deeper complexity to Bella, portraying her devastation with a subtlety that makes her heartbreak palpable. This isn't just a sad teenage girl; this is someone whose entire world has collapsed. Robert Pattinson's Edward is even more tortured, and Taylor Lautner's Jacob has matured into a character you can't help but root for. The love triangle is no longer simply Edward vs. Jacob-it's about Bella navigating these two entirely different worlds. Pattinson and Lautner each make a powerful case for their characters, one with brooding sophistication, the other with down-to-earth warmth.And we can't forget the Volturi-especially Caius and Aro, played by Jamie Campbell Bower and Michael Sheen. These two bring an air of malevolent elegance, becoming the embodiment of seductive evil. Aro, with his unsettling calm and childlike fascination, is as alluring as he is frightening. Michael Sheen gives him an eerie charm; he's not just a villain but someone who truly enjoys the nuances of power and suffering. Caius, meanwhile, is more reserved yet brimming with silent menace-a portrait of refined cruelty that complements Aro's theatricality. Together, they introduce a new level of danger, the kind that isn't just physical but psychological. They're beautiful, captivating, and utterly dangerous-a combination that makes them unforgettable antagonists. You can't take your eyes off them, even though you know they'd think nothing of ripping you apart.In the end, *New Moon* deepened *The Twilight Saga* in all the right ways: visually captivating, emotionally richer, and filled with a darker, more thrilling intensity. It's a film that knows how to tug at the heart while keeping viewers on the edge of their seat.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Way better than the first, but still not very good.","I really don't see why so many people seem to think that this movie is worse than the first one. The first one was sooooo boring. Nothing happened, the characters were bland, and it was way to dramatic. Now personally, I don't care if vampires sparkle or don't eat humans, I really don't care, but couldn't you give them personality.Unfortunatlly they don't give the characters much more personality in this film, but I can definitely say I liked it more. Maybe it was because I watched the first two back to back and it was just coming off on how boring the first one was, but I have to admit, I didn't hate this film. Is it good, no, but it's passable.There's actually some fighting, it lightens up a little bit, and there is actually some conflict. I like the three leads in other roles they played, but they just need better direction.Overall, not recommended, but if you had a choice between the first two, pick this one, at the very least you'll have fun mocking it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why all the changes from the first movie?!,"The first movie was great - hence all the buzz about New Moon. Then why did they change so much? 1) The makeup on the Cullens was awful. They were much more pale, ashy, and dramatically different from Twilight. It was distracting, not to mention made Edward much less gorgeous, which we all know is 1/2 the reason why most 15-30 year old girls went to see the movie (which I think is most of the viewing audience, right?). 2) The costume choices were bad for Alice. Really really bad. 3) There was obviously too much coaching going on for the actors - they did great in the first movie. Don't overcoach them. Especially Alice and Jasper. And Rosalie. It made for some less-than-professional scenes. The worst: Bella and Alice in Bella's house with Jacob. Oh, it broke my heart to ruin the movie like that. And that bad taste carried through to the end of the movie. I hope Eclipse will rectify these problems and re-set to the original plan (which worked).",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
close to the book but not great a film.  annoying & frustrating,"The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD).Like first book in the series, the second film sticks closely to the books. In the book it works better than on screen despite the cinematography being very attractive and it's a nice film to watch in terms of the view. However the acting and lack of engaging script let the film down and it's a shallow experience. The interaction with Bella and Jacob and his family is the best, and the whole Cullen family scenes, but all the Edward angst and back and forth is just painful. It is in this film that we first meet the Volturi and whilst they are supposed to be scary they were a little too camp but it was interesting to see their workings and history. There's a lot of CGI that works to varying degrees of success, but sets and costume designs etc are good. Edward's desire to keep Bella safe are admirable in the book but in the film the lack of communication - dialogue - between the two is just plain frustrating and annoying. Jacob was the sanest thing in film number two.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What did u expect??!?,"I do not understand the bad comments about this movie... there was nothing to expect. I didn't read the books so i don't now what fatal misshapes did the do in this version but the movie was something like this: Our popular charming vampire realizes the danger he placed Bella in so breaks up with her. Heart-broken and miserable, she finds comfort in Jacob, who we later find out is a werewolf. Here comes the problem.. who's it gonna be?!? This movie became a tormenting yo-yo; back and forth .. back and forth.The biggest set back in this movie was that it was LONG... torturing LONG so prepare yourselves!! They were stretching it so much the you can actually lose the purpose of this movie.Kristan Stewart was very good, as usual, and handled the role very well. I never liked Robert as Edward and i am sure never will. If the only excuse your gonna give is that he is so handsome, dark and charming then thats pathetic because hes not. His acting is mediocre and dependent. Jacob makes you wish first if he can just cut his hair.. but when he does you will wonder if he is ever going to put a shirt on. i really wanted to see more of the Cullen family was but was disappointed.We come to Micheal Sheen. He was the reason I wanted to watch this movie, just to see him as a vampire. He was WONDERFUL and very funny. and if he does not come back it would be a disaster!!This movie was not a horrible downfall for me.. and I actually admire Chris Weitz and think that he although many parts were creatively done in other parts he limited or was forced to limit this creativity into something more simple.I am not going to blame anyone because this movie was weak in many parts especially the soundtrack.. it was really horrible.If your an adult i don't advise you to go watch it. If a teenager, don't expect anything and just watch it out of curiosity.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Some Interesting Taste In Men,"After seeing the first Twilight movie all I can say is that Kristen Stewart's character Bella has some real weird tastes in men. First a vampire and now a werewolf, YEEGADS.This series of books has become most popular with the current young generation and I can see why. Bella is certainly breaking traditions and questioning certain mores and norms of society to say the least. But the films wouldn't work if you didn't have beautiful and attractive people in the leads who also can be romantic on screen.That she has in her vampire lover Robert Pattinson. Pattinson and Stewart really do click on screen and their performances make you believe in both Twilight and New Moon.In the previous film, a third character, a young American Indian kid played by Taylor Lautner is seen and he first clues Stewart in that her inamorata isn't quite human. He likes Stewart also, but from a distance.But when Pattinson leaves her because he feels the romance can't be, Lautner moves on in. But he's got a big old secret himself. He's got a werewolf gene in him and it's these werewolves that have protected his tribe from the vampire clan that Pattinson belongs to.I really did admire the special effects, especially those that turned Lautner and his friends into some really convincing large wolves. They do take care of business quite expeditiously.New Moon does its best in the special effects and the romance department. Those who've read the books know what's coming next, we filmmakers can only anticipate.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The greatest disappointment ever,"When I heard that New Moon was coming, I was extremely curious, because Twilight launched a new concept about vampires... That they are almost human... But what I saw in New Moon, disappointed me very much. This movie is so bad, that, if I wasn't at the cinema, I would have left... I heard that they want to launch the next chapter from Twilight Saga... Let's hope that is better than the last one... And, how they won't let me post this comment unless it has minimum 10 lines I'll say something about the actors: Kirsten Stewart can't play, I don't know how she got that part; Robert Pattinson has some acting skills, but I don't appreciate him that much... Taylor Launtner may have some talent, but his role wasn't so good... That's all folks!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Next Chapter Begins,"After Bella recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life, she looks to celebrate her birthday with Edward and his family. However, a minor accident during the festivities results in Bella's blood being shed, a sight that proves too intense for the Cullens, who decide to leave the town of Forks, Washington for Bella and Edward's sake. Initially heartbroken, Bella finds a form of comfort in reckless living, as well as an even-closer friendship with Jacob Black. Danger in different forms awaits.I have to admit it. I enjoyed the first film, TWILIGHT, very much so. I'm a sentimental guy so I was swept away easily by the romance between Edward and Bella. To make it clear for anyone of you out there, the TWILIGHT series are not vampire movies. Instead, think of them as a ROMEO AND JULIET story WITH vampires. Some people like these kinds of things. Others don't. I'll try to refrain from saying only teenage girls would love this movie because when I went to see this movie, there were people between the ages of 2 months and 65 years old, half split with males and females. I guess the stereotype wasn't true after all.You can automatically feel a huge difference between this and the first film. This film is definitely much more slower paced. While never boring, it's quite a drag since it's over two hours long. Although it starts off slow, the ball does get rolling after Edward leaves Bella by herself. Unfortunately, it's also much more moodier, but I guess teen relationships are like that, aren't they? On top of that, the story isn't really all that interesting. After all, it's mostly about Bella being depressed when Edward leaves her. The finale seemed a bit rushed too with little payoff.However, all is not bad. Director Chris Weitz does a much better job in here than Catherine Hardwicke, giving the film a distinctive look in the title sequence alone. If you may remember, I complained that the first film had too low of a budget to make it look like a blockbuster like it is. However, the problem is quickly fixed since the budget is twice as large as the first, which helped make the film look less like a CW TV show than before. The special effects are put to good use here, especially for the werewolves, an addition that makes the story much more interesting. The score by Alexandre Desplat is really fantastic. See how much a bigger budget can help a movie?Kristen Stewart does a great job in here as always. I think she grounds the movie to reality. Although Robert Pattinson is underused here, along with most of the case, he's good with the small amount of screen time he has. Taylor Lautner gets a much bigger role in here, which is fortunate not only for the Twihards out there but for everyone else too, because he makes the movie more interesting. As stated before, many of the cast members are underused. Remember Rachelle Lefevre, playing Victoria, the villain, who was part of the cliffhanger ending in the first film? Well, we see her for brief moments in here, totaling up her screen time for only seconds.The story is much more moodier and less interesting in here, in my opinion, compared to the first. The characters are in here mostly to mope and be depressed because of a such complicated relationship. However, the technicality is much improved, from the cinematography to the score. Director Chris Weitz does his best here, along with the rest of the cast. It's a decent sequel to a good movie but it could have been much better. Maybe the screenwriter should cut out some unnecessary bits from the novels to make it more interesting. A little action wouldn't hurt, would it? Don't you just hate it when someone you love turns out to be a vampire? I think Bella needs a break.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Meh,"I have not read the books, and am just basing this off of the acting and dialogue present in the story.First, let me just that I felt as if the only player acting with any conviction was Lautner. His character was believably obsessed w/ Stewart's character, and you could feel the angst in his dialogue, regardless of how poor it was.Greene was also a scene stealer, though her scenes were few and far between.I gave this a 5/10 based off of Stewart's and Pattinson's performances. We are supposed to believe that these star-crossed lovers are deeply devoted to one another and insanely in love, but there was no chemistry, and no emotion in either of them.The movie also tries to parallel Twilight to Romeo and Juliet in the first 20 minutes of the film... If you have to parallel your story to a famous romance to convey the relationship your two protagonists have with one another, you have failed as a writer.Stewart acts like she's distracted or that she's too good for the Twilight crowd. The detachment that she feels halfway through the movie seems real, but she acts like that while she's with Pattinson. If she thinks this gig is just a means to a career, she has another thing coming, and she better fine tune her acting- I'll assume based on what I saw that her Joan Jett biopic will be a disaster.Pattison is like a dolled up zombie for the entire movie, and his ""you are my everything"" lines scream ""we don't know how to write love"". He speaks with no conviction or passion, yet that's everything his character is supposed to represent... he also has a funny looking left nipple (see the scene where he rips off his shirt).Actually my biggest pet peeve of both movies is the musical transition for the budding relationship. We're supposed to believe these people are falling in love, but have nothing but a music video to base anything off of.Maybe the movie fails because of the actors, maybe it's the writers' faults, maybe it's both, but unless you're the obsessed fangirl that saw this movie in week one, the only character remotely relatable is Jacob, due to a fairly mature performance by Lautner.I went in expecting mediocrity and that's what I got. My girlfriend is making me read the books before the next one, so maybe I'll have a different perspective this time next year.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Did We See The Same Movie????,"I'm reading through these comments and I am just... I don't even have a word. People upset about the long opening of showing the title... wth? What did that matter? It's quite a petty point. The eyes that they changed, which I had noticed from the trailers, I actually really liked. It was more of what I pictured in the book... and at least they didn't show any closeups that literally showed the contact lines like Twilight. Yes they went through things a bit choppy and quick relying a lot on the readers of the book, but they tried to put in as much from the book as they could. I found it extremely easy to follow and felt it completely put Twilight to shame (which I love so don't go down that road.) I don't know anyone that walked out of that theater disappointed.I found the acting very well done, so I don't understand that either. Kristen pulled me into every scene... her devastation was obvious and her transformation from zombie to some what normal as she hung out with Jacob was very apparent. Her screaming from her sleep was quite realistic. Robert's dialog was emotional... which is what the whole book was about. The character Edward chooses his words wisely because he doesn't know what Bella thinks and knows she usually comprehends it the completely opposite, hence the pauses in between lines. The conversations in the movie were word for word from the book. Some people complain about Jacob taking off his shirt... saying they just put that in there... but that's what he did in the book. Some people didn't like the ending... but that is how the book ends.I just don't understand what most of you are talking about. I went into the movie with High Expectations and found the movie exceeded them. Most of the comments I'm reading are from people that didn't even want to GO to see the movie. I feel like they don't like the actors that play the part for whatever reason and their opinion of the movie is bias. Perhaps my opinion is bias since I read the script and knew exactly what to expect, but I LOVED the movie. I LOVE the books. I LOVE the story and I left that theater euphoric. If you want to see a movie with bad acting go see 2012... which is all CGI and nothing else.And just in case someone wants to go down this road... I am 27, I read a lot of books most vampire based. I'm not some 12 year old that will swoon over any hot guy. I watch and read for the story which I love and I am just baffled by these people complaining. I just don't understand.Add On Next Morning: Okay now that I have sleep and I'm no longer illusive... I still say that the movie was unexplainably fantastic. I take back absolutely nothing I've said, but there was one thing that I realize in my sleep that they cut too short. And this is NOT a spoiler because 1. if you read the book you know what I'm talking about and 2. it was in the trailer. The one thing, and it is pretty obvious, that they shortened was the race to Italy. They go from Forks to Plane to Porshe in literally seconds... even cutting out the line from the trailer when Alice is warning Bella about the Volturi. That is the one and ONLY thing that they messed up and I will admit it's a pretty big mess up... but by no means did it ruin the movie in anyway.ROUND 2: Took my mom to see the movie today and tried to go in with the perspective of all the people that said they were disappointed trying to scrutinize the movie to every last detail, because I want to understand why you guys were so disappointed and why you were thinking about all these petty things. Well with as much of a bad attitude I could find to go in to see this a second time in less than 24 hours. Do you know what I came away with... the disbelief to how so many people could find so many unrealistic and unreasonable reasons to not only be disappointed but to not even enjoyed the movie. I can honestly say that I don't know a single person that came out of either of the showings unhappy or disappointed in ANYTHING except that it came to an end. In conclusion... I just don't get it.And so this ends the best to my ability a very complete review.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It was okay,,, at least better than okay...","I thought the movie was pretty decent. There were lots of beautiful shots. Beautiful cinematography. Beautiful music (so much better than the 1st movie). The acting was ""ehh"". They could've done better. Maybe the two main characters need more acting classes. Kristen's facial acting was fine but her voice acting was horrible. Robert needs to take some more acting classes in my opinion. Too serious. He needs to show more love to Bella. Don't be afraid to go closer. LOL. As a fan of the series, I feel i got my money's worth watching the movie. But we still need more Robert and Kristen chemistry. I think I'm only going to watch this movie twice. It's not really very replayable. XD",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I don't recommend it to movie fanatics,"For teenagers whose movie knowledge only reaches up to Mean Girls it's OK, but don't watch it when you know a good movie from a bad one.I got dragged to this movie by my friend who is sort of a fan. I downloaded the first movie and thought it was horrible. New Moon was a bit better, but still not in let's say Harry Potter's league. You read on the internet and papers that the chemistry between Robert and Kristen is so good. It's not. I haven't seen a single emotion on Kristen Stewarts' face the whole movie. Pattinson mumbles in a way that is hard to understand. Only the smaller parts were OK, Ashley Green did a good job and so did the rest of the Cullens. Bella's friends were also fine. Taylor Lautner had a tendency to overact, but was also believable.From the trailer I gathered that the first movie was sort of like the introduction and this movie would be faster and more action and more emotion. Boy was I wrong. It's just as slow as the first one and the action was, well, nothing. The Vulturi fight looked amazing in the trailer, but don't be fooled! Everything you saw of the fight in the trailer (6 seconds) was what's in the movie.Me and my friend just couldn't get over the fact that Bella is such a bad example for teenage girls! She gets dumped incredibly rudely by a (in my opinion not so attractive) vampire who leaves her and all she can do for months is cry and cry and cry and shout in her sleep. We were like: Hello! the guy is a jerk, get over it! But unfortunately she didn't. She also gets extremely suicidal over her 'loss' and does extremely dangerous things because then she 'sees Edward again'. That was really pathetic. I haven't read any of the books but that was the worst storyline ever. You already expect us to believe in vampires, but I will not cross the line of fantasy in believing that she can see him when she breaks her promise.Good stuff, was the wolves. I really liked the gang of wolfs, the interaction between them, the friendly ways. The transforming was also done great. I would have liked to see more of them instead of Bella's mourning.I just have to say one more thing about this vision of Alice of the future. Why o why did they show Edward and Bella dressed in, I don't know, middle-ages clothing and jumping around in the woods? The WHOLE theater was laughing at them. Not good.When you like the books, sure go and see it. When you like vampires, go see it. When you like Taylor Lautner, go see it (that's why I went). But don't expect quality in this movie. You'll only be disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"I've read all the books, at least 4 times now, and I love love love them. I love the obsession in that book, that they just cannot live without each other and edward is dying being without her for a minute. i liked the first film, i thought it was pretty well done, and it had some sort of dark atmosphere all over the film. but new moon *sigh*. i think they thought they would make the best movie and overestimated themselves. i have to agree with everyone here, the acting is pretty stiff. they look so different.. i mean jasper looked like he is 40 years old? nowhere on this planet will you see someone like this in a high school. and where is bellas and edwards obsession about each other? all over the books edward is extremely protective of bella. but he isn't in this film. he just doesn't seem to care much in the film. and as someone said, if i wouldn't have read the books, i would have been lost couple of times through the film. they could have left out bellas dream, the first scene. and i didn't like the scenes bumped into each other. first everyones happy, and a second later someone completely different happens, not related to the scene before. i understand that putting this big book into a film is different, but they really should have done couple of scenes. or changed the story in the book. bella never had visions of edward, she only heard him. and she never jumped on a strangers bike. whats up with that. altogether i went to the cinema twice, obsessed about the story. but new moon is a disappointment, twilight was pretty good as a film, and i just hope eclipse will be better.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Amazing,"The new director did a magnificent job of making New Moon portray the book accordingly. It was a fabulous movie that any Twilight fans should go see. All the characters correspond to the book version amazingly. The story throughout the movie keeps the audience involved, and the special features used are also fantastically put together. Every actor deserves an immense amount of credit, and the director especially thank you so much for making the movie like the book, us twilight fans really appreciate it.

Not What Expected,"I've read all four of the books, and enjoyed them. When I saw the first film I was a little bit disappointed; it didn't follow the book as closely as I hoped it would, and it didn't do as much as it could've. The potential was there, however, and I prayed that they would tap on that potential in the second film, New Moon. Despite my wishes, New Moon was a bit of a let down. Granted, the story was followed a little more closely, but my friends and myself felt they left out a lot of important points while adding some unnecessary features. The details added to Jacob Black's character were very helpful and brought more to the story line, but it took away from other characters. I with they'd chosen more appropriate actors the parts of the wolves and the parts of the Volturi, some of the actors simply did not fit their characters. (such as Dakota Fanning for Jane) So, while Twilight: New Moon was a success in the box office, and while I'm sure I'll own the film when it comes out, they could've done better over all, and I pray they tap on all the potential they have hidden for Eclipse, the third installment of the saga.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Honestly taste in movies people. Go watch a good movie instead of spending $8 and 2 hours of your time. I found the first one laughable and full of gloom and teenager acting.

Bring Back Catherine Hardwicke!!!,"Chris Weitz clearly doesn't connect with the love story that drives the Twilight series. I was expecting his adaptation of New Moon to be poignant, to bring to life Bella's painful heartbreak and her struggle to figure out her true feelings for one of her closest friends. I was not expecting it to be a second-rate teen movie!Weitz's New Moon is packed with soap-opera moments, hot naked torsos and pretty poor special effects. The scenes shot in Tuscany end up being the most memorable ones in the entire movie, largely because of the stunning backdrop! Twihard tweens will probably love this movie, but I don't see how any other Twilight fans could.Let's hope David Slade does a much better job with Eclipse.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Movie Fulfills the Cinematic Promise of the Book,"Just came home from watching probably the most hyped and anticipated movie of the year. It had an unwieldy title ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" for those who lived under a rock and did not know that this was the sequel to ""Twilight.""I have read the book before, and expected this to be a better movie than ""Twilight."" ""New Moon"" the book had the best cinematic promise of the first three books, and the movie fulfills that promise very well. The parts about the wolves, the cliff jumping and of course, the Volturi in Italy were as exciting as I imagined them. The quality of the special effects during the wolf scenes and the fight scenes with Volturi were excellent.After the movie, my wife was on Team Jacob. The character of Jacob Black is the best written main character in the Twilight Saga books, and it reflects here also in the movie. It is easiest to empathize with Jacob's situation, than with the distantly cold Edward or the confusingly conflicted Bella. The young teenage actor Taylor Lautner portrayed him very well, both physically and emotionally. A loud collective gasp was heard when Taylor removed his t-shirt (gratuitously) to reveal his body for the first time(among many). I found that hilarious.Of course, this could not be the Twilight Saga without the classically cheesy scenes and lines, especially those that involved Edward. The ultimate in cheese would be that laughable ""Edward and Bella running in the woods"" scene. It was so awkward I do not know why Robert Pattinson allowed it to appear on screen.Overall, ""New Moon"" is a better movie than the first ""Twilight"" film. I am not really looking forward to the next one (due out in the summer of 2010) because I found ""Eclipse"" to be the worst of the three books I had read. But I'm sure we will also be watching it. The ending scene and final line is probably one of the best cliffhangers in recent memory.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What happened to NEW MOON ?,OMG was this the movie that had so much hype that even I got lost in it all ? I totally agree with most of the comments that the acting was BAD BAD BAD..doesn't Kristen know any other expressions than the ones in which she painlessly expressed in this second rate movie? Robert was bearable and yes I did raise an eyebrow when Jacob took off his shirt...suddenly felt a little hot under the collar. But what did it for me was that I actually nodded off for about ten minutes in the middle of the movie...any one got a pillow ?

"Love it or hate it, New Moon is a movie with some really good stuff, but also really bad stuff","Let's face it, Twilight is an irresistible pop culture phenomenon. It has a great looking cast, great looking backdrop, and great looking protagonists. It's a teenage girl's fantasy, and I know how crazy that sounds. A tale of a vampire who love a human instead of eating her is quite coy. But that was the first movie, this is just a movie where the guys show off their sculpted and sexy bodies.That's not to say though that I didn't enjoy the film, in some prospects. ""New Moon"" starts off fast and ends fast, but it drags too long in the middle, and for a 2 hour movie, that's somewhat sad.Some of it is ridiculous, for example, Kristen Stewart who plays Bella is quite annoying at times. When Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, leaves Bella, she becomes too hysterical, and it's more whining and moaning than crying or sobbing. I like her better in the original Twilight film, and in other movies, but she is quite bothersome here. Maybe it's because she wasn't directed well enough, but whatever it is, she plays like she's in a daytime soap.Robert Pattinson is really underused here, and it's a shame, because even though he's not completely physically dreamy, he is quite charming and alluring. The movie tries to make up for it by dangling ripped and toned jailbait in front of our eyes (and now because of it we have several adult females turning into pedophiles), which some people who are more oriented to appearance will appreciate. However, I am not oriented in that manner, and found that the character had way too much of a negative personality.The supporting cast, however, is quite nice. So is the romance between Edward and Bella, which isn't shown on-screen much of this sequel, is enough to hold the film above water. It's undeniable, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have some wonderful chemistry. It's what made the original Twilight so good and what makes this one a bit too mediocre.But being someone who actually really enjoyed the first movie, I have a hard time not recommending this to people who are fans of the book, or the first movie. People who have not seen/read or did not enjoy the books or the first movie however, should steer clear of New Moon, because they will certainly not like it.Love it or hate it, New Moon is a movie with some really good stuff, but also really bad stuff. Maybe if the production had more time, they could of done more with it? But we'll never know that now, will we?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Even better,"I remain a fan of the first one but I do think this is an improvement. While the handheld documentary style worked well for putting us in the shoes of Bella this one broadens the scope and thus they opt for a more traditional classic cinematography making it feel more cinematic. The editing utilizes dissolves, wip pans and motion control to convey the passage of time. Both the glittery skin and super speed look better. This one turns up the heat on the love triangle that was implied in the first one. It is again a strong adaptation of the novel which is worth reading if you enjoyed the film. Certain things are trimmed and stuff that's implied is spelled out. If you listen through the whole thing it's 14 hours so obviously some stuff had to be changed in order to get into under two though of course some of that is that what is described with words can be fairly quickly shown without losing the impact.Some people really dislike how mopey this is, how mired in sadness. I agree that not every single movie should be like this but it's a teen heartbreak love story; I think it is 100% warranted. Now, I've seen criticism that this is very much a middle chapter I concur however I would argue that it is a fulfilling story on its own. This is very much when it went from a one-off to a series similar to Matrix Reloaded and The Empire Strikes Back. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A - kind of fun - mediocre (spoiler),"This is not a movie for all the Kusturitsa and Antonioni fans out there. This is a movie made from a series of books written for girls up to 16 yrs old. And I emphasize the word ""girls"". The mentality of the male heroes have nothing to do with the way a male thinks but everything to do with the way a female would like them to think. Heroes, protectors, strong/silent types, ready to sacrifice themselves for the heroine and so on (what happens when in real life a girl finds a guy like this is another story but the word ""looser"" is involved). It's a typical romance with a twist of vampire to sell it easier to your average dreamer. I mean, we have a 109 yr old guy (vamp or not not important) who falls for a 17 yr old girl and he's not a ... teen lover. Just seriously in love, probably cause they have a lot in common and tons of subjects to discuss in the forever they want to live together. And not after her body either! I guess the script you can make from a story like this goes so far. And to follow pace with it, the director didn't dare to add depth to any of the characters, in case he ruined the recipe. A very well thought idea! Good, bad and the rest of them kind of thing.Said the above, the movie was a mediocre as an action flick and also mediocre in the special effects department. I won't write about acting cause there isn't any. Still, it gives you 2 hours of watching the wolf boy taking his clothes off (man semi-naked: major good thing, plain wolf: bad computer graphics) and the vampire boy not been able to breath from the heavy make-up (lipstick rather too red for my taste, face too pasty - the rest of his siblings had it a lot better). Have to admit that my age been around 35, I laughed a lot, especially at the last scene. Thankfully it wasn't only me but the whole theater, so no guilt over that.Now, about the girl of the movie. Well, she's 17 and she acts her age (give or take 2 yrs). Honestly, I didn't know that when you're 17, traveling to another country is so easy when you're an American. You just say to your father ""be back in a day or two, don't have to know where I'm going, see you"" and all is OK. Unfortunately, here in Europe, parents demand to know a little bit more about small things like that. Culture, culture ...Bottom line: If you're up to (stretch) 20 yrs old girl, go and see it. It's rather fun and not badly paced. If you are older watch a re-run of True Blood. More twists in each episode that in the whole movie. And the vamps are much much better looking with less make-up and faces that don't look like they've been hit by a shovel face on. Even, I dare say with confidence, better actors.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
you guys just need to calm down,"It's been hysterical to read such negative reviews the past few days. I am truly stunned when people write 'it's a chick flick' or 'it was made for Tweens'. One word--- duh! It would be the same if I watched ""Saw"" then wrote a negative review because it was a horror flick. Please, please, do me a favor. If you have not read the books, DO NOT see this movie. Plain and simple. Let me break it down for you: 1. The books are always better than the movies. We've seen a hundred books become movies and are always shocked when they're not as good. Just as in ""Twilight"", ""New Moon"" skipped over a lot of things, and honestly a lot of important things that the book described. The sorrow and depression that Bella feels just isn't the same on screen. There was a lot about Jacob left out and their trip home from Italy was completely overlooked. The cliff jumping scene was particularly disappointing. Stephanie Meyer does such a great job of describing Bella's jump, Edward's reaction and her drowning, but the movie just couldn't do it justice. 2. This movie's target audience is girls ages 10-18. again, duh. If you're a guy, you are going to hate it. There's no sex scenes, no naked women, no explosions or bloody gore. Guys, just go with your girlfriend, see it and stop whining already. 3. This wasn't designed to be Oscar-worthy. It's a chick flick.With those simple thoughts in mind, please stop taking this movie so seriously. It's just entertainment and let me just give you a head's up, ""Eclipse"" will be a romance movie. again, duh.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Don't go by the Promos will Disappoint,"Had loads of expectations from ""The New Moon"" but was disappointed.There are numerous reasons to dislike ""The New Moon"" . 1.Direction 2.Music. 3.Run-time. The run-time for the new moon should have been much more.You cannot be expecting a story in a novel being explained in a short run-time.The editing of the movie was just not upto the mark.Most of the scenes were left unexplained e.g.Jacob's transformation into a werewolf.The movie seemed to be moving hurrying towards the latter half which was again not acceptable. The effort should have been to portray the nuisances of the character in a much finer way than what twilight had done rather than hurrying through the motions just to create a sequel to earn quick bucks.The background score in the first movie was much better than this one.It was actually one of the reasons for which i liked Twilight. The direction lacked the conviction which was there in the first part ""Twilight"" it seemed the director merely wanted to make a really entertaining movie on a plot which is complicated,difficult to handle and therein lies the problem with ""The New moon"".It could easily have been one of the best movies of 2009 if given the right treatment was meted out with a bit more screen space to the ""Volturi"" which was primarily one of the entertaining things in the movie. Summit entertainment needs to get its vision for ""Eclipse(Post production)"" and ""Breaking Dawn"" right it needs to be clear on whether to provide classic adaptations or just churn out run of the mill adaptations and waste plots for classics such as the ""Twilight"" series.I wont be wrong if I say ""Rob.Pattison"" is one of the reasons for the success of this Series.And they cant be expecting him to carry bulk of the load on his and Kristen stewart's Shoulder's. And there are some reasons You might just like ""The New Moon"". 1.Rob and Kristen. 2.Volturi. 3.Cullen family. 4.Special Effects. Though kristen stewart looks out of sorts at times with the same expression again and again(as most people complain about her expression)she does a commendable job.Robert Pattison one of the saving graces of the movie does a really good job with the kind of screen space he's given.The ""Volturi"" and the ""Cullen Family"" require a special mention as they didn't go overboard in any of the scenes in the movie from what i remember.The Special Effects in the movie was much better than the first one which was expected by the fans of this series. All in all ""The New Moon"" was entertaining but in parts,it could have been a classic but sadly the justification to the script and adaptations of the character was not done. Go watch ""The New Moon"" with least expectations of being entertained(as it promises in the promos) and hope the production house gets its right for the other two parts with regards to the the Direction,Run-time and Music.

The Book Was better .... The Film was Choppy....,"Just a quick thought look at the screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg. Her history of scripts are all TELEVISION SERIES! To me this makes sense why the script is so bland. It does feel like either a bad teenage television series and the dialog writing seems to be for soap operas. I would truly love to read these scripts. A lot of people feel that Stewart and Pattinson were the only bad actors and that everyone else was fine? I think you should see the movie again to see that nearly every character's acting were dry, stiff, staged and felt like you were watching a very bad soap opera. Could it be the Writing, Directing, Acting or a little bit of all three combined?Unfortunately I was one of the many looking forward to seeing this Novel transcend to a film. I remember while I was reading the book saying to myself ""oh wow I can't wait until they show this on Film. I think they can cut out a lot of the redundant scenes in order to make a seamless 2hr film."" Well I was wrong. The Book was by far better than this film.The half of the film was decent in order of taking scene by scene from the book but the film truly went down hill once Bella finds out that Jacob is a wolf.From that point the acting went dry, the film was rushed and all of the great scenes in the novel especially the ones that I was truly looking forward to see in the film were GONE.To the viewers that haven't read the book and just jumped into the film I can understand why they would truly hate this movie. It makes no sense and you can careless as to why certain things are happening.The whole entire sequence about Edward trying to die in Italy was very weak. All it was was a rushed sequence just slapped in there because it was written in the book. The acting was dry and typical for ""Vampire Dialogue"" I remember hearing Dakota Fanning say how Bella is for dessert. Aside from the red contacts, the Volturi were staged, written very poorly.I definitely would recommend reading the books and if you are a fan of the saga sure see the film, buy the Bluray, DVD, Ipod video etc... But other than that, don't waste your time on this film. There are by far better movies out there.Just a general thought: Where is the world headed with the young Teenage viewers? What are people doing to these kids? Look at the CW for instance....",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Expectation Turns into Disappointment,"As many had expected this Movie New Moon to be as interesting as the first movie ""Twilight"", it was a disappointment to the much awaited audiences and the twilight fans. The expectations were high among the viewers and vivid fans but, as usual the second sequel always has not been able to live up the moment. Initially the movie is slow and gradually the movie picks up.But after half an hour into the film, the movie tends to move in a slow pace.In a way, the movie is dragged around friendship and Jacob's attraction towards Bella. 2/3rd of the movie is focused on Jacob, instead the main character Edward. With the limited appearance of Edward, the on screen love magic between Bella & Edward dint set the viewers heart on fire. The end was in a bit of confusion, not knowing exactly the reason, why they were allowed to leave. And the confrontation of Edward and Jacob, seems like Bella is confused, whom to love as she is in love with both of them at the same time... Interesting Hmmmmmm.well if there is a another sequel to his movie, then i would suggest the fans not to expect for another Twilight Magic again.Keep your fingers crossed Friends.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Awful.  Maudlin, insipid.","I was surprised by the first movie. It was rather good in a stylish, ultra-romantic, popcorn sort of way. But this movie just laid it on far too thick.Bella was a totally unsympathetic main character. I kept wanting to slap her and say ""Just get on with your life!"" And really, the scene with her sitting in the chair and the camera rotating around her and the month names being displayed! Come on! This movie was horrible. Just horrible. I truly hope they do not make another because my daughter may want me to watch it with her.There were too many things wrong with this movie to even go into.

A Little more than to be expected,"So I think we can all agree that Twilight pretty much sucked lard-covered vampire ass. I didn't expect much more from New Moon (aside from having a decent budget this time) especially when I heard Chris Weitz was directing it (The Golden Compass? SERIOUSLY?) But I was actually almost pleasantly surprised. Aside from Edward always having some cheesy line, I'd say every single actor improved. Kristen wasn't a babbling mess, Jackson didn't look *as* pained all the time, and Mike Newton stole every scene he was in.I also liked how Bella sent emails to Alice instead of thinking Edward Edward Edward all the time, showing that she missed more than just him.And also a definite plus was that, unlike Twilight, they didn't have so many added in improv scenes saying dumb ass things like ""These kind of things don't exist"", and the action came in before 80% of the movie was over. I loved the little rumbles.Now...for the fun part...There were like 10 minute intervals between questions and answers. I was literally almost to the point of yelling to the screen ""SAY IT ALREADY!"" They also had the LONGEST and unnecessary conversations where it was basically a lot of repeating and loud breathing.But whatever, I'm still gonna see the third movie anyway ;P",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I really enjoyed it and thought it was much better than Twilight.,"I've never written a movie review before but thought I would give my thoughts on this one. I'm 34 and read all the Twilight books about a year and a half ago and loved them. I didn't really care for the Twilight movie but I have to say I really enjoyed New Moon. Personally I thought it flowed so much better than Twilight and had a brighter feel to it. Twilight made me want to go to sleep. The acting definitely improved. I still don't think Kristen Stewart and James Pattinson are great actors but Kristen irritates me a lot less in this one. I think Taylor Lautner did a great job as Jacob. Almost too good, though. In my opinion he overshadows Edward in the movie because he looks better and acts better. Overall though I really enjoyed the movie. It was funny in parts and not nearly as depressing as the book was. I didn't find it to be boring at all like many of the other reviewers. I also thought they did a good job of following the book. Although it probably helped that I hadn't read it recently so I didn't remember all the details. Some of the scenes were exactly as I had pictured them in my head during the book. I am surprised at the negative reviews. I went with ten other women (30, 40 and 50 year olds) and we all liked it better than Twilight. I think we have to remember that this is a book series written for teenagers so of course the movies are going to try to appeal to them. If you keep that in mind and overlook some of the flaws the movie is very entertaining. The teenage girls in our packed theater seemed very happy when they left so I think they accomplished what they were looking for.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
why is this crap popular,"i have not seen new moon but my sisters have a they said they really enjoyed it which is why i KNOW it's crap because they think 2012 looks good and they have seen Twilight and i saw it a few weeks ago and it was awful usually in vampire movies there are staples people follow like vampires cant go out in the sun because they will burn to death but in Twilight if that idiot looking Edward goes out into the sun he SPARKLES gold what the hell what i find even more funnier is that my sisters said they didn't like twilight because it had terrible actors and it wasn't directed well but they enjoyed new moon, WHAT they are desperately confused they only see the film because they have read the books and if the first one was and the second is being directed by the guy who did Golden Compass maybe it isn't a good idea to see it because you will know it's crap my friend is going to see it but in his defence he said he couldn't care less about the film because he is going with a load of girls. The only thing i agree on with my sisters is that the actors are terrible Kristin Stewart throughout the film keeps talking about death and cold things and then Edward and i just wished her character had died in the movie because that probably would have cheered her up and Edward is even worse because he is as spaced out as a drug addict and his eyes are always wide as if he is shocked and the baseball scene in Twilight was horrible a lot of CGI and crap actors.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Calm down it's a movie..,"I think that's completely stupid of the person from Brazil who said what kind of a message it sends to girls, I haven't watched the movie yet, but I've read the books. Everyone understands the movies/books aren't real. Stop trying to read so much into it. Yes I'm aware how idiotic it would be to act like that in real life, but it's a movie. Get over it. It's supposed to be entertaining. Also with all of the action movies or horror films, why aren't you complaining about them influencing serial killers or gangs? Oh could it be that those could possibly be movies entertaining to you? Hmm... Bottom line is, even though you may think teenage girls are complete and total idiots, I'm confident enough to say that if anyone were to act like that, it has nothing to do with Twilight or New Moon. They obviously have other problems making them act like that.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
If I was female I would have loved it,"It's OK, yes OK. However I am a guy so my outlook on it may be very different to all females.

The special effects have been ramped up with a bigger budget and there's less Edward, yay. OK, alright, he's OK too, he's just not in it too much. The relationship / friendship between Bella and Jacob is the focus mostly. That is of course the race to Italy is on. Vampire royalty of Italy is about to be shaken up by a Cullen and a Swan. The story isn't bad, some liberties have been taken to change the book, but it won't matter to those who haven't yet. Is there anybody? Robert Pattinson will have the audience swooning, as will the werewolf boys, after they have changed back into topless human form that is.

No magic love between Bella and Edward and I found Taylor Lautner and all other actors much much better than Kristen. Because her parents are in the business (her dad is a TV producer and her mom is a script supervisor) don't make her automatically a great actress.

"Wow, this is terrible with a capital WHOA!!!","I rented this movie just strictly for the purpose of making fun of it, and it certainly did not disappoint. From the cringe-worthy dialogue to the severely wooden acting, I probably will never understand why this crap is so popular because it is in a word ""pathetic"".I don't buy the whole star-crossed lovers thing, why you ask? because its pretty hard to say you love somebody when you can't even look them in the eye? When Bella gets the paper cut in the first part of the movie, Edward throws her against the wall, but does he check on her to see if she's OK, NOOO he just frickin' stands there like a lump staring at her!!! To say the actors playing the characters have no life is a understatement. Stewart and Pattinson look like smiling might actually kill them. I honestly seen more life in dead people. Lautner at least tries to show some emotion, but in the end its just not enough to make anyone female outside the age of 13 care.

Grossly Underrated,"No, this is not the greatest movie ever made. Yes, some of the lead actors do horrible jobs (I shan't name names, you can figure that one out for yourself)- though I blame the original director more for that for poor casting in Twilight. The editing and mise-en-scene are a bit obvious at times as well and they take full advantage of marketing Lautner's new body.HOWEVER, I believe it's also grossly underrated. Based on other posts on this site I was actually dreading watching it- I thought it was going to be another ""Twilight"". But based on the script and some of the young actors he was given, Chris Weitz did an amazing job; far, far, faaaar better than the former director.The cinematography is improved (much warmer and simply more pleasant to look at overall as opposed to the grey, cold colors from the first film), he elicited better performances from all the actors, even the bad performances were markedly improved, and he seems to have put more thought into filming the movie overall (as opposed to Hardwick who seemed to only want to get across the cheesiest, clich√©, chick-flicky aspects of the series...).Even the script is improved- it covers more of the book and gives the actors better material to work with.As formerly stated, this is not a fantastic film, but it's not sub-par either, and it's doesn't deserved below a 5 or 6/10 rating overall in my honest opinion. It's an average, albeit very engaging film- worth seeing if only to develop your own opinions on it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
under-rated.,"I can't believe that people are deliberately giving 1 star just because they don't understand the hype. At the end of the day this was always going to be a movie for the fans and further to this it's aimed at teenage girls. So, for the people who are marking it down due to the amount of half naked boys - lighten up! So many films use girls this way so why get offended? Secondly, New Moon is in a different league to Twilight. Weitz has turned this film into a professionally done blockbuster rather than the slow moving, un-flowing mess that was Twilight.I loved this film. I've read all the books more than once and i'm definitely slightly biased but slating a film made for teenage girls? What did you expect? For me New Moon exceeded my expectations, It's more authentic then Twilight, the cast has settled into their roles and the story flows. Of cause there are a few scenes/lines that are sketchy and I don't think much of Kristen Stewart but on the whole, it's a good film.It's not going to win an Oscar, but if you're a fan chances are you'll really enjoy this film and appreciate how much better than Twilight it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Watch in Cinema only once. Forget about DVD.,"OK, the sequel is better than the first movie, that is my honest opinion, but it is only because the first movie was bad enough to make the sequel a better one. If you are a fan, fair enough, you would probably like it but I don't understand how you become a fan in the first place. I watched the movie because it is selling so well and I actually thought they made a much better movie than the original.The acting itself is pretty bad as always. The story does not make much sense and the special effect is really nothing special if you watched 2012 (which by the way one of the worst acting with amazing special effect). I liked the area they are shooting the movie though, I enjoyed more watching the beautiful more than I enjoy the movie. Kristen Stewart was the only actress I thought had any acting skill which is still not very good. I thought at least I can watch some good story this time involve more with the history of the Vampires and Werewolves but it is still not very well explained. OK, you can argue that the movie is not going for that part of the story but the emotion aspect of the main characters. Too bad the love story were hardly romantic or touching or any kind. It might be the immaturity of the acting skills of the actors and might also be simply too hard to make the movie emotional.The main topic of movie was not clearly identified. Sometimes you can mix several ideas in a movie so it can indulge several emotions from the audience but in my opinion, it is a very dangerous thing to do. Movies try too much always end up in disaster. Fortunately, there are always special effects to save the day and it does look pretty cool to see the wolf changing action, but that is about the only thing that is impressive.It is a mediocre movie with unclear intention. It is not really a good romantic movie because there are very thin bonds between the couple (or their acting was so weak, I could not feel it). There are not enough actions to count it as an action movie. There is not even a strong story line to support the movie if you are comic fans. I would rather watch Buffy couple more times than watch this movie again. By the way, Buffy is one of the most overrated TV shows I have ever seen. I still prefer it over New Moon.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It would be nice if we could at least add a little depth to the frame. The special effects were terrible. The motion blur effect used when people are running around seems to be a cheap way to conceal bad special effects. The only way I would ever watch this movie again would be if someone paid me and handed me a blind fold. But... Hell! What do I know? I've never commented on a movie before. But after watching that terrible conundrum I was motivated to create a IMDb account to help get the word out. Don't waste your money.

This Will Never Be Amazing,"First of all, I have read all of the books and watched the first film a million times. I'm a huge fan of fiction, and I do agree that the books are poorly written - yet entertaining for a one-time read.I understand why people feel let down by this movie. Some of the special effects were cheap and the acting, from Kirsten Stewart in particular, wasn't great. However, I never felt bored once during New Moon - I actually preferred it to Twlight. I thought that lighting was a great improvement, it made the film a little more realistic. Also, the new appearance from the vampires were excellent - they looked exactly how I imagined them to in the book, with tired eyes and bright golden pupils. They are vampires after all - they arn't meant to look like humans.The fight scene between Edward and the Volturi was visually stunning and despite not being in the book, the film needed that extra scene to make the film more exciting and to show how powerful and fearful the Volturi are.This film will not appeal to ANYBODY who is not already a fan of the books or of Twilight, as they will not be able to look past the fact that these vampires glitter in the sunlight. It is not a horror film, it is a romance. The vampires arn't meant scary, therefore it is a little unfair to compare them to Dracula or true blood - its a completely different take on the vampire mythology.Some of the dialogue was absolutely appalling though - some lines in particular had me in hysterics when I'm pretty sure they were meant to be serious. And the scene in the flash forward with Bella and Edward running through the forest must have been a joke, if not it could have been done so much better.New Moon was not terrible at all, and I was not disappointed as the weak points that were in the movie were exactly what I expected. I thought that it stuck to the book really well and was much better directed than Twlight. Chris Weitz has done a good job at turning arguable, the most boring and depressing book of the series into a funny and entertaining film, which will make all 13year old girls weep with joy every time they see Jacob without his shirt on.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
See it if you like (and read) the books..,"First off, can I just say here that if you're going to write a movie review, PLEASE use spell check and have a basic grasp of grammar. It's hard for me to take your review seriously when you cannot differentiate between 'hole' and 'whole' or 'they're/their/there'.Everyone is going off on what message this (story) sends to girls, etc. And I do agree - to a point. But I would hope that parents would speak to their daughters about realistic expectations and I would also hope that people realize this is *fantasy*. There are no sparkly vampires out there; unless we're talking about an emotional 'vampire' that uses body glitter.Take the movie for what it is - a companion piece to the book. For that alone, it is a decent movie. However, I can't praise the film beyond 'mediocre'. Here's why: 1) Kristen Stewart. She has one facial expression. Really. Bella had more personality in the books, she actually smiled and cracked jokes.2) The film was choppy. You weren't necessarily sure why things were happening, some major plot points and key dialogue were missing.3) Wardrobe. Who dressed Alice in painter's smocks and grandma's housecoat? This girl is supposed to love couture, sky high heels and the latest in fashion. This was not translated well. At all.4) Getting big name actors - and giving them one line. I don't think I need to expand on that.5) Whatever they did to Jasper's hair. Yeah, that's sort of a personal ""Why?"" thing, but still, horrid!! I still enjoyed the movie, though. It is interesting to see how someone else interprets the visuals of the book(s) in comparison to how you imagined them. Many of the locations were just as I pictured them when reading the books, so it was like seeing parts of the book brought to life.And let's be honest - it is amazingly nice to look at Rob. Perhaps the ""goth"" in me is dying hard, because seeing him all pale and vampire-ish made him even hotter, if possible.I really don't recommend the film if you haven't read the books. From an outsider's POV, the films are too disorganized and key plot points are missing. But, if you already know what's going on - and what's going to happen - it is fun to see it brought to life on the big screen. Plus, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner and company do bring some drool-worthy eye-candy to the party.As a stand-alone film, it sucks. I'm sorry to the ""twi-hards"" out there, but it's true.

In my opinion,"While you're probably sick of hearing about The Twilight Saga: New Moon, it is crucial that you read this letter. Permit me this forum to rant. The Twilight Saga: New Moon has refused to make a public apology for its atrabilious doctrines. It follows from this that it thinks that advertising is the most veridical form of human communication. However, my efforts to exercise all of our basic rights to the maximum lead it to pray for my effacement as fervently as I pray for its. I have to laugh when The Twilight Saga: New Moon says that it can change its purblind ways. Where in the world did it get that idea? Not only does that idea contain absolutely no substance whatsoever, but you'd think that someone would have done something by now to thwart its plans to abridge our basic civil liberties. Unfortunately, most people are quite happy to ""go along to get along"" and are rather reluctant to fight for what is right. It is imperative that we inform such people that there's a chance that The Twilight Saga: New Moon will fix blame for social stress, economic loss, or loss of political power on a target group whose constructed guilt provides a simplistic explanation quicker than you can double-check the spelling of ""elecroencephalographic"". Well, that's extremely speculative but it is clear today that The Twilight Saga: New Moon maintains that people don't mind having their communities turned into war zones. Perhaps it would be best for it to awaken from its delusional, narcoleptic fantasyland and observe that it doesn't want us to know about its plans to remake the world to suit its own puerile needs. Otherwise, we might do something about that.The really interesting thing about all this is not that few things in life are as enjoyable as watching newly enlightened people expose all of The Twilight Saga: New Moon's filthy, subversive, and destructive activities. The interesting thing is that given the amount of misinformation that it is circulating, I must point out that there are lots of weepy, wimpy flower children out there who are always whining that I'm being too harsh in my criticisms of The Twilight Saga: New Moon. I wish such people would wake up and realize that The Twilight Saga: New Moon wants us to think of it as a do-gooder. Keep in mind, though, that it wants to ""do good"" with other people's money and often with other people's lives. If The Twilight Saga: New Moon really wanted to be a do-gooder, it could start by admitting that I don't know what bothers me most about it. Is it its specious arguments, its illogical reasoning, its obscurantist claims, its unreasonable speculations, or any of the many forms of pseudoscholarship we see in its arguments? In any case, The Twilight Saga: New Moon maintains that it is a champion of liberty and individual expression. This is hardly the case. Rather, there is growing evidence that says, to the contrary, that if I wanted to brainwash and manipulate a large segment of the population, I would convince them that ""the norm"" shouldn't have to worry about how the exceptions feel. In fact, that's exactly what The Twilight Saga: New Moon does as part of its quest to create a beachhead for organized nihilism.You don't have to say anything specifically about The Twilight Saga: New Moon for it to start attacking you. All you have to do is dare to imply that we should guide the world into an age of peace, justice, and solidarity. If one believes statements like, ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon is a spokesman for God,"" one is, in effect, supporting the most discourteous kooks you'll ever see. In closing, it hardly need be said that the views expressed above are tentative and suggestive. You should now go off and perform a thorough study of your own. Of course, this will be an exercise in futility unless you accept the fundamental premise of this letter, namely that while I cannot judge The Twilight Saga: New Moon's intentions, its actions really appear spleeny.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A thrill to watch, Thanks Chris Weitz!","May I just say that when I watched Twilight, I found it extremely boring, and dull. At first I blamed the director and the cast, but thinking back to it, the reason I found it so monotonous was because of the non-stop TV spoilers, and exclusive clips they fed us fans. they showed us all the exciting clips, leading us to think: oh! this movie's going to be FANTASTIC! So when the time came to watch the movie, all the exciting clips were already seen, which left all the 'not-so-exciting' bits of the movie left to see. so this year, at a last attempt to keep my adoration for the books, I avoided all exclusive clips, and photos from the movie. I just came back from watching the movie, and needless to say, I thought it was TERRIFIC! sure, the acting wasn't top notch, but it had charm, wit, and made me laugh a few times (In some sad bits a little tear appeared). It may not be Oscar worthy, but better compared to Twilight. It is still unfair to compare the two, because of the circumstances last year to this year that differ so greatly, but any-who, I found the movie enjoyable and fun to watch. On an end note, I am a fan of the series, being fourteen and into romance books. but if you really don't want to be let down with Eclipse, please, please, do not watch the spoilers or exclusive clips. you don't have to do this, but it really helps.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not my sort of film, I'm afraid","TWILIGHT: NEW MOON is the follow-up to TWILIGHT. I hated the first film; I'm not a teenage girl so it just didn't appeal to me, and the kiddified romance just rang hollow from the outset. NEW MOON seeks to develop that story, and also to explore more of its supernatural world, but it's just as big of a bore as the first film.The plot, in essence, sees Robert Pattinson's Edward go off in a huff, leaving Bella (the ever miserable, one-expressioned Kristen Stewart) to hook up with werewolf-on-the-quiet Taylor Lautner. If you're a fan of bad acting, check out the incredibly wooden Lautner, who somehow manages to seem like a sissy and a little girl at the same time. I never thought I'd be longing to see Pattinson back on screen, but believe me I was.The tiresome, overlong love story is punctuated by moments of expository back story (which are equally dull) and a few half-hearted action sequences, clearly directed by someone with no understanding of how action works. There are halfway-decent CGI scenes involving werewolves which are fun if cheesy, but as a whole this is perfunctory teen-friendly fare with nary a moment's danger or intrigue to propel it forward.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Way better than I expected.,"I am obviously a big fan of Twilight and the entire saga. After Twilight last year, I was very excited to see New Moon. My friend and I went to the midnight showing, waited 2 hours for the movie, and were NOT disappointed. Yes, they changed a FEW things in the movie, but they're not going to do the movie EXACTLY like the book. It would have been a lot longer if they did. Kristen Stewart's acting was a thousand times better in this movie, she didn't stutter repeatedly, she didn't look awkward with her hand movements. Kstew and Rpattz have an amazing chemistry on-screen. Taylor Lautner was good as well. I didn't exactly LOVE his performance, but it was still very good.The movie had a lot of funny lines in it that weren't in the book. And the movie did use a LOT of lines straight from the book. It was very very good.Twilight fans shouldn't be disappointed. I definitely recommend this movie. Yes there are scenes they left out from the book, yes they changed the relationship between Bella and Jacob a little, but overall it was true to the book, and very very good acting. I can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The haters hate this movie,"I've been really looking forward to seeing this movie because Twilight was really horrible,and I love the books so dearly. As soon as I heard there would be a different director I had some hope for new moon. The first thing I did when this movie went nationwide was check this site for the rating it got. I was really disappointed to see that it had gotten a 4/10! I was still planning on seeing it, but went into this thinking it was going to be terrible.Guess what? It wasn't terrible! It certainly doesn't deserve a 4/10. The acting overall was better, although still in need of improvement. The story line made sense, and it was way more true to the book than the first movie. The special effects were cool too. My boyfriend went with me and he has never read the books, but he saw the first one with me and hated it, and after seeing this one he said ""the movie wasn't that bad.""(and he's a pretty harsh critic) But it's true! I was really pleasantly surprised. I mean obviously there are some corny scenes, but again, not deserving of a 4 rating.I think one of the problems was that the first movie didn't really set up the relationship between Bella and Edward properly. They have an all consuming, soul mate, can't live without each other love. This was not really established in the first movie.So why does this movie have such a low rating?I think some people out there just love to hate the twilight series. I mean the first movie made it embarrassing for anyone over the age of 15 to admit they like the books. It was really butchered, and I think New Moon really was an improvement.Give it a chance, have low expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised too.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Painfully bad, even for romantic people !!!","OK, so to start with the explanation WHY I was so disappointed. First of all, I really liked Twilight, it was slow romantic movie with vampires and a little mystic. And I was looking forward to New moon. Thank God i didn't see this movie in the cinema. Cause I would want my money back. I convinced my boyfriend to watch this movie together, because it had werewolves, and I heard it's a little more action than in the first movie.OK ... I was wrong, after first half and hour I apoligized to my boyfriend, cause it was so so bad. We laughed through all heartbreaking scene, and all that I can't live without you, cause that is crap. And that is all that this movie stands on. We watched to the end, if it was my decision to make, we would stop this movie after first 15 minutes. This is the first time for me to say: Do not watch this movie! It is painfully bad.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kristen is a bad choice for Bella. Because She is narrator and keeps the story going on.,"I really don't understand why I never be satisfied with the movie though I am really obsessed with the books. Kristine is a bad choice for the character of Bella. Because I never get any feeling from her face expression. She is like face-expressionless. What a lack for an actress in this character. Rob and Tyler are really good but their performance should be supported by the narrator, Bella. But, in spite of an effective narrator, we are introduced with a plain and senseless narrator who never expresses her thoughts, feeling through her eyes and face. She is just standing there without doing anything. It is somehow interesting but when I look at her daily photos, I can see the same facial expression as in film. There is no performing quality in her presence in the film. Because ""SHE IS A NARRATOR"". Can you tell me? Who can continue to listen a bad story teller? you are bored. It is the same in the movie. I am bored of her story telling. But I prefer to read the book. By this way,I am able to shoot the best movie in my mind.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"New Moon - nice title, poor content","New Moon follows closely the line of the books, so for those who read the books it's totally predictable. I think it was a lame movie made after a weak book with very little substance, which appeals mostly to girls who deep down dream at princes on white horses. Leaving aside the subject of the story, the film itself was very long, slow and boring. It is a very light movie and the leading actress is not very good at expressing feelings. It's like the director took the book and threw it on screen without filtering it through his mind, without putting his own personal touch. So if you are looking for the experience of a great or impressive movie, this is not the one.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
KNOW what you are expecting to see and then it's a pretty nice movie!,"I hate all this reviews that says this movie is bad or this movie is fantastic! Let's get one thing clear.Every movie is destined for a certain audience, for a certain type of audience and offer a certain type of entertainment. Before you go see a movie it's critical to know WHAT TO EXPECT! Why are you going to see it and what kind of entertainment you expect from it.So if you saw Twilight and didn't like it don't bother watching this one. But if you liked it or you won't be bothered to see the sequel well then I recommend it. It has a well played script that gives exactly the character of the book and the essence of New moon for things that will follow. Directing is actually pretty good so why not watch it?So I disagree with those that says it's a bad movie. It's bad if you don't know why you are watching it. It's not a masterpiece either not is a movie that I would recommend to anyone without caution. But if you want to see this kind of movie the Yeah it's pretty good one and two hours well spend.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
LOVED it!,"Okay, thanks to the unbelievable 4.2 rating here on IMDb, I went to this movie with pretty low expectations. I'd really been looking forward to seeing it. What is wrong with people??? How could anyone who has read the book give it less than a 5? I thought it was wonderful!!! The acting was much improved. The make-up and everything visual was high quality. And the pace, feel and tone were true to the spirit of the book. I left feeling satisfied.Was it perfect? Of course not! Another hour or two and they could have added in a lot more detail. But be realistic! This movie is two and a half hours as it is! I hope you enjoy New Moon as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"New Moon. Some bad things, but mostly good things.","Okay so as we all know, The Twilight Saga has become one of the biggest hit franchises of the 21st century. I won't deny that I really do love the series, I think that Stephenie Meyer had a vision that was so perfectly mapped out into four books, which I think were very well written. But here's the main issue, the movies aren't going to be just like the books, I can respect that, but I really think the director, crew, and actors could have done a much better job on reinventing Stephenie Meyer's wonderful creation. Now, there were some very good things about this movie which I will comment on. When it comes to CGI and visual effects, I give New Moon a big pat on the back, after watching the futile attempt at good CGI work in Twilight, it was actually nice to watch a Twilight movie with good effects in it. If that was what was stopping you from seeing New Moon, go right ahead and watch it, you won't be disappointed. Aside from that, the acting in this movie was noticeably better than that of the first. You can tell that the actors grew a closer relationship with each other and this made them more comfortable when acting in intimate scenes. I think Bella and Jacob's relationship is very precise when it comes to translating it from the book. Taylor Launtner did an excellent job at acting as Bella's main love interest. As for Bella and Edward's relationship, I could feel a closer connection towards the end of the movie. I believe that in time this connection and the actor's connection will continue to grow and with that the movies will only get better and better. Well, in all, this movie was good. I really thought it was much better than the first. If your a fan of the books, definitely go and see it. For me, it was definitely worth the price of a movie ticket. I give The Twilight Saga: New Moon 6 out of 10 stars, but that's just my opinion, go and see for yourself how this matches up to your expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ok sequel better than the predecessor,"I really hated the first TWILIGHT. It was badly acted, with lazy action sequences and a bit forgettable as a whole. However, being some sort of masochist I forced myself to watch all the sequels. This wasn't great but a big step forward when compared to the poor predecessor.In the beginning Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) tries to end his relationship with Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) because his family wants to attack her for sucking her blood. So Bella spends more time with her school friends and also with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and after a while she will discover that also Jacob has a big secret: he belongs to a tribe of Native Americans that are shapeshifters and can turn to giant wolves. These ''wolves'' have vampires as their ancient enemies despite the Cullens and the tribe have a treaty. After Edward has a vision of Bella jumping off a cliff he goes to Italy where a coven of vampires led by Aro (Michael Sheen) recommends him that he should tell in public that he is a vampire. However, Bella and her friend will go to Italy to stop Cullen just in time and he promises to never leave Forks again and will struggle with the Volturi for the love of Bella.Ok, this sequel isn't exactly great but it was better than the predecessor for a few reasons. The acting was a bit better this time even from Pattinson and Stewart despite most of the other cast members are there just for their occasional line. The scenery and photography were brighter and more colorful, and also the action sequences were better.Not great but at least 30 times better than the beginning of franchise.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twi-fright?,"'Twilight' was a decent teenage love/drama with the essence of an action/thriller in the midst. 'New Moon' - under the helm of new director Chris Weitz - is a much more worded affair.Perhaps I'm being too generous - I'm not usually - however, 'Twilight: New Moon' carries with it some interesting moments and scenes which intrigued me as the audience into the plot. The idea that Taylor Launter's Jacob Black could be edging his rival Robert Pattinson's Edward out of the equation as he attempts to rekindle a life long crush on Kristen Stewart's Bella Swan. It's like an episode of Coronation St. with numerous nifty tricks in the bag as the duration pans out!The first third of the film is appallingly bad as it feels like all of the cringe worthy 'happy Edward-Bella family relationship' on a loop. It's rather dreary and feels like an extension of it's predecessor rather than a sequel bursting full of fresh ideas. Give the film time and you will at least have some positives to reminisce over afterwards.The second third follows Stewart and Launter's blossoming relationship with former lover Pattinson out of the picture. This is the greatest section of the film as I feel compelled into this relationship more than the previous one and it's intriguing to view it unfold.The climax is a little late coming in the fact that the previous two thirds of the film have been rather worded and bloated. The action is well choreographed for a rather low budgeted flick and it gives us hindsight of hopefully what is to come in the future 'Twilight' instalments.It's not awful, but by no means is it great. An average sequel to the popular 'Twilight' adaption in 2008 but its a watchable affair.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A stale and boring rehash of the first one,"More of the same from terminally awkward teenager Bella Swan, and unfortunately this time it starts to wear out its welcome. That's not to say it's all bad, though. Some positives include improved cinematography and a good soundtrack. The cast also seems more comfortable in their roles this time, although the peripheral cast is woefully underwritten and seems to be there just to pad out the story/run time. This time around, Edward leaves Bella for her protection almost as quickly as they got together in the first one. This leaves more time allocated to supporting character Jacob Black, which wasn't a good thing. Taylor Lautner isn't as good of an actor as Robert Pattinson, and he lacks the (limited) charisma that Pattinson brings to his role as a 109-year-old vampire. Another positive element is several self-aware pop culture references and jabs at the nature of the story itself. But a few funny moments do not a good movie make. The story has some major pacing issues, jumping right into the story but then slowing down to a crawl as Jacob and Bella spend more time with each other. Also, in this installment, the audience is introduced (rather unceremoniously) to the Volturi, who seem to be some kind of vampire ""elitists"". After an offhanded reference early on (which does have a cool sequence of a vampire being ripped limb from limb), they aren't seen until the obligatory climax which this time involves Edward threatening to expose himself for what he is. One minute, Bella's in Forks reuniting with Alice and the next, she's whisked off to Italy to save Edward from getting himself killed. It all just happens so fast and without much aforethought. One positive thing I did get from this rushed final act was Michael Sheen, who plays the Volturi leader. He brings a certain elegant sleaziness to the role which I liked. He also seemed to be having fun with the ludicrous material he was given. After this sequence, the movie ends on one of the most ridiculous cliffhangers I've seen in recent memory. Overall, the movie doesn't cover any new dramatic territory, which results in it being stale and boring at times. However, the filmmaking quality was improved, even it just amounted to polishing a turd.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as bad as many believe!,"I was never into vampire films or anything of the sort, such as strange animals, monsters or creepy figures! But just like I gave a break to the Harry Potter films (I know it cannot be compared!) and got involved, I decided to give a chance to this saga as well. This kind of films are made to appeal to teenagers and for sure the leading actors get tangled in the 'fans paranoia'. It's inevitable, it is how society works! For that reason alone it's a success! If you break the film, this one, into pieces and analyse it like a film critic (which I am not!) you will see many faults - disconnected dialogs, unrealistic details (I know it's a vampire film) and non-connection between some actors at parts on the film... Expectations!? What can you expect for a film like this? It's a film made for the fans and for that it has lived up to the expectations. Even though Robert's reduced presence might have broken some hearts, on the final part (If you have not read the book which is my case) you really start wiggling in your chair. The special effects also got its moments, the fight scene on the 'church' was impressive! And even if at points with low heat, the emotions are well portrayed. Bella's diary keeps you posted and you sense her discomfort. And then and after all its a film which gives you hope.

Boring,"First off, let me begin by saying I enjoyed the book of the same name. Next, let me say that this movie was an extremely poor film rendition. That being said, let me get into the true problem of the film - the two main actors! They were both extremely boring in their attempts at acting. I believe that both of them would do well to take an acting lesson. His acting method is to look brooding and hers is to grimace at all possible moments. It was like watching my son and my daughter fighting. I think that these two people have it hard though as they have a lot of hype to live up to. They do not, however, live up to this imaginary line drawn on the screen. Shark Boy was okay but what was up with the fake Indian hair? If he is Indian, I am a shark. One word summarizes this waste of time - boring, money back, no acting, little action, slow plot development, terrible acting, and did I mention it was also boring?

Better Than Twilight!,"We were fortunate to get to see a premiere of New Moon in Knoxville. Taylor Lautner and Kristen Stewart were there to help raise money for Regal cinemas Variety children's charity. I'm proud to say that it was a great success as over $400,000 was given by Twilight fans.Now for the movie! I would imagine that most fans of the series would have two questions? Did the movie follow the book and how many minutes of the film included Robert Pattinson. As most readers will know, its impossible to get a 500 page book into a two hour film. I think that the Twilight and New Moon movies have done a much better job of following the books than did the Harry Potter films. Robert is in at least half the film which is more than I would have thought from reading the book. There is a lot more action in this film and it sets up well for the release of Eclipse next year. The film has already set records for advance ticket sales at Fandango and with two more films remaining could well become the best selling series of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not nearly as bad as the first movie,"This movie was so much better than the first piece of garbage, that I have to give it a relatively decent rating. I went in with low expectations, partly from the bad reviews I've been reading, and also just knowing how weak the second book's plot line is compared with the rest of the series. I was pleasantly surprised with this film.The makeup and special effects were better, there was more humor and more action, lots of sex appeal. The musical score was also better. All in all, this director did a great job with a poor source material. He turned that junky 2nd book into something relatively amusing, that didn't feel torturous or like a total waste of time.I was thoroughly entertained for about 1.5 hours out of the 2 hours. Unfortunately the movie jumps from really high action to suddenly slow (and unnecessary) dialogue sequences which just plod along. The movie is incredibly faithful to the book, including all major and minor characters and same plot outline. I don't recommend it unless you are a fan of the series or have low expectations as I did.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Twilight"" was decent... ""New Moon"" is worse.","OK, so, I've never read the books, but I have to say Twilight was a decent movie (6/10). The cinematography was beautiful, the cold blue filter gave it a cool ""feel"" and the most important thing - the music was great. The story was easy but nice to watch.Here, most of the pluses of the first one are gone, and most of the minuses of the first one are... even bigger. But from the beginning.The story is not bad, but the screenplay, I have to say, it's AWFUL. It makes you feel like Rosenberg wrote it in a few days or even better just to get the paycheck. The dialogues are mostly terribly awkward, the storyline skips to fast making the story unbelievable etc.The acting now. Robert Pattison is NOT better. Maybe he wanted to be like that, maybe he was supposed to be just acting a cold guy with one face expression, that doesn't actually act at all, but seems to be tired of being on the plan, because he has some smiles (2 maybe?) that may suggest so, but that's to little. Kirsten Stewart, whom I thought was a good actress (after Into The Wild), and who I though played well in Twilight, here... it's not bad at all either. Surprise. I really liked her.The music. No ""Super Massive Black Hole"" in the songs from the movie, no ""Bella's Lullaby"", dramatic drums and Burwell's talent on the Score. Much more forgettable, but the main theme (Meadow) might be better than lots of music composed in the cinema in recent years. Beautiful. If only there was more...As the cinematography goes, no more cold blue filter here, but still some nice shots. The best scene, I though, was a scene with ""Hearing Daamge"" song in the forest, hunting for Victoria. Very nicely shot and edited, working with the music well.

This was a pretty big step down from the first movie.,"The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) is a movie I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows Edward leaving Bella after she almost dies again in his company. As Bella's recovers from the breakup Jacob makes his move to win her heart. She slowly starts liking him and discovers he has his own dark secret. Will Bella's life be just as at risk with Jacob as she was with Edward?This movie is directed by Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass) and stars Kristen Stewart (Snow White and the Huntsman), Robert Pattinson (The Batman), Taylor Lautner (Abduction), Billy Burke (Drive Angry), Anna Kendrick (In the Woods) and Christopher Heyerdahl (Peacemaker).This was a pretty big step down from the first movie. A lot of scenes and circumstances seemed awkward. The scene at the movie theatre felt unnatural as did the biker sequence and most scenes Jacob gets mad. Lautner's acting was dreadful and Stewart is a pretty average actress as well. The special effects on the werewolves is good and the vampire hierarchy had potential. The ending seemed forced and a bit unrealistic.Overall this is a average to below average movie that's only worth watching once. I would score this a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A far superior movie to Twilight and looking forward to Eclipse,"I'll admit it straight out I'm a huge Twilight fan but after reading some poor reviews here and some in the papers I wasn't excepting much from New Moon. This didn't bode well for me as I had been disappointed by Twilight.But what can I say I was pleasantly (total understatement) surprised. The movie was very faithful to the book and the bits that were added in worked extremely well. I especially liked that there were far more comedic moments which I felt were needed even as I read the book. Taylor Lautner filled the R-Patz shaped hole in my heart. He was endearing and sweet as Jacob, I found myself loving him, where in the books I really despised him. Pattinson does what he does, effortlessly and sexy as hell, there's nothing major for him to do in this movie but he didn't phone it in which made me feel that he cared about this character and the franchise. Charlie is quickly becoming a more rounded character and I'm loving his transformation on the big screen, the man is far to 2-D in the book. But the best surprise here is Stewart who seemed awkward and bored in Twilight. Here she captures Bella's pain of losing Edward perfectly. The chemistry between her and Taylor is immense and almost rivals that of her and Pattinson. I'm so glad she upped her game as for me she was the major disappointment in Twilight.Christ Weitz has done an excellent job and has cut through a lot of the cheesy lines that can make New Moon too angsty and almost patronising. The extra action is great and I thought the wolves looked amazing. Even the grunts and the thundering noise they made as the sped through the woods was incredible.If there was any fault there wasn't enough of the Volutori but then again there isn't that much of them in the book anyway. Oh and the bit with Edward and Bella running through the forest made me burst out laughing which I doubt was its intention but all an all I enjoyed it immensely. I went with serious Twilight fans and girls who had never read the books and we all agreed, a far superior movie to Twilight and looking forward to Eclipse...only 225 days to go :)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I don't understand,"Honestly, I don't really understand what people are discussing here. The movie is definitely not a very good one, definitely has a lot to improve to be considered good even, but people here are just insulting it for all the wrong reasons. I would say that they are using every excuse to call it trash. I think the major down sides of this movie were definitely the huge plot holes all along it. For somebody who hasn't read the book its nearly impossible to enjoy it. I can't believe the writer would allow such cutting, but apparently she didn't mind it. The direction isn't extraordinary but I wouldn't consider it horrible, the special effects are nicer than in the previous movie and I enjoyed the wolf parts. The fact that people keep on complaining about guys having no shirt is ridiculous, there are several explanations in the book about that and so they just followed the source, for once. I do not consider the guys attractive as they are shirtless, so I doubt I'm being biased. The criticism about the acting is out of place, if you ask me. The acting is nearly the best thing in this movie and I disagree with those who say the actors have always the same expression and such. I found that the actors are quite good at expressing the tension that characterizes most parts of the book. I do agree that the humor parts have been nearly completely left out, which was a tragic mistake if you ask me. To all those who are arguing whether or not Bella represents a good model for girls, your complaint goes to the saga, not to the movie. If you didn't like the books and their messages, you might as well have not gone watch it. I think everybody is trying to read more than there is to it. I very much agree with somebody who said if you don't like this kind of stories, don't go to the cinema to watch them and then whine about them. I consider the movie a rather mediocre one, it could have been SO much better, with little effort. If they had just grabbed the damn book and put the content in the movie, for starters. I realize time is a limit, but I prefer a movie that is very long or two separate movies to represent the story, than a bad movie with everything cut around and not-understandable. All in all, I would give this movie a 5/10, for the acting that I appreciated, the soundtrack that was quite appropriate in my opinion, and the special effects.However, I would NOT recommend the movie to people who haven't read the book and/or do not enjoy romance and fantasy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Romeo and Juliet? Lol No.,"My God. Even if the first one wasn't technically a good film, at least you could enjoy the weirdness and not get ever bored. That didn't happen with this one. The first hour is almost unwatchable, with a depressed Bella after Edward abandons her.The movie shows us the play Romeo and Juliet, so we can force a conexion with it and the story we watch about these two lovers. But it doesn't work at all, and that forces the writers to make characters act in contradictory ways all of a sudden so they can force the comparison with the classical.What we do have is boring scenes that amount pretty much to nothing until sudden changes force a huge jump in the plot, for then a bunch of scenes of nothing until the next jump, often requiring characters to appear out of nowhere to force those changes. There is no tension because there doesn't seem to be a logical story progression and then we are at the end of the story in the third act, and barely anything happened.A bad, awful ""romantic"" teen story. I liked the CGI when used, and some scenes here and there, but this one was bad and boring.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is diabolical,"I'm watching these films because my friend wants to see my reaction. I never thought any film could be worse than Son of The Mask... so far I've found three. Twilight, Twilight - New Moon, and Twilight - Eclipse. Each as equally bad as the last. I think we should deleted these movies. Delete them from history, I fear that if aliens came to earth and they asked to see our creative history and they found these in the vaults they would destroy us. We need to prepare for this scenario. Edward Cullen is a psychopath. Jacob not far behind. Don't let young impressionable children watch this toxic bag of garbage.'Near Dark' is a way better.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An okay sequel!,"The film follows Bella Swan as Edward Cullen leaves Forks, Washington with his family after a conflict with his brother Jasper Cullen trying to kill Bella on her 18th birthday. Bella starts being depressed for months after her unexpected breakup with Edward. However, her dad decides to send her back to her mom until she starts spending time with her friends and develops a strong relationship with Jacob Black.That is just the main premise of the story, but there is more to this movie's confusing and incoherent plot.I'm not going to cry like a little girl over this film but I hate this movie. It's a sequel based on a book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer and I thought it would interest me but after watching this film with my sister LeeAnn, I just walked out my room in disgust and a lot of angry.The plot is confusing as heck because it's really dumb and not a good idea. A lot of critics put down this movie which I am glad they did because this movie does not deserve to have universal critical acclaim and it's not really good at all. The plot is slowly paced and it's very long -- being at 130 freaking minutes long -- I will not watch The Twilight Saga: NEW MOON ever again in my life. I read the book and it's okay. I loved the book version, but once I watched the movie, I just found myself saying, ""What in the heck did I just watch?"". That is exactly how much I hate this movie.The one part of ""NEW MOON"" that really got me mad is when Kristen Stewart's character, Bella Swan, is screaming in her sleep after Edward leaves (because she misses him) throughout the whole darn movie. That is just stupid and what an outrageous idea. By the time she finally stopped screaming, I was really ready for this movie to end quickly, but i had to see more of this slow-paced movie. Her screaming, it definitely drove me crazy.They spent a cheap worth of money on this movie and this movie succeeds at the box office? The film cost $50 million dollars to make. Man, that is crazy. If i have to say anything nice about this movie, I will bring up the acting and the music. The music is by far, really good by Alexandre Desplat, who would later go on to compose the final two films in the Harry Potter film franchise, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1"" and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2"".The acting, from my point of view, falls flat. But I will give credit to Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and also Dakota Fanning, who plays Jane, while Stewart and Pattinson are playing Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, for a second time. Michael Sheen plays the role of Volturi leader Aro and he is really good and he played the werewolf character, Lucian in ""Underworld"", ""Underworld: Evolution"" and ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"". He played that part wonderfully and to see him in a TWILIGHT film is spectacular.Taylor Lautner plays the role of Jacob Black once again and he does a good job, too, but even then, it's incredibly over the top and he tries way too hard to make Kristen Stewart's character, Bella, like him. I do love the CGI werewolf version of Jacob, but the rest of the CGI is terrible. Some of the dialogue is horrible, but some of it is also really good. The pacing and editing is slow and awkward.So, overall, I love and hate NEW MOON! I know it has it's fan base and THE TWILIGHT SAGA films does have it's fan base, so if you like this movie, that's fine, because we all have our own opinions.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as bad as people make it out to be,"I am going to come to the defence of this film. OK so it probably should not be 10/10 but I am trying to add some balance to all the 1/10 votes that are also not reflective of the film.Firstly, those who commented and gave 1/10 because this film offers a bad role model to teenage girls - oh come off it, what has that got to do with the film? Seriously, try and think back to when you were at high school and you ached to be with someone so much that it was painful and you cried yourself to sleep at night - then when you finally got with someone and they dumped you for whatever reason how much that really hurt - first time your heart is broken is a real killer, how quick you forget. Do you seriously want to do anything during those couple of months? Hobbies? Careers? Exams? Who cares about that when your heart is broken and all you want to do is curl up in a ball and die. Keep in mind that Bella is also in love with a vampire who is designed to be attractive in drawing in their prey - making the heartache much more powerful.Secondly, those who commented and gave 1/10 because of mumbling and flat performances - keep in mind that teenagers tend to be like that in real life. They are acting as teenagers in the film so for me that actually made the film feel more realistic. Bella was supposed to be dull and ordinary in the books, Edward is supposed to be broody and sullen, Jacob is one of the most complicated characters in the book - starts off shy, but also has a happy go lucky attitude but also has violent mood swings (completely contradicting personalities in the books that Taylor pulls off pretty well).OK now my own review... I felt that the film kind of rushed things, especially towards the end. There was not enough time given to really capture the heart ache either but I thought the scene with Kristen sat on the chair and the world spinning around was a good idea. Incidentally, Kristen was gorgeous in this film... I can understand a lot of jealous women not getting enough of Robert and feeling inadequate compared to Kristen's beauty. Personally, I was disappointed that there was not more of Ashley Greene who has to be the most talented actress/actor in the entire series (compare her role in this film to summer's blood). The cgi wolves were amazing - it was almost worth going to see the film just to see the wolves. Michael Sheen was also brilliant - I was probably most concerned at how Aro would be played and I think they got it spot on. Taylor was not as bad as some people were making out - probably another case of jealousy coming from the men this time. Once again, Taylor is supposed to be playing a moody teenager with huge mood swings because of the shape-shifting thing. More could have been done about Sam's 'cult' though and Jacob's fear. New moon felt more like a film while the first film felt like it was an extended pilot episode for a TV series. Although, I think had I not read the books prior to the film then I would probably have missed a lot. I could certainly sympathise with those who had not read the books feeling short-changed but those who have read the books should have realised some of the subtleties in the performances that are trying to match the books. Edward is supposed to be broody with a sullen attitude. Bella is supposed to be ordinary and dull and full of heartache - some people must be so lucky not to have had that experience in their lives when at high school. Jacob is supposed to be a shy teenager who then hits a kind of 'puberty' with massive mood swings. The worst acting in the film was actually Dakota Fanning's inability to smirk sadistically. Realistically, if I was not trying to balance the poor voting, this film was a 6.5 out of 10. More to do with the script than anything else that failed to capture the main points of the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Superb Entertainer...,"Chris Weitz directed 'New Moon' is a superb film, that turns out to be a memorable cine-going experience.'New Moon' is like a Batman, Superman flick... where logic needs to damned. A film that has Vampires, Werewolfs & Volturis as it's main characters. I didn't enjoy the first flick, but this one has impressed me.To state Robert Pattinson as a Superstar, would be like insulting the guy. I was stunned the way my younger sister, and the entire Cinema {which was filled with chicks} erupted when he entered the screen. The guy is a Youth Icon, and a fabulous actor. Kristen Stewart is impressive. Taylor Lautner is quite good. Michael Sheen stands out in a brief role.'New Moon' is a blockbuster entertainer.... watch it for Pattinson & Stewart!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's bad, but not as bad as people make it out","Okay this movie is bad. The whole franchise is bad. The only good thing about the Twilight Saga is the music and the unintentional laughs, in fact the only reason I watch these movies is because they're hilariously stupid. New Moon is commonly made out to be the worst of the franchise (alongside Breaking Dawn Part 1) but I actually found it to be better than most of the others.For starters, it's got a dope soundtrack, probably the best in the franchise. The action sequences were also the best in the series too, especially the chase sequence featuring Victoria (I don't know why the rest of the movies couldn't make the vampire chase scenes as good as this one, instead of the awful green screen and CGI ones that they normally use) Speaking of CGI, the wolves were actually really well made, and were more realistic than the ones from the rest of the franchise. I was impressed overall by the general aesthetics of the film.Don't get me wrong, this movie is still terrible. Kristen Stewart still has that constant sickly face and voice that sounds like it's on the verge of vomiting, Robert Pattinson is as boring as ever and Taylor Lautner is pathetic. The romance and chemistry between the main characters is almost non-existent, and the dialogue is some of the most cringeworthy and embarrassing I've ever heard. This movie is really slow too, and so much time is frustratingly wasted on put-on conversations between the ""characters"" and swooping helicopter shots of the woods.Overall The Twilight Saga is bad, and New Moon is no exception, but I personally think it's one of the better instalments in the franchise.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rapid Fire Review,"This movie is actually more enjoyable than the first one in my opinion. Granted, its still absolutely horrible...
Robert Pattinson isn't as unbearable in this. Kristen Stewart is still the worst actress known to man. Still the most awkward uncomfortable vampires in all of history. Still poor casting. Awkward dialogue. Poor script. MUCH better direction. Much better set design and locations. Not as cringe. Not as emo. Horrid CGI. Confusing plot, with numerous plot holes (not if you've read the book). Better film score. Nice colors. Some mild humor, poking fun of its own flaws, which is refreshing.

Praise For New Moon,"BRAVO!!!! BRAVO!!!! BRAVO!!!! Just one word: UNBELIEVABLE!!! Congratulations to Stephanie Meyer and to the wonderful direction of Chris Weitz. I finished reading the book today at 3:30 p.m. and it met every expectation, the lines were perfect, the acting was superb, Taylor was hot!!! Oops did I say that!!! From the script to the acting to the beautiful scenery of Forks, Washington to the beautiful city of Italy. Everything was just amazingly accurate and breathtaking. This movie really brings out the best in Rob, Kristen and Taylor, they let their emotions fly and they were just phenomenal. I could not be a proud Twilight Fan and a true at that if someone had not encouraged me to read Twilight in the first place. I am now hooked beyond measure. I can't wait to see what Chris can do with the 3rd installment - Eclipse. This may not be a professional review, but it is a personal one. I thoroughly enjoyed myself tonight as I was captivated and kept on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to get this movie on DVD to add to my Twilight Saga collection.

Wow....there are no words,"I am a teenage girl in high school, probably the target audience for the movie series and even I have to say this movie was terrible at times. Just like the book the movie was a little slow with it's transition from one scene to the next, I actually got bored after the first thirty minutes of the movie which never happens. I think that Robert Pattison makes a decent Edward but they need to lay off of the amount of make up they put on him because it hides his emotions and expressions so he just looks mad all the time. Kristin Stewart...she pretty much ruined the whole movie and movie series period. Don't get me wrong she is a good actress in previous movies but she just doesn't have a good grip on the character of Bella. Her and Robert Pattison have no chemistry what so ever! The only reason why I am giving this movie a rating of 6 out of 10 is because all the other characters saved this movie. Taylor Laurtner is a very good actor and makes the perfect Jacob Black. At times he does seem a little overly dramatic but not too much. The actors that play the Cullen family were excellent but I was upset that they got little screen time. I would say that the only people who will like this movie will probably be die-hard Twilight fans who have read the books millions of times. I have read the book series but I am not obsessed but I will see the next movie just because I have read the books and hope that maybe just maybe the next movies in the saga will be better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Better is vampires creating vampire gorillas and day-walking tribesmen in the story 'Wolferain and the vampires of Congo'. There's many serious new takes on vampires in it. And none glitter.

"I think it is the only maybe, sort of decent one, in the series.","The effects at least with respect to the wolves are good enough and you can see how much the direction improved since the last film as it focus less on making the ambiance have a certain overall look and more on it having an emotional look parallel to the characters mood which is a little better given that this series sole purpose are feelings.Another bad thing about this film is that they jump to the next scene really fast and they do not let you enjoy moments just like in the ending where they cut it in half a second and that didn't let me think about it well enough.As a good thing i must say that the music is spot on in each scene and that the way they portrait Bella's depression was very close to what some people have described to me as depression, although it is a little bit of an awkward scene.The rest of the movie did nothing for me and didn't really gave me any further interest. 5/10 An honest pros and cons review By Robert Cane",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Worthy of Any Fan's Money, But Don't Expect Perfection","As a fan of the books, New Moon was entirely enjoyable to watch--albeit, much like its predecessor, Twilight, it had its issues. One should note that the overall tone of the film seems to possess a different feel from the original. This difficult-to-describe-in-words tone, which one will recognize once he or she watches, produces an unflattering tawdry effect.Unlike Twilight, New Moon does not make introductions (in so much that as far as the main cast is concerned, Bella and the Cullens) and the problem rests here. The film's obviousness in assuming its audience is well-acquainted with the characters results in line of cheap jokes (which I will not disclose so as not to spoil any part for any fan, like me). However, just because the film wants to cater to the already loyal fan base of the saga, does not mean that it must make that catering so noticeable‚Äî there are plenty of other ways (just being loyal to the books for instance) to appease and delight the fans, who for the most part will enjoy anything about the series.The special effects, which one might rightfully assume should be better since this films budget should be more substantial than the last, are just fine. However, there was a noticeable change in the eye colors of the vampires, which seems to be significantly brighter than in the first. The red eyes are more like rubies and with the brightness of the topaz, all the Cullens' eyes seem like huge, inhuman, bug eyes. In other words, while this may or may not be a more expensive effect, it does nothing but take from the film. Aside from just looking wrong (the Cullens look so alien that it is absurd the audience is expected to believe any residents of Forks have fallen for their charade as humans who are just exceptional beautiful)That being said, the rest of the Film has definitely improved upon the last. The make-up and hair is better: there are no more lines where we can easily find the pale make-up ends, a problem Twilight did not bother to fix.While the acting has improved (though I personally didn't find a real problem in the first), there are inescapable scenes from the book that would be hard to make look respectable on screen. Note that this is not a knock on Meyer's writing, just a reminder that some things work better in books than they do in movies. Any other improvements I might mention would spoil the film, but there are more the audience will definitely appreciateAll problems aside, New Moon is a delight for any fan and well worth that over-priced ticket.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
New Moon is a Step in the Right Direction,"Almost a year to the day after Twilight hit theaters, it's sequel New Moon has teens--well women in general--flocking to the theater.New Moon is by far the most internal book of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight Saga. Books that take place almost entirely inside of the protagonist's head are difficult to translate to the screen--see the labored adaption of Twilight. This and a thousand other reason had me worried when I entered the theater to see New Moon. The book centers on the Bella Swan's internal journey towards the light and away from Edward. The quiet transformation that Bella undergoes under the warm and watchful encouragement of Jacob is what has so many...I want to say teens but sitting in the theater this afternoon with more middle age women than screaming teens makes me say women hopping on Team Jacob. The movie was bound by the constraints of time, already running at just over 2 hours, the movie does not quite do justice to the tender affection that develops so slowly between Jacob and Bella, but I think that this has more to do with lack to time than a lack of reverence for the relationship. Weitz, the director, and Rosenburg, the screenwriter, are incredibly faithful to the book on the whole. There will be no cries for scenes from the book that didn't make it into the movie like there were after Twilight, and furthermore Weitz and Rosenburg try to added just enough to the story to give the viewer something to care about, something to strive for--though this hook never quite sinks into the viewer. On the whole, Weitz's directing style is far less distracting than was Catherine Hardwicke's direction in Twilight. There were definitely moments that the camera movement detracted from the story rather added to it, but these moments occur far less often with Weitz at the helm. Furthermore, Weitz's camera direction kept the camera out of the faces of the actors and often allows several actors and even some of the background into the shot.The acting in this movie is at least on par with the acting in the first film. Kristen Stewart definitely has the ability to portray broken-souled mopey-ness in spades. Her portrayal of Bella is a dark and broken exterior overlaying a stubborn will to live and a will to hold on that is at the best of times captivating and at the worst of times annoyingly pathetic to point of forcing the viewer to wonder why either Edward or Jacob would want her. When Bella is left by Edward in the woods with the promise that she'll never see him again, it's heartbreaking. When the directorial effort to keep the story moving gets out of her way, Stewart definitely will pull tears from even some of the hardest viewers. Stewart's performance is imminently watchable even if not her best. Stewart managed to be less...blinky than she was in her first portrayal of Bella and, mercifully, keep the lower lip biting to a minimum. Robert Pattinson is largely absent from this adaptation except during the opening and closing of the film. When he does appear, Pattinson's acting is a bit labored but the hoards of ""Twihards"" wont mind because Pattinson still manages to throw heart-melting looks at Stewart. Pattinson's American accent is much better and much less like a bad imitation of a New York gang movie. On the plus side, Pattinson's Edward is enjoyable during the confrontation scene at the end of the movie. The problem with Edward is that he is gone from the screen so often that even the strong chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson seems to slip from the viewers mind. Then there is Taylor Lautner. Lautner is the most charming of the three principles in this film. Lautner and Stewart's relationship building scenes at the beginning of the film are sweet and enjoyable but the romantic chemistry between the pair is never quite where it should be. Overall Lautner's performance is strong and it should promise good things for Eclipse when the real Jacob, Edward, Bella triangle comes to a head.On the whole, the film, though quieter than the first, is a better than Twilight. The movie is, as is the book, merely a transition from Twilight to Eclipse. In the end, the movie will be loved by Twilight lovers and hated by Twilight haters. Those who are neither lovers nor haters of the saga will feel somewhat ambivalent when the movie ends.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I would have loved to see more of the Volturi and the Cullen Family, but it was true to the novel. The story was easy to follow even for those that did not see Twilight.

Twilight New Moon Okay But Not The Greatest,"Let me first say that I have not read any of the books so I don't know how close it follows the source material. This film is certainly a chick flick but I got it for free from the library and I saw the first one so I figured how bad could it be right. After watching it I can see why many critics and audiences didn't like this sequel. I for one thought New Moon was okay but not the greatest from director Chris Weitz who does a decent job of making this movie but there are many flaws that weigh it down which I'll get into later. Kristen Stewart is okay as the lead Bella despite the films problems. This may not be her best performance but she's still somewhat believable as the character. I wish she could have shown more emotion of what Bella is supposed to be going through instead of just blank stares and blinking her eyes. Robert Pattinson is all right as Bella's brooding vampire love Edward in his very limited screen time. Pattinson fans will probably be disappointed because don't expect him in it that much. He shows up early on and then his character disappears for most of the movie only to reappear before the climax. Pattinson doesn't have much to do this time around but he does what his role requires I guess. Taylor Lautner is impressive as Jacob Black whose part is much larger in New Moon than the first one. Launter and Stewart felt more like the leads in this sequel than her and Pattinson in Twilight. Taylor does a convincing job as Jacob and makes the best of his larger role in the film. I did feel they had him take his shirt off a bit too much which felt unnecessary except to make teenage girls go crazy over his six-pack abs but Lautner improved on his performance from the previous one none the less. The rest of the cast including the Cullen family, Bella's father Charlie, and the werewolf shape shifters are okay despite only having a few minutes of screen time. Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning have what amounts to cameo appearances as dangerous vampires who feed on humans. Sheen and Fanning are decent in their villain roles but lack screen time and development considering they don't even show up until late into the third act. Sheen does make an appearance near the beginning of the movie but his character along with Dakota's Jane aren't in it long enough to leave an impression and don't have a lot to do either. The same can go for Edi Gathegi as the vampire Laurent who returns from the first one for a brief appearance before apparently biting the dust and Rachelle Lefevre as the revenge driven Victoria. Lafevre turns in an okay performance even with no dialog and only a few minutes of screen time. Pattinson and Stewart had nice chemistry together just as she did with Lautner. The special effects including the CGI werewolves were pretty good and the few action/fight sequences the film did have are well executed but aren't anything memorable. With the good things out of the way now I'll get into what I thought could've been better. The movie seemed to be juggling way too many characters with most of them (Sheen, Fanning, and the other members of the Volutri to name a few) getting the short end of the stick and the dialog was a bit cheesy at times. New Moon was a little slow at times making it drag which weighed the movie down a bit for me. Also Bella's ""reckless"" attitude that put her in danger got a bit old at times because I mean how many times does she need to be rescued in one film. With it's flaws aside though, New Moon isn't that bad it just could've been better. It'll probably please almost any die hard fan of the book series. Overall Twilight New Moon has some action, a little suspense, and good performances from the cast for the most part but this wasn't the best movie I've seen. Granted I honestly didn't expect much since New Moon got mixed reviews but if director Chris Weitz improved the flaws somehow this sequel could've been much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worse Then The First,"Not much to say about this one to be honest. This movie is focussed on Jacob, it has some bad CGI but my boo Alice is in this more so that's good. This is just a lot of Bella complaining that Edward is gone and all that.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better Than 'Twilight'...,"I saw this film last night at a Midnight showing and had to say it was better than I expected. Taylor delivered as Jacob showing his friendliness, his loyalty, and finally, his love. He commands your attention when he steps onto the screen. This boy is going places. Kristen was very good at portraying the heart-broken teenager, but her skills lack in some places. I couldn't believe her every time she tried to be serious. Plus, her screaming at night was awful. Rob wasn't in much of the film, but didn't do very well in the places he was in. Every time Bella and Edward were together, I kept waiting for someone to bust in and say ""Just Kidding Guys!"" so everyone could laugh. It was so horrendously over-dramatic. The visual was good and the score was amazing.See if you're a fan, Rent if you're not.3.5 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Twilight 2: At This Rate, I'mma Need Negative Stars...","Holy hell did this get worse fast. The first one was bad, but this... Good God. There's so much crammed in exposition and attempted world building, we get more of this horrifically toxic threeway between Eddie, Bell and Jake, we get a message that if a boy you love leaves you that you should become near suicidal to lure him back (reeeaaally wish that wasn't real). Oh, we also start really getting into this whole Vampire Avengers thing. It's like a stupid X-Men knockoff in these movies now because every vamp has their own unique and ridiculous power. Why? How? How does this make sense? It's almost like the writer didn't know what they were doing and just decided to pull from anything semi-popular at the time.What really gets highlighted in this movie though is what I think to be the fundamental flaw in these films. Yes, the acting is bad, the visuals are worse, the story is ridiculous but that's not it. Time is the problem here, I think. Now, maybe this is because I didn't watch these as they came out but to sit and watch them now, the movies give no sense of the progression of time. How long have Bella and Edward been together? Answer. NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR THIS! This girl is having horrific night terrors because of a break up in highschool? Get this woman to a therapist because there are bigger issues at play here. The movie makes it feel like they've been together for maybe a month. That is not enough time for this level of nonsense, especially on the part of Mr Immortal there that's been around for whatever ridiculous amount of time. Strictly from the movies, the whole beginning of their relationship could've taken place over a semester of high school. That's it. If that was stretched out, if the movies bothered in the slightest to establish a timeline, to flesh out this relationship as more than creepy night stalker high on Mary Sue perfume and the Mary Sue herself then maybe, MAYBE we could get some sort of weight to these moments. It doesn't do that though so instead we get someone looking like their legit losing their mind because their spring break fling didn't last and I'm not having it.It's not until Bella is going bonkers with Eddie withdrawals do we get some obnoxious months splashed up on the screen, at which point it's too little too late and only serves to further the idea that everything prior to that happened inside of one month. It's just bad filmmaking.Also, can we just stop with these supremely obvious attempts to build tension? ""Oh my god, Edward left her! Will they ever get back together!?"" Come on. We all know how that's gonna go so can we just snip that right down and get back to the movie. It doesn't fool anyone, we all know how it's going to play out and it's just annoying.

Twilight knows nothing about vampires,"Twilight and all it's incarnations knows nothing about vampires. Vampires don't care about sex or anything except one thing: blood. Everything is blood. All the associations that ""labeled"" you in the world before are meaningless once you become a vampire. Mother, brother, sister, father. All meaningless.Read Anne Rice if you really want to understand vampires. She now writes Christian fiction which is a real shame.Due to the high level of nudity and sex related scenes I won't let my children, who are all under 18, go see this film. I recommend all parents refrain from allowing their children to be exposed to this.If my children want to see young males without any shirts on I suggest they go down to the beach during the summer or any other summer related activity.I was particularly appaulled during the scene when Bella stuck her nose up Edward's anus.

New Moon is the breakout comedy of the year!,"As a comedy, this movie is a 10-star.Jesus, I couldn't stop laughing at the dialogue and the bad acting and awkward stares and oh man, it was just too good. It was like somebody said ""Greg, we're making a parody of the 'teen girl, mysterious boyfriend' concept, and we want you to laugh the whole time. You're going to enjoy it, I'm sure of it.""God, did I laugh.However, they were being serious with this little outing, which means I have to grade this as though it were an actual film. Sadly, with a shoddy plot, crappy dialogue, unbelievably silly message, and HORRIBLE, stilted acting, I can't do anything but give this a 2/10.It gets that extra bonus star because Robert Pattinson actually really doesn't like the Twilight books, and in fact thinks the whole story is teenage schlick-flick drivel. Every time he looked directly at the camera and delivered a wooden, dragged-out ""I couldn't live without you, Bella,"" I felt like he was really telling me, ""Greg, people really paid me money for this. I'm actually making money doing this movie, saying this line. Can you believe it? I know I can't.""Good show, Twilight. Or is it bad show?God, I just don't know anymore.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I liked it better the 2nd time I saw it....,"Took my daughter to the midnight showing and was very upset with the movie. Maybe it was everyone screaming each time Jacob took off his shirt or maybe it was just due to being tired from everything we had to go through just to get in.... Went to an earlier showing the next day, and liked it a lot better (no screaming girls).I must say that the soundtrack sucks, and therefore the music in the film doesn't grab me like it did in Twilight. Also, the contacts of the vampires are just plain wrong, so that was hard to get past.I actually really love the Twilight movie, and read all 4 books in a matter of a week (after saying for a year that I would NEVER read them at all!). However, New Moon was my least favorite of the books, so I kind of expected that of the film too.Hoping Eclipse and Breaking Dawn hold up to all of our expectations....",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"For bringing a fairly poor book to life, they did a pretty good job.","There has been a great deal of criticism of the New Moon movie. Many have valid points, but we MUST look at the material the director had to work with. It was a book from the TWILIGHT SERIES OF NOVELS, therefore: the characters were not developed, the heroine is a co-dependent flake, there is no actual relationship between Edward and Bella apart from ""Wow you're a vampire and can do vampire things"" and ""Wow, I want to suck your blood because your blood in particular sings to me""... etc - pretty hard to start with crap and make it wonderful, so let's not be too hard on the film makers. (Although admittedly, thoroughly addictive crap - I read the whole series in 5 days).I really enjoyed the film. Liked how it stayed closely to the book, but did away with useless sections. It was brighter visually. The wolves looked great and I enjoyed the depiction of the Volturi. I look forward to seeing them again.Yet, I digress. Kristen Stewart was actually not bad in this film. She certainly gave Bella a bit more spirit than in the Twilight movie. And she had good chemistry with Taylor Lautner (as Jacob). I found Robert Pattinson a bit lack-luster. I felt he didn't really show any real affection for her, and that their romance was not believable. Taylor Lautner was great as Jacob. Bubbly and fun, and pulled off the moody transformation pretty well.Was sad to not see as much of the Cullens, but as others have said, it would have made for a very long movie.As for the criticism it has received for pandering to fans of the book - why not? - just about every person belonging to the demographic of the movie has read the book.Any other plot issues I had, or problems with the characters were problems I'd had with the story as told in the BOOKS. The books are far from perfect, and far from great literary works. But I enjoyed them for what they were, as I enjoyed this movie for what it was.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only male in the whole cinama (REVIEW FOR MEN),"Want a quick summary. Don't go wasting money on this sh?t-Bomb. Don't even think about it. Go and see Zombieland when that comes out, something that is actually entertaining.Now for the review Don't get me wrong, I read the books (seems mandatory to say that in a review for this abomination), I saw the first movie and enjoyed it but this is just terrible. This movie does not commit to telling a good story at all its just about having Taylor/Jacob running around looking like a male stripper, half naked throughout most of the movie. This movie is ONLY made for girls. Older women who are getting attracted to Taylor, seriously the guy is 16 you are pathetic.I know I have talked about Jacob a lot now but seriously that is all this movie has going for it. The convincing and enjoyable love story between Edward and Bella from the first movie is completing absent here and instead feels fake and annoying. There was a scene (SPOILER) where Alice shows Arro Bella's vampire future. The scene shows Edward and Bella wearing while cloths running through a forest together, leaping I could say....WHAT THE HELL. This scene was stupid and felt more funny then serious. This entire movie tries so hard to be serious be with scenes like this, anybody could be forgiven for thinking it was pure comedy, but it wasn't.Most reviews on IMDb at the moment which are positive are from young women and yes this movie was made FOR THEM ONLY so I can understand why they are so happy with it. For all those people who read the books and saw the first movie, stick to the book for the real and most powerful New Moon experience and avoid the movie you will be happier in the long run.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth Seeing,"This movie was way better than twilight. Better acting, funny, and not to mention all the guys. Taylor worked hard and it shows. Even though Robert Pattinson wasn't in the movie that much (sad) it was a great movie. i cried, laugh, and was completely in love with the movie. If you haven't read the books you should, you will get more out of it. And people have to understand they can't put the whole book in a two hour movie. They might have to change something from the book to just get the point across in the movie and to make it flow a little better. Will see again in the future. And will buy the DVD once it comes out and watch it a million more times than twilight.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
decent enough,"i haven't read any of the books, so this is based just on the film.And it has more good aspects than bad ones. it has been beautifully shot and has occasional visually epic cinematic moments. the acting is solid, even if some of the characters lack a little dimension, with Charlie Swan (Billy Burke), although not in it much, being the most buy-able character. in a world of fantasy, character depth is sorely needed to make any of it believable. but if u accept the world its set in and are willing to go along for the ride, you shouldn't feel too perturbed, you'll get to see some stunning CGI that you wont see anywhere else, u might say ""transformative"". the narrative is a little patchy and jumpy at points but easy enough to follow, and makes enough sense to keep the interest. overall I'm satisfied to have seen it but i wont be rushing out to see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Worth the Wait,"Throughout this movie I felt like I was at a strip club. Every time Edward or Jakob appeared on screen all of the girls would scream. It was apparent that they were there because the guys are hot, not for their acting ability. I have been a fan of vampire films all of my life. I also love romantic movies. The film shows very little vampire related content and the romances are awkward. It is very slow moving and the acting seems awkward and not developed in parts. The best part of the movie for me was the last half hour or so. The wolves were cool. I spent most of this movie hoping it was almost over. From the start it dragged. I was hoping to see more of the Volturi and Dakota Fanning. I wish I just would of waited for it to come out on DVD.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie - Below Average !  [  Pros and Cons ],"Just watched this highly anticipated movie. Here I would like to give a few pros and cons for the movie.Pros:1 > Ashley Greene [ Alice ] looks stunning and is the only good thing which I honestly liked in the movie.2 > Michael Sheen also acted pretty well . Too bad he was just included in the last 20 minutes of the movie.Cons : 1 > Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart - Well I honestly didn't find any chemistry between them in this movie. They were poorly characterized and made the movie boring.2 > Taylor Lautner - Well he has got many scenes in this movie - And all the scenes he was without his T Shirt [ For Girls ]. First of all he looked like some gay model instead of an actor . The way he acted - well he was poor but he was better than the lead pair.3 > Direction : Well to be honest , he is the main person responsible in making the movie dull . No innovation - nothing !Some very poorly directed scenes with not so good actors4 > Script - I know the story is based on a novel. But the script and its execution was very very poor . I mean the writers get paid right - Even a 15 year old Twilight Series fan would write a better script than the one in the movie.So in all I have rated the movie a 5 - Thanks to the great story by Stephenie Meyer.PS : Would request the fans to think before they vote - The movie does not deserve a big 0 nor does it deserve a 10 ~",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a Marshmallow! Uhhh....I'm coming......I don't want you to come....,"Are just some of the corny lines that are delivered in this second masterpiece installment of the Twilight Saga. I think it's fair to say that it's okay to like this movie, everyone has their opinions, but here's mine. I didn't mind this movie at all, in fact I thought it was very unintentionally funny! But the difference between myself and others like me verses some die-hard ignore quality people, is that I enjoyed this movie, but still know that the production quality lacked, the dialog was horrible and overall, it was pretty sh*t....Wanna she Kristen Stewart act? You won't find it here. Maybe it's the source material she had to work with. Go watch her in 'Speak' or 'The Cake Eaters' she is a phenomenal actress (I've been a fan of hers ever since I saw her in 'Cold Creek Manor' back in the day, I always knew that little tomboy would be hot one day!). As for Rob, Taylor, Ashley and the others they know their part was just to stand there and look pretty. I'm sure, they do have talent, but it won't be shown here, rather their beauty did most of the work. Even esteemed actors Michael Sheen (the 'Lycan' in 'Underworld', and his Oscar nominated role in Frost/Nixon) and Dakota Fanning couldn't display their acting chops, probably again because of the source material.There's no reason for the dialog to come off that cheesy, unless of course it was intentional. Now I know why Catherine Hardwicke wanted to spend more time going over the script, instead of being hushed to make this. That's probably why she was replaced. Can you imagine the executives at Summit rushing out is sh*t-tackler film, what the next one is gonna be like? Not only was the script probably done in less time, but the fact that it's already done filming. Hopefully, the third will be better, but I didn't think the second was better than the first.........Production wise, I feel like a little more money should be spent to touching up the special effects. Summit knows it's gonna make a ton of money, either way. Why not put a little more into it? For the sake of the film as art.These films could be much better I believe, if a little more time was spend on QA control (revisions/time spent on the script, special effects etc.).....But nonetheless, it was fun to laugh and enjoy the film for the wrong reasons. No, this is not the worst movie I've seen this year.......that honor goes to 'The Fourth Kind'.....Now that pasty face (supposed real life Dr. Abigail Tyler) is more frightening then any vampire or werewolf in this film!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Agreed It Was Bad...,"Well,a lot of things that have been posted above are ""supposedly"" true...lack of acting skills,dialogue delivery,poor expressions etc.etc... Bella can't act, even after doing a few movies.(read:few seconds in ""Jumper and a movie called Messengers and so on."").Her expressions ARE lame.etc etc. DUDE! give her a break..I can bet if she looked as good as Megan Fox no one wud give a damn about how she acted...n there'd be more guys watching twilight than girls.I mean..most actresses can't really pull off a Julia Roberts or a Meryl Streep!(Well,they re my favorites!).N thats besides the point.Shes young,smart and tries he best to act....she just landed a role which required more depth and subtlety than what she could deliver.Is she a poor actress? time will tell.It's too early to say she s a bad actress.As far as I'm concerned.Yes,it was'not up to the mark(her acting)..but we all have put her into Bella's character by now and she's all we've got for the next two movies.I hope she learns...and will learn and try her best to smash her critics in the next one. I think she's got style and a lot of time on her hands to mature..like the transition from converses to designer gowns.I guess she'll hang around for a while..maybe it's just wishful thinking,but then,I like her somehow.Robert Pattinson.I must say,if he wasn't there...the twilight saga could'not have gone on.I mean it was because of him that legions of fans all over the world started adoring twilight , went on to new moon ..and so on. He's incredibly hot and I would use a million other adjectives but they wouldn't fit here.Am I smitten? Well fans all across the world are.and Twilight was definitely riding on his good looks (like New Moon is on Taylor Lautner's defined 6 pecs!)as there was nothing else to offer besides bad acting,poor dialogue delivery etc .etc...Once I got over the whole ""Oh hes so handsome"" phobia I realized he couldn't act that well , had weird expressions n it was a very average movie (new moon was way better).But I heard in an interview that hes ""Learning to act on the job""..well people..don't u think if millions of fans have noticed their poor acting,then they definitely have and obviously don't want to be cast away so soon so they must be doing something about it?? Well I really found him hot ever since Harry Potter..I hope he hangs in there for a few years thanks to his good looks and then goes on to become a better actor and lands better roles (Hopefully in Rom-Coms or something!)Taylor Lautner. Wow . what a body!! people kept saying its fake.But thats just to console themselves that their girlfriends won't run away from them.He looks hot too, and wow with the whole team jacob team edward thing,I guess mortal guys are having a hard time.Well I hated Jacob Black*(the character) for some odd reason..I guess I always thought he was the guy who was confusing Bella n ruining the eternal love story.Well I kinda liked him in the movie.Cute,Warm and Adorable.Acting?? he didn't have many dialogs..but i thought he was better than the other two.All in all.I'd like to tell people not to give up on this Saga so easily.Another thing is that in all Book Adaptations I've always noticed that the book is way better(LOTR ,HP) ..so stop comparing and talking about missing plots..everyone in the movie hall with u has already read it...so much for holes!Well I'd like to give it 5 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Promotes Bad Values in Women,"This movie, as with the first, encourages women to be promiscuous. This is a terrible movie, and you are a terrible person if you enjoy it.

To put it bluntly, Bella is a whore. The sad thing is that little girls will watch this movie, and think that this is normal behavior and they will behave this way as well when they grow up.

It's a good thing to get caught up in and escape from the dull boredom of reality. I wish I had a forbidden love that could put some excitement in my life.I did like that they brought the story to a location outside of Forks, as it made for a more epic and collaborative story and it made for better adventure.

Only for Twilight lovers,"New Moon being the second in the series, it doesn't have the ""new"" feeling to it anymore. Which doesn't matter too much as most of the viewers are probably Twilight readers anyways. I liked the first movie better, and preferred the third one in the sense that this second movie is a lot less ""normal"" visually. All of a sudden Bella wears a lot more refined make-up for example, Jasper's and Rosalie's wigs are just too ridiculous for words and the red eyes of the ""non vegetarians"" are much too red.

Love Triangle Extraordinaire,"What are the chances that in your life time you not only meet a vampire, but also werewolves, and both are coveting you ? Twilight saga continues with Bella's life changing with Edward moving away, and a new boy in her life. This movie is not a stand alone piece, and other Twilight sagas should be seen before seeing this movie.Edward has second thoughts about his relation with Bella, and he decides to move away. But other ""non vegetarian"" vampires are not so easy to let go, and decides to eat Bella. Who comes to rescue but a pack of giant werewolves. Jacob, who she's dating turns out to be a werewolf, and wouldn't want vampires to touch her. There's a vampire's version of what looks like Vatican in Italy. Thinking Bella is dead, Edward goes there to end his own life. Bella chases after Edward to save his life. She does, but the stipulation is that Bella becomes one of them.The story moves along slowly, but there's excellent story telling in each chapter of this movie. Since they've already made their mind up to make at least a trilogy, they can take time to expand on the story. The plot is good, and unusualness of the setting of each of the sub- plot, makes this movie entertaining to watch.Krsiten Stewart is perfect in her leading role, and so are the other co-stars. This is one semi- low budget movie that blows away other higher budget productions. Definitely a movie worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
This part is my favorite,"While I don't really like this Saga, New Moon is my favorite among the 3 parts that were released. Bella has finally got some skin color because in the first part she was looking like a vampire herself. In this part we see some intense feelings and more action. While in the first part everything seemed artificial, dark and pale, here there are more colors which is more pleasant to watch. Scenes are made in a more attractive way, Bella seems more beautiful. However I still have problems with Kirsten's portrayed Bella, I can't decide if she is acting bad or is Bella supposed to be so emotionless?.. She really can't express feelings well which doesn't let me to dive into the story. It leaves me indifferent. Her father also seems pretty emotionless. My favorite part is the ending where the whole beauty starts, I really love the color red so visually for me it is really pleasant to watch! This part is really something compared to the empty first part of Twilight Saga where I couldn't feel the love that was born between Bella and Edward at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A huge drop in quality compared to the first movie,"I don't understand all this complaining that vampires are supposed to be ugly and not sparkle. Vampires may ride on rainbow unicorns as far as I am concerned, they are not real and it's not like the existing mythology on them is not without its contradictions. The vampires in I Am Legend where fugly, and it still didn't make for a good film (which wrecked a fantastic novel). If you go to watch a supernatural romance film geared towards young women, you can't complain that well, what you watched was a supernatural romance geared at young women, and not Nosferatu. But you can complain if it's a terrible one! I'm not well acquainted with the books (have skimmed through the first one quickly, but it really wasn't my cup of tea and never finished it), but I saw the first movie on DVD a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised, it was neither particularly original or well acted, but it was a good portrayal of teenage emotions and longing, well paced, well shot, some gorgeous cinematography and an excellent soundtrack, a director who understood the teenage psyche.So sitting yesterday in a cinema packed with overexcited women and their grumbling other halves, I was fairly optimistic. I was not exactly expecting Citizen Kane or Rashomon here, but I didn't expect the subtle brooding moodiness of the first film to be replaced with such cringe-worthy and over the top ridiculousness. Either Meyer's writing took a nosedive in the second book, or the first director managed to pluck the best elements out of the first novel, while Weitz chose the worst ones from the second one. Having watched his Golden Compass film, where he managed to suck all life out of that brilliant Pullman novel, I'm inclined to blame him.Where can I even start? Horrible pacing, rushing through action and then slowing down to a snail's pace (I almost nodded off halfway through), picking up again crazily, without any rhyme or reason. Some godawful dialogue that had me squirming in my seat with embarrassment for being there, a by-the-numbers soundtrack of cheesy violins, and some huge misfires, the slow-motion running hand in hand through the woods had the entire audience laughing like hyenas. The Volturi looked and talked like something Anne Rice would have concocted during a bad acid trip. Awful, robotic CGI. Everything that was subtle and implied in the first film, was hammered on our heads again and again on the second one. Lack of chemistry, lack even of logic at times.A film built around shirtless scenes and marriage proposals, instead of atmosphere, feeling and plot, and a director that seemed to neither understand nor have a shred of respect for his audience.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"No, the CGI was NOT good","I might have given this film a 7/10 for being not half bad, provided that there were no werewolves or vampires in it. Whoever is in charge of this stuff needs to understand that you only do the effects that you CAN do.I burst out laughing the first time the werewolves were on the screen, and again when we were actually shown the transition from stud-boy to cartoon-wolf. I don't think that was supposed to be the effect, but it did liven up the film a bit.Even simple effects like Bella's hallucinations of Edward were pretty bad. It's like they didn't even try... just overlaying some stupid Photoshop effect directly onto the rest of the video, instead of blending it in.Don't even get me started on Edward's fight with the Volturi. We go from The Matrix to THIS? Oh the shame of it.Aside from the CGI, the film is an hour too long, and vampires STILL do not sparkle. But if they did, it would look better than that.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I gave film saga a second chance and I just about approved,"OK so Twilight for me was bad....I hadn't read the books which was probably why I completely hated it, it didn't make sense so I went home and read the books and although i still don't like the film, I can see why people like it. I enjoyed the books, the ending was a bit predictable but overall it made me think about giving the films a second chance.So there i was at the midnight screening, in a packed room of teen girls, middle aged women, over excited guys and the clearly bored looking boyfriends who had been dragged along against their will. The title came on and people cheered, and every time Edward or Jacob appeared there was whooping.But i ignored it all, actually decided to watch the film, the first half hour dragged, and I mean dragged, there is only so much lack of acting from Edward and Bella you can take before you feel like shooting yourself in the face. The scenes were directed well but those two managed to ruin it, i don't see how they were cast for these films as they both struggle to show any emotion, instead keeping the same faces from start to finish.But its gets better, Jacob is better not brilliant but he at least looks like he's trying, luckily the support cast make up for the lack of effort from the main characters.The special effects were good, much improvement on the first (you can see the budget difference), the script was better but sometimes I did cringe as the actors delivered them badly and some lines should of been left out all together.The film picks up pace and the end is pretty good. I did enjoy it, it wasn't great but it kept me entertained enough that I didn't feel like I had wasted my money.But not everyone will enjoy this film, you have to overlook a lot of downsides to enjoy such as the main character being unable to deliver a line while showing actual feeling. Im not going to complain about the topless guys (as many men reviewing this film have), although sometimes utterly pointless, I have seen enough films where girls walk around with it all hanging out for it be about time I can enjoy watching topless men for a change It doesn't do the books justice but its not that bad that you feel like demanding your money back, just try to overlook the fact that Edward and Bella have the acting ability of a rock.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not horrible...,"I saw Twilight before reading the series and I thought it was well done. After reading the book, I still agreed with my original thought, it held true to the book and cut out only what wasn't extremely important to the story. Now, of course, I read the books before seeing New Moon. The thing that bothered me the most about the movie is what always bothers me about sequels... the characters, while the same, looked different; and on my way home, I figured out it was the eyes. While it seems like such a trivial piece of the movie, the gold tones, as opposed to the blue tint, worked for everything except the eyes. the vampires in this series are supposed to be friendly, safe, and as harmless and one-of-us as possible. This made them look very freakish which was not the case in the first movie.Other than the screaming teenagers that I wanted to smack that were ga-ga over Jacob, I thought it was decent. They cut out parts of the book that weren't completely relevant to the film and it worked well without, but because I knew what happened I easily followed the undertones and inferences left in the film. I went with a friend who had not read the books and she enjoyed it as well and didn't think it was hard to follow without knowing more details.Overall, it was good. Some minor bad, clich√©, acting points, but forgivable with their charm and love for the story. Only time will tell if I continue to like it after seeing it again when I can really dig deeper into the script.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not as bad as everyone is saying, but undeniable room for improvement.","To fans of the Twilight series: This is definitely NOT as bad a film as the reviewers and others are saying! You shouldn't let their negative comments stop you from seeing this movie. That being said...There is absolutely room for improvement!I think the problems really start with the trailer. It makes people who watch it (who have not read the books) think that this is another Vampire action fantasy with some romance, when in actuality it's neither. The film is, like the novel, mainly and angst ridden story about a teenage girl dealing with loss. There is some romance and some action and of course fantasy, but 80% of the film is angsty dialogue.Another big problem carries over from the first film.... line delivery. It is possible that some of the actors are too inexperienced to play rolls that are so dependent on portraying extreme emotions, mainly inner turmoil. But either way, I do think that these are incredibly difficult characters to portray, and pretty much impossible to pull of successfully with this script and short amount of time given. Also, there's absolutely an issue with character development, especially in this installment.And, that brings me to chemistry; Stewart and Pattinson have none! I know what the tabloids say, but give me a break! I feel as though Stewart has much better chemistry with Lautner in New Moon than she's ever had with Pattinson, which is one of the reasons I liked this installment! In this film, as in Twilight, I just kept wondering... ""Why do you like him (Edward) so much?"". It just seems so awkward between the two of them. Never romantic, or sexy, but tense and uncomfortable. And, that's bad! There are awkward moments in the novels, but it's more an ""I want to be with you, but can't because I might kill you, but still love you more than anything."" awkwardness, rather than an ""I can't touch you, or look at you, or smile at you because I'm concentrating on blinking."" awkwardness.All that being said, there are some great moments in this film. From the relationship development between Bella and Jacob, to the introduction of new and exciting characters, to the general sticking to the actual plot... again, it's definitely worth seeing!A general caution: If you have not read the books or seen the first movie, you will be completely lost and most likely hate this film! At least read the cliff notes!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Saga Continues!! Mediocre Sequel!!,"It wasn't as good as it's predecessor, but still it was pretty good. Kristen Stewart's acting was quite remarkable and the other actors also did well. But there were part here and there, where I felt bored, because of slow pacing of the storyline. Overall, it was worth watching, but I wanna see more in the next sequel and how it all turns out to be.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pure Masterpiece,"I saw this movie today after reading a large majority of the novel, comparing both I'd say Directer Chris Weitz portrayed his vision the way the book was intended also full respect to Taylor Lautner (Jacob Black) and the visual effects provided. Unlike Twilight Director, Catherine Hardwick, Chris Weitz gave the film a lot more character packed with more action and darker themes which will keep your eyes glued to the screen.New Moon is a massive achievement kick starting a turning point to the Twilight Saga, I promise those who weren't fond of the first film will get more than what they bargained for.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Monotonal though enjoyable film,"Yes the movie is overlong, and yes its like a teenage soap opera, but if you've seen the first film you shouldn't really be expecting much more.All throughout the movie I found myself anticipating a peak, hoping what seemed like filler would build up to something greater. Well, there was somewhat of a peak, but it felt disconnect from what came before. In terms of story the movie fell kinda flat. If anything it just felt like a set up for the next one.So why the 7? Well, I was entertained, and despite the film never going anywhere, my attention and interest never wained. I found the characters intriguing and dialogue interesting enough to add eclipse to my list of 'want to see movies'If you weren't a fan of the first, you won't find much here to change your mind. But if you were, you should be adequately entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An EXTREMELY crap sequel.,"Ok! This movie was bad. The writting is just doing my head in. Nothing happens. NOTHING! I was expetiing the performances to be better than the first, but they were actually worse than the first. This film doesn't even have a climax. It's just a set up movie for the 3rd. The only stand out performance was Billy Burke as Bella's Dad. This film was oainful to sit through. The VFX is pretty tv standard. I don't rrally recommend this film, but I suppose it's necessary for the 3rd, 4th a d final films.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Chris Weitz turns New Moon into generic money maker,"I really did not like the feel of New Moon. I love the story and have read all the books. New Moon was pretty much spot on with the book in the sense that scenes were 98% book derived. However, Weitz's take on New Moon has left me feeling annoyed. He took a sensual, magical book and first movie and turned it into a stereotypical American money maker ""blockbuster"".The movie was all fast, cheesily cut dialogue with almost no time to feel real emotion from the characters. I did not appreciate the scenes in which Weitz tried to turn a serious situation into a comedy by having the characters emphasize lines into a joke that were not meant to be funny. But I guess that's what brainless American's want so he had to go there.The movie felt rushed and did not properly show the relationship formed between Bella and Jacob. Yeah the movie would have been longer but many fans would be willing sit through it anyways for the sake of a properly made movie.The eyes, the eyes, the eyes. Waaaaaay overdone. These contacts were so crazy looking compared to the ones in the first movie it was almost hard to concentrate on the lines. The more subtle look fit much better.And last I want to express my disgust with the musical score. Why oh why did you all have to ruin the musical integrity of the movie? All major movies do NOT need a full orchestra playing suspenseful music to make watchers feel a scene. It's really corny and at times I felt like I was watching something more like Home Alone. Twilight had a more intense feeling because this was not done. Whoever is doing Breaking Dawn, save the corny violins and clarinets for your next Hollywood production. And if Eclipse has this same sort of orchestrated music, edit the movie and do it like Twilight. :)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This series should never have been made into a movie,"I don't blame the actors, the cast or the crew. I blame the writer, Stephanie Meyer, for producing absolute trash. Bella is the most unlikeable, worst character ever. Stubborn as hell, extremely selfish who doesn't give a crap about anyone except for herself and what she wants, boring and nothing special about her. How anyone can root for her, goes beyond me.
This book should never have been published, let alone made into a movie. It came out in the era where books and stories like Harry Potter and the Hunger Games were being made into movies, and there's absolutely no comparison. It's such a disappointment. Whereas books like Harry Potter and the Hunger Games teach us about courage and bravery and sacrifice for the greater good. This book goes in the complete opposite direction. The worst part is, it appeals to a young crowd who can easily be manipulated in losing all their values. Basically Stephanie Meyer is teaching all youth that if you are stubborn as hell, selfish, don't give a crap about your family or friends and constantly chase bad things, you're gonna get rewarded with something as fake as Edward Cullen. It's so wrong. It's affecting the youth horribly into thinking that everything that Bella did, is justifiable. This should have been banned.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I don't get the overall negativity here sorry,"OK I understand that these books have sold millions of copies and there are people that are to the point of obsessed with them (I consider myself one of them actually). However I have also seen more than enough movies to know that you can't expect a movie to be much like a book, if for no reason than books can tell you the internal motivations of any character they focus on, which movies can't do. Also take into account that it is a 600 plus page first person narrative (as in told from Bella's perspective only) and that makes it nearly impossible to convert accurately to anything resembling a movie unless you turn it into a 10 hour miniseries. So they changed the order of some things around, added a couple of things to make it a little more visually stunning for the movie person that hasn't read the books, and dropped a whole lot of stuff just so they could get it onto a movie screen. I think they did an excellent job of condensing it down and still keeping it coherent and somewhere within the themes of the book it is based on. The acting is generally good, especially Taylor Lautner as Jacob, who it the character the whole movie hinges on really, because if he wasn't such a strong presence the whole concept would collapse. Kristen Stewart who plays Bella even manages to be interesting, which is something of a feat considering she spends probably 80 per cent of the movie in something resembling a clinical depression. It is certainly a movie I will be adding to my collection when it makes its DVD release and I enjoyed it immensely.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More action and fantasy - but is that so good?,"Bella Swan (Stewart) struggles to adapt to life after Edward (Pattinson) leaves for her own safety and soon she is spending time with Jacob (Lautner) who is a werewolf.There is a certain credibility with watching this film if you are not a teenage girl. For one the appreciation of love and lust intermixed with the foundations of friendship are all maturely depicted in Stephanie Meyer's book so you are looking for a good adaptation of mature emotions. There is however sadness on the stereotypical portrayal of viewers for these twilight films; teenage girls watch for the sheer factor of Pattinson and Lautner. But the refusal to watch a film based on the fan base is frankly ridiculous.The sequel to the globally popular Twilight has already spurned millions in cash and even broken The Dark Knight's record for biggest opening day, but does the money guarantee satisfaction? The old saying of the film is never as good as the book is absent here as there is plenty more action to be enjoyed. However the generation of emotion from the book never fully comes across on film. The critics jumped on the lack of action in the first and this picture tries to make amends and does so with a passion of action.This is the main reason the film is to be enjoyed. The brief but well directed trial bike sequence on the appropriate wet roads is good and the cliff diving sequence adds a spice of darkness and passion to the feelings of Bella. The wolves generate a feeling of spice and action, in good sync when Laurent emerges. In general the film has a livelier outburst and the sequences of action and fighting are far better than the brief scenes in Twilight. Therefore this should be appreciated by a wider audience as we still have the love.The book had the action sequences and this film justifies them well enough to satisfy the twi-hards. Balancing the action and dialogue was well portrayed as well.However this film has a few major flaws. For one the general feeling is never quite accurate. We can not really associate with Bella during her tough parts of separation. The constant inclusion of a ghostly Edward giving advice does not benefit the supposed feeling of isolation. And perhaps the initial love and companionship the two main characters had in the first film feels irrelevant in the grand scheme of proceedings here.The soundtrack boasts new artists all over and we can never have appropriate silence to reflect the mood. Chris Weitz must be quite green as if he isn't shooting a pair of branches or trees he is shooting a hard to view werewolf.However this is a good fun film. Jacob is a better character than Edward owing to his more adventurous personality which adds another dimension of love. The action is far better and though the feeling of love isn't as high as the first this is a worthy watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Utter bum water,"What's good: a had a nice little snooze
What's bad: script, photography, acting, Kristen Stewart looking like she's smelling a bad fart, weird glowing characters.

Guys shouldn't have cut so many scenes,"So, I am over 25 and I liked the books.First, I'd like to say that it'd be nice if people could get to know the story before going to see the movie and kill it in a comment. A lot of people are focused on Bella's behavior, what the people do and how the story goes ; it's in the book, all of it. I mean, you may not like the actors, the music or whatever but if you don't like the story, just don't go see the movie!Now, about the film, it is true, the love part is not shown enough ; the movie is very slow - lots of shots of the actors faces, not moving, lots of pauses - and in the same time too quick, at the end it goes too fast and the story is impossible to understand if you didn't read the books. Plus, some things present in the books are not needed here, or would have to be explained. Lots of cheesy sentences - you do need sentences before and after to make sense... The actors have 10 sentences each/1 sentence for each passage of the film, and big (funny) parts of the book have been taken away.Some guys just cut too many parts of the movie because someone had decided it had to be 2h and not more.Action scenes are really good.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I am totally confused - my review may contain some spoilers,"I am a die-hard fan of the series. I have read all the books of the twilight saga and I have watched Twilight too. I went to see New Moon on the opening night in Greece and although I can say that the movie was true to the book I can't say that I liked it or maybe it is best to say that I only liked some parts of the movie.First of all, I think that the movie was just a sum of the scenes that the die-hard fans wanted to see, like we were all following a check list or something and I thought there wasn't any true cohesion between them.Secondly in my opinion the chemistry that there was between Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in the first movie of the series, was somehow gone and replaced by awkwardness and stupid looks. In the first movie, I really loved the way Robert was playing the character of Edward, I don't know what happened to him in New Moon, his playing was just bad.Also Kristen Stewart just SUCKS in this movie. I really liked this girl, in the previous film, I though she had her own way of getting in the role of the character but in New Moon she was terrible. She was doing all the time this stupid eye blinking thing, which I didn't understood at all. I thought that she couldn't portray at all, Bella's feelings.I think this movie belongs to Jacob and the actor portraying him. (Taylor Lautner). I really believe this kid has done an excellent job. He really got into the role and although I am not a fan of his, in this particular movie I really really liked him. He was the only actor that was actually playing, while the others were just sharing stupid moments of silence and awkwardness. Congrats Taylor!!!Finally I hated the make up they used on actors. Especially the colors they used for Edward. OMG it was terrible. They made his skin look somehow gray and not white as it should be and his lips were kind of strange, like they were smudged with a brown lipstick or something. Totally, totally bad!!! Also what happened to Edward's hair? In all the four books and in Twilight too, Edward is supposed to have bronze messy hair. Maybe that sounds like a tiny detail but for this character this detail was his trademark. So where is it??? The vampire eyes were kind of strange too. I preferred the Twilight version.Finally, the wolves were bad. They seemed fake to me. Like the wolves of a video game or something. I was waiting for so long for this movie to come out and unfortunately I was disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better not to have high expectation.,"I've never read the novel New Moon so I went to the cinemas with no expectation whatsoever than what I seen in the trailer. So here's in a nutshell.The Good: The acting is actually better than what most reviewers said. Kristen Stewart did a great job playing a depressed Bella who just got out of a relationship. She really captures the emotion of only someone who has experienced that can know. The only person who is better than her was Dakota Fanning, playing the vampire Jane. She only gets a few minutes of screen time but it was enough to convince me how evil her character is and how good Dakota is.Next, the CGI was a bit early millennium. But it was adequate.The storyline itself was engaging. And the whole story was kept well-paced.The bad: What makes the movie not as good as what the audience expected is because it lost its original formula from Catherine Hardwicke's Twilight. There were less chemistry between the actors. The directing and editing could've been better. It's just the entire atmosphere of the movie seems 'not right'.Overall: New Moon is a great movie if you haven't yet read the book. If you have, then you might be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beautiful!,"New Moon would have been my favorite of the series if the Breaking Dawn Part 2 didn't happen. This movie is incredible from beginning to end! With it's terrific acting, thrilling moments, perfect soundtrack, and an amazing second love story about Jacob and Bella.
When I first watched Twilight, I was all on team Edward. But then seeing Jacob and Bella together just destroyed that. I love Jacob and Bella's chemistry. I almost feel that Bella was way more comfortable around Jacob's tribe, and Jacob himself. The way they connected with each other was just so real and natural. However, towards the end, I do understand why she picks Edward-even though I would pick Jacob-and am completely happy with who she picked.
One of my all time favorite scenes is when Bella is running through the crowd in Italy to get Edward. That whole scene is just amazing and creates the suspense.
The only thing I hated was how Jacob told Edward Bella was dead. It was just so childish.
Overall, this movie is one of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
hhmmm.......,"I would just like to start off by saying that I have read all the books and seen Twilight and New Moon.I saw New Moon when it came out (i saw the midnight premiere) and thought the movie was pretty good. I believe it met my expectations. But my brother, who is not a fan, told me about all the reviews that were on this website and I don't agree with most of them. Until I came to one that made a great point. If you like it ""Yay"", if not than ""Yay for you too"".Yes, the movie did lack some of the books important points (like the flight home from Italy and the grand theft auto of the infamous porsche) and Rosalie did look like crap. But what really bothered me was the over-criticism this movie has gotten. So what if the vampires shimmer instead of turning to ash and so what if they want to be ""vegetarian"". Vampires ARE NOT real. So Stephanie Meyer has every right to make vampires however she thought fit. And to be honest I'm glad this wasn't another cheesy dungeon and coffin vampire story. Or one where the vampires jump around in leather suits wearing sunglasses all the time. More power to someone who wanted to take a different outlook on the traditional, FICTIONAL, boring vampire.I think the actors did a good job and I like all of Kristin Stewart's movies. So I knew what to expect. And on another note, Bella is supposed to be emotionless. Someone she loved just left her. I'm sure most people have experienced heartache. Yes, even you men. Now I'm not a teeny bopper so I don't take the story so literal, but why criticize Bella so much for Edward leaving her. It's fiction, that's those people's fault for believing that all men are that way. And that all relationships are that controlling over a human. If anyone had really read the book, they would have gotten the story and why the movie was the way it was.I do hope that Eclipse is better in some aspects. But each one is supposed to be uniquely different than the other. So I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for the next one.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I have read that most think the last books are the worst but as an avid reader of romance, horror, and fantasy I enjoyed those the most.Now for my movie review...with what they had to work with the movie wasn't as god awful or bad as I imagined and I was surprised to find myself entertained in the same average way I was entertained reading the book series. They followed the book very closely unlike almost every other book to movie I have seen. The makeup was still pretty awful and I hope in the third movie they figure out a way to make the vampires look more like vamps and less like drag queens. One thing I hoped they would do to the movies was create some chemistry with the leads instead of the dry obsessiveness of the book Edward and Bella. I don't understand and am quite confused how anyone can think there is any lovey dovey romance with these characters. I mean I can't think of one scene in the whole movie/book series that I can go aww they really are made for each other! (if someone can point me to that part I think I missed it...)I read lots of complaints about the acting and there was some parts of bad acting but again I don't find them completely at fault since SM cheesed out their book counterparts.Overall I gave this movie a 7. 3 for the story, 1 for making it a better movie than the book, 1 for keeping me interested for 2 hours, and 2 for good luck since it got a lot of one stars and to be fair it didn't deserve it. Sure it wasn't a blockbuster but it wasn't as bad as people are making it out to be.Oh and on a side note the worst part of the movie was when they are at the movies and..omg that was so dumb. :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as good as the first,"I read all the books already and then watched the first one. I enjoyed the first one was done very well and stayed with the book pretty good. I was actually amazed because I didn't think it would be done well. So now I watched New Moon. Hmmmm. Well I honestly didn't expect it to be all that good because of basically Dakota Fanning playing the part of Jane. Well guess I was wrong on one part. It wasn't her that ruined it for me. I honestly don't think this movie was done well at all. And looking at all the ratings I wouldn't be surprised that the other two won't even be made now. It just seemed like to me that the parts that shouldn't have been rushed were rushed and then there were so many parts that seemed to drag out forever never should have been done. I can see why a lot of people didn't like this one at all. The last half hour was so rushed it was pathetic and took away from the big climax of what happened. It seemed like they though oh darn, we only have a half hour left and we haven't done this part yet. The acting yeah isn't the greatest but they did pull it off in the first one well enough. This one showed how bad the acting was I think because they dragged out parts they shouldn't of. Oh and don't get me started on the music. I don't think hardly any of it was any good in this movie. I don't know if because they had a different director or what was why this one wasn't as good but it wasn't. If they do end up making the next two I hope they learned from their mistakes on this one and at least do the other two some justice. I will grant you at least they did stick to the book pretty well, they just over emphasized a lot of parts they never should have. I basically would say don't bother seeing it in theatres, wait til it comes out on DVD.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
book vs movie,I'm reading the new moon these day.. not even half-way thru it ..and i love it already..mesmerizing... movie on the other hand lacks the depth..i loved the movie.. but honestly think thati could have enjoyed an extra hour too to adjust most(if not everything)what book has to offer.don't miss the movie-it gives a face to all the overwhelming things u imagine..don't miss the book- its a wonder.i just cant get enough i guess!,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"New Moon Has Some Good:  Jacob, the Soundtrack","I have a dirty little secret. I am 32 years old, and I have read the Twilight book series (all of them) and watched the movies. Now, I have a semi-excuse. I am a young adult librarian and service to teens is my first priority. This means I am supposed to know what teens enjoy so that I can use that knowledge to develop programs for them at the library. However, while this explains why I might have read a couple of the books, it doesn't explain why I chose to go see the New Moon movie at midnight this morning.It was a last minute decision. I didn't have to work today so I thought, why not? Usually the big midnight releases are on Tuesday nights and I have to work in the morning. Plus I happen to live right down the street from a really cool community movie theater. It is quieter than the big cineplexes. I had no trouble getting a ticket at the last minute or finding a seat. They serve freshly popped popcorn, which yes, is a anomaly in the movie theater business.So here's my reaction to the movie, and I'll attempt to do this without spoilers. Of course, it's pretty hard to spoil this movie when everyone knows the story for the most part.The Good: The best parts of this movie are when Bella is alone or with Jacob. Their chemistry is real. And why wouldn't it be? Have you seen those abs? Little Jacob looks GOOD in this movie. The man-boy has a temperature of 140 degrees, and I am always cold. And when Bella is Edward-less, Kristen Stewart gives a fragile and sincere performance. I felt the wall she built around herself, and I felt it tumble as Jacob's warmth melts it away. I am on Team Jacob, but no one can deny that Bella and Jacob had a better connection in this movie. Maybe it's because Edward hardly shows up, but it's pretty obvious.Okay, yes, there are some very cheesy parts in Taylor Lautner's Jacob performance. Couldn't they get him a better wig? But he did what this part required, he looked good (I read today that he had given up ice cream, poor guy) and he had a good combination of anger and brokenness to pull Jacob off. And he loses the wig halfway through.I also have to say the soundtrack is outstanding. Some great songs, and maybe without the songs I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie so much. The right song can cover up many flaws in a film. I found links to the songs on youtube that were especially good. Hearing Damage by Thom Yorke played over a chase scene, and gave the moment an ethereal quality. The next one was Possibility by Lykke Li, which plays during a rather sad moment in the film. This singer reminds me so much of Julee Cruise (turn this one up, it has a great dance to it, too) who sang many of the tracks off of the Twin Peaks TV series soundtrack. Maybe not the exact sound or timbre, but just the feeling of despair you feel when listening to the songs.The Bad: The vampires all look TERRIBLE in this movie. At the beginning scenes, Edward looks all right. But the vampires do not look good. I think in general, they have done a horrible job making these vampires look good. Most of the actors are attractive, but the makeup is so bad. They are all pale and frigid looking. The vampires are supposed to be alluring, but it didn't work out that way. When we first see Edward after a long absence, we are comparing him in our minds with the muscular, tan, warm person of Jacob. And Edward and Bella together have no chemistry. They had some in the first movie, but it's gone. Bella doesn't even seem to like Edward's company. And Edward looks constipated the whole time.Go Team Jacob! I would say if you are a fan of these books and this concept, you should see the movie. If you have no interest in this series, the movies are not for you. What I want to know is, will it get better or worse? As a Jacob fan, I know I am going to hate the last movie, but the third one could be the best.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very good!,"I have read the books(I'm just finishing them for the 2nd time) and I went into the movie excited but not expecting a lot. A movie just never is CLOSE to as good as a book. The guys in the wolf pack were beautiful(as were the graphics.) Fanning and the guys who played Aro, Caius, and Marcus were all wonderful additions. Even Jasper's(Jackson Rathbone) acting is better! I loved it! It's full of action, adventure, and OF COURSE romance. I even jumped once or twice. (This coming from a CHEAP chick) I thought the movie was so worth the $10 we paid to see it that I'm going again!My only dissatisfaction? I'm really frustrated by the number of people who voted low on this movie BEFORE it was even out. I may be wrong, but though there must have been a FEW people who saw it before it was out for the public, there were over 2,000 which leads me to believe that a lot of non-Stephanie Meyers, non-Twilight, non-Robert Pattinson fans must have voted. Oh well, I thought it was great!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fans and Critics both need to shut it,"For anyone not familiar with the Twilight story, it is a pretty simple (and pretty clich√©d now) premise about a love affair between a vampire (Edward) and a human (Bella). In this chapter, Bella reconnects with her childhood friend (Jacob) after Edward decides he has to leave town with his family and never see Bella again. The two main conflicts of the film are 1) A love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob and 2) Dealing with Victoria, the vampire who wants Bella dead after the Cullens (Edward's family) killed her boyfriend in the previous movie.I'll say this right away, I think the Twilight series is far overrated by its fans, but far underrated by its critics. I'll just go right into the good vs bad.The Good:-The setting. I REALLY love the small town in the middle of the northwest US forest setting, and I think it was a perfect place to have all this occur.-The special effects. Sure it was pretty obvious -when- there was CG, but it was still handled pretty well and not overdone.-The characters. I definitely have some complaints about a few of them, but most are pretty intriguing. In particular I thought Alice, Jacob, and the Valteri were far more interesting than Edward and Bella. In turn, the acting is pretty decent also. Say what you want about Kristen Stewart, but she knows how to play the mopey teen quite convincingly.The Bad:-The clich√©. Don't you miss when vampires used to be evil? Nowadays we have Twilight, True Blood, the Vampire Diaries, The Gates, countless novels cashing in on Twilight's success...the list goes on. I really miss the days of Buffy and Angel when there were only one or two good vampires in the WORLD.-The vampire rules. Here are the ""physics"" for vampires in this world: ~They are almost invincible. Sunlight and staking won't kill them. They're too damned strong!! They have to be completely obliterated to be killed...like completely dismembered or burned to a cinder. This means it would probably be impossible for a human to kill a vampire in this world because they are also super strong and SUPER fast. ~In the sunlight, they don't die. Their skin simply shimmers. You probably already knew this because it is the only thing that the Twilight critics ever complain about. ~I'm fairly certain that simply being bitten by a vampire without being killed will turn a person into one...inconvenient ~ Many vampires have extra powers. Future visions, mind-reading, and other psychic things ~There is a truce between vampires and werewolves (though they aren't really werewolves, they are shifters. werewolves need a full moon to change). The wolves protect humans and cannot harm vampires unless they break the truce. Simply put, the vampires are too overpowered.-The ANGST!! My god, after Edward leaves Bella, she mopes in her room for like four months! She is completely prepared to throw her life away for some guy she met a few months ago. Edward is even worse. He's been around for ~119 years but he is completely prepared to die just because this girl he met recently may or may not be dead. These crazy teens and their ""all or nothing"" attitudes... I literally had to facepalm when Edward told Bella ""you are my only reason to go on living."" Sure that sounds romantic to all the clueless 13 year old girls watching, but what the hell was his reason for living four months ago?Like I said before, the fans need to shut up and the critics need to shut up. Overall I thought New Moon, like Twilight, was not ""God's gift to movie watchers,"" but was still a decent film that I don't regret watching.Final score - 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the first movie,"This may not be the best movie out there but you have to agree that this movie is much better than the first one. I've read all the books and in the beginning when the first movie came out, I didn't really want to watch Twllight because the trailer looked very boring and not interesting at all. But my friends kept telling me to watch it and so I did. I saw a bit of the movie and realized that it was crap! I turned off the TV after 10 minutes. The gray and dark colors in the movie kinda ruined it and so did the acting.But New Moon is different and I kind of liked it. It's not my favorite movie but I think that Taylor Lautner really did an amazing job in here and so did the others. They found the right people to play the characters. Some of the acting was a bit too overreacted. But there is one thing I want to say about Kristens acting, she can't scream, I'm truly sorry but when she screamed in this movie I couldn't stop laughing, it sounded like a pig in pain.If your fan of the books you should watch this movie, it's worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I enjoyed it,"Well, I think most people are too critical. The shots were great, the music was perfect and the acting was not so bad. Kristen and Rob do not have such a strong chemistry on screen but Taylor and Kristen do.I loved some ideas, some key shots. Anyway, they act rather good, better than in Twilight. The overall was much better than the first one, it was a better mirror of the book than I expected. The Volturi part was partly disappointing. I expected something more...grand. The action was entertaining. They did a great job. It's not as far as bad as all these people say, really. I don't think that they have a fair opinion about it",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilight: New Moon - take your girlfriend along!,"When you have friends who have all the Stephenie Meyer's books at least once, and before the release of the movie the race is to finish the book once more. This is time you get dragged into watching Twilight Series - Second edition - New Moon. Even though you know, you are not going to be spooked, scared or traumatized by blood sucking vampires or bad smelly mutts werewolves. If it was true, i would not be watching scary movies in dark theatres.Jacob who is running after shirtless and gets converted into super awesome werewolf, this is the only time i love the this movie, when i see werewolves, but after sometime, it reminds me of Remus Lupin from Harry Potter series. The story very complicated (pun intended) it is a choice between a werewolf and a vampire for the poor always dreamy looking and dreaming (Isa)Bella. The werewolf fight sequences have a nice CG effects being used, but then this is not an action movie, it a romantic movie of forbidden love.On Edward, the vampire boyfriend, his appearance on the screen, i was always standing there, but you just notice my presence with the expressionless (read as stylish) look. On Bella, why is she so serious, she just doesn't smile in the movie, she can sit hours while a guy is fixing a motorcycle, months brooding or thinking over lost forbidden love. Whne the next comes along she has am awesome rebound relationship erupting only to realise that he is also not a normal human being. At the same time, you may be able to relate the feelings, but never the situations in your real life. At that very moment i was enjoying my caramel popcorn.If you want to impress your girlfriend, then take her for this movie, there is something about this movie, story, novel that makes them start thinking and if you make them watch this movie, they will be yours in the forbidden love. But remember, this is not a children's movie no more, the audience have widened to even grandmothers. The violins in the soundtrack does spook you, but then they are there to bring in more dramatics in already abrupt jumping of scenes and countries, the soundtrack is pretty well done and and supports the cinematography.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thank you to all you moaners :),"I personally enjoyed this film very much, so rated it with a strong 7/8 out of 10.Film Psychology: Does anyone else tend to enjoy films more after so many people have slated them??? I certainly do, and it is NOT intentional! So thank you to all you moaners who made this film so enjoyable for me :PI read the books a year back and thoroughly enjoyed them, so i will admit that they were not 'that' fresh in my mind. However i still came away from the film a happy camper.There were weaknesses in the film (rushed plot, suspect acting) but the film was still fast paced, great action scenes, and great special effects.And the end scenes with the Volturi put the icing on the cake for me, (even they looked nothing how they were portrayed in the book) The next 2 movies will be improved and even more amazing i'm sure!

I want my money back!,"I thought I'd please my girlfriend by going to the cinema just before the weekend so we could cuddle up a bit and enjoyed a nice 'chick-flick'.But WHAT a disappointment it was. Not only was I completely annoyed by the soap-acting, the cheap-sound and visual effects, the harry-potter-length of movie (what a waste of celluloid), but most of all, about all the hype around it.I ended up with a very grumpy girlfriend next to me and had no pleasure after wards either.Simply scrap the next 2 movies that are planned ahead and make something useful for those that want to spend their money on a good evening in the theaters.I WANT MY MONEY BACK.I'd rather goto a fast-food-restaurant and spend it there to later throw up from it than see this load of crap again.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
total eclipse of my mind!,"OK, let's start by saying that almost no man with right sense of mind will ever admit that this is enjoyable movie, even if they watched it home alone covered with beer and snacks and emotions on delivery :))) Yet again i am willing to admit that there is something in this kind of movies. OK, first of all the music i excellent and it should get 3 out of 10 for that part only, acting is.., well if we could call that an acting cause scenario and script lines are plain awful, if someone take few weeks and change scenario for most of parts this would be a good movie, however chemistry between actors is nice, effects are well if it weren't for wolves there wouldn't be any, lets say good and there is a few enjoyable moments, but thats just not enough to fulfill giant gap between poorly executed script and mind dumbing serious sf/drama story which is needless to say one of the funniest ever in movie industry.Shame, cause with little more mind at work at scenario, more intelligence between the lines, and better finalization this could be 7-10 but now its just poor shake 5 where 3 is for music only, and thats lowest you can go with A production and that kind of budget! Well at least Ladies are happy :))))",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Over long movie that still holds heart,"Rating-4/10The Twilight Saga: New Moon is the second in the Twilight franchise and a movie that although steps it up a notch, comes up worse than the first go. With it's slow pace and rather melodramatic remarks and scenes and of course new digital effects, this can seem boring and if not a big fan of the series then also stale. For fans of the book it seems it is a good representation from what I have heard and although people less in tune with Twilight may be sorely disappointed, hardcore fans should be pleased.Our second outing takes places in the same place, with nearly the same pace that we saw at the beginning of the first one. Of course no film stays happy forever and as we see(without spoiling it) ,Bella goes through some things and people come in and out of her life in a flash, its all very easy to feel sorry for her, if only just a little. This really did make me think that to truly connect then you have to be a hopeless romantic or madly in love because this one truly is for the lovers and wannabe lovers as it has so many scenes directed in that direction. I did feel this one lacked fighting, now not all movies require action of course but this one really does, but the thing is when it comes around it seems cheesy and yet again over dramatic, poor showing on the adrenaline side(this in a film where Bella is trying to get adrenaline rushes).Chris Weitz takes the helm and does an OK job, I mean for a movie like this it is a hard job to make it good so I can't destroy him that much, well maybe not yet. Melissa Rosenberg comes back to create the adapted screenplay and although I guess for some of the horrible script problems you have to blame Meyer, maybe a few changes here and there would have spruced things up and made it better to listen too also. Now I mentioned effects and with the addition of a new supernatural being like a werewolf you expect quite good ones with such a big budget, this is not the case and even if you can look past it, the over dramatic directing and filming comes in and severely damages the respect this movie still has.Now Kristen Stewart, is she a good actor here, well make your own mind up but for me although not going the mile to act well, still bears the entire movie upon her shoulders and manages the more difficult scenes well. Taylor Lautner has his time to shine in this one and he does well but not well enough for me to say good, he bounds around the place like he is lost but still manages I guess to bring some emotion and that angst we always see with Twilight. Robert Pattinson is not as good here as before, too quiet and subdued and really doesn't bring any of the at least slight charm he could conjure on Bella in the first instalment. The rest of the cast are pretty solid but by the end they all manage to be sucked in to the bad script and kind of poor directing, or maybe that's just them.So yes Twilight New Moon is a movie failing to improve upon it's average predecessor and although making strides in the romance department, lacks in enough action and thrills to justify it's 130 minute running time. And again yes it is a bit too long for a film, as I said before and have many, this it one for the fans but for those who don't really like the series or just can't be bothered reading then be ready to be let down at a very high grossing film. It is Poor there is not doubt in my mind but be prepared to give it a go, it can be enjoyed in small parts.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No imagination at all; but was fun,"Well, i haven't watched the first movie of the series, but before i decided to go this movie, i read the spoilers from internet, and in 2 or 3 sentence i got all the point. But still i wasn't expecting a movie with so basic imagination, so basically acting. Did this happen to you; in some scenes, that intended to be acted romantic, made very funny impression in the cinema, and some people were laughing. And the end, this really sucked, what an idiot idea was to finish the movie with those words. It's waste of time and waste of money. The only person who did well acting was Taylor. The rest were acting like that had thousand kilos of bot-ox on their faces. Always the same impression.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Despite bright spots, it's downright terrible.  It's time to get a new writer.","It's hard to believe only a year has gone by since the last Twilight film came out, which is weird, because this summer, I'll be saying something like, ""it's hard to believe only a few months have gone by since the last Twilight film came out"". This is the running joke throughout the entire film. Is Summit's fear of financial collapse so great that they feel they have to churn out these movies as fast as a printing press distributes newspaper? Or is it that they secretly don't have faith in the franchise's long term prospects, making their only blockbuster series unable to truly stand against the heavyweights like Harry, James, and Jack? Whatever the reason, the biggest problem with ""New Moon"" is how rushed it is. Strangely, I've got to hand it to Chris Weitz. Few directors could have handled the production schedule this film probably had, and he's managed to do a better job than his predecessor. That said, another reason I'll give Weitz credit for doing a job well done is his ability to handle what is easily the worst screenplay of the year. At least Street Fighter and Dragonball had heart. There's no passion. Almost every line is a false clich√©, something that in the end makes the film one of the funniest of the year, and takes away from people that actually did well on the film.Before I continue onto the bad, I'll state the good. As far as acting goes, it starts and ends with Taylor Lautner and Michael Sheen. Weitz did a great job as far as picking some crew members, but not all of them. For example, he pulled off a miracle when he got Alexandre Desplat to score this film, and Desplat's score does not disappoint. It out does the first film along with the cinematography, but that's where it stops.I don't know what happened to Kristen Stewart's ability...I know it's there, but she simply just doesn't care, isn't trying, or is just flat out bored the entire film. I found myself begging her for expression, in between my laughter at almost everything the absurd character of Bella did. I found that one of the strengths of the first film, the slightly charismatic Robert Pattinson, isn't one anymore. His reduced screen time is not to blame, as Pattinson just lost all charm he had before, and he also forgot how to act. I liked Peter Facinelli and Ashley Greene, while Nikki Reed annoyed me. Anna Kendrick's role is still a scene stealer, while I had a hard time determining if Jamie Campbell Bower was a man or a woman, or if he could be any creepier if he tried.The work of Michael Sheen and Taylor Lautner are two of five good things about this movie. Sheen delivers a delicious turn as Aro, and I enjoyed every minute he spent on screen. By far the best performance from any of the Twilight films. It was the perfect balance of slight scenery chewing mixed with a deliciously devious line delivery, reaffirming him as one of my favorite actors. Lautner is someone I've got to give credit to, mostly because he's not cringeworthy like Stewart and Pattinson (well, until he says a stupid line that's not his fault, but he played the character well), but the main reason that Lautner did a good job was because almost everyone I've talked to sided with his character and liked him better than the main characters. This is the mark of an actor playing a role well. Lautner's physical transformation is also quite impressive, as every female will have no problem saying.I just can't get my head around how awful Rosenberg's script is. How anyone can include some of the lines that are in here is beyond me. Sure, some of them were probably from the book, but as a writer of film, you have to know what works and what doesn't work. Sure, New Moon has its intentionally funny moments that Weitz inserted to break the serious tone for a bit...But what Weitz and Rosenberg seem to have forgotten is this: because the film is so rushed, the dialog so cringeworthy, the visual effects so terrible, etcetera...New Moon ends up as a parody. The entire beginning of the film, and Jacob and Bella's friendship, plays out like an episode from an MTV reality show, providing laughs for even the most die hard fans of the series (I know this because the entire theater was cracking up whenever Bella would be sad or Jacob took his shirt off for whatever random pointless reason).What's even more unsettling is the subliminal messages these films send...Bella is willing to give up her soul to be a vampire with Edward, which he refuses to oblige. How can Bella be the role model Meyer and Rosenberg obviously want her to be when she is literally the biggest pushover I've ever seen? Her character is so unbelievably flawed that it's next to impossible to root for her, and it's also next to impossible to see how two actual nice young men fall in love with her. She has no redeeming qualities, and only shows how easily persuaded a young girl is. To all the young girls reading this, it's fine to want an Edward or Jacob in your life, but it's entirely something else to want to ""be like Bella"".So, in short, if you want to laugh, look no further than this ""film"". I honestly don't think the next movie will be worse than this one, because the crew would literally have to not film anything and sip margaritas on set for it to be worse...wait, actual footage of the crew sipping margaritas is probably better than this abomination of a film. The few bright spots are overshadowed by the terrible script, and the only guy I feel bad for at the end of the day is Weitz.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
it's so - so,"i think this movie is cool, it become trend setter in movies industry. the love story between Bella, Edward and Jacob seems perfect, but the love story is too strong and the vampire struggle was not exposed, so the love story was dominate the entire story, too much drama and no action. if we compare this movie with another vampire movie, we can find the one that better than this movie. overall this movie was OK, after the previous episode of this movies series, all we need is just wait the next episode and watch it, is it going to make us sick of their love story or not, or we will watch more struggle of vampire life. if your plan to watch this movie, it's OK and entertain enough, and the most important thing to remember is, go to cinema with someone else, just in case you got sick of their love.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad but not great either,"I just went to watch New Moon this afternoon. Overall, i think it's an OK movie. The movie's plot did not deviate far from the book. Sure they change and add a few scenes but hey you can't expect the movie to completely follow the book. Personally, i felt that New Moon is the most boring book in the series esp. the middle part of the book after Edward left Bella. I was like come on, girl get over him. True, he's a vampire and all but your happiness doesn't depend on him alone. So, i was curious how they made out the movie. The movie doesn't disappoint me unlike the sixth installment of Harry Potter (they made Harry Potter a coward, yeesh..). I'd read some of the users comments on Kirsten Stewart acting. I think she portrayed Bella convincingly. In the book, Bella is the kind of person who repressed her emotions. So, she won't show her true feelings to the people around her. It is perfectly reasonable for Kirsten Stewart to show just a couple of facial expression since this is who Bella is. I don't really care for Robert Pattinson acting. I'd watched the movies he acted in ie. Little Ashes and How to be. He didn't strike me as a particularly good actor. His acting is mediocre at best. Taylor Lautner did a good job as Jacob. All the other actors complement the movie well. The cinematography is quite good. Boring soundtrack. Not one song stand out unlike in Twilight ( Supermassive Black Hole by Muse and Bella's lullaby by Carter Burwell). All in all, the movie lived up to my expectations.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
review from a late twenties fan,"First of all let me tell you this...i saw Twilight just 2 months ago and became a really big fan afterwards (read all the books and saw all the Rpatz interviews on you tube) There were two reasons - Catherine Hardwicke and Robert Pattinson. I came back from the cinema few hours ago and what I can say is all the magic from the first Twilight movie I watched like 1000 times is gone, forgotten and spat at. The chemistry,intimacy and the teenage feel magic that you can relate too at whatever age is gone. What is left is Edward looking at least 10 years older than 17 (and I love Robert, but he really looked old), Bellas depression for me was not depressing enough. Bellas visions of Edward felt like a Mexican soap opera.The Voulturi were great - too bad they didn't have mroe lines, and of course the best part for last - the wolves. I was totally in love with Edward, still am, but the wolves - they were just amazing....it's not the director however, whoever worked on the special effects's done a really really great work to say the least.All I can say is that I really am looking forward to Eclipse...no director can do worse than this, really. BTW Catherine Hardwicke you and your lovely Nikki Reed...can't wait to see your next movies. Thank you for Twilight.Summit - you suck for letting her go away.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
True to the book,"As a fan of the books I can say this movie was done pretty well and stayed very true to the author's story. I'm not a fan because of the hot guys or plan to model my life after Bella's (she's just a character folks, not meant to be a hero or idol). I enjoy the love story as well as the drama and suspense of each book's plot. If you're not a fan of the books or story then you probably won't enjoy the movie, simple as that. But I enjoyed it quite a bit and thought the characters, especially Jacob, were portrayed very well. I missed a little of the visually artistic approach taken with the first movie, New Moon is definitely a more literal interpretation, however, the story is told well and I found it quite entertaining. I definitely think you get more out of it if you have read the book, but most, if not all, of the major details/events are in the movie and I felt it told more of the complete story than the first movie did. Looking forward to the third!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terrible,"i got dragged to this disgusting 'movie'(if you can even call it that) by my girlfriend... i am still in shock how people can try to defend this as a decent film, the acting was garbage, the effect pathetic, the script was so bad i cringed every time these so called actors opened their mouths. I can understand little girls liking this movie but for anyone else there is no excuse for liking this. One of the most boring movies i have ever seen in my life, usually when i see a movie with bad acting and terrible plot i enjoy it just to laugh at how bad it is, but this was to pathetic to even laugh at. In short i would rather be slowly crushed from the feet up by a steam roller then have to watch this film again.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
biased,"The reviews for this movie are highly biased. I thought the first movie was terrible and by the score it's been given here, i thought the second movie would be even more awful. This movie definitely does not deserve a 4, and not a 10 either, but these reviews simply show people's inclination to discredit anything that is popular.(and guy's immediate aversive response to anything girls worship)It was much better than the first film. Firstly, it didn't make me cringe, which is a huge improvement. Yes, the characters are a bit immature, the plot is a little foolish, but i think that was the point of the movie. The characters connected, it didn't feel contrived; the atmosphere was well created; i had a little problem with edward, who seemed to overact a bit, but again, I suppose that was the point.This is, by any criteria, an OK movie. Maybe a 6. But I will rate it higher just because it annoys me when movies like this one are only seen in black and white. It's not the first cheesy romantic movie and certainly 'cheesy' doesn't mean boys should rate it 1 and girls 10. Scary movie 4 has a higher score for gods sake.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
entertaining enough to watch but acting wasn't there,"The major problem that I had watching this film was that the acting from Kristen Stewart was not the character that the books envisioned. I grant them that the film did follow the book's story line as well as they could on the screen. The tenseness did gain momentiam throughout the film and there was genuine concern that came across during the film due to the atmosphere created by the director and everyone behind the camera. However, there was still lack of emotion given off from the characters that the actors tried to portray. Kristen Stewart was the worst. She said her lines well but there was no body language that she gave off that made me believe that she believed what she was saying. There was no emotion behind the lines. It was like watching a catatonic actor. Furthermore, there was no real connection that I felt between any of the major characters, i.e. Edward, Bella, or Jacob. I feel that this movie could of been a lot better if the right actors were put into place beyond just for adolescent eye candy that I heard all the tween girls in the audience scream with in the movie theater. It would of been better if the right actors where put into the characters. Overall, I did find it entertaining enough to watch and have a good time during the movie. But there could of been a lot more done to do the characters justice and the storyline.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
urgh!!,"Now, I understand that this movie is a fiction and it is about vampires and werewolves. So I'm not going to question anything in relation to the story itself.The only thing I liked about New Moon is Jacob's and his friend's transformation into wolves, and the fact that they were topless almost the whole movie. And Charlie.Unfortunately, even Jacob's body can't save this movie. It is excruciatingly BORING. I understand that in a trilogy, the 2nd installment is normally slower but again, I am not questioning the story. It's the bad acting, the delivery of the lines, the lack of feeling that frustrates me. Bella's expression is the same throughout the movie. Bella and Edward don't appear as if they are in love at all. Way too many unnecessary pauses especially from the main characters, can't they speak properly? Bella's 'nightmares' were way too often they become irritating. I was head over heels with Edward in Twilight, but in New Moon, his facial expression is tiring it made me rolled my eyes!I haven't read the books and do not intend to. But I wonder if this girl Bella is as selfish and ungrateful in the books (the way she treated her dad and Jacob)...all because of her love for Edward. I'm not saying that she should reciprocate Jacob's feelings simply because he was her shoulder to cry on, but how can she simply shove him aside whenever there's a Cullen around. From my point of view, she used him and dumped him..so much for a best friend. She doesn't even care for her father's feeling.I thought Twilight was okay, could have been better with additional fighting scenes, but New Moon was a waste of time.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Directer missed the reason why the 1st mov was hit,"I think actors and director missed the reason why the 1st mov was a hit, i mean its not the first mov where u have vamps...I think it was a BIG hit cause teens and bellow 30 age groups find a college life type mov wit normal people(soft of..)doing baseball and does not were 1880's cloth and talk funny.The boy and girl who like watch other but can't say it.It is only in their eye.A sweet love story after all.In my class girls really loved it and thinking maybe 2nd one is as gud as the first one.For the last few months the hype for New Moon in TV is just amazing. When i watched the new mov i was all most in sleep. Compared to the first one it is really slow.I didn't read the books so maybe i am not getting the plot..but i think the amount of time it was in No1 position in the box office is only due to the hype.I think ppl who are creating the mov should look back then make the next movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My review without spoilers,"I just think people need to go in with real expectations, this is not an Oscar worthy movie but it is entertaining none the less. is not like New Moon is the best movie ever made but as i said in my FIRST review it has improved in a big way when you compare it to Twilight. The acting really has improved A LOT especially with Kristen when you compare Twilight's Bella with New Moon Bella, is like she is reflecting in her portrayal how she has grown is like what we've seen lately in interviews a more self assured girl but still very nervous and shy and in her acting is the same, this time she does a better job at portraying the emotions especially the heartbreak this character is going through. Taylor really does a good job playing his character he really gets Jacob but as it also happens with Kristen there are scenes where he just doesn't quite achieve to capture the emotion of the situation and comes off stiff. Rob as i said he's not in the movie enough to make an informed decision as to whether or not he has really improved in his performance, but from the times you get to see him on screen there is improvement in his personification of Edward. The supporting cast does a great job i think but they are what they are, which is basically filler characters in the story. However it really shows in the new actors and in the supporting cast which of them are great actors on their own because even if they only show up for a couple of minutes in the film they steal the show. the perfect example for this is bot Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning who both played the character of Aro and Jane down to the T and do an incredible job in bringing to life this characters. and Anna Kendrick who in just seconds of being in screen steals the scene. Now visually this film is 100% better than Twilight, the photography was incredible which with me being a photography student is one of the biggest things that attract me to movies, Chris Weitz did a great job, the contrast,lighting and color palette and the sharpness of the images was done really well this looks and feels more like a high budget film. Some of the special effects could still be improved but overall they are really good. and in terms of the music i love the soundtrack of this movie. In general is a very entertaining movie and a perfect 2nd installment to this saga,but don't go into it thinking you're going to see the latest masterpiece in modern cinema cause you are not.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not all that good, was it?","After seeing the first one and realizing what an utter horror of a film it was, I was not interested in seeing the second installment. I can't see what the big appeal of this movie is. After reading the series seeing the movie was a huge let-down. I understand that books-to-film are never anywhere near as good, but I think they could have casted two main leads to more interesting people. I have never appreciated the acting skills, or lack thereof, of Ms. Stewart and these movies prove why.I hope that the director and all the other people involved with the making of this popular series reads up on the comments left by the public and try to make some positive changes to the next movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There is nothing wrong with this movie,"I was both excited and worried when first going to see New Moon. Excited because I love Twilight the film and all the books. Worried because this was the second film I'd be seeing where I'd read and loved the book first and was anxious to whether or not they'd get it right. I'd read and loved the Half blood Prince before seeing the film and the film became a huge disappointment. Although I'll never be fully happy because its impossible to fit a whole book into just over 2 hours and so there are things I'm gonna miss, i can't say I was upset. Most people who complain about the acting and the film as a whole are just non fans who can't stand that its become so big, and I'm getting bored of listening to these people online. I've read the books a lot, and so has my boyfriend. Neither of us are silly little teens, we're both mature 23 year olds and although he's more of a J.R.R. Tolkien fan and not obsessed with Twilight like I am, he thought New Moon had been done very well and stayed very true to the book. Some of his other male friends who'd been dragged to the cinema with there girlfriends also hated to admit that they enjoyed it. The acting of every main character was done exactly as I'd imagined from the books if not better. Although I love them both, I wasn't sure if Kristen and Rob could make the break up scene as heartbreaking as it should be but I actually found myself caught up in every second of it and was blown away. I feel like after Twilight they realised how special these books are to people and they put everything into knowing these characters. Anyone who wasn't impressed with there acting doesn't get the characters in the book. If they weren't doing it right, Stephanie M would have let them know. Jacobs character was also a lot like I imagined and the chemistry between Jacob and Bella was played out perfectly, as was Bella and Edward. I loved the way the film captured that even though Bella is growing closer to Jacob, he can still never be Edward, this is something I was worried about before seeing the film. And can I just say, Bella is a teenage girl who is so clumsy, always worrying and so insecure and helpless. Yet she always puts everyone else first and will risk her life in an instant to protect the people she loves. Okay she really needs the vampire she loves in an unhealthy type of way. But he needs her that way as well and thats what love is, thats why its such a strong story. Love that powerful makes you weak and tells a great story. And thats what the Twilight sage is about, its about Bella and Edwards love and how nothing can overcome it. Its a great love story and she's a great role model. Anyway, everyone did a great job, New Moon is beautiful and hasn't done fantastically for no reason, I'm just worried about Eclipse now but although I'm not sure about the director, I fully trust the cast. I've not been this excited about a bunch of movies and books in my life but I've given 9 instead of 10 because I really didn't like the vampire contact lenses this time around and being New Moon, like Bella I really missed Edward Cullen and no amount of muscles can help with that.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dead acting and empty dialogue brings in the big bucks,"Last Friday tween girls flooded movie theaters across America to catch the release of the next installment of the Twilight Saga, New Moon.In this chapter of the series Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, breaks off his relationship with Bella, Kirsten Stewart, to protect her from himself and his vampire family. The only thing Bella can find to comfort her is seeking out danger with her childhood friend Jacob Black, played by Taylor Lautner, who ends up being a werewolf.Most of the time Stewart was on screen she looked like she didn't want to be there. She couldn't seem to generate enough emotion for her part in the movie.Pattinson followed the same suit as Stewart but he did manage to master brooding, which he appeared to do most of the little time he was on screen. Also his character was supposed to be attractive but so much makeup was put on him to stress his vampire- paleness he looked like a drug addict with good hair.Pattinson and Stewart's characters were supposed to be passionately in love but the actors looked awkward and uncomfortable together. Their dialogue felt empty and looks that were intended to be intense and passionate seemed vacant.Lautner played his character better; he made Jacob Black a likable person. He had some solid comedic moments but wasn't up to par in the emotional scenes.The plot itself is not presented well. The movie is dry and slow for the most part. When an important moment does happen it is too quick and not completely explained. Someone who has not read the books might not completely understand what happened at the movie's climax or other plot turning points.The movie itself was pretty hollow and superficial. The film is supposed to convey a great love story but it lacked meaning. It was hard to like the characters. Director, Chris Weitz, seemed to care more about putting shirtless boys on screen than character development.The best part about the movie was its soundtrack. Every song chosen set the right tone at the right moment.In short, if you are looking for a meaningless but flashy movie featuring vampires, werewolves and lots of shirtless boys then New Moon is for you. But if you are looking for an engaging plot and talented acting and directing then you should stay as far away from this movie as possible.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pretty good. Not great, but pretty good.","After reading some other peoples comments I must say I'm glad I haven't read the books. I thought that the character of Bella was just supposed to be someone that had problems showing there emotions, but evidently that was just bad acting... Knowing that takes a bit away from the effect of the movie, but thats okay I guess. Anyways on to the actual review, the first movie was mediocre, not terrible, but not very good. As such I wasn't planning on watching this one, however a bunch of my female friends kept telling me that this one was gonna be better, so I caved and decided to watch it. I wasn't disappointed, much. This movie is indeed better than the first one. not great, but still pretty good. The special effect are better (I'm quite a fan of the wolf transformations). and The overall plot is quite a bit better as well. It even made me actually want to see what was going to happen next at a couple parts. The acting is still pretty bad (though as I said above I didn't realize how bad till afterward). But I don't really feel like going into to much detail. I just thought people might be interested in a view of the movie by someone that isn't either by some old guy or a 15 year old girl (I'm a 21 year old hetero male).",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mixed on this one,"The first Twilight was horrible to say the least, and this one was actually better. However I think some of the previews that played before it where actually more entertaining.That being said, if you where to cut out all the scenes with Ed and Bell together it would be a fantastic movie. It feels like they are so close to a really good movie but they give us no evidence of why the two even like each other except that Bella blinks a lot and gasps between sentences when talking to him. So it is senseless and Bella falls into the category of a retarded person. Im mean who goes through a break up and acts like they are trying to kick Cocaine and heroin out of their system? I mean how long where they together, a year possibly two? I've known relationships that have ended in which the couple's where together for years. It sends out a weird message about obsession that adults can identify but young kids might not. Unfortunately showing a story that says its OK to be obsessed with a guy to the point where you are suicidal is not the something the MPAA worry about kids seeing, just nudity.But as far as the Jacob character and the rest of the ""pack"" that was damn good actually. I think, as I said to people before, the idea of creating a story between Where wolfs and vampires was actually a really good idea, in fact the only good idea the author actually had, too bad she submerged in unbelievable bull crap. So you have to kind of ignore the Bella and Edward love angle cause it sure as heck isn't love and sure as heck isn't working.Of course Jacob has his corny moments. Though I never seen anyone take off their entire shirt to field dress a small head scratch. Then again maybe that works with girls. Well then again I don't know any girls as foolish or gullible as Bella so perhaps not.In the end I gave it 5 stars cause half the movie was good, the rest of the vampire stuff, especially the vampire Vatican thing was a waist of time. And you can tell too cause even the filmmakers didn't bother spending too much time on it.If you want to actually laugh out loud, go for it see this movie!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No real complaints,"I took my girls to see this the day it came out. I hadn't read the twilight series until shortly before this movie was released. If I hadn't read the book I would have been a little lost. Yes they did a great job including the main parts of the story. But what about the little details in between? What feelings or emotions carried you to the next scene? Those are the signifigant details that get forgotten when doing a book to big screen.The reason the New Moon book was so engrossing was because it included all the thoughts & raw feelings of all the characters...Kristen did a gr8 job with hers, that's because they included that. But after her depression passed, what about the rest of the emotions? I say next time if you're running shy on screen time, add in the feelings a person is experiencing with a narrative overview while you're progressing so rapidly from one scene to the next to fit it all in.What connects us most to our love of the books? Don't leave that out in the movie..That's why Titanic, The Notebook, Gone with the Wind, were so amazing. We can connect. Plus you kinda have to do the book justice & reward us for spending all our hard earned cash :)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eat Your Heart Out Laura Mulvey: A New Moon Reading,"Like millions of other people, I flocked a screening of New Moon in its first week of release. I knew that I wouldn't enjoy it after what the first movie offered me, so saying that I did not enjoy it is like saying I went to a funeral and found it sad. Despite this, I still chose to be a sheep and follow along with the crowd to help break box office records.The only way to experience this movie (in my humble opinion) is in an audience filled with swooning girls, just to really soak up the atmosphere that the film projects. That was my intention, and luckily I succeed by going to a screening early enough after the films release. I could tick the audible sighs and swooning sounds box on my expectations list, and soon to follow was the obligatory chest shots.Without going into boring synopsis of the film, which would be as simple as a bus full of Miss America contestants, I can put forth a much easier description. Perhaps only students of film, scholars, academics and cultural critics and theorists will understand it, but regardless, here's my synopsis: Laura Mulvey, eat your heart out.Mulvey's seminal theory (Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema) discussed the idea of the triple male gaze in the mid 1970s. This triple male gaze is the projection of a woman through a male characters eyes, put forth by a male author (director/writer) for a male audience. In New Moon we see this turned around. It is not the female that is the object of desire anymore, and instead it is the men who are subjected to the ""to-be-looked-at-ness"" aspect of Mulvey's claims. Her theories have been subverted, and not for the first time (let us not forget Casino Royale with Daniel Craig coming out of the water, like an Adonis, a la Ursula Andress style.) As we see this idea the idea of the triple maze gaze being turned on its head as at least a double female gaze now, if not even triple with Stephenie Meyer's book, the character of Bella and her male contemporaries (or should I say pieces of meat/eye candy.) But despite this, the Bella is still a dull girl who relies on the comfort of vampires and werewolves to stay amused and happy.Consensus among female teenage (or tweenage) viewers finds the film ""hot"" and ""steamy"". Edward is ""dreamy"", Jacob is ""ripped, but 12"" and there is an instant divide between Team Edward and Team Jacob (one that could result in heads being ripped off and a ritualistic sacrifice in the name of the Twilight.) Perhaps it's because I've been watching too much True Blood, but the Twilight films leave something to be desired for me. I require that big bite that Twilight and New Moon lack in their ""nothing much happens"" plot lines. I don't consider myself an action chasing adrenaline junkie, but in I needed some proverbial action and I needed it desperately. Luckily New Moon offered me more than the previous instalment, but I was still not as satisfied as the tweens and ""twi-hards"", who seem to be feeding on some kind of unexplainable and unquenchable supernatural level.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad example??,"To those who thought this was a bad example to young girls because she gave up her life for the man she loved. First of all it is fiction, a love story. Second of all should we ban classics such as Romeo and Juliet?? Juliet ended her life when she found Romeo dead. It is literacy and art. Vampires are fictional and so is Bella. This book and many other fictional books (okay so its been made into a movie, same thing), is created so people can step outside of their normal lives and experience something different. I thought that the whole series was brilliant, easy to read and easy to watch. If your teenage girl wants to give up their lives for a man, then perhaps instead of taking a stab at fictional characters, they should start by pointing the fingers at themselves as parents.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only to be enjoyed by tween girls and die-hard fans.,"Die-hard fans of the Twilight novels and movies won't be reading this review. Or at least, they are not my target demographic. People reading this review are probably like me - guys - and maybe girls - who haven't read the series of novels written by Stephanie Meyer and who watch the films from a very neutral point of view. We watch these movies precisely as stand-alone films, and not as adaptations of our favorite novels featuring our favorite characters and our favorite scenes. I don't know how well adapted Twilight was - all I know it was a very mediocre motion picture -, which means I haven't watched New Moon with specific expectations. All I wanted was to watch something mildly entertaining and hopefully better than the last installment.Well, now that I have watched the film, all I can say is that, as a professionally-produced motion picture, NOT as an adaptation of some novel I have not read, New Moon is mediocre. Not good, certainly not god-awful, but just painfully mediocre.If the performances in Twilight were just bearable, then the ones in New Moon are simply god-awful. Although the romance between Bella and Edward wasn't particularly credible in the first movie, at least there was some palpable chemistry between the lead actors that helped the audience relate to their supposed love - a kind of chemistry that is unfortunately absent in this film. And it's not only that - Robert Pattinson plays Edward like a mannequin and appears for about 20% of the movie's running time, and Stewart's Bella is nothing more than a useless, crying girl who doesn't seem to know how to live without a man by her side. If Twilight showed that women could be chauvinistic too, then New Moon conveys a very backward, old-fashioned and stupid view of love and relationships.At least some of the actors are competent. Taylor Lautner's Jacob is a thousand times more charismatic, interesting and lively than Edward, which means a romance between himself and Bella would be much more satisfying both character-wise and plot-wise. (I somehow sense this won't be the case, though.) I'm not saying Lautner is a good actor, but at least he's got some screen presence and tries to develop his character more than the stiffer-than-a-tree Pattinson. Secondary actors are not very important, the only standout being the great Michael Sheen, who is suitably disturbing and scary as the leader of the vampire royalty.Speaking of vampires - I have no clue why Meyer decided to call this overly-sentimental and whining monsters ""vampires"". True, they do drink blood and are immortal, but they also lack fangs, screen presence, charisma and, most importantly, they are not scary at all. But don't get me started on the most laughable concept Meyer introduced to the vampire mythos - that of the creatures shining or sparkling when exposed to light. Why the hell would this make sense? It looks laughable on screen - and I'm pretty sure it doesn't fare any better on the written page - and it makes these so-called ""vampires"" look even more ridiculous. Actually, James Berardinelli, one of my favorite on-line critics, has a perfect name for these guys: VINO. (Vampires In Name Only.) At least the movie looks better than its predecessor, although that doesn't mean it's got a more competent director in the form of Chris Weitz. (I suspect it's got more to do with budget.) Special effects are OK, I guess - the wolf pack - especially Jacob - look good when in animal form, and some of the blue screen work is pretty decent. Certainly nothing groundbreaking - but who cares? It's not like all the tween girls and moms who have allowed the movie to break a gazzillion box office records care about the action or the visual effects. All they want is to see their favorite characters on screen reciting some awful dialogue - most of which was extracted verbatim from Meyer's novel - and showing off their biceps. I admit it was pretty amusing to see all the hormonal girls shouting in the middle of the movie theatre every time Jacob took out his shirt and started posing like a gay porn star.Like I said in the beginning, this review is for those who know very little about the Twilight saga - ""Twi-hards"" certainly won't care about what I have to say, nor will they care about the lackluster screenplay, the mediocre special effects or the horrible acting. The thing is, movies are supposed to be for everyone, something that becomes even more poignant when talking about adaptations - the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter films are as successful as they are because they can be enjoyed by die-hard fans and newbies alike. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the Twilight films. Hopefully, this will change once we get to see David Slade's vision of Meyer's story - I'm pretty sure a decent director like him will at least try to do something remotely interesting with this set of - at least until now - boring and brooding characters.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Put the twilight stigma behind and enjoy it for what it is: Pure Entertainment,"I just finished watching the Twilight Saga: New Moon and was pleasantly surprised. It was an entertaining and different weekend flick. However, it seems that a majority of the people on the internet would not agree with me. I will attribute this to the general stigma people have towards twilight. Mind you, I'm not a very big fan of the books and found the first film absolutely cringe-worthy and hilarious but I went in with an open mind and actually found myself enjoying it.Yes, New Moon is a very melodramatic movie and may not be for everyone. However, that doesn't necessarily make it bad. The style director Chris Weitz incorporates reminds me of your typical Bollywood (Indian Film Industry) movie which I think brings something fresh to Hollywood. Two thumbs up to Weitz for making this movie a thousand times better than Twilight. The CGI may not be top notch but was done well and the scenes seems to flow better than they did in twilight. My favourite part of the movie was a chase scene through the woods accompanied by a Thom Yorke song. It stayed with me after I left the theater.The acting wasn't Oscar worthy but how many performances these days truly are? In my opinion the stand out performance was Taylor Lautner's who brought a certain vulnerability to the character of Jacob and in the end made Jacob seem more likable than he was in the book. I think more people should focus on how much of Jacob's personality he has embodied than how much muscle he put on. This movie actually made me like Kristen Stewart somewhat as an actress as her incessant blinking has toned down a bit and she brings to screen a character many girls (although they shouldn't) can, in secret, relate to. I'm a huge fan of Robert Pattinson but the movie didn't do him justice. I'm glad he smiled more than he did in twilight but his performance just didn't make me ache for Edward the way some of his other characters in movies such as How to Be, Little Ashes and The Bad Mother's Handbook have.And of course I can't forget Billy Burke, Peter Facinelli and Machael Sheen who brought the extra pizzaz needed to make the movie worthwhile.My only complaint: Bad Script! Summit should really consider hiring someone else to write Breaking Dawn.7/10",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Much better than the first one!,"Okay what is with all you other people slating this movie? Seriously? If it was so bad how come it has broken box office records for the amount of money made for a new movie? Are you people who are leaving negative comments the type of people that work in boring mundane jobs think you're super cool for being so laid back? Whatever, it was a good film and I have seen loads worse! Grow up and stop being so negative. Maybe when you can have an intelligent conversation, until then don't talk crap unless you really know what you are talking about! I mean it really was much better than the first one by far! And that goes to show you the difference between a good and bad director. At least in New Moon they didn't leave out key scenes which they did in the first one (the scene where Bella passes out because of the blood in class, that was quite a key scene).Anyway I thought this was fantastic! They got Jacob down to a T and the whole Voltari thing was pretty super. The only thing I would say is they could have played with the other members of the Voltari a bit more, but there is only so much you can put in a movie.I would also say it's a bit violent for younger viewers, but the books do get a bit darker and this is not necessarily a bad thing. Overall great acting from all cast, I think they played the wolf pack brilliantly and Emily was perfect for the role. I was a bit unsure about Rosalie in the first one, but she comes out perfectly in this one, even if she's only in there for a short while. As for Bella's father, they couldn't have chosen a better actor for this role.Overall a great movie, like I said much better than the first one. It's not going to win any Oscars, but that was never the point of this movie. This movie is a great film based on the book, almost down to a T and Stephanie Meyer should definitely be proud of this one!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a bad movie but that doesn't mean it's good either,"To begin with, I haven't read any of the Twilight books. That said, I really enjoyed the first movie. I can't really say the same for New Moon though.The acting is ""wooden"", as many have said, it appears very clich√© in a way that gets boring very fast. Pattinson pulls off 2 or 3 different faces throughout the whole movie. The plot is decent, but the way it evolves is dull, and there's very few but good scenes of action.I know this isn't a long review or something. It's more of a comment actually. Just know this: New Moon is a movie to watch with your girlfriend, for instance, so it won't get that boring. If you watch it alone, it might take you a while but you'll eventually fall asleep.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
General improvements over the previous film.,"This film was based on a series of ""best seller"" books about the romance between a vampire and a young human. I never read the books (nor do I intend to) to know what they are like, and I'm willing not to talk about them, but if Edward and Bella's love story was supposed to be epic something didn't work. Despite this, and just like the first film in this tetralogy, this film was a box office champion, teenagers consumed it well and the studio rubbed its hands in satisfaction.The plot is easy to summarize. After realizing that Bella was in danger with him, Edward leaves her, wishing she would forget him and live a normal life. But she falls into depression and seeks to put herself at risk in the hope that he will appear through visions that she has whenever she is in danger. At the same time, she approaches Jake, who is in love with her and wants to have a chance. It turns out that he also changes: he belongs to a tribe of werewolves and, somehow, it activates and he starts to be able to transform into a giant wolf. From there, the animosity between him and Edward grows, given that vampires and werewolves are natural enemies, and is linked to the competition for the love of young Bella.Despite the change of director, little changes. Chris Weitz seems more capable as a producer than as a director. The film is going on without us feeling connected to what we are seeing. With the exception of some very concrete scenes, there is no involvement or depth, everything seems futile and a deep and dramatic love, capable of transforming a person's life, ends up just looking like a childish crush. The sudden ending of the film would, I think, have the intention of provoking a ""wow effect"" in the audience, but in me it only caused the sensation that the final part of the film was cut.What I said about the actors in the first film applies perfectly to this one. There were some casting errors that didn't help. Kristen Stewart is a weak actress with no presence or expression, and the same can be said of a dull Robert Pattinson, who seems to be more dead than his character. Both were poor casting choices and the romance between them never convinces by the absolute lack of chemistry. In spite of everything, comparing the two films directly, I think Stewart took advantage of the previous experience and did a better job here, which may be the result of some critical spirit and the ability to face mistakes and try to do better. Better than them, Taylor Lautner is more intense and palatable, and that intensifies a lot here. Together with Billy Burke and Ashley Greene, they are the best interpretations of the film. The Volturi manage to appear cold, calculating and threatening, especially Dakota Fanning, Jamie Campbell Bower and Christopher Heyerdahl. Michael Sheen seems polite, even aristocratic, but he based his character on a thousand stereotypes about European noble vampires and looks like a caricature and not a credible character.Technically, the film shows improvements compared to the previous one, perhaps the result of a stronger financial investment by the studio. CGI wolves are excellent and are the most striking and interesting visual resource. Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack stood out more and this is worth it because it is one of the best technical notes in tetralogy. Editing and post-production work were poor. Good scenery, props, good large-scale images of cold and cloudy landscapes and a beautiful city of Volterra complete the technical work.Overall, I feel that this film represents a slight improvement over the previous one. We continue to face a dull story, but the introduction of truly threatening characters and the greater role given to more emotional characters and capable actors gives it a bag of breathable air that its predecessor does not have.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Okay,"Better than anything today. At least actors were enjoyable when this came out, except for Kirsten's bad acting.

"2 Steps Forward, 3 Steps Back","Following up on its iconic predecessor, New Moon continues the Twilight love story. Adding fuel to the debate, New Moon had Team Edward vs. Team Edward sparked into a nationwide phenomenon. While lines were drawn and sides chosen, the Twilight fan community was roaring going into New Moon.After the Cullens abandon Forks in the hopes of bringing any danger with them, Bella (Kristen Stewart) is left in a depressive state. Attempting to rescue his friend from her self-destruction, Jacob (Taylor Lautner) advances on Bella. After a false vision tricks Edward (Robert Pattinson) into believing Bella died, he sets out on a suicide mission. Racing against time, Bella must choose between her two lives to save his life.Putting Edward on the back burner, Jacob takes the spotlight in New Moon. Since his character has much more emotion, Lautner is able to give a more passionate performance. Contrary, Stewart's attempts at being depressive and moody create an awkward and forced performance, which is less enjoyable than the first. Unfortunately, most of the cast continues to give a half-baked attempt at soap opera-esque acting.New Moon unfortunately introduces one of Twilight's least exciting plot points, The Volturi. Focusing on the politics within the supernatural world, the film suffers in similar ways to the Phantom Menace. While the idea is interesting on paper, the execution throughout the series is always snore-inducing. Alternatively, the exploration of Jacob's wolf-pack adds some fun and levity to the otherwise lackluster sequel.While it fueled the 'Team Edward vs. Team Jacob' debates, New Moon doesn't deliver as passionate of a story. Though it focuses on some of its stronger characters, the addition of uninteresting elements drags it down heavily. New Moon takes 2 steps forward, but 3 steps back as it struggles to improve on the already lackluster original.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Definitely true to the book, and definitely NOT disappointing","Well first I am a huge Twilight fan and needless to say I read all the books and was waiting for that movie for a year. But when I saw all those negative comments I thought OK maybe their expectations were high but so was mine.It's not an easy task to make an adaptation of a book, even a book like this long and complicated to adapt, so yes it was not entirely as good as the book itself, and the scenes were kept short and emotions were just cut out right at the moment when you're going to start to feel something. But it's purely for the reason that it was a book adaptation. I know how long and complicated the book is, and it was much more difficult to put it on the screen compared to Twilight.Whatever they did, I think they did it, because they didn't wanna missed out a single chapter. And as far as I've noticed, they didn't miss a chapter. Everything was in there and perfectly screened. But because of that reason they had to make short scenes. But whatever the problems I think they did a good job and I generally like the movie.When it comes to the acting, I think Kristen was on a lot of pressure. It was like she took the whole movie herself. And all those emotional scenes, ƒ± think she managed it quite well. Unfornutaley we cannot see a lot of Robert in it but still he was perfect. Taylor was, no words for him. I mean he was Jacob Black! Everything Stephenie wrote in the book about Jacob was there in Taylor. He put so much into this movie and you can clearly see that.So before making any negative comments I think you should consider the difference between book and its movie version, and most importantly you should look at it from the director's and the whole crew's perspective. Stephenie gave them a new world to play on, but it's not an easy world. You both need to add emotions, action and drama and comedy and fantasy everything was really hard to combine. But overall it's worth watching. And thanks for that cast and crew, they did a really good job...",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fact: Twilight was better than New Moon,"I think we can basically state it as a fact that the movie Twilight was MUCH better than New Moon. However, I still think, as a huge Twilight fan, that the movie brings a very close visual of the actual book. There were many parts, such as Bella's relationship with Jacob, that should have been emphasized more. There was no true chemistry between any of the characters and the acting was much too awkward to bring out any true emotions. I personally had goose bumps throughout all of Twilight, but felt nothing during New Moon. The movie did not get to the key cores of the book rather just put a visual on the book.New Moon is about the pain and suffering a person is left with when losing a loved one. It is about finding comfort and realizing what is truly important in life. Bella literally put her life into Edward and all of the Cullens, and was left with nothing. She had dreams of everlasting love with Edward, which is something every girl in love would only dream of having. Bella is left with a gaping hole in her heart and struggled to find any way to get a sense of happiness again, to a point where she puts herself at risk just to feel Edward's presence. She also finds comfort in Jacob, and their relationship expands and grows during Edward's absence. The misunderstanding between Edward, his sisters, and Jacob causes all the characters to take drastic measure in order to save Edwards life, thus bringing us to new events and a new story.The real pain and the true emotions are not brought out in the movie, and i believe there were many points in the book were not shown correctly in the movie. I think all Twilight fans were expecting another breath-taking Twilight, but were disappointed. If it weren't for the disappointment, I think the movie was not all that bad. I am very much looking forward to the third movie Eclipse, but definitely no expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was okay,"I now know why Vampires live forever. Movie Producers won't let them die.When we last saw Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson) they were in love and Bella knows all. So really there was no need for a sequel, but now Edward tells Bella they cannot be together. Bella is crushed. And, a new wrinkle has emerged and his name is Jacob (Lautner), and he is in love with Bella and he has a secret too. Secrets abound and Bella is caught in the crossfire. Sounds like one of your soaps, doesn't it?Return with us now to those chilling days of Vampireville, where Vampires rule again.The first half of this movie was very slow, disappointing and the acting suffered as did we all. Someone needed to put some life into the main characters, and wake them up and tell them a movie is being made. Yes, the situation was serious but heyThere were many, many scenes that contained too much silence, and hesitations as perhaps there wasn't enough dialogue to cover things. Dragging out these scenes had us looking around to see what was playing next door, and many of those scenes had no music to help things along. The Director did pass Movie Making 101, didn't he? Maybe he didn't see Heaven's Gate with those ever slow drawn out scenes.The second half had more life, with some pretty good fight scenes and CGI as well. The movie saves itself. This was okay, but hopefully, the next segment to this series will be as good as the first Twilight movie was. Let's hope. And, let's hope Ms Stewart can conjure up more than one facial expression.The very last scene indicated to us there will be another sequel. We may have to chose up sides: Team Edward or Team Jacob. Can't wait. This was okay, but we want better than okay. Okay?Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Saga Pokes Along,"For lovers of THE TWILIGHT SERIES the second installment NEW MOON should satisfy. It apparently follows the Stephenie Meyer novel fairly well and certainly has more to look at than the first installment. For lovers of teeny bopper films, vampire and werewolf legends, and sappy highsschool romance this installment will provide many pleasures. For the rest of us it is passable entertainment.Chris Weitz succeeds in making the impossible story lines move seamlessly, and while the majority of Melissa Rosenberg's script sounds like highschool lunchtime chatter, the story of Bella (Kristin Stewart) falling in love with Edward the vampire (Robert Pattinson)only to be deserted and then protected by the apparently normal American Indian Jacob (the very buff and studly Taylor Lautner) who turns out to be a werewolf....it goes on and on until there is finally a confrontation between vampires and vampires and vampires and werewolves that provides a semblance of an ending. Part three is coming soon.The scenery in Washington State is nice and the musical score is pretty. The acting is bland as is the chemistry between Bella and Edward and Bella and Jacob. But then this film is not meant to be challenging - just entertaining. And it is.Grady Harp",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009): A Tale of Heartbreak and Transformation,"The Twilight Saga: New Moon, directed by Chris Weitz, is the second installment in the film series based on Stephenie Meyer's immensely popular novels. Following the success of the first movie, New Moon delves deeper into the supernatural love triangle involving Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), and Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner).Plot and Setting:
The story picks up with Bella Swan celebrating her 18th birthday, only to have her world turned upside down when Edward Cullen, fearing for her safety, decides to leave Forks. Heartbroken and desolate, Bella finds solace and companionship in her childhood friend, Jacob Black. However, she soon discovers that Jacob is also harboring a supernatural secret-he is a werewolf, a natural enemy of vampires. As Bella navigates her grief and burgeoning feelings for Jacob, she finds herself in the middle of a deadly conflict.Performances:
Kristen Stewart portrays Bella's despair and emotional turmoil with a raw, vulnerable performance that captures the depth of her character's pain and resilience. Robert Pattinson's Edward has a reduced presence in this film but still manages to convey the angst and internal conflict of his character. The standout performance, however, is by Taylor Lautner, who transforms Jacob from a sweet, supportive friend into a fierce, conflicted werewolf. Lautner's physical transformation and intense performance add a new dynamic to the story.Direction and Cinematography:
Chris Weitz brings a different tone to the series with New Moon, emphasizing the themes of loss and transformation. The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe beautifully captures the gloomy, overcast atmosphere of Forks and the vibrant, sun-drenched landscape of the werewolf territory. The visual effects, particularly the werewolf transformations, are impressive and add to the film's immersive quality.Soundtrack and Score:
The soundtrack, curated by music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas, features a mix of melancholic and moody tracks from artists like Thom Yorke, Bon Iver, and Lykke Li. Alexandre Desplat's score complements the film's emotional and dramatic beats, enhancing the overall mood and depth of the story.Themes and Reception:
New Moon explores themes of heartbreak, self-discovery, and the complexities of love and loyalty. Bella's journey from despair to empowerment resonates with many viewers, though the film has faced criticism for its sometimes melodramatic portrayal of teenage angst. The love triangle adds a compelling layer to the narrative, keeping the audience engaged in Bella's emotional struggles.Cultural Impact:
New Moon solidified the Twilight Saga's status as a cultural phenomenon. It further propelled its lead actors into the spotlight and maintained the franchise's immense popularity. The film's release was a major event for fans, contributing to the ongoing fervor surrounding the series.Conclusion:
The Twilight Saga: New Moon is a significant entry in the franchise that expands the story's universe and deepens its emotional stakes. While it may not win over critics with its sometimes overwrought drama, it effectively captures the essence of teenage heartbreak and the allure of supernatural romance. For fans of the series, New Moon delivers a compelling continuation of Bella's journey, blending romance, fantasy, and coming-of-age themes into a captivating cinematic experience.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie makes the Vampire Diaries look like a masterpiece.,FYI The Vampire Diaries/The Originals are complete GARBAGE.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much book for a two hour movie,"First of all i have to say that i have very mixed feelings about this movie. I have read all the books, and from a fan point of view that have already read the books this movie makes it out better than from a point of view where the watcher have not read the book. This is in my opinion not exactly a good way to make movies. You shouldn't have to read a book to get the movie.The thing that i feel is really holding this movie back is that the director should either have kept to the reader fans and made it truly for them, or truly for those who haven't read it. It seems a little like they tried to fulfill everyone's wishes, something i wouldn't say worked out as well as planed.What they should've done was to cut out a few of the details that wouldn't have made a real difference to the main plot. There are some parts that i wouldn't've really understood if i hadent read the book, and in my opinion thats not something you put in the movie.So my conclusion is that they failed at the prioritizing part. It does have some of the things i really liked about the first movie, but sadly not enough for me to give it any higher score than this.Also, i cant decide if Kirsten is a brilliant actor or a really crappy one. I usually think the brilliant way, but at some points it makes me wonder.6 out of 10! The biggest minus was the things that i wouldn't have understood if i hadent read the book, and it was a lot of those here.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still better love story than Twilight,"Or at least slightly less bad. There is obvious progress in production, but unfortunately, not in acting and directing.

Good sequel that expands the story,"I was surprised I liked the first Twilight movie. How about the second one? Well, I think it's equally good. It has the same characters but there's also a lot of new to offer.One thing I like about these movies is that they don't overuse special effects. The wolves are practically the only cgi characters and they actually look really good. (Cute fluffy giant dangerous monster wolves!) The only disappointment was that Jacob cut his hair. He looked more cool in the first movie. But you'll get used to it.Not much to complain. If you like the first film, then make sure to also watch New Moon.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Werewolf Howl has More Depth,"""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" lumbers onto the screen with all the grace and dynamism of a distressed vampire facing the break of dawn. As the second installment in the Twilight series, ""New Moon"" aims to elevate the stakes by presenting a love triangle of supernatural proportions, but it quickly succumbs to its own narrative inertia.The characters are as thin as parchment, and just as colorless. Kristen Stewart's Bella is stuck in a constant state of melancholic longing, oscillating between Robert Pattinson's brooding vampire, Edward, and Taylor Lautner's Jacob, a werewolf with more abs than personality. The performances are uniformly underwhelming, with the chemistry between the leads as elusive as the Cullen clan's reflection in a mirror.The plot meanders like a lost vampire in a sunflower field, devoid of suspense or intrigue. The escalating love triangle, designed to build tension, instead results in a tedious back-and-forth that never culminates in any satisfying pay-off. The melodramatic plot is further hindered by dialogue that is as stilted as it is cringe-inducing.Aesthetically, the film presents a consistent palette of gloomy blues and grays, fitting for a world dominated by vampires, but ultimately lending the film a monotonous visual tone. While the special effects team manages to bring some decent transformation scenes to life, the choreography of the climactic fight scenes falls flat, lacking both originality and excitement.Director Chris Weitz fails to energize the narrative with any sense of urgency or danger. Pivotal scenes meant to convey emotional depth or tension instead come across as dreary and tedious, sucking the life out of what should be a pulse-pounding supernatural drama.In conclusion, ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" is a disappointing addition to the series, lacking in plot, character development, and directorial vision. It's akin to a vampire's bite: it may initially grab your attention, but ultimately leaves you feeling drained and regretful. This is one moon that certainly didn't light up the cinematic night sky.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent!,"First of all, it seems everyone with a bad comment has to tell everyone that they've read all 4 books.

I was surprised as most movies have their own take on the book. I think it was awesome as I felt that it truly captured the tragedy, angst and depression of the relationships that I felt from the book. If you can empathize with characters at all, you'll get what this movie (book also) is all about.

A more refined mixed bag - and an awkward sidestep,"The first 'Twilight' film, released in 2008, was awash in astounding awkwardness (though weirdly fitting) and occasional bluntness (not unexpected) amidst what I think was, in the broad strokes, a reasonably well considered young adult story about love and supernatural beasties. I don't think it was nearly as bad as it's generally made out to be, though I can understand the issues folks take with it, and I was curious just what the second installment of the franchise, 2009's 'New moon,' would have in store. I'll say this: Chris Weitz's direction readily feels more refined, and the art direction and production design at large, too. So it is with most elements, honestly - cinematography, music, editing, costume design, and so on. (The decisions as to hair and makeup are still often rather dubious, though.) It's as though the first movie was a testing ground, and with its popular and financial success executives determined that more resources could safely be directed toward its sequels. This is hardly to say that the second title is perfect - I don't think anyone could accuse the 'Twilight' features of perfection, in any sense - but the greater polish is noteworthy, and I admire the effort.The heightened gawkiness and forthrightness of this movie's predecessor is definitely still present, especially in the dialogue, and in some of the plot ideas and advancement. There are times when the smarter construction of 'New moon' is absolutely reflected in the cast's performance, suggesting Weitz's guidance of the ensemble was more concrete - and, to be sure, some points where the capabilities of the actors still come across as subdued, painted over with the gaucheness that defined so much of 2008's 'Twilight.' This dichotomy holds true as well for special effects and stunts, dialogue, characters, and scene writing, and throughout the narrative as a whole. And what's really remarkable is that each time the pendulum swings, the difference between those contrasting points only grows. At its most brusque and straightforward, 'New moon' is so on the nose that it's basically giving the audience a deadpan stare, daring us to blink. At its most levelheaded and mindful, meanwhile, it seems surprisingly solid, an astonishing tonal shift that feels very different. It's at once decidedly imbalanced, yet in that interminable wobble manages to somehow even out. Does that make 'New moon' inherently better, or worse, for the fact of it? I can't tell.If all my words so far seem to be dancing around the edges of a more hard-boiled opinion, though, then let me offer some distinct criticism. The wolves look half decent, at a glimpse - but as has often been the case with lesser productions, the more we see of them and the computer code that generates them, the more questionable they are. The touches of in-universe lore that we get, expanding a little on what we got the year prior, help the viewer to feel more invested in the saga, though at points it seems to be riding a knife's edge of being too loosely tied together as it presents. The core of that expanded lore, in this case, hinges on frank racism: in the age-old feud central to the narrative, certainly, but also in the fact that the werewolves are emphatically written as both indigenous people (hooray representation!) - and also unlikable dude-bro ""Alpha Male"" stereotypes (...what?). With that, too, the murky, dubiously handled overtones of domestic violence and abusive relationships that colored 'Twilight' are only reinforced here. Then, too, though I appreciate the notion of further building out the world beyond vampires, the diversion in 'New moon' feels less like commendable augmentation, and more like a sidebar distraction - accentuated by the ""cold ones"" bookends. And to cap it all off, the interpersonal drama and quasi-love triangle that lies at the heart of the story here is mostly common, and contrived, to the point of feeling desperate and forced - and the climax is foreshadowed from the very, very beginning.Adding one last insult to injury, protagonist Bella Swan is written with more personality and spirit than was true in the first picture, not least of all in the darker and more reckless moments. Complementing that growth, and bolstered by the stronger material, young Kristen Stewart (like most of her many recognizable co-stars) turns in a performance that's unremittingly improved from just one year previous, with more notable range and nuance. It's unfortunate, however, that her most frequent scene partner in 'New moon' does not share those qualities. Chief supporting character Jacob Black is written as conflicted, wavering between the wisdom beyond his years that was suggested even in the first title - and the unflinchingly repugnant, self-absorbed caricature of a man that his ill-conceived brethren wants him to be. Yet Taylor Lautner - whether from his own lack or as a result of Weitz's direction - gives a display of acting that is more wooden, unmoving, and unconvincing than anything we saw in 2008, quite reminding of the inelegance we witnessed in green-screen 'Star Wars' nightmares I, II, and III. Yowza.Despite the difficulties, the climax is well done. The ending is a little iffy, but I'll take it. Taken piece by piece, there's much to like among the story ideas. I highlighted Stewart, but I really do think the acting here is discretely stronger. More so than not, by and large, 'New moon' shows a lot of progress over its antecedent. It's just regrettable that where it falters, the deserved critiques are so glaring and numerous as to weigh down the possibilities of what the title could have been. Above all, the brunt of the plot swerves so far and for so long from the meat of the series as a whole - the relationship between Bella and Edward - that this entry feels aberrant and confused, just two movies in. For all that 'New moon' gets right, and recognizing just as with 'Twilight' that this is built for a particular audience, the flaws in its writing cannot be ignored, and I think are surely noticeable for any possible viewer. I don't blame screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg, but novelist Stephanie Meyer.Ultimately I think this is on par with its forebear, yet for all the wrong reasons. Call it one step forward, one back and to the side. So long as one is receptive to all the wide variety that cinema has to offer I do think 'New moon' is enjoyable on its own merits, as a continuation of the story that began in 2008's progenitor - but one absolutely must be prepared for its deficiencies.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Depressing and dull with messaging that could ruin lives,"When I watched the first Twilight film I felt that it was bland and uninteresting in every way, and one thing I most certainly did not feel was interest in what happens next. It simply doesn't feel like an ongoing saga after that first film, so I was curious to see how they would manage to continue the story when they got to New Moon. Well, it's certainly just as boring. The one and only thing I will commend this movie for is that they at least addressed in some small way the general creepiness of the Edward-Bella relationship. Sure they just mention it in passing, and try to laugh it off, but there is a moment when they talk about the fact that a man that is literally hundreds of years old is seducing a teenager. Aside from that, there are no redeeming qualities in this film.The first big flaw in New Moon is that a large chunk of the movie involves Edward leaving and all the relationship stuff being taken over by Jacob. This is a problem because Robert Pattinson could act better than Taylor Lautner in his sleep. Lautner actually manages to be worse than Kristen Stewart, and I didn't think that was possible. He is utterly devoid of charisma, and never once convinces me that he is falling in love. Combine that with Kristen Stewart's expressionless staring into the middle-distance and you have the worst love story imaginable. As part of this stupid relationship we get to see Bella once again proving herself to be utterly clueless. Despite constant blatant hints and obvious clues, she is simply dumbfounded that werewolves exist.However, the more egregious problem with New Moon, and the reason it made me actively mad, is how it handles the break-up of Bella and Edward. I know it can be devastating to have your heart broken, but this film is so committed to the idea that these two are soulmates and have some supernatural bond, it sends ridiculously harmful messages to teens everywhere. Not only is Bella reduced to wailing in such a dramatic fashion that a responsible father would probably force her to spend time with a therapist, but it gets worse than that. At the idea of never being together again, both members of this couple feel that suicide is their only hope. It's dark and depressing, and exactly the opposite of what we should be teaching young people. I don't have much more to say about New Moon, because not much else happens in the movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I find this second installment of the series much more intriguing than the first.,"Yes, I know. I started with Breaking Dawn Part 1 and haven't even touched upon Twilight yet. My bad, I guess, but I find this second installment of the series much more intriguing than the first. Here we have actual drama, as real as a story about vampires can be, and real conflict. Bella is a teenage girl who acts like a teenage girl, and both Jacob and Edward act like teenage boys...which is sort of a real contradiction in Edward's case. I mean, after a couple of hundred years, don't you think a man might have some modicum of maturity? But maybe being a vampire retards your common sense in favor of your hormones. Hmmm. Wait a minute, what hormones? He's dead! Oh well, I could go on and on with the contradictions in this film, but who am I to rain on anyone's parade? This is a Romeo and Juliet set in the fantasy of seclusion and passion, a love that was written in the stars. The special effects are great, especially the transformation sequences with Jacob and the rest of the tribe. After all, you knew they were werewolves, right? And the addition of Michael Sheen as Aro, the head of the Volturie and Dakota Fanning as Jane, the evil inflicter of pain with a devilish smile, brings a new dimension of mystery to the story. Rated PG-13 for violence and dramatic action, this one is safe for the teens and even the 10 year old girls who are lovers of romance.

Their appearance serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk in the shadows and the precarious balance that exists between the vampire and human worlds.""New Moon"" is a visually stunning film, with breathtaking cinematography that captures the beauty and danger of the Pacific Northwest. The soundtrack is equally impressive, effectively conveying the emotional intensity of Bella's journey.While some may find the film's focus on teenage angst and supernatural romance to be overly dramatic, ""New Moon"" offers a compelling exploration of love, loss, and the enduring power of human connection. It is a film that resonates with audiences of all ages, reminding us of the importance of embracing change, cherishing our relationships, and finding the strength to move forward in the face of adversity.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Engaging !!,The second instalment of the Twilight saga called New Moon is surely a setback from its predecessor.The movie is full of forgettable dialogues and performances.The plot is not engaging at all.The plot seemed dragged few times but yes it moves forward.It's a movie that you never wished for but you can watch just for time pass.The visuals are quite good.The character played by Kristen Stewart is so toxic that you'll start hating her and she will become annoying after some time.Robert Pattinson's performance is one of the better performances in the saga.Overall just for the sake of completing the saga you can watch it.,5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""New Moon"" Shines Bright","3 out of 5 stars (average)Note: the ""Twilight"" saga is one of the most fascinating franchises I have ever viewed. Its characters are fascinatingly uninteresting, its ""romance"" fascinatingly creepy, and its ""message"" fascinatingly bizarre. However, I liked it at one time. This review was written at a time when I wasn't allowed to see a great number of vampire movies, meaning that I found the action scenes in this to be great (they are decent at best). Therefore, please take the following review with a grain of salt, and know that a current evaluation of this film is coming. Enjoy!It seems not too long ago that we were first introduced to Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) when the Twilight saga began, along with the rest of the characters from the book series. Bella is still ""Ms. Angst"" and Edward is still speaking in Shakespearean-type prose.Bella is upset because it's her birthday. Why? Because Edward never ages and she is afraid she will grow old and useless while Edward will remain young. At Bella's party at the Cullen's, Jasper almost bites her because of a paper cut. Suddenly, Edward announces that he and the rest of the Cullen's; Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, Carlisle, and Esme are leaving the tiny town of Forks because ""people are noticing Carlisle hasn't aged one bit."" He tells Bella he's never coming back: it will be as if he didn't exist. Bella, being the goddess of angst she is, goes into a deep depression. This leaves her father Charlie (Billy Burke) confused on what to do for his daughter.But, when Bella discovers that when she is in danger, Edward will appear in a vision and speak to her, our idiotic Juliet immediately goes to her childhood friend Jacob seeking help. She begs him to help her fix up a couple of motorcycles so she can see her undead Romeo by taking a ride on the wild side. As she and Jacob work on the motorcycles, Bella gradually comes out of her depression and develops great feelings for him. Later, when Jacob starts exhibiting very strange behavior (i.e. disrespect, anger problems, and avoidance,) Bella wonders what is going on.As it turns out, Jacob and several others on the Indian Reservation have a deep secret inside. (It seems Bella can't find any normal human boys to like.) What is the deep dark secret? How is Bella involved? Will she and Edward ever make out again? To find out, you'll have to see this exhilarating thrill ride or talk to one of the ten thousand screaming girls who have read the book and would happily kiss Robert Pattinson had they the chance.Speaking of screaming girls, my friend Meagan saw the midnight viewing the night the movie came out and I interviewed her the next day at school. Here's what Meagan had to say:K-What did you think about New Moon compared to Twilight?M-New Moon is definitely more adrenaline-rushing.K-Who do you think is a better love interest for Bella?M-EdwardK-Do you think the director stayed close to the book?M-NoK-Do you think that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson will continue to play Edward and Bella?M-I hope so.K-What did you think about the actress who played Jane?M-She was really good.K-Who do you think is a better director?M-The first one.I disagree with Meagan about the movie staying close to the book, which embarrassingly I've had the pleasure of reading. I thought the film stayed pretty close to the book, most of the time. My mom felt the Jane character in the book was totally different then portrayed by Dakota Fanning in the movie. (Jane is a Vulturi Vampire who enters the story in the end of the movie and book.) I thought this director had better pacing than the first movie, which seemed a little slow for me. The camera work in the beginning of New Moon was terrible though-I was sick of seeing the back of Bella's head as the camera revolved around her during her many months of depression.I think, and please don't hurt me for saying this, that Jacob is a better love interest for Bella than Edward because he's more relatable. I know they don't end up together but I enjoyed watching their chemistry anyway.If you want more action, more comedy and more Jacob, go see this action packed film which surprised me by staying close to the book. Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
