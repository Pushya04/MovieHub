"A stellar space film that is literally about space and vertigo and survival--fiction, but not science fiction","Gravity (2013)A ridiculously visual movie. The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.The idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, ""Children without Men."" And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of ""effects"" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.Sandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.Once you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.The answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid ""Grey."" No distractions here.Except the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.The photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed.The best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror.There have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable.It's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.a postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film ""Aningaaq"" which is recently posted all over.

The Most Visually Stunning Film Of 2013,"Truly epic in scale! Whilst 'Gravity' falls short against films like '2001: A Space Odyssey', it is a tense and visually stunning thriller from Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón is one of my all-time favourite directors, and this CGI-heavy project just boasts skill and ingenuity from the director, DOP and VFX artist. The critics stated that you would be gripping to the edge of your seats, this is true in every aspect, the film is full of intense and thriller situations with amazing performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Just shy from winning Best Picture over '12 Years a Slave', 'Gravity' left the Oscars with 7 Academy Awards to its name, and it deserved each and every one of them. A masterpiece that allows the viewer to become immersed within the scene to often thrilling effect.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Stars in Space,"Visually stunning. A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A celebration of nature,"It's pointless to talk about the technical and artistic values of this movie. It's obvious, and it's inevitable not to be amazed by it, from photography to acting (kudos for Sandra Bullock, especially). What I would like to point out is the movie's meaning. I just got out of the theater and I'm still in awe, and what really got to me, beneath all the visuals and everything, is that this is the ultimate movie about nature. It's a celebration of the complexities of nature, about how we, as human beings, are so insignificant and weak facing it. We are a tiny little thing among a vast system that's beyond our control. This movie is a study on the humanity's place in the universe, so it's a call for us to face the ""larger picture"" humbly, and see how our lives, our societies, our achievements and our problems are NOT as important as they seem to be. Look further, your life will seem very fragile. At the same time - and that's the brilliance of the movie - Gravity is a celebration of the human being, because even though we are in fact very insignificant, it is our will to life, and our effort to make our lives meaningful, that make us matter. This is now my favorite movie ever, because it's so rare to find a movie, especially a Hollywood one, that can speak so deeply, so poetically and so subtly about life, the universe, and everything, in 91 minutes with such astonishing grace and artistic honesty.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but let's not say it's completely realistic...","The visuals for this movie are impressive. The story line is enjoyable, and it leaves you appreciating your place on Earth. The characters also provide some good laughs.It was one of the better 'space' movies. However, as a geek (I know, I know it's a movie) the orbits are all wrong for some of the events to even remotely take place. So if you know anything about space travel, as usual suspend disbelief for the moment. It at least stayed largely true to the no sounds in space thing, and provides some good lessons about linear and angular momentum. The fact I even get to bring this up, means I give the film makers some serious props... I wouldn't go so far as some of the reviews where they says the movie is creating a whole ""new genre"". The reviewers and movie makers just never realized, until now, what us geeks knew all along... space is much more awesome and frightening if you portray it more realistically.Hopefully the movie also provides a good reminder about how special this little rock is, and how unforgivable the rest of the universe is. Let's try and keep our planet that way! At least I was reminded of this when I left the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Go but lower your expectations,"The more I watched the trailer the less I was sure I wanted to spend the money to see it. I am glad I went but it is not something I would see again.The visual is very good. If you go see it you must see it in IMAX 3D or don't see it at all. It is great to see views of the earth from space and also nice to see extreme closeups of the Hubble, the shuttle and the ISS both inside and outside. The 3D was so realistic I blinked a few times as things came flying toward the screen.As for the story, don't even both paying much attention. Just sit back and watch the visuals and ignore the story. The believability is not even in the near vicinity of this universe. There is almost nothing about this movie that is any way related to how things like this would happen in space. I would go so far as to say you could take along earplugs and not listen to the story.

This film makes you feel like you are drifting among the stars, instead of just showing you a story set in space.

In Space No One Can Hear You Scream,"Arguably the best tagline for a movie EVER, ""In space no one can hear you scream"" Alien's ""In space no one can hear you scream"" tagline is arguably the best tagline for a movie of all-time. That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso Cuarón's latest thriller, Gravity.Starring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity puts the two A-listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space.Their struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) to float untethered in space. Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90-minutes. Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible.Alfonso Cuarón is chiselling himself quite a career. He was last behind the camera for Children of Men (2006) which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). But Gravity is his best work to date.Bullock carries the film (expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination) and Gravity centers on the two main characters only. There are no other developed characters. Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston, Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn't amount to 2 minutes if strung in order.With only two actors to carry the entire 90-minute runtime, the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background. And the visuals are fantastic. There are no side-stories, sub-plots, unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters. Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left.Gravity is the best 3D film ever. Ever. Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound (both loud and quiet) and you have a faultless mix. Gravity will contend for Oscar's in Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.Cuarón incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space. And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy, the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character's success in each new attempt at survival.With still a few months left in the year, it's too early to call a film the year's best. But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year's conclusion. It's that breathtaking. It's that good.www.killerreviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Don't believe the hype!,"I rushed to see this film on the strength of the IMDb reviews. I left the theater wondering if I'd seen a different film. First off, the 3d visuals were absolutely spellbinding. That mitigated my disappointment with the rest of the film to a certain extent. However, the thin story and weak dialogue kept dragging me out of the action. Sandra bullock did her best with the on the nose dialogue that was laughably bad at times. She didn't seem to be the right fit for the role but I don't think she can blamed for bad writing and misdirection ( no one told the director that thirty minutes of hyperventilating might be unnecessary realism?) By all means go see this film for the spectacular visuals but don't expect a story to go along with the spectacle. Even Jim Cameron managed a decent story with Avatar. Sadly they missed an opportunity to create a scifi classic here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity -- much more than a space movie!,"Gravity pulled me in right from the start!! The cinematography of Earth and space is stunningly breathtaking!!! The CGI was flawless, lending the impression of actually being there. I can't remember ever being pulled into a film so completely and thoroughly.Gravity is a film that takes place in space, but it is SO much more than just a space movie. I identified with Sandra Bullocks character on a couple levels and I felt like I was in her place at the final scene.Gravity. It pulls us down. It places us solidly where we are. It defines us. There is no escaping the reality...although sometimes we try. Sometimes all we need to do is let go and let gravity bring us home...Questions that the film conjured in me: Where do we escape? What causes us to awaken? How do we pick up ourselves against the weight of the world and learn to walk again? Who are we really when we are stripped down to our core?To feel the pain, the fear, the loss of dreams amidst each breath. To try again. To never give up. To heal. To dare embrace life. To love...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

GRAVITY....You Don't SEE It....But You Sure as Heaven EXPERIENCE It!,"Long Live Alfonso Cuaron! Que Viva Alfonso Cuaron! In just a few hundred words, I will now try to do the film, its director and cast (Sandra Bullock & George Clooney), justice. ""The Seventh Art"" is a term that seems to have fallen into disuse during the past 15 or 20 years. GRAVITY's director, Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men), has not only resuscitated, but also reinvented it, adding a signature spin all his own. Where is it written that a movie's commercial success is almost always inversely proportionate to its artistic, intellectual and aesthetic quality? GRAVITY, most certainly, brings to mind the adage, ""The exception proves the rule!""As this review is being written, Gravity is rated 8.5 on IMDb.com, by 184,000, placing it in the all-time film top 75, just behind The LION KING and just ahead of REQUIEM FOR a DREAM. Truly great films are both original and work on multiple levels. How, specifically, does this one manage so much in just 90 minutes? Alfonso Cuaron's poetic visuals enable us to view his reality through the eyes of a cinematic genius. A glimmering tear, floating aimlessly, impacts the viewer with a Tsunami of emotion. The breathtaking, yet surreal, backdrop of hovering earth and stars provides an ever-present reminder of both our relative insignificance on a cosmic scale and the fleetingness of our problems, however transcendent they may seem to us in the moment.GRAVITY communicates more via imagery and resourceful, subtle, yet intense acting, than it does through dialog. The dialog here mostly serves as a buffer, a veneer, to calm and disguise extremely turbulent inner-emotions. Some of life's great tragedies are framed in the most insipid of words.There is genuinely something for everyone here. If gut-wrenching is what you seek, there are some chaotic, frenetic and viscerally charged moments. Almost forgot to mention, GRAVITY's use of 3-D is never over- the-top, in- your-face nor employed gratuitously. It is deftly and strategically used to highlight on-screen occurrences, not to detract from them or be the sole focus, per se.Bullock's character, Dr. Stone, who at first seems utterly driven to achieve perfection, is in reality locked into a self-induced drone like state of professional isolation, resulting from a profound loss she seemingly refuses to come to terms with. The inner conflict this causes her and Bullock's ability to involve the audience in her character's catharsis translates into moments of overwhelming poignancy. .Why is her performance Oscar worthy? Ms. Bullock literally carries the entire last half of the movie solely on her shoulders and her performance is tersely awe-inspiring. Very few Hollywood actresses could pull this off. And to think that initially she wasn't on the short list for the role! George Clooney's character, larger-than-life, veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, is the jovial kind of guy who can be a bit of an ***hole at times, but amazes you with his simple selfless professionalism when it really counts. In this supporting role, the on screen platonic chemistry with Sandra Bullock is uncanny. Honestly, some of the best I have ever seen.Lastly, in addition to gut-grabbing, heart-involving and mentally engaging Gravity does what only 1 film in a 1,000 managesIt captures your soul! Some really fine films try to provide the right answers. After experiencing GRAVITY, you'll be asking yourself many of the right questions. .ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A thrilling ride from start to end, must see on the big screen in 3D","Just returned from seeing this at the Haifa Film Festival. As an astronomy enthusiast, I thoroughly enjoyed Gravity. It was more absorbing than any movie I can remember in recent history and probably the closest most of us will get to being in space, any time soon. The stunning visuals combined with great 3D work and sound effects totally draw you into orbit right along Sandra for the 90 minutes it lasts. By the way, the teaser trailer does not do Gravity justice, but it was nice to be pleasantly surprised for a change. Plot wise, it's not the most sophisticated film ever - Hollywood couldn't resist some of its usual manipulations (no need to elaborate here, you'll know it when you see it), but in this case, it's forgiven.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A visual technical and directorial achievement, but there is much more to 'Gravity' than those things","To me, 'Gravity' may not quite the masterpiece that it has been touted to be, though the critics and positive reviews do a fantastic job summing up the film's merits. However, while it is easy to see why some won't like it it is nowhere near as bad from personal opinion as the negative reviewers say. It is nowhere near the worst film ever and not deserving of a 1/10 rating with the visuals, effects and direction being such an achievement, the trend to bash critics and those who agree with the general consensus has also become extremely annoying.Alfonso Cuaron is is an extremely talented director, all his films to date have proved that. 'Children of Men' is especially good and one of the best films of the decade, have always have had a huge soft spot for 'A Little Princess', 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is not for everyone but for me it was a near-masterpiece, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of the best directed films of the 'Harry Potter' franchise and as polarising as 'Gravity' is there is no denying that Cuaron's direction and the visuals were exceptional. 'Gravity' may be my second least favourite film of his, with 'Prisoner of Azaban', still very good, faring least, this is saying little and is testament to Cuaron's talent.'Gravity' does fall short of perfection. Its weak spot is the script, it does tend to ramble, feel manufactured and cheesy and doesn't do an awful lot to make the characters more than mere clichés. The story doesn't always grip with a few slow, dull spots, and the ending puzzles.However, as said already in this review and by previous reviews (acknowledged in most less than positive postings, 'Gravity' is a triumph visually and technically. The cinematography is tremendous, quite possibly the most beautiful and best shot film of 2013. The setting is striking and the special effects are a marvel. Cuaron's direction is exceptional, some of the best he has ever done, a master of visuals and mood.With that being said, 'Gravity' has much more to it than the visuals and direction. The music is an incredible fit, it's haunting, sweeping and breathtakingly beautiful. A good deal of the story is gripping, with intimacy, tension and great emotional impact.Sandra Bullock gives one of her finest performances here and gives the film a certain grace, while George Clooney has a cool calmness that fits his role perfectly. Ed Harris is also impressive.Overall, an achievement visually, technically and directorially, but despite its faults 'Gravity' is much more than those things. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
An outstanding visual space film,"Gravity is an outstanding visual film directed by Alfonso Cuaron, crammed with some lovely area views, and excellent 3D effects that were used in an appropriate manner to create an extraordinary CGI appearance. I enjoyed the movie but didn't find it to be one of the very best of the year. The problem with this movie is the story, technically it's a flawless masterpiece and the 3D is amazing with a strong performance by Sandra Bullock, but the story is thin and predictable. Bullock does give one of the better performances of the year and the 'man vs. nature' storyline is always a compelling one but this movie mainly works as an amazingly beautiful visual feast and little more.

"If this had been a silent film, it would have been perfect","Visuals : 10 ... Script: 0 If this had been a silent film, it would have been perfect, but, sadly, it's rife with banal and irritating chitter-chatter, none of which was used to truly propel the story nor profoundly flesh-out the characters. Everything that needed to be known could have simply been shown in a couple of captions, and expressed through body language/facial expressions. NOTHING needed to be said here, especially not this dribble that was passed off as dialogue.The special effects and astounding real-ness of this film, however, blew me away! The attention to detail and the shocking realism of the actors' weightlessness is stunning! Though I warn you: anyone who is highly sensitive to motion sickness will want to avoid this film.Clooney's performance may be generic (due to his weak-water scripting,) but Bullock's performance is impressive, and uncharacteristically physical.There is a faint hint of ""2001: Space Oddessy"" in the scent of this film, though it clearly stands apart. The not-so-subtle metaphors for gestation, birth, re-birth, and evolution are beautifully illustrated in this film, and give the viewer an eloquent buffet of food-for-thought.The ecological situation this film presents is quite serious, and not something that one might have been previously aware of... kudos to director and writer Cuarón for approaching this little-known, yet globally effecting subject, which not only effects the environment but also the future of human space exploration and communications. (I recommend that you check out the accompanying documentary, which is offered as a ""special feature"" on the DVD.)

Objects move with geometric beauty, while Earth is a vivid, distant dream.Concept (Plot/Theme): 1.5/2 - The threat of space debris is wonderfully mundane and realistic, but everything that follows the initial catastrophe requires some suspension of disbelief as survival becomes increasingly improbable. Still, the film adeptly captures the minuscule fragility of human existence.Total Score: 7.5/10Gut Feeling: 8/10 - While I wondered how her character qualified for a space mission in the first place, Bullock delivers a moving performance in an immersive film that is worth seeing for the cinematography alone.Final Average Score: 7.75",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Sandra Bullock delivers a powerful performance, bringing depth to her role and doing full justice to the emotionally charged narrative. Although I personally don't gravitate toward these types of stories, as I find them not particularly edifying, Gravity still manages to hold attention and keeps you on edge from start to finish. It's certainly a good one-time watch for the sheer intensity, visual effects, and strong acting, even if it's not the type of film that leaves a lasting philosophical or emotional impact.

"Gravity is one of the most beautiful, gripping, intense, moving, and downright satisfying movies I've ever seen.","Have you ever seen a moment in a movie where it gives you a certain feeling inside? I like to call them ""Pixar moments"". We've all been there. We see a Pixar movie (most likely Toy Story, Toy Story 3, and every movie in-between) and we feel something. It's a combination of satisfaction, heart, and strong emotions. That's the impact that Gravity left on me, but instead of one part of the movie, it was the entire thing. This movie stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney who are astronauts. They are on their normal day job when all of a sudden, lots of debris flies at them. Sandra Bullock gets separated from them and she has to find her way back to Earth. I am really bad at describing movie plots. And it's to describe this one because it is so well written and well executed that I don't want to spoil it. Not only is the plot very intense, but it's also realistic. Astronauts have to deal with this all the time and it's a scary thought when it does happen. That's also something I should bring up. This movie does a great job at keeping you on the edge of your seat. There's lots of destruction, but with the added bonus of zero gravity and no oxygen, it makes for one heck of a ride. And I like how the destruction looks and sounds. When you see the debris fly, you know that crap is about to go down. And let's not forget that in space, there is no sound, so when debris does hit everything, it's not a loud crash, but a quiet thud. It's like the sound that is made when you tap a microphone. It's very well done. The acting is well done, too. Sandra Bullock definitely stole the show. She does a great job at reacting to her surroundings and doing her scenes in general. George Clooney had a great performance, too. His character is the confident, talkative type and that really worked for this role. He even looks like an astronaut. That's a plus. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen in my entire life. The camera displays everything in a swooping motion, like the camera is in space, too. And how the scenes are set up is just amazing. I heard that every scene they had to do was choreographed so specifically. They had to know when to move and when to react to things. That added to the realistic factor and I liked it. And know it's time for the big one; the special effects. HOLY GUACA-STINKING MOLE! They are, without a doubt, the best special effects I have ever seen in my entire life. Everything looks absolutely beautiful from the stars, to the sunrise, to the Earth itself. It really feels like you, the viewer, are in space with them and that adds to the movie a lot. Overall, this movie was a masterpiece. This is one of those rare movies where while viewing, you can't think of anything you wished you would've liked changed or done differently. Gravity is in my top four favorite movies of all time (up there with the three Lord of the Rings movies). I loved this movie and I can't wait to see it again on Saturday. If you haven't seen this movie, please, please, please, watch it. This movie is amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Something Visually Beautifully, Something Tense, Yet Something Void","I thought Gravity did a great job with the special effects and the realism of space and the cinematography. I thought in my opinion that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were great in their roles. The film provides plenty of moments of visual awe and deep tension. So overall I thought the film was pretty decent. The movie is a visually entertaining and fun for audiences who are looking for spectacular effects and truly real visuals.What made me slightly dislike the film itself was the fact that the background to the characters wasn't explained thoroughly. OK Ryan Stone's (Sandra Bullock) daughter dies but I never really felt the pain that she felt since we never got to visually see memories or her back on Earth with her daughter. Also what kind of person was Matt Kowalski, George Clooney's character. He seemed more like a guy straight out of some hick town bar who had fond memories back at home. The plot wasn't fully fleshed out and the 90 minute span of this film was just flat out BOGUS. This film could of EASILY been 30 minutes longer. Giving the time for the characters to be fully fleshed out, what the true purpose of their mission was and what they truly experienced besides some bloodshed, tears, a little drama and a safe landing home for Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock).Overall this film was good but not fantastic by ANY stretch of the imagination. Do I find this film overrated? Hell yes! Do I think its a bad film by any means? NO. Its a movie simply built on eye candy, visuals and tension. Yet it had little plot and poorly fleshed out characters as well as the point of the entire mission.Gravity was OK but its only worth a one time view.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Every human being should have the chance to watch it at the least once in his life,"To all the people that valued this movie 1/10. I've never written a review but in this case, seeing that this movie received 1 over 10 I would like to share some thoughts. First of all I wonder how much you would evaluate a movie like ""Sharknado"" or ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". This movie deserve more than 1 because surely is not the worse movie you saw or you will see in your lifetime. Originality: please enunciate me a movie that is talking about destruction about chain-reaction caused by debris. Who is telling that ""Apollo 13"" was better remember that the story was not original: it happened in reality, it was already there and the director already knew what happened, not having to invent it. There is a difference between reproducing and originality. State of art visual special effects: maybe you watched your movie on a tablet or laptop but for the time this movie was produced no better technology for special effects has been used before. For example, I like Inception but there is a big difference between filming ""no gravity"" effects with a normal camera and doing it with a 3D IMAX camera and the Academy Award Oscar is the evidence. If you watched it in a 2D small screen then it's not director's fault. To conclude I do not believe the director had even the idea to reproduce the reality or teaching science but only to show how beautiful is the life in our home, Earth and how difficult is to survive outside of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
HK Auteur Review - Gravity,"In my opinion, the key to making special effects convincing on screen is designing the effect to look somewhere between real and unreal. When the audience can't figure out what's real and what's not, they will believe it. This is what happened to me during Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity.Since Children of Men, Alfonso Cuarón takes his love of the long take and brings it to new levels. I couldn't figure out how these long shots were accomplished. The camera floats freely around the astronauts in space in long takes, occasionally shifting from third person perspective to first person. The camera loops, twirls, corkscrews around space, completely forgoing the human sense of up and down. It looked like the cameraman was really floating around with the actors. I knew that wasn't possible. But eventually I tapped out and let the movie spectacle just wash over me.As science fiction thematically explores the extreme potential of mankind, awe is an important component to every science fiction story. I was in sheer awe through the entirety of Gravity. Firstly, outer space and the beauty of Earth from a distance awed me. Then there was the solemn beauty of witnessing the space stations being decimated in space. I began to marvel at the destruction and momentarily thought deep thoughts. It was as if for a second I was watching waves wash ashore on a beach while reading J. Krishnamurti. Finally, I was awed by the fragility of human life. After all, all astronauts are just little fishes trying to survive out of their own habitat. The experience was otherworldly, self-reflective and dangerous all at the same time.I walked into Gravity mistakenly thinking it was a George Clooney vehicle. To my surprise, it's a Sandra Bullock movie. Sandra Bullock has always had a natural personable quality on screen. Whether it was pining for her crush to awaken from a coma in While You Were Sleeping or driving a bus that's primed to explode in Speed, she's always able to draw the audience into her plight with vulnerability. Bullock's characters never feel above the audience. Often this quality of hers get overlooked from having to play cheerful funny characters in romantic comedies.In Gravity, that quality is used to its full extent. We watch as she struggles to survive a series of obstacles. Her performance is as immersive as the special effects. She draws you in completely into her plight. I wish more depth were given to her character. By the beginning of the third act, the film starts to run low on its spectacle and it came to the moment where more character was needed for a bigger statement. Gravity elected to stay with its spectacle and jetted for the finish line. It had a good ending, but it was missing that final thematic punch that answers, ""What is this story ultimately about?"" and ""Why am I watching this?""And for that, Gravity is a great gem and one exhilarating thrill ride. I am even happy that it was a great role for Sandra Bullock. I just do not know if the thrills will be as compelling on subsequent viewings. So in the end, it is not a masterpiece, but a very awesome movie nonetheless.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
GRAVITY....You Don't SEE It....But You Sure as Heaven EXPERIENCE It!,"Long Live Alfonso Cuaron! Que Viva Alfonso Cuaron! In just a few hundred words, I will now try to do the film, its director and cast (Sandra Bullock & George Clooney), justice!Obviously... This is ONE movie people really seem extremely divided on! Personally, I absolutely LOVED it! For those of You who didn´t...Maybe reading some of my thoughts just might cause You to reflect and perhaps have some second thoughts!""The Seventh Art"" is a term that seems to have fallen into disuse during the past 20 or 30 Years. GRAVITY's director, Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men), has not only resuscitated, but also reinvented it, adding a signature spin all his own!Where is it written that a movie's commercial success is almost always inversely proportionate to its artistic, Intellectual and aesthetic quality? GRAVITY, most certainly, brings to mind the adage, ""The exception proves the rule!"" .When this review was being written, Gravity was rated 8.5 on IMDb, with 184,000 Votes, placing it in the all-time film top 75, just behind The LION KING and just ahead of REQUIEM FOR a DREAM! OK... Now, some Years later, it has slipped to a 7.7 Rating. Not GREAT-But most certainly.... Very Good!Truly great films are both original and work on multiple levels. How, specifically, does this one manage so much in just 90 minutes? Alfonso Cuaron's artisitic and poetic visuals enable us to view his reality through the eyes of a cinematic genius. A glimmering tear, floating aimlessly, impacts the viewer with a Tsunami of emotion. The breathtaking, yet surreal, backdrop of hovering earth and stars provides an ever-present reminder of both our relative insignificance on a cosmic scale and the utter fleetingness of our
problems, however transcendent they may seem to us in the moment......GRAVITY communicates more via imagery and resourceful, subtle, yet intense acting, than it does through dialog. Here, the dialog mostly serves as a buffer, a veneer, to calm and disguise extremely turbulent inner-emotions. Some of life's great tragedies.... are framed in the most insipid of words. . .There is genuinely something for everyone here. If gut-wrenching is what you seek, there are some chaotic, frenetic and viscerally charged moments. Almost forgot to mention, GRAVITY's use of 3-D is never over-the-top, in-your-face, nor employed gratuitously. It is deftly and strategically used to highlight on-screen occurrences, not to detract from them or be the sole or even central focus, per se.....Bullock's character, Dr. Stone, who at first seems utterly driven to achieve perfection, is, in reality, locked into a self-induced drone like state of professional isolation, resulting from a profound loss she seemingly refuses to come to terms with. The intense innner-conflict this causes her....and Bullock's ability to involve the audience in her character's catharsis translates into moments of overwhelming poignancy.........Why is her performance Oscar worthy? Ms. Bullock literally carries the entire last half of the movie solely on her shoulders! Her performance is tersely awe-inspiring. Very few Hollywood actresses could pull this off!And to think that initially she wasn't on the short list for the role!George Clooney's character, larger-than-life, veteran astronaut Matt
Kowalski, is the jovial kind of guy who can be a bit of an ***hole at times, but amazes you with his simple selfless professionalism when it really counts. In this supporting role, the on screen platonic chemistry with Sandra Bullock is absolutely uncanny. Honestly, some of the very best I have ever seen. .Lastly, in addition to gut-grabbing, heart-involving and mentally engaging...GRAVITY does what only one film in a 1,000
manages...It captures your soul! Some really fine films try to provide the right answers. After experiencing GRAVITY, you'll be asking yourself many of the right questions.....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA! ....10********** !!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The intensity of the experience covers up for the weaknesses in the events and writing,"I am really not a fan of 3D; I dislike that everything seems darker and a little bit harder to see and even for the big banner 3D movie (Avatar) it seemed like an unnecessary gimmick that didn't do enough to cover up a not particularly good film. Add to this the number of films that are cheaply retrofitted with 3D for the sake of money and I really have no interest in seeing anything in 3D if I have a normal option. Gravity was the exception since from what I heard it was probably worth seeing in 3D and from seeing it I can agree with this.As a piece of technology, Gravity is really impressive. I always think that the absolute best use of special effects in films are those where you forget how impressive they are because they really don't stand out as different from everything else but are just part of the construct. That is the case here as space just feels real and the huge amount of work to make it happen isn't made a fuss of and doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film. Helping you forget this is the fact that the film is a real experience in terms of the story as a ride. Within a few minutes you are in the middle of the experience and it really doesn't stop until the end. Visually I did still feel the 3D made the images darker than they should have been and reduced the clarity of my whole field of vision, but in this case the feeling of being ""in"" the film really work and aside from one or two ""thing coming at you"" moments, it really worked. For me equally impressive was the sound engineering; most sound effects are given a really satisfying ""via contact"" sound – the sound where the vibrations come via water or another material like they vibrate through your body rather than in the air. This was done so very well and helped me get into it as much as the visuals and effects.The one thing to say though is that all of this probably only applies if you see it in the cinema and with the full experience because this is what it is about – and it would be wrong to get sucked up in the experience and not see the weaknesses within this film. Specifically these are in the content and they will be more apparent on a smaller screen. The events within the film are so unlikely that without these strong aspects drawing you in, they will probably be more likely to push you out of the experience to question what you are watching. Attempts to add character and back story are OK but only as part of an already engaging experience – mostly they are only so-so and one or two rather clunky bits of symbolism really don't work. That said it is not down to the cast. Clooney may be very much about his calmness under pressure and his great presence but Bullock does a very good job to be vulnerable and fighting to survive and just like the effects do, her performance draws you in even if the material she sometimes has to deliver has the potential to do the opposite.Gravity is only 90 minutes and it moves with intensity and urgency that is effective and greatly helped by how great it is as an experience. As such it will work best by far with a large screen and those silly overpriced glasses on because it is all about this and in this context the weaknesses are less impacting – but there are weaknesses and they do have an impact and I suspect that as the film moves onto smaller screens, these will be more apparent.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
*Gravity: A Breathtaking Cinematic Experience*,"*Gravity* is a cinematic masterpiece that transports viewers into the unforgiving expanse of space, creating a visceral and emotionally charged experience. Directed by Alfonso Cuarón, the film is a technical marvel that pushes the boundaries of visual effects while delivering a poignant story of survival and human resilience.One of the film's most striking aspects is its stunning visuals. The cinematography, by Emmanuel Lubezki, is simply breathtaking. The vastness and beauty of space are captured with awe-inspiring clarity, while the terrifying reality of space debris and the claustrophobic confines of the spacecraft create a palpable sense of danger. The long takes and immersive sound design further enhance the film's realism, making audiences feel as if they are floating in space alongside the characters.Beyond its visual splendor, *Gravity* is a gripping psychological thriller. Sandra Bullock delivers a powerhouse performance as Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first space mission. Her character's journey from terrified novice to determined survivor is both heartbreaking and inspiring. George Clooney provides excellent support as the seasoned astronaut Matt Kowalski, offering humor and camaraderie in the face of overwhelming adversity.The film's narrative is focused and efficient, building tension steadily as Stone faces increasingly perilous challenges. The isolation and despair she experiences are palpable, making it impossible not to become emotionally invested in her survival. *Gravity* is a masterclass in suspense, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout.At its core, *Gravity* is a story about the human will to survive. Stone's struggle to overcome unimaginable odds is a powerful metaphor for the challenges we face in our own lives. The film's ending is both hopeful and bittersweet, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.In conclusion, *Gravity* is a cinematic achievement that is as visually stunning as it is emotionally resonant. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent visuals, so-so plot","By the time most of you read this review, Gravity will not be in cinemas. If you haven't seen it on the big screen then you're missing out on its biggest asset.Gravity is a special effects film. Watched in 3D and on a large screen it's easy to get so sucked into the environment that you could actually believe it's shot in space. Some of this will translate to your home television but I think it'll lose a lot on a smaller screen.And that's bad, because the plot line underneath isn't up to much. Neither Clooney nor Bullock put in a bad performance here but the story is fairly standard Hollywood stuff which doesn't leave you caring what happens or gripped by the actionNeither of which are a problem in a cinema, where the pretty graphics are a spectacle all by themself. At home? Not convinced.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Could have been a sensational blockbuster. Could have...,"Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone, tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness.I watched this on release in the cinema and I truly loved it. 2 of my favourite actors, in my favourite genre of film, with a breathtakingly exciting story. We need more space stories to get people excited and inspired about a future civilisation of humans living off-earth. It has to come as there is no alternative. However, it was only while watching it again, on DVD a year later, that I recognised just how many holes there are in the plot. I still love the film, but I see too many plot holes these days.The main problem is the physics. I don't expect everything to be rigidly correct because, it's just a story. But I do expect things to be in the realms of reality. Almost all of the physics throughout weren't even in the realms of likelihood so that spoiled it a little for me. People who love Sci Fi will know exactly what I mean but for those who don't, do you really think a senior astronaut would be clowning around in his jet suit like Wall-E as Clooney does at the beginning? All the satellites would have been fine in the tragedy: All space craft are at different orbits. There's not a chance in hell that Kowalski could have found Stone after she first got blown away from the station. You can't just move through space and change orbits on a whim: It takes complex calculations and multiple thrusts to achieve that, you can't do it with a jet pack and certainly not with a fire extinguisher! The continual banging into things is laughable. Their bodies would be instantly broken if that happened in real life. Stone was down to 1% oxygen, yet still Kowalski keeps engaging her in conversation about trivial things. And Kowalski was saved the instant Stone caught his tether: Making him let go and somehow float off (which he would not do) was just silly. That's enough for now. There's another dozen screaming mistakes but I'll let you watch the film and spot them.What was possibly more irritating than the plot holes was the music score. At first I thought we were going to experience the true hush of space. That would be a remarkable and wonderful thing. Instead Kowalski is constantly jabbering about nothing and playing awful music. Perhaps the most irritating role Clooney has ever done. Also there was a musical score over the film. It was supposed to (I think) excite your emotions. What it did was just spoil the film. Why do you need the racket of a full blown orchestra when someone is in space? That for me was a schoolboy error and was probably the main factor that I didn't rate the film as highly as I otherwise would have done.In the end I still enjoyed it on some level, but it could have been an enormous blockbuster like Titanic. But ultimately it was just a good Sci Fi film. I gave it a 7 but it could have had the only 9 I am ever likely to give had it not been for the thigs I mentioned.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Regardless of physics laws broken Gravity pulls you in, start to finish. A must watch.","Firstly I would like to illuminate the vastness and incredible wonderment that is our galaxy. Our Milky Way, is spinning at an amazingly fast rate of 225 kilometers per second. In addition to this, the galaxy is traveling through space at around 300 kilometers per second. This basically means that we are rocketing along at speeds of 530 kilometers per second.. Annually our big old smiley moon moves further from us here on earth by 3.8cm. This is believed to be a result of tidal effects. The energy in the sunlight we see at present came all the way from the Sun's core around 30,000 years ago. This energy spent the vast majority of this time passing through the thick atoms of the sun and only a mere 8 minutes to reach the earth's atmosphere once it had left that fiery ball of fury we call the Sun. Crazy I know, But as Jesse Pinkman of Breaking Bad famously said ""Science bi%#!"".Feeling small? Well Gravity initially instills this same feeling and then so much more. Gravity is a wild space roller coaster action film surrounding a major catastrophe caused by space debris colliding with a US satellite and the team left fighting for their lives and the impossible contingency to make it back home safely to earth. And yes whilst many of the physics laws are bent to suit, aesthetically and as a narrative this film is completely worthy of all praises.Let's start with the casting, with so much resting on Sandra Bullock I will admit I was certainly a skeptic, however I could not fault her performance once you looked past her rather uninspiring career with some terrible ""zone out"" and ""how were they ever funded"" sequels and original films such as Speed 2 (one of the lowest rated films on IMDb scoring 3.6/10), Miss Congeniality 2, The Proposal, 2 Weeks Notice, Premonition and Forces of Nature. It was almost enough to make Steven Segal look good, almost. It was for this exact reason I didn't see this in cinemas and am now of course kicking myself harder then Guy Ritchie for both marrying Madonna and helping her make a movie. I digress, Sandra Bullock who plays a hardware engineer encapsulates the character in every aspect and the emphatic feelings are well drawn for her character as you are taken along for the ride with her. Whilst her character realistically would most probably never have been hired by NASA she as a character pulls on the heart strings and makes your heart ache for all she has and will go through. In short I am thrilled Angelina Jolie dropped this role. Mission commander Matt Kowalski played by the sterling silver fox George Clooney (who received the role after Robert Downey Jr pulled out with scheduling conflicts) was perfect for the role and somehow took the geek factor out of the profession and brought a charm, energy and cowboy style to the role and hit the nail head on. He makes it look good and romances space with an impeccable delivery and my only wish was that more was told about his character.The cinematography which of course is vastly computer generated animation took 4 years for the directors to be happy with and it certainly was worth the wait. Looking down at the looming earth you feel like you are right there and every bump, jump and spin of the astronauts is shared with the audience. The action sequences are epic and the force and pressure are very well designed to give the feeling of complete helplessness in space, where nobody can hear you scream... (Terrible?) The films tag line ""Don't let go"" is fully incorporated in a visually stunning film which will surely educate and inspire future film greatness.Watch this movie preferably on the biggest sharpest screen with the best audio possible, Fasten your seat belt, cause planet Earth is going bye bye. I give Gravity 8.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Depicts space like you've never seen it before,"Alfonso Cuarón directs a masterpiece which deserves every award it is given. Yes there are flaws, like many films, but these flaws are overridden by sheer magnificence and beauty that Gravity manages to create in its depiction of space and the events that occur during a catastrophic mission.To put things short and sweet, the visuals are breathtaking, the tone is perfect and the pacing is flawless. Although there are negatives, for example the lacklustre narrative along with the unconvincing dialogue, the film manages all what the audience expects to follow in the emotional journey through space.The trailer instantly had me hyped for the film, it felt unique and seemed like an experience rather than a film that you'd just go to the cinema and watch, and that's exactly what it was, breathtaking and unforgettable. I was lost in the atmosphere and drama that was superbly created throughout the film. ""In space no one can hear you"" - this sums up the journey that we follow Bullock through and the isolation that the film creates and puts you into. Cuarón captured the mood perfectly and had me in the eyes of Bullock to feel the situation she was in and be involved with the character's emotions from the beginning to the end.The technical production of the film uses techniques which are new to the genre and make the experience seem like nothing you've felt before. The score is outstanding and full of impact which feeds the narrative in order to work together and create an atmosphere which feels real and has the audience isolated in its environment. The sound effects use a process like no other which have you constantly relating to the character's situation as you can literally feel what the characters do and capture the events as they happen. Drones in the score and muffled sounds in the audio all work in relation to one another to depict space in a perspective that seems to have ""impacted cinema"" and shows the scale and isolation that comes in space.This entire sense of loneliness that comes with the film and suggested in the tag line is cleverly portrayed in the film's cinematography though the scenes where largely effects based. There is a definite sense of scale which the cinematography brings through the extreme wide shots and the minute long shots that suggests a lack of impact in space.Lastly, as mentioned, the visual effects are just mind-blowing. Not once do the events ever feel unreal and lose the emotional sense that the film creates. They are subtle in a way where they are not regarded and talked about as effects although they take up a large part and drive the entire story. The journey is fuelled by Gravity's ground breaking special effects and was a huge influence to its overall success adding the excitement and action that everyone was looking for but had never truly discovered. The visuals and the effects show space from an angle that has no restrictions and because of this, creates a unique experience that has not been created before.Overall, the film has a perfect rating from me because I can not give it an valuable or deserving faults as I was lost in an unforgettable experience that I reckon will make a big impact in the history of cinema and will last for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Visual Feast and An Insult to Real Astronauts,"What this movie is really trying to say...Sandra Bullock is very fit for her age. George Clooney is so cool in a spacesuit. We deserve to win awards because we care about realism in this science fiction. We did this and that research and training with real space professionals etc.What this movie ended up saying...Hollywood has its own idea of scientific realism. George Cloony looks old even in a cool spacesuit.Oh, and, there's crazy amount of space junk up there - which will one day come back to bite all of us down here. All it takes is a meteor, or an X-flare, and a chain reaction. When that happens all a space technician could do?Panting and spinning uncontrollably in space.The disasters on the ground produced by this kind of massive space junk apocalypse event will likely kill more people on the ground. Yet we are to focus on one very important haplessly spinning space-walker who could barely save her own very fit physique.Panting uncontrollably - every step of the way and even after being repeatedly told to calm down and to conserve energy - consumes already dwindling oxygen supply, and shows how untrained, ill-disciplined and unprofessional the astronaut is (and how lazy the writer/ director/ actors are)Lead character is apparently a certified emotionally-unstable and technically-mediocre, panicky, random-button-pushing astronaut. Still given the job. What an insult to real astronauts.At least 40-something Bullock tried her best to look 35 and succeeded. 100% silver hair and nonathletic Clooney looks completely his post-menopausal age, and by any account should not be in a spacesuit, nor strutting about some expensive space station low on insulin supply. Another insult to real younger, taller, fitter than athletes astronauts.Which brings us to another possibly unintended effect...China looks like the real space master. Not sure if that's already true in reality. But unlike this ""realistic"" Bullock astronaut, Chinese astronauts would likely read Russian buttons, or at least breathe calmly, and take more calculated risk when in doubt. China certainly won't send a charming but aging male out there and risk their billion dollar investments.And the plot...What plot? There is no plot to give away. Just lots of spinning above glorious earth, hyper-diligent space station cockpit shots, panic damsel panting audio, and Bullock's super fit body parts on display.Scientifically, 'Gravity' is one of the worst ""insult to real professionals"" offender of this decade, especially given the stellar budget and the ""we care about realism"" hype. Just admit it is a blatant Bullock star vehicle and stop elevating it to some hard science fiction pedestal.And because it is more about ""making Bullock like-able"", it became less about character realism. Apparently female astronaut still needs to pant in damsel in distress style to elicit audience sympathy and to seek daddy figure reassurance just so that she could function coherently. A weak-minded, vulnerable, unfocused female leading character is not my idea of female hero, but designed to be appealing to the Bullock fan crowd. Another annoyance throughout this film for me.Still, even with all of the above, the movie managed to entertain me due to one single factor: the setting. I just happen to like geographic or space documentary. The movie should be called ""Above Earth"".Aiming straight at Bullock and Clooney fan club. Watchable for non-science buffs. Will likely annoy hard science fiction fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not great","Let me start by disclaiming ""spoiler free"" - I assume you have seen a preview or read at least enough to know the most basic premise of the film. If you truly have no idea what it's about, well, I make references to content used in the trailers. But seriously, if this does describe you, why are you on IMDb and reading a review at all?The Good: * Beautiful, amazing, breathtakingly phenomenal cinematography. I honestly feel closer to having an idea of what being in space might be like as a result of the way this was shot. * Solid acting. I felt the characters were genuine, and Clooney/Bullock fit their roles quite well - in fact I'm surprised at any negativity toward the acting. * Suspenseful. Cuaron did a great job keeping the audience on the edge of their seat, and had a solid balance between slowly built, drawn out sequences and other ""gotcha"" kind of moments. * Dialogue and characters. Great blends of comic and serious, deep and light, etc moments. Very well put together from that end.The Bad: * Repetitive events. You know that scene in the preview where someone is grabbing on to some space ship part for dear life, and it appears that if they miss it they will be lost in space forever? Yeah, I've now seen that moment a few dozen times, to the point where I'd predict a Gravity Drinking Game around it. It's just too much, and while I get it that that's a big part of the premise, it becomes nearly comical after the first few times it occurs. * Too many crises. If you've read the trivia around Apollo 13, you've probably noticed they deliberately removed some of the events that transpired in real life from the film, mostly because they didn't think the audience would find it believable. In Gravity, I felt that the cascading series of mishaps were just too many from start to finish. I think numerous moments could've been reduced or removed completely and the end result would've been more gripping. Instead, I kept getting that feeling where my suspension of disbelief was being taxed. * Too many ""last possible moment"" sequences. To avoid spoiling anything, just imagine a caper movie where the bomb is set to go off, and after a ton of action, the bomb is defused with less than a second to go. Now do it 3 or more (I've lost count) times in the same movie. It certainly builds up tension, but also increased the ""okay, now they are just messing with me"" effect. * The trailer. While I'd say it's a tossup between Drive and Hancock as to ""worst expectation setting for a movie, EVER,"" I'd say Gravity's trailer is on thin ice. If you've paid too much attention to it, it's pretty ridden with spoilers (thankfully I had not seen it more than once before going into the movie). But if you also just saw it once or twice, you'd probably be thinking it's a non-stop space action flick. It isn't, and if you are unfamiliar with the director's other works, you should definitely pay them some attention first. The movie paces really well actually, but it's a much more drawn-out film than I think a lot of people will expect. * Annoying 3D. I wish I'd seen the IMAX 3D version, maybe that would change my feelings here. As it is, I didn't, and other than 2-3 ""really cool"" uses of 3D, it was pretty superfluous to the movie.Overall, I have negative feeling about it. Per the above, it was wonderfully put together, but ultimately I felt the movie spent more time trying to manipulate me with unnecessary tension. I think the basic premise was suspenseful and dramatic enough, but had several too many ""and now we'll find a way for *another* crazy bad thing to happen"" moments for me. I wish that weren't the case, as I really did want to like it. Assuming you'll ignore this - my only advice is to definitely see it in the theaters, in IMAX if you can.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Heart pounding ridiculous!,"Mr. Alfonso Cuarón, you gotta be kidding me man! Next time have a warning written on the posters saying ""It could give you 'Gravity' level experience"" for people who don't want to be dumbfounded when they come out of the theater. I mean what was the point of me buying recliners for my entire family when you just had to make us sit on the edge of our seats most of the time? How many months were you in space with Tim to know how to make the viewers experience extreme thrills? I hadn't imagined the risks of being an astronaut who needs to repair satellite systems in space, until I watched your movie. I'm actually short of words to express the amazing visuals you've put up behind the characters. It almost seems a billion-dollar project accounting in what NASA must've spent to help you make a film out there 'Gravity' is next to the real experience of being an astronaut which will literally take your breath away! It's a brave new height of quality created by an artist who apart from doing all the research, seems to have probably fantasized of being in outer space a lot. Normally when people watch effects taking place in a scene, they can probably figure out what could really be happening, like ropes, computer graphics, chrome screen, etc. you know. But you'll be so lost in the magnifique of the relative background that the next thing you know you'll be catching your breath after the scene's already happened and you won't have time to think of anything else in the world later. It won't give you goosebumps or the chills in your spine but the intensity of the 'silence' itself will reach out to grab you like you really have to be there and then at the same time you're gonna experience ""A hell of a ride"". Not to mention the music is a tool in this movie that's going to affect your shock for worse! If you know how many categories of academy awards are there, let's just say that I won't be surprised if these guys sweep out half of them. Alfonso Cuarón, Tim Webber, Emmanuel Lubezki, Steven Price, you guys have my standing ovation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Realistic Until You Think Unbelievable!,"The best drama I've seen this year is Mud and I'd say that the best sci-fi this year would have to be Gravity. I make that analogy because these are really pure manifestations of my understanding of drama and sci-fi genres respectively.Also, seeing this movie in 3D was the first time that I was not completely distracted. It reminded me more of stereo documentary footage in Los Angeles where the Endeavor space shuttle resides. Wonderfully realistic until you finish watching the whole thing and think about the storyline.You think: This is all unbelievable! None of this could have really happened. -But you fooled me the whole way.Lastly, Sandra Bullock gives a beautiful performance. There are so many scenes I love. It's not about the dialogue because it's predictable and simple. Its just about the choreography and performance. A perfect duet between Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. I love them both.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Incredible,"This has become one of my favourite movies. Everyone would say prior to the release it was a stupid concept and that no one would see this film. The moment i saw the trailer i knew that it could scrape in some well deserved Academy Awards. But then i saw Gravity and it blew me away entirely. The fact it made so much money as it did was also quite a shock, but it was well earned. Just from watching a few scenes one can realize how much work that was really put in to this project. The day the Oscar nominations were announced and Gravity came out with 10 i also knew that this was a well deserved achievement. If anyone who saw the 86th Oscars and thought gravity didn't deserve these awards, watch the film before you pass judgement. It takes you to a new place in life and is just impressive in every single way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely unique and spellbinding.,"I noticed that one reviewer gave this film a score of 1. I just don't get this, as ""Gravity"" is one of the most creative and visually striking films I've ever seen. The only film that reminds me of it, somewhat, is ""Avatar""--where an entire world is created digitally--much like in ""Gravity"". However, ""Gravity"" is very much unlike ""Avatar"" is most every other way and represents an interesting 'what if' scenario in this near-future sci-fi film.The date in which the film is set is uncertain but is sometime in the near future. In this near future, the International Space Station is still in use, the Chinese Space Station is up and running and the Americans once again have a shuttle program.The film begins with an American space mission in progress. A scientist (Sandra Bullock) is working on fixing her pet space project while being overseen by an experienced astronaut (George Clooney). Without warning, a series of explosions emanating from a Russian satellite create a chain effect--launching space debris everywhere and destroying the shuttle and severely damaging the two nearby space stations. Unfortunately, at this point only the two astronauts are left alive--but not for long unless truly extraordinary events take place that allow them to return to Earth.I was worried that I'd find the film boring. After all, 13 minutes into the movie, you are left with two living characters--and you see no others for the duration of the film. Yet, inexplicably, the script and direction keep the film from being dull. There are no lulls--and the action and acting really work well together and suck you into the film. I have rarely felt as tense as I did as I watched the movie and many times I found myself moving about in my seat along with the action.Technically, the film was amazing. Using the actors' faces, a CG world was created that looked real. You really felt that it was filmed in space and the physics were really awesome. I rarely use words like 'awesome' or 'amazing' in my reviews--but this IS the only way to describe the technical prowess of the film. While I am sure physicists and rocket scientists could spot a few flaws here and there, the film makes it all seem so plausible and real that I cannot help but admire and love the film.Do yourself a favor--see this film and try to see it on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great CGI...that's it...,"Gravity is possibly the most overrated movie I've watched in recent years. Yes it has great CGI, the visuals are stunning, but I think I payed for a movie...This has absolutely no plot, no character development, no story...And an Oscar nomination for Sandra Bullock to look scared and breath heavily...are you serious?! The above is fair warning to those, like me, who think that are going to watch a movie...You're going to watch something that would be a great space documentary. If you wanna be blow away with stunning visuals this is for you. The best CGI I've seen to this day, the attention to detail in every little thing and it really takes you somewhere if you watch it in 3D it looks like you're in the middle of the action. That being said, it is an experience, but not a movie experience. It would be something to try in Disneyland or some amusement park, because it is a ride...It's just not a movie. It is impossible for me to spoil it, because it has no plot to spoil, I can't tell you anything you don't already know going in. I give it a 6/10, because I kinda enjoyed the ride, and it deserves credit for its visuals, but this is, by far, 2013 most overrated movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the best,"One of the best movies i've seen in a long time. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and continuously amazes you with some of the most beautiful and stunning sights and visual effects you have ever seen. I do prefer that you watch it if full 1080p / HD quality. Definitely one of the most visually stunning movies in the world. Some people say that there is ""Bad Science"" and I disagree. I believe that only at a couple of parts in the movie, the laws of physics is completely off. If you get a chance to watch Gravity, do it, especially if you see it in 3D (even if you usually hate 3D, believe me, it's worth it). Alfonso Cuarón has outdone himself with this film, it's definitely a must see film. I give this movie 9 because I believe that the story could be a little better. But it is amazing the way it is. Also the special and visual effects are amazing. I definitely recommend that you watch this movie at least 2-3 times before you die.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Less Than Perfect, But Visually Stunning","A medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) and an astronaut (George Clooney) work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.Obviously, this film has garnered the attention and accolades it has because of the special effects and visually stunning design. And there is no arguing that this looks amazing, with or without the IMAX and 3D. Some have called it this year's ""Life of Pi"" or ""Avatar"" and there is plenty of truth to that.Others have been critical of its scientific accuracy, which seems odd. Sure, Bullock is not wearing ""space diapers"" and not everything might have behaved how it would in zero gravity situations. But this is hardly the point. The chances of anyone surviving in this scenario are basically nil, so just accept that it is fiction and give them a little bit of wiggle room to tell the story.As for the story itself, I was not terribly impressed. The themes of isolation, desperation, hopelessness and hope are all good ones, and I have to give them credit for providing a fair range for Bullock's character. Others have pointed out the spiritual symbolism, which I concede was lost on me and may be one reason I think it was not the masterpiece others have said.The praise is near-universal, with critic A. O. Scott saying that the film ""in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them."" How do you top that? James Cameron stated, ""I think it's the best space photography ever done, I think it's the best space film ever done, and it's the movie I've been hungry to see for an awful long time."" Which, coming from the leader of cutting-edge film technology, is the highest of compliments.With regard to the Academy Awards, the film earned ten nominations (tying it with ""American Hustle""), many of which are in the technical categories, and it sincerely deserves to win those awards. Director Alfonso Cuaron, known for his Harry Potter film and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" among others, really went out on a limb here and should be recognized for that. He won the Golden Globe, and I think he deserves the Oscar, too. To helm such a project takes intestinal fortitude few (besides perhaps Cameron) could muster.Bullock as best actress is debatable. Although much was done by computer animation, and thus amounts to more or less voicing a cartoon, the parts she physically appeared in deserve respect and admiration. Bullock stayed in a special mechanical rig for up to ten hours a day, communicating with others only through a headset. That is dedication that was not matched by Amy Adams or Meryl Streep.Best score I could accept, though I do not feel strongly about it one way or the other. Steven Price, at age 36, is a relative newcomer, and it would be nice to see him enter the world of Hans Zimmer and John Williams. But is this his time? Lastly, best picture. And I say no. Much like Ang Lee received best director for ""Life of Pi"" but failed to get best picture, I think the same could be said here. The direction and cinematography are excellent, but is this a film that will resonate in years to come? I have my doubts. The emotional impact simply is not there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A fun ride and an amazing story,"I felt so good after leaving the theater. This movie was so entertaining that I couldn't sit still in anticipation. Yes, there are some scientific errors, but they are so minor that they honestly do not take away from the movie at all. I think people need to list and number all the factual mistakes to make themselves feel smart. It's a movie... Deal with it. I also saw this movie in 3D which really brought to life the special effects. Don't go in with extremely high expectations and don't try to act like a know it all genius.

Truly Magical,"Every once in awhile a movie comes along that reminds you to believe in possibility. 3D film was developed so that visionary filmmakers like Alfonso Cuarón could make movies like Gravity. Quite simply, it is a groundbreaking, jaw-dropping experience of visual beauty and vicarious terror that leaves you breathless.What I liked: This is not the transcendent wonder of Kubrick's 2001. This is a physical and visual encounter with cinema. For the record, I love 3D movies but not for the sake of it. I enjoy new ideas being translated through a relatively new facet of technology. Gravity left me feeling as though I knew what it would be like in space and that is no small feat. Cuarón and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have given us a visual story that previously was beyond my imaginative scope. Just brilliant.What I didn't like: As with most ground breaking films, what Cuarón was trying to accomplish cinematically overshadowed character and dialogue. This is a rare exception where it's okay with me. The movie is not about Bullocks' back story. The movie is entirely in the moment and succeeds as such. Bullock and Clooney are commendable and convincing but their familiar faces within this magical moment of experiencing something new in film, for me, was almost distracting – or a disappointing reminder that it was just a movie.http://canyoutellastory.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/gravity-2013/",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Visually spectacular... but that's it.,"This film is over-hyped.. I'm not saying it's poor, I just think it's not as good as you're led to believe.First the good things:Visually, it's one of the most stunning things I've ever seen - you have to see this in 3D, it's the ultimate 3D movie as they're in space and everything is floating all the time and it's simply stunning.The director did an exceptional job - you really feel as if you are in space. The clever switches from third to first person is excellent and I have to commend this - especially with the 3D, I really can't stress how much of a stunning spectacle it is.NOW, HERE'S THE PROBLEM: The stunning visuals mask a poor and unrealistic storyline. The characters are predictable, and some of their actions are baffling, and the ending is just utterly predictable. I don't want to spoil the film, but I just couldn't relate to the storyline.3D VISUALS: 9.8/10 Storyline: 3.6/10to conclude; it's a wonderful spectacle and the 3D is so stunning it allows you to zone out of the boring storyline - but this is a film I will never watch in 2D.

Art!,"Alfonso Cuarón has a way of hooking into the viewer emotionally and he did so again with this film. The movie was gripping, suspenseful and expressive. I felt as if I was right there with Bullock, going through everything that she was going through. The scenery throughout the film was so stunning and overwhelming that I almost felt unworthy of watching it. I'm not an astronaut or scientist so I can't comment on how accurate the depiction of space was but I sure did appreciate the visuals.I was hooked, I was scared, I cried, I laughed and I questioned what I could do to make my life better. This is the effect watching this film had on me. Alfonso Cuarón doesn't just direct movies. He creates art, like a painting. And any good painting incites emotion. So that's what watching his films does to me. This movie was definitely a 10 from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not flawless but stunning!,"""You have to see this movie on the big screen otherwise it's boring and non-satisfying!"" In my opinion that's just nonsense. Of course the experience is better but even though I didn't get the chance to see it in theater I was still stunned when I saw it at home for the first time. First of all let's get to the overall plot: A team of astronauts are out in space to repair the Hubble telescope when a Russian satellite is getting hit by a rocket and now wreckage of this satellite is about to collide with them. After that the only goal of everyone who survived this accident is to get back to earth alive. Gravity isn't a Science Fiction movie, it's more of a nerve-racking thriller. The main characters are played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney who both do an excellent job but this flick isn't outstanding because of the great acting or the story, it's the superior technical level this movie is on. Whether you talk about sound, which of course isn't always around as you are in space, so the most of the time you just listen to the powerful soundtrack, the impressive visuals when thousands of pieces of metal fly by you, or just the camera movement by Emmanuel Lubezki who won several Oscars for a good reason. In the first few minutes you get to see a very long shot which really involves you into the catastrophic events. Even when you are just at home lying on your couch you feel sick in the stomach when crew-members are tumbling around. It's really rare that I can feel for the characters that much as in Gravity, which gets supported by POV (point of view) shots here and there. That's why I don't get why a lot of people are complaining about this movie being boring, as he doesn't let you breathe a lot during the short run-time of 91 minutes. The only concern I got with the film is a very cliché turning point within the movie, but I don't want to spoil things here so I'll just leave you with that. This aspect gets easily dubbed by all the other great things I mentioned. In the end Gravity isn't just a movie, it's more of an experience you should witness. Don't get turned off by people complaining about watching the movie at home although a big TV and some good headphones or a surround system are recommendable. Overall it's not perfect but definitely worth a watch!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Gravity in a Word: ""Captivating""","Gravity is the latest in science fiction feature films, a thriller directed by Alfonso Cuarón that will have your heart racing and your breath held for most of the film. Gravity toys with your emotions from minute one, juxtaposing the beauty and serenity of space with its impending danger and destruction.The film stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and tells the story of two astronauts and their fight to get back to Earth after the destruction of their space shuttle. Bullock plays the role of Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first expedition to space with Matt Kowalski, played by Clooney, a veteran and the more experienced of the two. Bullock's acting is wonderful, as she shared strong and true emotions with the audience despite the fact that for most of the film, she only has herself or Matt (a man her character isn't very well acquainted with) to talk to.What set this film apart are the special effects. With a budget of $100 million, about 80 per cent of the production was done in CG (more than James Cameron's Avatar) to create a visually stunning film. Viewing the beauty of Planet Earth from space is what captivates you for most of the film, with the help of 3D technology designed and added in post- production under the supervision of Chris Parks, giving an amazing depth to the film. The work producers put into bringing space to life is phenomenal — not to mention the light box, with over 4,000 LED bulbs that had to be created (invented, even) to film the actors' faces inside their astronaut helmets.Gravity shares similarities with traditional tales of determination to return home and survival. The Odyssey and Castaway come to mind. But in space, this narrative takes on a new perspective. The theme of perseverance is written all over this movie, with Stone questioning her ability to keep fighting — to look death in the face and either go on or give up. This is a story about going against all odds when the entire universe is against you.There are several hints of a rebirth theme as well, with the astronauts hanging from the space shuttle with their lifelines like fetuses with their umbilical cords. Look out for the scene partway through the film with Bullock floating in a C-shape fetal position, and remember the way astronauts have to relearn to walk and gain strength in their muscles upon returning to Earth, like a child. All these instances suggest a Kubrick-like interest in demonstrating the evolution and vulnerability of human life, united with the scenes of confronting death.Gravity is at the top of the list where the Oscars are concerned, with ten nominations (tied for the lead with American Hustle), including a nomination for Best Picture. Even astronaut Buzz Aldrin gave the film positive reviews, and he told the Hollywood Reporter that he's happy Gravity was made and hopes it will ""stimulate the public"" to encourage advancements in space technology. I think with a movie like this — and all the recent press from Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield — we're taking one small step in the right direction.http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/gravity-movie-captivating",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Fabulous Visuals, Substandard Plot","Gravity is a film with fabulous visuals strung together over an appallingly substandard plot of clichés and director-indulgent moments. Yet again Hollywood has wasted millions on great CGI without bothering with decent writing. Part of Gravity's $100 million budget was surely spent on paying marketers to front-load sites like IMDb with 10-star reviews. It's a trick that works. But if you want to know what moviegoers really think of a film, wait until it's been out a couple of weeks, THEN check the user reviews – you'll get a more accurate picture of how good or bad the film is. I give Gravity a 6.Sandra Bullock seems like a great person, the kind of cool, smart chick you'd like to hang out with, whose pleasing combination of poise and humility makes her fun to watch in feel-good movies like Miss Congeniality. Unfortunately, Sandra Bullock is not a great actor. In Gravity she plays protagonist Ryan Stone, the focal point of the movie, practically the only character. Given Gravity's extremely weak story, the film REALLY needed an amazing actress to play the part of Ryan Stone. A stronger actor like Charlize Theron or Jessica Chastain might have been able to bring much more to this role to help fill out the weak plot with a nuanced and powerful performance. But even a great actress couldn't turn Gravity into a movie that was more than just great CGI.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Simply breathtaking - you cannot get closer to a real spacewalk than this,"I've just returned from a 4DX screening (moving seats, artificial wind, etc.), and my childhood dream has come true: I have spacewalked! I studied to be a physicist, I love sci-fi and I did have an idea about the challenges you face as an astronaut - as space is really hostile towards life (your oxygen running out, pressure to be kept, micrometeorites, lack of gravity and it's consequences). Once I heard about the movie's basic setup, 2 astronauts bound to each other after a space accident, I knew what problems they would be facing: the loneliness, the tiny chance for survival, no room for mistakes, but room for heroics, emotions and sacrifice. I thought it's a fantastic setup for a movie-maker to exploit.Well, let me tell you: I got much more than I expected!The visuals rip you right out of your comfort-zone on Earth, where you always know where up/down/left/right is. The enormous speed differences in flying objects and you, the fact that you can just drift away with nothing to hold on makes you re-think the rules you are used to.I've really loved how the story actually gives a great physics education to the audience about how things are in space, without explicitly saying so (great for kids). All this with such incredible visuals that you simply cannot avoid being IN the suit, IN the story, being thrown around, fearing for YOUR life.Sandra Bullock and George Clooney don't let us down with their acting. Clooney is not one bit less than we are used to, but Bullock, she gives as Oscar-worthy performance. In most scenes she is alone, and has to carry the movie along alone - a demanding task – but she does with such emotional expression that makes this probably her best film.I dare to say there's actually a third actor: Earth itself. You've never seen it's face like this before, in so many colors, during the day and at night, and you get a special rare view of something too - I let you find that out in the theatre...Ladies: even if you are totally uninterested in space-movies, this one will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will give you the emotional catharsis you might expect from a really outstanding movie. Just go.Finally: there's a twist waiting for you at the end, only there you will fully understand the title: Gravity!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Survival Story,I didn't think this movie would be that good with some of the reviews I've seen so I waited until the movie was on HBO. I'm not sure why a lot of people don't like this movie. This was an excellent tale of trying to survive with all the odds against you. This movie draws you in and makes you root for the characters without actually getting in depth to their lives. You don't need to know all about someone in a survival situation because it really doesn't matter what they did in the past. Some things in the movie aren't realistic but its a movie its not real life so I'm OK with it. These are some of the CGI I've seen in a long time. I'm not to sure why there's so many people who dislike this movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

A definite must watch for lovers of good cinematography,"Gravity pulled me back into the world of space stations, astronauts, and dangers of space junk. A world of wonder that I experienced watching recordings from space shuttle missions and Hubble documentaries. And I am happy about it.The main stars are Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), and they are the only people whose living faces we see throughout the movie. What we see are probably the best space visuals in a movie that have been ever part of a non-documentary. The visuals are crisp and steady. A welcome change from all the shaky-cam that we see in the recent cinema.An interesting and refreshing point was proper use of the first-person camera. I felt as if I was looking from inside of the space suit. I felt that strange mix of claustrophobia and agoraphobia that is possible to experience only in the vastness of space while being in this insignificant amount of fabric and tech. These shots were few which made them significant and were well established in the relationship to the surrounding so I knew where I was looking at all times. One of the harder things to achieve in the emptiness of space.The film was perfectly paced for a space movie. Coming into the movie, I was ready for extremely slow space walks, but Cuaróns managed to beat my expectations by introducing welcome highly dynamic scenes to separate off the slower paced ones.The plot was fairly standard, but here again Cuaróns managed to keep it very fresh by giving us one large surprise mid-film. One major problem with the movie was that it did not make me care for Stone which was essential to sink into the movie. Cuaróns made a strange decision to make her a person without family. Meaning that her only motivation to survive was her own survival instinct. But this decision meant that Stone could explore some topics that are available only to people without stronger survival motivations.On a more nit-picky note, what was with that in-your-face symbolism of a womb in the middle of the movie. Either I have not noticed other symbols, or in a film with a very few symbols, there is one that is sticking out and heavily disrupting the flow of the story.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sets the standards for modern cinema,"Gravity at first sight may appear to be an everyday space disaster film, and you would be right. Gravity follows a simple concept, on and paper it may seem a bit tedious in fact. However, what highlights this film as one of the most cinematically perfect films ever made is not its story, but its execution.Visually, Gravity is perfect. The CGI is incredible, and flawless to the eye. It is very beautiful to admire, especially in the opening 17 minute continuous shot which is designed to do nothing but make you admire and immerse yourself into the space 'scene'. During this continuous shot, as you drift around George Clooney in the cosmos it is evident that Cuarón wants you to take a moment and enjoy this scene, before it all goes to hell which it inevitably does. The film is littered with stunning visuals, through the times of calm everyday dialogue and terrifying scenes of peril. Gravity pulls you in and throws you into the scene and with clever camera-work, even you sometimes forget you are sitting in your chair.Gravity has been anticipated for its supposed realism. Although according to the space pros, its far off from being realistic, the everyday film fan could not spot the flaws. The realism in Gravity, such as the lack of sound in space and the non existence of air creates an atmosphere that has never been experienced in film. Watching a spacecraft get torn apart in total silence is like nothing you have ever seen. How Gravity incorporates the idea of realism and the low hope of survival really makes you empathic for characters, and vouch for their survival.Gravity is almost cinematically perfect. No question there. Gravity exists to immerse, entertain and to strike that fear that we all have in space back into us. It creates visuals that have never been witnessed before and it is to date the best film to see in 3D. The acting from Sandra Bullock is outstanding, and she deserves credit and a lot of recognition for her role in this masterpiece along with George Clooney. Gravity sets the standards for modern cinema, and creates an experience that will be hard to beat in years to come. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity Sucks!,"""Life in space is impossible""Acclaimed Director Alfonso Cuaron's much appreciated and raved about ""Gravity"" opens with these 5 words . Ironically, Cuaron goes on to prove that even with a master like him at the helm, it is possible to make a substandard film.It is shocking that Cuaron who is usually known for his memorable characters and gritty portrayal of human relationships has come up with such a marginal script (co scripted with son Jonas) and absolutely no gripping characters.Sample this - Sandra Bullock's Dr Ryan Stone is the last person who deserves to be on any mission forget a critical space mission. Given that she is prone to panic attacks and her first reaction to any situation is negative, chaotic and that of hopelessness. At worst, Dr Stone is a nervous wreck and at best she is following orders without questioning. Old Jungle saying – if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. What in the name of Prometheus is Dr Stone doing in space? Watching Dr Ryan Stone fumble her way through space made me instantly crave for Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) from ""Alien"".George Clooney's mission commander Matt Kowalsky is well, George Clooney, throwing his one liners with panache and being the gorgeous, sexy , funny counterfoil to dim witted, slow and helpless Sandra Bullock.Background score from Steven Price makes sure that we all know in advance when a perilous event is just waiting to happen. Price overwhelms us with the music, instead of intelligently using the loneliness, the vacuum and the deafening silence of space at crucial moments in the movie.With such one-dimensional characters and predictable linear storytelling, Director Alfonso Cuaron's salvation comes from fellow Mexican, old partner and Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki Morgenstern (The Tree of Life, Children of Men, Sleepy Hollow) who shows us in all its glory and fright what it must be to float in space. This is as real as any of us ordinary mortals can come to experiencing space first hand. Lubezki is the shining star of this space misadventure. And it is for his contribution mostly that I award ""Gravity"", 7 out of 10. Otherwise, Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity"" mostly just sucks.My top 3 space movies continue to be ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Contact"" and ""Apollo 13"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A visually stunning thrill ride,This film serves up an experience no other has achieved: it takes you into space with such effect that you believe you are there alongside the protagonists. Then it adds amazing special affects as everything that makes space somewhere that a human can survive is obliterated in spectacular fashion. You cannot take your eyes off the screen.Some have criticised a lack of plot. I disagree. Here is the most elemental plot of all: survival against all the odds. Here is the deepest human question: the value of life.I forgot to breathe as I watched this. Amazing.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The effects are unbelievable, but so is the script.","Astronauts Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Matt (George Clooney) are stranded in space after a freak accident.There that's the story out of the way, now let's concentrate on the real reasons why this film is being heaped with praise: the spectacular special effects and awesome 3D.With every shot of Gravity begging the question 'how the hell did they do that?' and some really great use of the latest 3D technology, this big budget special effects extravaganza is a sumptuous feast for the eyes from the very first frame to the absolute last, director Alfonso Cuarón pulling off feats of visual trickery even more unbelievable than Ryan's ability to survive the film's repeated disasters.If you're able to ignore the script's sillier moments and some glaring scientific plot-holes, Gravity should prove to be a stellar experience; if you're looking for something resembling a great story, or have an particular interest in space exploration, prepare yourself for the possibility of crash and burn.7/10 purely for the visuals.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

I was really impressed by Sandra's acting, she was great, and the detail of the story, I was amazed. When I watch the movie, I feel like I'm in the real universe. And the best thing about this movie, the music. I will give a huge round of applause to the music of this movie. Too emotional.

"As ""science fiction"", Alfonso Cuarón presents us with an epic, that is, a work strongly rooted in reality, which at certain times works almost like a documentary","In ""Gravity"", the fear doesn't come from an alien. In the plot, astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is on a mission to repair the Hubble telescope along with doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who is making her first flight. This introduction shows the astronauts exchanging minor conversations with the mission control center in Houston (voiced by Ed Harris, who here almost reprises his role from Apollo 13). Suddenly, the astronauts are surprised by a warning to interrupt the mission due to a shower of debris resulting from the destruction of a satellite by a Russian missile. The wreckage of the satellite, thrown into outer space, is on a collision course for the astronauts, who are soon hit. Ryan is thrown and wanders lost through space until Matt, who here looks more like a western cowboy for his lines and behavior, manages to lasso the character of Bullock. Together, the two need to make their way to the international space station to try to get back home. It is clear that midway through the journey there will be a lack of oxygen, the wreckage will hit the duo again and everything will seem to conspire against the two.The successes of the films undeniably account for the technical part. It is impossible not to be surprised by the visual form found by director Alfonso Cuarón (from the excellent And Your Mother Too, from 2001) to narrate the drama of astronauts lost in space. Cameras use and abuse, in the best possible way, different angles capable of impressing. Hardly has the Earth seen from space been so beautifully portrayed as here. The film is the sum of extremely tense long-shots, almost no dialogue and no sound other than diegetic sounds and a parsimonious but potent soundtrack by Steven Price, which blends into the images exquisitely, starting with the deafening opening made solely to enhance the silence that follows. Cuarón, who also co-wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas and worked on the perfect montage with Mark Sanger, created a simple, even basic, but visceral story of survival told through long, blunt takes of a technical brilliance that has long been unheard of. Sees and which they mimic while swallowing Cuarón's own sequence-shots in ""Children of Men"".As ""science fiction"", the director presents us with an epic of the so-called hard science, that is, a work strongly rooted in reality, which at certain times works almost like a documentary. There is Kowalksi's ""flying backpack"", the space shuttle, the Hubble telescope, the International Space Station and a Chinese space station which, if it doesn't already exist, has concrete plans to be launched in the very near future. The dialogues are all functional and reveal procedures that may well be the exact replica of what would happen in such a situation. They are expository to a certain extent, but organic at all times. The effects of gravity on bodies and objects impress anyone and become an essential part of the narrative. If in 2001 we had velcro shoes to prevent the stewardess from floating on the PanAm ship, in Gravity we see the details of space suits and how liquids - and fire too! - behave in a vacuum without gravity. And what we see before our eyes is so impressive that even Buzz Aldrin, the second man to step on the Moon, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, gave his seal to the film, making it clear that what we see is really what happens. It is exactly because it is a reproduction of the reality that exists today that Gravity is not an example of the science fiction genre, but a thriller that takes place in space.And to accomplish all of this, of course, there is a heavy reliance on CGI special effects tape. But this dependency, here, is extremely positive, as it is these effects that allow Cuarón's camera to walk wherever it walks without cuts, to present unusual angles and to observe a breathtaking visual. Nothing seems out of place. Nothing feels fake, over the top, or less than it would if Cuarón had shot Gravity on location. It's the massive use of CGI the way every director should use it: to tell the story he organically wants. From spectacular scenes of destruction to small details like Ryan's tears floating out of her eyes, the camera panning in and out of the astronaut's helmet, and ice forming on the capsule hatch, the special effects mesmerize and captivate, creating a believable, logical and cohesive universe.In outdoor scenes, in open space, 3D allows a depth of field that is sometimes beautiful, enhancing the natural landscape that is Earth and sometimes terrifying, by making us stay attentive and close to several layers of the film: the astronauts in the foreground, others further down, and even the space shuttle, all under attack from satellite debris. In interior scenes, inside escape pods and space stations, 3D enhances the claustrophobia of these places, making us closely follow the confined space and suffer along with the actors. And this is all thanks to the excellent work of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, Cuarón's partner in ""Children of Men"" and Terrence Malick in ""The Tree of Life"". Knowing how to use extremely wide shots that easily pass into more closed shots, reaching extreme close-ups, Lubezki and Cuarón bring out the beauty and danger of space and Dr. Ryan Stone.Seeking to create a narrative that grants as much respect to the word ""scientific"" as the one devoted to ""fiction"", the film avoids the absurdly common mistake of bringing disasters into space resulting in explosions and bangs, which makes the destruction portrayed in ""Gravity"" even more impactful for occurring in silence and in a brutal way. So, most of the time, the diegetic sounds that accompany actions are just those the characters would actually hear under similar circumstances: the voices of each other and the command in Houston, and, of course, the heavy breathing inside the helmet. And if the genre's standard and expository dialogues are, in a way, the weakest point of the production, they at least serve to give some necessary humanity - even artificial - to the central duo through their interactions and personal reports. With this, we perceive the security of the experienced Kowalski and the fear of his colleague, who, in addition to the frightening situation in which she finds herself, is still surrendered to past traumas that can serve as motivating or discouraging elements, depending on the moment.Sandra Bullock, who during half of the film only appears with her face and, even so, inside a huge astronaut's helmet, gives an acting show, in a much more natural and convincing role than the one that won her the Oscar in 2010, for ""The Blind Side"". She achieves an enormous amplitude, even limited to the medium in which she is changing from a straight scientist to an astronaut adrift, the tortured mother and the heroine of an action movie without ceasing to be perfectly believable for even a second. George Clooney does what he has to do efficiently, but the nature of his role is very different from that of Bullock, so his participation is more allegorical and self-conscious, again thanks to the clever script that knows how to joke with the actor himself.But don't expect an intricate story, as already mentioned above. Cuarón and his son wrote a basic adventure, where the heroes have to get from point A to point B and so on, with a light layer of personal drama so that we can identify with the characters. Enemies are space debris and space itself, not villainous humans or space monsters. And we have to accept, in a way, certain ""lucks"" that the characters have throughout the plot, but nothing that is not part of the necessary suspension of disbelief that, although Cuarón demands a little more from us than usual, he makes up for it by literally catapulting us into the action to the point of leaving us breathless along with Dr. Ryan and allow us relief in the already classic new version of the ""space womb"" from 2001.Gravity falls into the commonplace of films typically made in Hollywood to win Oscars: that of working with human beings overcoming problems that are apparently without solutions, but that after much suffering, these people manage to achieve victory. All this drama is deposited in the character of Sandra Bullock. To begin with, her daughter died when she was four years old and that's why the girl's life no longer seems to have any meaning. She soon gives up the fight until George Clooney's character takes on the role of saving her with strong words and catchphrases. So ""Gravity"" is much closer to movies like ""Wall Street"" and ""Jerry Maguire"". Does this make production bad? Not necessarily, after all, the look makes up for the flaws. It's just a shame to see a production with so many successes not going beyond a mediated script. In this aspect, the film becomes predictable and from a certain point, Ryan's destiny already seems clearly traced. Ryan's overcoming is perceived in each scene. At the end of the film, the camera, which before was shaky when showing Ryan, changes and starts to focus from the bottom up, now showing a confident, determined woman, like a good American, willing to survive.In 1968, Stanley Kubrick released ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"", based on similar principles seen in ""Gravity"": a stunning look and a particular plot, eternalizing in the history of Cinema. More recently, in 2009, Duncan Jones brought back the space theme and made the fantastic ""Lunar"", which unfortunately went unnoticed by the mainstream media. Even without the originality of the proposal (not least because we are talking about Hollywood), it is undeniable that Cuarón also leaves his mark on contemporary science fiction with one of the best films of 2013.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Movie Experience,"This movie is absolutely stunning from start to finish, I can't remember ever being pulled into a film so completely and thoroughly, and I don't think I've seen a more beautiful scenery of outer space, both great performances by Sandra Bullock and Clooney makes them believable. Gravity goes down as one of the best cinematography ever to see on the big screen. So, for this being one of the best movies of the year, with over the edge sitting seats, and for Alfonso Cuaron delivering just a great experience to the movie screen and just delivering one of the best scenary of space, I give "" Gravity "" 8 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A disappointment,"This film is over-hyped and definitely not the best space film ever made. The plot is centered around two astronauts who become stranded when their satellite is hit by debris. The film follows their attempts to survive and get back to Earth. While on paper the premise is solid the film is hampered by problems that leaves the viewer with a sense of mediocrity.The biggest issue I have with Gravity is repetition. While the first 10 minutes may be entertaining, the film goes around in circles from there on. I'll be hard pressed to encounter a science fiction fan who doesn't find the plot predictable and shallow. Furthermore the dialogue is bland and whilst Cuaron desperately tries to give the film emotional depth, a forced performance from Bullock and poor writing leave the viewer feeling nothing.Perhaps the film's one redeeming factor is the technical work to create the impression of space. Never before has Earth looked so real. Also the audio was used to good effect to create tension and boost the action sequences.Despite the technical triumph I still left the cinema feeling average. No matter how pretty space looks, it cannot redeem the story or the failure to connect with the audience on an emotional level.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great Survival Film,"""Gravity"" is one of those movies that I don't really think about that often when thinking of the ""great movies"", but when reminded of it, it is looked back upon with fondness. Absolutely breathtaking special effects that still look very good almost a decade later. Everything about this movie on a technical level is just sheer genius. Visuals, sound design, cinematography. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock also give great performances. The story is pretty simple and I'll admit there were a few lines of dialogue that came off a little goofy. I liked the survival aspect of it and there was some interesting imagery here with Bullock's character floating in space like a fetus, the shot mimicking human evolution toward the end of the film. Deep themes of fate and Murphy's Law.Check it out and watch it on the biggest screen you have, if you have a nice home theater set up you'll really enjoy this with the surround sound turned up and on a high resolution screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good movie but flawed physics,"The movie is a treat for the senses in every way. Visual, auditory, and fairly exciting. I enjoyed the movie (seen in 3D) and rank it fairly high in terms of good science fiction.**SPOILER** **SPOILER** An issue I have is with one aspect of the movie that ignores the laws of physics, yet this aspect becomes a plot point from which all else follows. I'm guessing many (most?) won't know, notice, care about this - but those of us with a science background will catch it immediately.When Bullock and Clooney overshoot the ISS and Bullock gets entangled in the Soyuz parachute cord, Clooney (still tethered to Bullock) zips by but then, as the tether reaches its max length, he is jerked to a halt. The reality is this would have triggered a shift in momentum back along the vector he was traveling - he would have ""bounced"" as it were and been pushed back towards Bullock. End of story, so the writers ignored this (see Newton's Laws). Even if the event portrayed was accurate, we clearly see that all of Clooney's momentum has been negated. So at that point, both Bullock and Clooney have zero momentum (relative to each other, relative to the ISS). At that point - Bullock could have grabbed the parachute line and pulled (momentum towards the ISS would be the result) or could have grabbed the tether and pulled Clooney towards her or Clooney might have been able to get out of the jetpack, give it a good push away from himself, and once again be pushed towards Bullock as he gained momentum in the opposite direction. In all cases - the 2 could have easily made it to the ISS. It would have been a better story in my opinion - killing off Clooney was just a plot device to give Sandra an ""all alone"" aspect.There are several other flaws in how physics is ignored in the movie - but they are much more technical and it is a movie after all. Most would not notice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Grand Elevation,"Gravity doesn't seem like a big epic film like what most Sci-Fi pictures are treated today. The concept is quite simple, but despite of being simple, it's surprisingly more of a rewarding experience than you would expect. The real idea of the film is to portray how nature can bring both wonder and danger within the universe. The movie takes place in space, but there's definitely no alien twists to consider, because gravity and physics themselves are already their enemy, and all you have to do is to take its ride like you've never seen space before. The genius of the film is just being simple, but what's extraordinary is how it elevates the use of CGI and a direction giving us a good amount of suspense we need for a space thriller. Gravity is a cinematic experience that anyone shouldn't miss.The plot is indeed straightforward, in spite of some scenes when the astronauts' are talking about their personal lives. The rest is all amazingly put together set pieces where danger can happen anytime and anywhere; it can be a struggle by the difficult movement in space, satellite debris destroying anything that passes, or just losing oxygen. Watching these characters trying survive the disaster going on is technically the only plot here, and how the film realized these incidents is astounding. I think the most memorable feat is whenever a soundless destruction occurs as the music score's beat replaces the clash. But really, most of the time is built in tension, and while everything is supposed to look terrifying, it also looks quite spectacular.But it's not always about the the terror, the film is already remarkably stunning, with the marvelous perspectives that the camera picks. Most of its shots linger as it flies around from people to people and place to place, and it rarely shifts angles until it actually needed to. This brilliant camera-work makes you feel like you're part of the ride, which is pretty obvious for a film like this. Big budgeted CGI is usually used for blockbusters to impress the audience how cool the movie looks, but this is one of those that is able to be both cool, and electrifying. Looking at planet Earth is indeed a breathtaking view that may give you goosebumps, until an equally spellbinding peril happens up there. It, of course, had some human elements, but it works better in the exhaustion and longing of the characters' situation than the drama they make about their backstories. The performances makes it all easy to relate, if not nuanced. This is, most of the time, Sandra Bullock's show, and she controls the role decently. And George Clooney is always likable in any of his scenes.Gravity is a magnificent achievement. It can also be an alternative to the genre in a while since Sci-Fi is recently (or has always been) taken over by epics with aliens and giant robots or whatever, but never forget what's scarier than those myths, simply just how force of nature works. This review probably sounds too hyperbolic that some might expand their expectations. One thing people should know about Gravity is it's a very simple film with a very simple story and concept, but by Alfonso Cuarón's strong ambition, all of its elements are perfectly fit together. As a result, an experience that may stuck in your memory for a long time. Gravity is easily one of the best films of the year, and again it should be seen in theaters, either 3D or not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity is an experience,"The first image in Gravity is a space shuttle slowly floating towards us. Of course, in actuality, the space shuttle is moving incredibly fast but speed seems relative in space. On the space shuttle is Ryan Stone, a medical engineer, Matt Kowalski and Shariff, both astronauts. They are installing a new system to better view the universe, I think, something like that. It really doesn't matter because in a few minutes the space shuttle is going to get hit by debris, sending the story off. A story about a character's will to survive in the most hostile environment most people will never know. That's the story. Most of the dialogue in the film is very situational based. Except for one scene when one of the characters divulges a rather traumatic event in their life. But the film could be completely silent, for the movie goes far beyond story.In space sound can't travel, a point that is made in many films involving scenes in space. However, most films that contain scenes in space ignore this and when a ship explodes we hear it explode. When a person opens a door in space, we hear the door. To Alfonso Cuarón's credit, he does not shy away from the terrifying silence of space. In moments of sheer terror, the audience is left in the quiet. Most of these moments are filled with musical score, but they would be just as effective without as well. I found myself sometimes wanting to scream in frustration at the characters on screen in these tense moments. But I didn't need to. In the silence, I found the sound of the audience in the theater, yelling at the characters for me.Most films that employ visual effects, the effects are noticeable. What I mean by that is, when watching an action film, you can tell when a real object shot by a camera has turned into a CG object. No matter how good CG gets, this fact will probably always be true. Space is an interesting place to portray using visual effects. Space is not a place many of us will ever go in our lives. It is a place filled with mystery. It is the most terrible and yet the most awe inspiring place. And the visual effects in Gravity portray space and the events that unfold in it brilliantly. I could not see the filmmaking. I had no idea how they filmed it, I would imagine mostly in front of a green screen, but I just couldn't tell. I thought I was in space. I was completely engrossed. On a side note, I did not feel that the IMAX or the 3D improved the viewing experience. When watched again (yes I have already watched it twice now) in a normal 2D theater, the film was just as breathtaking and exhilarating.Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are great at playing their prospective roles. The cinematographer is dazzling. I felt as though the cuts were non-existent. I was never aware of an edit, almost as if the entire film consisted of one continuous shot. All the elements of the film came together perfectly to make this movie and to serve the story. But as I said before, Gravity goes far beyond just a simple story. It is an experience.I truly believe that any film sets up its own expectations for the audience, as to what kind of film it will be, and what the ultimate conclusion should be. Every movie has a beginning, and they all should have a feeling of barreling to the end. And once we get to the end of a great film, there is a feeling that that ending was always going to be the ending. The story was chaotic and out of control as it raced to this end, and it was destined to be this way although perhaps I have a more romantic view of film than most normal people do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Astonishing, Technically Brilliant and Very Moving","I saw ""Gravity"" on opening weekend, and was so overwhelmed by the visuals that I went a second time on the same weekend to absorb the rest of the film once the novelty of the visuals had worn off. I wish I had posted my comments then, because now that it's become a phenomenon, my review is just so much white noise, and to those who are determined to hate ""Gravity"" because it's so popular, I'll be easy to dismiss as just one more lemming.But I did love ""Gravity."" I thought it was an absolutely beautiful movie, a story about loss, grief and rekindled hope disguised as a simple space survival story. It affected me very deeply and moved me to tears a few times, sometimes through the strength of its message, sometimes through the wonderful performance of Sandra Bullock, and at other times from the sheer visual beauty of the film. I can understand why others wouldn't be moved by the film (one of the things I love most about cinema is the subjective reactions audiences have to it), but I can't believe that anyone who purports to love movies won't at least acknowledge the sheer technical filmmaking mastery on display in this movie.Alfonso Cuaron has vaulted to the top of my list of favorite directors on the strength of this and ""Children of Men,"" another of his films that slugged me with an emotional punch to the gut. He's the rare director who can make us marvel at the technical achievements he's putting up on the screen even while he's touching us deeply with an emotional connection. In that way, he's a much less maudlin and sentimental version of Steven Spielberg.I'm almost disappointed that ""Gravity"" has become so popular, because it's the kind of movie I responded very personally to, and now it's going to be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and all we'll hear about between now and February of 2014 is how it doesn't deserve all of its acclaim.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
You end up counting your breath!!!,"When I first saw the trailer of GRAVITY, there was just one thought that was running in my mind; I am not going to miss this movie at any cost. Well, and I did keep my word and finally today I went and watched the much awaited movie of the year (at least for me it was). For people who think that a movie should have an ensemble cast, try this one! You are sure to be in short of words and you are sure to redefine cinema. GRAVITY begins with the magnificent and the breathtaking (literally) view of the mind boggling space that we have seen only on NASA footage and other documentaries. The view positively gives you the wish to join a space research organization. The silence will make you fall in love with it and the darkness will make you fall in love with the loneliness. You are introduced to Matt (George Clooney), Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Shariff (Phaldut Sharma) physically. As an Indian I also liked the Hindi song Shariff hums for a moment.It is all going well until a Russian missile gets released and the entire mission and their Hubble Telescope are hit and thrashed into pieces. Will all the three survive? Do they have a way for survival when the three are not even etched to each other? Will Ryan make it when her oxygen levels are falling rapidly?GRAVITY is surely one of the best movies made in the year. For a common man who does not understand the technical or the scientific aspects of the real astronomical world, this is a real breathtaking adventure. When Sandra Bullock counts each of her breath, we realize the importance of the air and the amount of oxygen we 'take for granted'. When George Clooney says 'sip like a wine and not beer', you are drawn into a reality wherein we realize that we are privileged of many things. As we progress with the film the fact sinks in that there is not much of a conversation in the movie (the script writers have definitely saved some papers regarding that) which makes it even more special. The close up shots take us through the journey of Ryan so closely that we start seeing everything being her. There is not a moment in the movie where you feel drifted away from the story or take your eyes off from the screen.With less dialogues and more to convey through actions, I give it to the entire cast and crew of the movie. And specially take a bow, Alfonso Cuaron, the director of the movie for making this master piece look so real and believable. What shall I say about Sandra Bullock and and George Clooney! Can I put all the affirmative adjectives for their brilliant performances?As I write this I still have a heavy lump in my throat. I am not that much of an emotional person when it comes to movies.

"Great special effects and acting, but unbelievable story","The special effects are very good and you wonder how they shot those space scenes simulating weightlessness. So to appreciate all the cinematography it is worthwhile to watch in 3D.But just two actors no matter how good and talented left something to be desired. Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney act very well but at times the story and the litany of crises seemed too long. And paradoxically some of the ways those problems were overcome by the characters was not realistic.The plot was too unbelievable and the basic story line was weak. Too many dramatic coincidences and narrow escapes. Too many lucky breaks. So if you're looking for great acting and intriguing details of experiences and time spent in space, you'll find this movie worthwhile.

Possibly the most visually incredible film I've seen.,"Five years after its release, I thought it was time to watch it. Seven Oscars which largely were awarded for sounds and visuals, and you can see why, it is a beautiful film, the visuals are jaw dropping, it really is a game changer in terms of sci fi movies.

It is so bleak, that anything that can go wrong does go wrong.Sandra Bullock is great, as is Russell Crowe for the time he's in it.I'm glad I've seen it, I wouldn't rush to watch it again, as it doesn't perhaps have enough content for me personally, but I get why people would deem it a masterpiece.A thrill for the senses, visually sensational. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Dreadful and wonderful,"Through a succession of terrific adventures and incidents after an accident in outer space we follow two astronauts, a man and a woman fighting against adverse conditions resulting of the total absence of gravity in which they move most of the time in open space, floating and sometimes drifting helpless at random The appalling visual scenes are filmed with great mastery and the performers do a great job with special mention of Sandra Bullock. The visual effects are of excellent technical quality. This movie has practically no story or plot since its main theme is made of the astonishing rhythm of dreadful and wonderful scenes that make the viewer to hold his breath most of the time.

I USED TO Dream of Space Travel...,"When I was a little girl, I strongly remember wanting to grow up to be an astronaut. (I know, who hasn't, right?) I have been an avid watcher of as many space travel and sci-fi movies and TV series as I can, and I've even studied a few astrophysics and astronomy books, attempted to go to college. I always, and even up until recently, seriously dreamed of traveling to space myself. Before, it was simply reality, and chronic lifelong illnesses and disability since childhood that had kept me from it. But that changed when I saw 'Gravity'. Upon experiencing the most immersive film I have ever been to, feeling like I also was trapped in space, with my palms sweating, toes curling, heart pounding at the speed of light, and having many breathless moments, it was like being on an hour-long roller coaster ride through space! The best 3D effects I have ever seen, and I am urging EVERYONE I speak to, that if you have even the slightest interest in this movie, anything short of a 3D cinema experience will diminish it too greatly to excuse! You MUST go see this movie in the theater! Trying to watch it at home will ROB YOU OF THE BEST THRILL RIDE OF YOUR LIFE! Upon seeing the terrors, experiencing them myself through this movie, I no longer wish to travel to space! I feel just fine with my feet planted firmly on the ground, than you! At the very least, I thought of NOTHING ELSE while sitting in the theater, and it will help you forget the insanities of our world for a short time.If I could give it 100 stars, it would be a no-brainer! Forget those who chose to nit-pick this cosmic marvel of an experience! If you go to this movie and can think only of the scientific inaccuracies, you should be cast in the TV series 'Big Bang Theory' as Sheldon's long lost Father!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Just a motion picture? No!  The most breathtaking cinematographic experience ever?  Yeaaaaaah!!!,"I can not judge this film just as a motion picture! Because it's something far beyond that. I can only judge it as an ""experience"", for that's what it's been to me! Well, as an experience this ""film"" is just a unique one! It took me several minutes to ""come back"", and the only critic i could then articulate when asked was a very short one: ""I am speechless""! I think the ones who didn't like it (or just declare so) are either too f...ing snobbish, or just sentimentally amputated, or both! For how can this ever be possible for a viewer not to be overwhelmed by that ultimate sentiment of Awe which the unprecedented visual effects and the amazing direction make not only the screen but also everything above, under and all around him over flooded with!? OK, there is not much of a story like the ones we usually watch on screen. ""Gravity"" looks more like a real time report of an incident that takes place within the 90 minutes the film lasts. But it's exactly this supposing ""real time coverage"" of a potentially realistic event that makes the difference, and - through the superb way of telling the story - brings the audience within the core of something nobody has ever experienced before in a movie theater! Anyway, no matter what some narrow hearted may say, ""Gravity"" belongs to that kind of sublime films which make one think ""And now, what is still to see in a movie theater? what may come next worth watching? Are movies a finished story for me, after this one?""! Well,this is its only negative point, if you want to see it this way! But try to be positive! Try not to be mean, and open your hearts for what is yet to come! Hopefully ""Gravity"" is only a short stop, and cinema will soon amaze us even more with another extra ordinary movie like this one!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

"A technical wonder, a visual stunner","James Cameron has called Alfonso Cuaron's GRAVITY ""the greatest space film ever made."" I want to believe he means... ""after 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY,"" although that should be a given, right? Nonetheless, Cuaron's follow-up to his brilliant CHILDREN OF MEN (2006) is another landmark in the sci-fi genre. The premise is simple, but the execution is what makes it a work of art. Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a biomedical engineer from Illinois, and astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), must find a way to survive after an accident leaves them lost in space. The universal themes of survival and resistance (in space!) give room for Cuaron and his troupe to create some of the most beautiful visual effects you'll ever see.As of 10/04/2013, I have seen only 3 films that have used 3D technology to really complement storytelling: Wim Wenders' PINA (2011), Martin Scorsese's HUGO (2011), and GRAVITY. However, even though GRAVITY is just as impressive technically as the aforementioned titles, it is my least favorite of the three because of its lead actors. Clooney is just being Clooney, and although this is the best Bullock has ever been, that hardly means much to me as I think she's a very bland actress. That soulless stare remains there, and I can't help but wonder what someone like Jessica Chastain could have done with this role. In Sandra's defense, I can also say she doesn't compromise the overall quality of the film too much, but she is my major complain about it (there's even an obvious ""Oscar scene"" written just for her).GRAVITY may just fall short of masterpiece level, but it's still a fascinating film for its technical achievements. If the Academy does not recognize the work of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki this time, they never will. Go see it in 3D as it's supposed to be seen, and enjoy the ride.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best 3D movie to date !!,"Went to see this on a XD screen, and was blown away with the visuals and sound. Not even Avatar in 3D was this good (Avatar has aged pretty bad in just 4 years, the characters now look cartoonish). Note that this movie like Avatar in his time were meant to be seen at the theater in 3D. Seeing this type of movies in 2D or at home just makes them average. This is what 3D in cinemas was meant for; only for movies who really justify and enhance the experience, not just to make more money out of sales of 3D tickets. The use of 3D helps you feel the action and emotion in this film; so do yourself a favor and watch GRAVITY in 3D while still in theaters to get the full immersive effect. You're in for an amazing ride!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
¡gracias...Mr Cuaron,"Gravity is the best film I have seen in my life.Right from the opening act, where Clooney's space walking Kowalsky & Bullock's Stone admire the beauty of the Earth from the silence of the space till the final act(I don't want to give it out), this film is an achievement of the highest order. In fact, Gravity is one of those rarest of rare cases, where Cinema takes the form of Art. Not since Avatar or more recently Ang Lee in his Life of Pi, has anyone used 3D so brilliantly that it actually transcends the dimensions of ""make believe"". The music score by Steven Price are to give you goosebumps. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography seamlessly captures the effects & the emotions on the faces of the actors & the results are the best seen in a long long time.Clooney as usual is at his cool avatar but its Bullock who is the star of Gravity. As the lonely mother who has lost her child untimely, & a first timer in space, another catastrophe is too much for her to handle, and Bullock is just brilliant in that. This is where the father son(Jonas Cuaron, what a talented guy!!) screenwriter duo step in. The journey from drifting in space with no one to help you out,hear you out to back home on earth is so masterfully crafted that yes you start rooting for them. But Gravity's ultimate brilliance lies in the fact that while we do root for our space walker/worker duo to come back home,we also think that such a glorious death might just also be just fine.But eventually do they both get back in one piece? Gravity, talks about survival, human willpower & hope like no other film since Danny Boyle's criminally under appreciated 127 Hours. Neil Armstrong had famously said after landing on the moon ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"". Such a thing happens here in Gravity also albeit in a metaphorical manner. I have rated 10/10 stars for Alfanso Cuaron's Gravity. But how do you count the stars in space?? Mr Cuaron...this film of yours is for the history books.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A stunning, game-changing, cinematic achievement.","OK, so I'm supposed to be working right now, but I'm in one of those funky-ass, quasi-writer's-block ruts where I've written one of my characters into a corner, and now can't decide whether to solve the problem or just scrap 8 minutes of screen time.Until I do, here's a few quick thoughts about ""Gravity,"" which my girlfriend and I went and saw on a day date yesterday afternoon. I'm not writing this to be read by anybody, mind you. Rather, it's my attempt to distract myself by writing something entirely unrelated to my script, in the hopes a solution to my problem pops up when I'm not thinking about it. Feel free to adopt this perspective in your own situation the next time your boss tells you you're screwing around. You're welcome.So, Gravity. Yeah. WOW. I suppose the simplest way to sum up this film is to say it is indeed, a truly new experience. In his autobiography, Charlie Chaplin recalled when he first saw Lumière's ""Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat"" (1895), which simply showed a steam engine approaching a station. To him, and millions, it was magic. Such is the case here with what I refer to as director Alfonso Cuaron's cinematic ""Thriller,"" a singular evolution of storytelling that he (or anyone else, for that matter) is exceedingly unlikely to repeat in my lifetime.Story-wise, though, ""Gravity"" is just your typical survival film which has been made aplenty, though, the elements are different in this setting with only a few broken spacecrafts and endless deep space. Survival films like ""Gravity"" are almost like one-off events, something that everyone should see at least once, but don't often stand the test of time. The allure of a movie like ""127 Hours"" was to see how James Franco would cut off his arm, but can anyone remember the rest of the movie? And does anyone care to? Fortunately, ""Gravity"" does have more going for it than most survival films, which primarily, is the various layers of fear: the fear of the unfamiliarity of space, the obvious fear of time, and finally the fear of not just dying but the question of how will your end come? A question I'm dealing with now in this unconscionable bitch of a script I'm trying to finish, I should add.But more importantly, if you're anything like the film homer I am, ""Gravity"" is much more than a formulaic story of survival; it is an exquisite work of visual art. Unlike the 3-D technology so overly-hyped in ""Avatar,"" the fact that the screen is so lacking in clutter and action only serves to immerse you in the film. Such was the promise of 3-D IMAX years ago, finally fulfilled here. The 3-D is so seamless and natural, there were moments when I had to remove my glasses for a moment, if for nothing else than to confirm that yes, a 3-D camera angle of a girl in a lake, shot from water level, is frighteningly realistic.""Frighteningly realistic."" That would also sum up this film, were it not for the fact that a mere moment after walking out of the theater, I was overcome with such emotion, I cried. As of this minute, I still have no concrete explanation for my reaction, except to speculate that while ""Gravity"" is by no means as great a film as ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Casablanca"" or ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (my favorite movie of all time), it is arguably the most beautiful cinematic experience I've ever been fortunate enough to have.One last thing, I promise. Perhaps the most ironic (and tragic?) aspect of Cuaron's game-changing achievement is that part of what makes ""Gravity"" so singularly wonderful is precisely why it isn't likely to find much success once the IMAX well has run dry: I, for one, will never deign to see this film in any venue smaller than six stories. That'd be akin to going to the stadium to see your team play Game 7 of the World Series, only to sit in your car and listen to it on the radio.See this, but only as it was meant to be seen.OK, now back to work before the Hammer comes out here and tears me a new one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A stunning and masterfully directed space drama-thriller.,"I would place Gravity up in the echelons of other space films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Wall-E. I felt gripped from the start and in my opinion, that is one major criteria of excellent cinema.It is beautifully rendered. The visuals are beyond stunning and the 3D is brilliantly executed. So very many films have been utilizing 3D which adds no value to the movie and are completely third rate. This film utilizes the extra dimension in the best way possible, to give the viewer the best possible experience. The beautifully crafted film employs visuals that will leave the viewer stunned, mystified and in awe. To prevent spoiling the film, all i shall say is the visual scenes are grand and brilliant in every way. Cinematography at its finest.However, great visuals only do not a great work of art make. The visual thrills are one of the many sensational aspects in the film. The directing is spot on, masterfully rendered. Visionary if i may say so. The audience is made to feel part of the experience, captured and drawn in as if at that place in time and seeing through the eyes of the characters. The intermingling of a great score and tenderly directed scenes that capture every moment, every emotion and every tiny speck of humanity making this a triumph.A brilliantly thought up story. One would think the story line is redundant and overdone. Others would question the depth of a story such as this. To these people i implore 'WATCH THE MOVIE!'. A story so simple and yet so intense. One which brings together the elements of a great thriller, with surprises at every turn and elements of great drama, a story that taps into the deepest emotions and into the psyche of these characters dissecting their every thought and action. It is a story of hope, courage and strength from the darkest abyss, despair, loss the power of laughter in extreme deadly situations and the power of fear and what it drives us to. It is a story of personal growth and personal development. A true survival tale in the harshest of environments and what keeps us alive. The psychology is explored and its role in life and the pursuit of survival.It is the emotional quotient that drives this film, the masterful direction and masterclass acting by Bullock and Clooney. The sheer craftsmanship of this film by its director and stellar cast make this film excellent in every way. Bullock and Clooney are artists, they bring to life, create these personalities and characters who will leave you in awe.I shall certainly watch it again. And despite the idiot who kept kicking my seat every 2 minutes, even that did not deter my attention. This is a great film. Word of advice: Please do not take little children to this film. I had 2 children sitting a few rows down who were so restless and kept talking the whole way through until a woman stood up to reprimand the parents. The parents received many more complaints.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity as symbolic of new era,"Gravity Gravity is in fact, a beautiful film. What to add if not to write about the special effects, the characters or the plot. And, what about the symbolic aspects of the film which makes it a desirable film to talk and write about. An aspect neglected when talking about the film. The acute use of symbolism starts at the moment after the first catastrophe when George Cloney breaks away from Sandra Bullock in order for her to survive. She enters the Russian Spacelab and takes off her astronaut outfit. After taking off the outfit, she swings her arms upwards to see her body in full extension to a point that before she reaches a foetal form, her extended body shows her legs as if they had become some sort of a mermaid tale. It might seem far-fetched, yet I would advise to take a close look at that scene again. The, she attains the foetal form where one cable looks like the umbilical cord then we are afterwards launched through a narrow corridor which could be the uterus. From that scene on up until her reaching and landing on planet earth, it will be her growing up experience as the tight tunnel in the Spacelab could be a representation of her coming out of the uterus. But, where would this all lead up to? The only flaw I see in regards to the symbolism and that is, and we could ask a question, at what moment does the shift from our reality, that of a space catastrophe which has been the fault of the Russians and their missile launch on American satellites to bring us to a new dimension as we will discover it at the end. The only moment I see is when inside the Spacelab George Cloney comes back, then, she wakes up alone. I believe the Twilight Zone effect starts at this point where the fantasy kicks in to bring to a deeper level of thinking and plot development. Our reality has disappeared for a new one. How can all of this be linked? Near the end of the film, when she crashes in a lake somewhere which could be China since she used the Chinese Spacelab, it is to ask if there are still people on earth. Now, the capsule is flooding with water and like a mother's womb full of water she reaches the surface like a baby getting out of the womb. As we are shown, we see only her head out of the water, a solitary background, and she reaches shore dragging her way out like the first amphibian that populated the earth before the dinosaur era. And, more interesting, it makes the link to the foetal form in the Russian Spacelab and the mermaid effect, with difficulty, she succeeds in standing up. The camera angle filming her legs is for one reason: To show the new era of humans that will originate from her and the male she will seek since she could be viewed as Eve and her future mate Adam the background almost representing the Garden of Eden. What then, is special about her legs? When one observes the camera angle, her left leg is in full view showing her muscled side which demonstrates human training and exercises. However, the right leg which is further back shows a skinny leg which resembles that of an alien leg feature, skinny. In other words, the new era of humans would be half human and half alien due to her prolonged stay in space and experiences. In all, I would say that a film of this nature is very rare and more should be made. I rate this film 9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Does not deserve to even sniff the top 250,"Went to see this the other night with very high expectations, and left highly disappointed. This films graphics and special effects are very beautiful and realistic looking, but that's about all it has going for it. There is virtually no plot, just one person roaming through space with one thing going wrong after another. Apparently, there are a lot of scientific mistakes (none that I saw, because I am ignorant on the subject) so if you're a science stickler, avoid this movie! Overall, if you want to see this movie to experience superb picture and a feeling of being in outer space, it could be a good watch. If you're looking to be entertained and see a top 250 worthy plot, you will leave disappointed, and 10 bucks poorer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Pray that you never get lost in Space!,"I've been writing reviews for movies for so long and movies like Gravity seriously deserve my assessment, after all, it's something that happens in the Space and not on the Earth!! I agree I am late in reviewing this cinematic brilliance and probably more than half of the people who follow my Posts would have already watched the movie by now, and I am really sorry but I had other important things to do in Life, in the last 2 weeks!! Gravity is undeniably the best Space movie made at least after Aliens from the 90s. This movie literally transports you to space in every cinematic way possible. The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if the Movie was actually shot in Space. The storyline which is actually a Space documentary becomes incredibly interesting purely because of the realism through IMAX 3D, the anticipation and suspense the director succeeds to build in every scene, and the great acting by the Hollywood veterans Sandra Bullock and George Clooney and I am sure they already have one of their hands on the Oscar trophy for the next Year!!I would just say that the Movie is a visual masterpiece. Yes I know everything you see on the screen is Fake and has been artificially designed through the CGI, but it never feels artificial and that's primarily because it has been completely shot in Spectacular3D. With 3D, you feel the depth of the Space and experience the movie as though you're right up there!! Please do not miss to watch Gravity in IMAX 3D (and not the regular 3D!!) and pray that you never get lost in Space, and if ever you do, then at least pray that the Satellites don't crash throwing debris towards you and if they do, then pray that the Space Stations are made Fire proof, and that the controls and manuals are printed in English, and if you are lucky till here, then pray that you land on the Land and not in the Water!! The movie deserves 8/10 from me, primarily because that was the closest I could ever get to a Space Craft, the Space Station, and the Space itself and not to mention the fear of being lost with no one around for 'light-years' far and not just miles!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best film of 2013 so far-,"Before this film, in my opinion the greatest special effects of all time were in Avatar. Everything was so realistic, you could see sweat on their faces. This film not only trumps everything that Avatar has brought us, but I really don't see these effects aging for a long, long time. I could be proved wrong, you could see the models in Star Wars, the shark looks like a dummy in Jaws, but this might be different. I am a big fan of Cuarón's style as a director. I love the darker tone that he brings to his films, his point of view shots in his films are flawless. He went all out, he pushed the boundaries for not only what he could do, but what a director can do. Same with the acting. Sandra Bullock gives a great performance as Ryan Stone. If she was any lesser of an actor than the effect that this film had on us, would be lesser. Bullock is one of those actors that you root for every time. She has that charisma, you want her to survive. In my opinion, the most atmospheric and powerful moments of the film is when she is alone. This is a tremendous feat, considering she is in front of a green screen 99% of the time. George Clooney brings a likability to his role, his character was very entertaining and a relief, when the film was at its darkest. This is the movie event of the year so far, no doubt about it. If you haven't seen a film that you enjoyed so far this year, go see this film if you haven't already.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
beautiful cinematography,"The movie goer is transported to a place the vast majority of us will never go. I now have a greater respect for astronauts -besides the technical side of their work - the personal side comes out, and the working with other nations in space. Ryan is the newbie - a medical trained astronaut who is running from a sad event in her life - as she says 'she drives'. With an experienced astronaut they are subjected to a happening that probably could happen. Their dependence on each other and then the training that makes for the rest of the story - they are smart. The best part of the story is the cinematography - the filming is amazing and I admire the director and all who were able to do this film - it is one of the best. Even though there are some things not true - you do believe it when you see it. I have read about this and admire the actors for what they did - I'm sure it was a challenge in many ways. I really liked this file - but with what I consider a really great film, I cannot get it out of my mind for several days. I saw this yesterday and that has not happened with it. But the cinematography did- it is worthy of an Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A jaw-dropping story about the human spirit and the will to survive,"Gravity is a movie about trying to survive an impossible situation, and its filmmakers do something almost as difficult: Create a Hollywood blockbuster that's so original and eye-popping, it causes the collective jaw of jaded moviegoers to drop.This thriller about two astronauts stranded after a disaster in space is so harrowing, because its visuals are so believable. It's the rare movie where the effects are so convincing; you forget they are effects at all.In this day and age when every DVD seems to come with a whole batch of behind-the-scenes documentaries, most savvy moviegoers can spot the tricks of the trade and know how most cinematic illusions are achieved. So, it's enormously refreshing to watch a movie that is wall-to-wall special effects and not be able to discern any of its secrets. Director Alfonso Cuaron is known as an innovative filmmaker (any movie buff who has not seen Children of Men needs to stop what they're doing this instant and go see it). With this film, he devised a whole new bag of tricks to get the movie from script to screen. (One hint: Cuaron reportedly dangled the actors from wires inside a cube of LED lights. I can't begin to fathom how that translated into what you see on film – and I'm not sure if I want to know.) The result is a movie that demands to be seen not only in a theater, but in IMAX 3D. Splurge for the more expensive ticket – it's worth it.As it has often been said, the most spectacular effects are worthless if they're not used to tell a compelling story. Cuaron knows the audience must be invested in the characters. Having two likable stars -- Sandra Bullock and George Clooney -- helps accomplish that aim, as does a script that fleshes out their personae, albeit through some clumsy exposition. Clooney and Bullock are the only actors with speaking parts whose faces appear on screen, but they both have such natural charisma, they are all we really need to see. One other key character is heard but not seen: Ed Harris, in a clever bit of casting, reprises his Apollo 13 role as the voice of mission control. (Apparently, it's a law in Hollywood that you can't make a realistic movie about the space program without the star of The Right Stuff being involved in some way.) The character moments are sprinkled into a story that unfolds at breakneck pace in near real time. At a concise 91 minutes, the movie is perfectly structured and a model of narrative efficiency. Bullock's character barely gets a chance to catch her breath, and neither does the audience.Gravity is not without it flaws, however. Despite the movie's extremely realistic look, it contains a payload bay's worth of scientific inaccuracies. (Allow me to go all Space Geek on you for a moment.) Beyond the obvious fact the space shuttles are all currently residing in museums and that one of the other spacecraft depicted in the movie does not yet exist – there are other glaring problems. According to this movie, every man made object orbiting the earth is at the same altitude and latitude. (Fact: They're not.) Some basic laws of physics also apparently don't apply in this film's universe. (I could go on, but I won't.) The movie's accurate depiction of spaceflight, though, is less important than its emotional genuineness. It's a story about the human spirit and the will to survive. Bullock's character, a space rookie, was a doctor in her earthbound life and her backstory is a tragic one. For her, venturing to space is a way of escaping her pain. But in facing death, she discovers a newfound desire to live. It's an inspiring portrayal in a movie that is itself an inspiring artistic achievement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The greatest sci-fi since 2001 and easily the best picture of the year!,"GRAVITY, Alfonso Cuaron's 2nd sci-fi undertaking, is a masterpiece. Beautifully realized, fantastically acted and housing the most spectacular special effects ever witnessed on film, it is a triumph in the utmost sense.Let me start by saying this is the most gorgeous film, on a technical level, EVER. Never have you seen something with this level of awe and spectacle. Not once do you doubt the cold depths of space and the mechanized behemoths that our heroes trek across in the 90-minute run time. It's this believability that adds to the dread and overall experience. You will feel completely exhausted by the time the credits roll, both emotionally and mentally. Not because there is any real thinking to do, but because you feel you're right there, in the suit, as helpless and lost as our struggling protagonists. You are part of the movie, and this is magnified perfectly by the best-used 3D EVER. This is one of the first times, other than Life of Pi and Avatar, that I insist you see a film in 3D. It wouldn't be the same mind-blowing experience without it.Sandra Bullock, and I never thought I would say this (since she is one of my least favorite actresses of all time), is absolutely perfect as Dr. Ryan Stone. I will be completely shocked if I don't see her name in the best actress category at the Oscars and, unlike her undeserving win for the Blind Side, she deserves the spot. This is possibly her best performance EVER. In fact, I'll be routing for her. George Clooney doesn't give a lot of presence to the film, but I think that's an ideal choice in lending poise and power to Bullocks stellar performance (no pun intended).This is one of the greatest science fiction films of the past, well, EVER. I know I've been throwing the word around a lot, but I don't often use it so freely. It's one of those rare cases, and I mean very rare, where every aspect of a film deserves the magic word at the end. Most technically beautiful film EVER? Check. One of the most intense and believable films EVER? Roger. The best film of the year and possibly EVER? Copy Houston, and luckily, we don't have any problems.2 Cox Up!

"No Air, No Sound, No Screams","At the start I would like to advise, if you have the chance to watch this movie at an IMAX Cinema in 3D then do it. DO NOT WATCH IN 2D. If you can only watch it at home make sure you have all the lights out. There are a few dark scenes that reflect the 3D emptiness of space in extremely. This movie is amazing and horrifying at the same time. If I would be an astronaut that must be the worst case scenario that can happen when you're in near Earth orbit. There are no cars honking and tell you to move because there is no air, so there is no sound and ultimately no one can hear you scream. Only real Astronauts who have been in space will know what it sounds like. So I think the representation of sound in this movie is pretty good as well. The camera work is amazing. There is a new VR (Virtual Reality) set out. I think it is available for around 500 bucks or so. Watching the movie with that set must be awesome, I think. And there is a little homage to Stanley Kubrick's '2001:Space Odyssey'. OK that's what I think it is (sorry no spoilers). All in all I definitely liked it and highly recommend it. Now go, watch the movie and enjoy. .....The end.....",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Spellbinding effects, Average story.","After all the hype and expectation it's time to bring Gravity back down to earth. Yes it is a spectacular film and a crime not to watch it in 3D on a big screen but even though I did, Gravity was still missing something.At the start you are in awe of the wonderful visual effects and feeling of space, once you dive into the story though you find yourself wondering why you don't care more about Sandra Bullock's character Ryan Stone, and Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney. Don't get me wrong, Gravity does stay away from another silly Hollywood space film but in the end the script is just not strong enough.Everyone raved about the performances in this film but really Clooney re-plays his cocky, smug character and Bullock spends most of the film panicking.

Brevity,"It's a modern ninety minute short film therefore it's probably a great film without even looking full stop. Most new films stretch out longer than their event horizon with cgi cartoonery too daft to laugh at and say less than this one's end credits. But however entertaining this might possibly be it's still as vacuous as the space that is the ... er real star - at least the ninety minutes didn't drag though.Two astronauts (Buzz Clooney and Ripley Bullock, the entire cast) are tinkering around a space ship when debris from space collision causes space mayhem and serious space problems for them to get back to safety. There's some gripping and some risible moments always complemented with eye-boggling cgi; although this is a live action cartoon it looks real to me at all times ... is that partly because we all know Americans with their backs against the airlock are always as resourceful as this ... If I'd seen this with some Buddy Holly 3D specs in the cinema I might have come away seasick – so thank the Lord I didn't! Without the 3D gimmick it's a film easier to concentrate on and criticise for its empty headed plot. And why off Earth did I keep reminiscing about Fireball XL5? I'd watch this again when it's on the telly in the future as a slot filler as no big loss.But it certainly was fantastic and space-breaking work by the legions of cartoonists and technicians: it looks great, appears heavy, ends up lightweight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

They don't get inside fast enough and get hit be the debris. Some die and two survive floating in space trying to get to the next orbiting satellite.Some more things happen and with the right amount of luck, one of the astronauts, Ryan, can make it back to earth.I didn't think it was that great of a role for Sandra Bullock, I'm surprised she was nominated. There just wasn't much for her character to do.FINAL VERDICT: Drifting and turning in space was cool, and it was a short, concise, story, just not that exciting. I'd recommend it if you want to see a slow moving drama.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of a Kind Experience,"Well where to start. Heard a lot about this movie and read a lot of good comments about this movie so wanted to watch it desperately. So finally watched it and it was an excellent experience for me. I have never had such an experience before. People drifting in space, fighting for survival all these scenes enthralled me. The story of the movie is very simple but don't want to tell you. The experience is very different. I am sure you have not have experienced anything like it before. So if you are planning to go for this movie watch it in 3-D only and don't wait for DVD watch it in theatres only.

"In a World of Remakes and Sequels, Gravity Brings Originality!","Let's be honest. The movie theater is filled with remakes and sequels and ideas that are more or less redone to death. Even the dozen trailers I saw before watching gravity had at least 3-4 movies that were clearly remakes.Gravity is a movie that you see if at the very least to take advantage of 3D technology which fits very few movies. This is one of them. The visual effects and 3D are some of the best ever. The movie doesn't use 3D quite as good as Avatar, but it definitely holds it own. You believe you are with the characters and at some points you feel like you are actually in outer space.The movie is short by modern standards but it feels like the perfect length. You aren't wishing the movie last longer but don't feel like you are short-changed.The sound is great and if you can find a premium sound system like Regal RPX 3D, then you are in for an epic ride.The acting is great and Sandra Bullock definitely deserves an Oscar nomination.While people want to mention about the physics errors and flaws in the movie, I say it only shows how great everything else is about this movie. It is like arguing why Godfather is bad because Michael Corleone shouldn't look so handsome being a war hero and all.Overall, see this movie while it is in theaters and in 3D. I have a feeling it won't be as epic when it arrives on DVD/Blu-Ray. It will only be a very good movie instead.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A stunning movie with twists, amazing visuals and breath taking moments","The movie will take you on a ride of your life. There are many twists, breath taking moments, amazing effects and visuals and best of all, more or less realistic physics. Gravity has finally brought back the interest in space movies since 2000, when a lot of space movies were thrown into the theatres, but most of them were quickly and badly made. Gravity is a must-see in 3D or IMAX, it is pretty much as amazing as Avatar. But do remember, it is a thriller and it might send a chill down your spine for most of the film. One of the key things is that it can fill you with some knowledge of what is ""up there"" and really shows how space debris can cause damage. So just go and watch the movie, you won't regret it. G.

great movie,"Best movie of the year. It saved this year for me, I can't remember the last time I had fun watching a movie like when I watched this one. 10/10 for me.

If you have nothing to do and need to watch something watch QVC instead, a test pattern is more interesting than this excuse of a movie. The only reason I can think of that people watched this is to see George Clooney and Sandra B. They should be ashamed to take money for this movie. I suppose the reason they chose to be in this is to continue their income stream. It is best watched with the sound off on the TV, actually with the TV off would be a better way to see this movie.

"It's poetry, so perhaps difficult to understand","For me, this is a profound film because of its simplicity in expressing that it is necessary to face oneself alone in order to experience the amazing connection that we have with each other and everything else in the universe, or life itself. Aside from the CGI, if you have experienced this facing yourself, you can't not appreciate this film.Most of the negative criticism of the film has been that the story is full of clichés. Or that the CGI was off, or that the story is simply too simple. I remember living in Chile in 1963 and as a 15-year-old watching Fellini's 8 1/2. I nodded off. If someone had asked me then, I probably would have responded that it was boring, that I did not know what it meant. This film has something in common with Fellini, it's just more personal, and dare I say it, just as universal in its comment on being alive and human.The tell here is that few comments I've read mentioned ""corny.""In 1969 I was being asked to go to Vietnam. I could not do this. My father in his kindness paid $400 to retain a lawyer to advise me on what was involved in being a conscientious objector, and that was what I pursued. This involved writing an essay for the draft board to state for them why I could not do this. That experience resulted in some 17 pages from examining myself, going to the guts, spirit, soul, and was literally facing myself, looking in the mirror, and the most terrifying experience I've had in my life.I am 66, have a wife, son, two grandkids. Viewed many films, read many books, experienced some stuff that might challenge anyone's imagination. But a child might know what this story is about.It is not pleasant to be alone, at least for most of us, simply because we are connected with everyone and everything else. If we were not, there would be no responsibility and life would be ultimately boring.I've seen films from the Angry Red Planet through 2001 to this one. I've watched the NASA videos, and so it is curious to me that some criticize the CGI.The greatness of this story is that it is about you, about me. It is about what-if, and most about what now. You are there. You are going to die. What will you do with your time, whether hours or minutes, or seconds.Space is a vacuum. Emptiness. I am certain that many of you have experienced this vacuum right here on the planet. What a wonderful thing that, in this story, some one of us who is a kind person with a good heart might experience the same thing and survive.

"Stunning Effects and Beautifully Directed,but Certainly Overrated,","Gravity is a decent movie with a great storyline and a talented cast.The movie is without a doubt one of the most stunning and realistic movies ever made,but I was still disappointed by it,it was just too hyped up for me.I thought that at times the movie relied much more on effects rather than story,which is always a problem,and also the movie was way too short,with a length of only an hour and thirty minutes,a movie like this could have been longer than two hours,there is so much more in space that this movie could have explored,I'm not saying it should have shown aliens or anything because it isn't that type of movie,but we could have seen some beautiful shots of other planets and galaxies,it would have looked beautiful and would have added so much more to effect of the movie.Sandra Bullock does deliver a beautiful performance however and is certainly the highlight of the movie,she delivers a very dramatic and emotional performance and it's movies like these that show why she is one of the most successful actors in Hollywood at the moment.I do think Gravity is overrated,but it's still very beautiful and enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or sci-fi.Two astronauts work together to survive and keep calm after they get stranded in space.Best Performance: Sandra Bullock Worst Performance: George Clooney",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Fantastic movie making,"In Hong Kong, the promotion of this film stated that various film critics given this film very high score, I just saw the empire magazine and it was given 5 stars (the highest). So, I was excited to go to see this film in IMAX 3D, on a Monday night show. The story is straight forward, it's an episode film to me, meaning there is only one main thing happen throughout the movie, and the director's job is to guide you through it with all the abilities he/ she can, and let you feel that it's happening to you and you are right at the center of it....and this movie done it, perfectly. From the opening to the ending scene; you are immersed into the events happen to the main character. With spectacular and stunning view of the earth and the space, you are so absorbed into it and feels like you are at space with them. I won't go into details but the story is solid and the acting from both Clooney and Bullock is good. But this is basically a one man (or should I say woman) show, as most of the time you can only see Sandra Bullock on the screen, so it puts lots of stress onto the actress, because the success of the film solely depend on her; but she did a beautiful job. One more thing, I think that this story is visually stunning, but at the same time it told about the importance of courage, to live on no matter how desperate you think you are. Because help may come from places you never expected. P.S remember to watch it in 3D!! As big as a screen you can find!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

GRAVITY Soars,"Some films (Castaway, 127 Hours) have a simple premise, a basic tale of survival, devoid of large casts and complicated plot lines. Co-written with his son Jonás Cuarón, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuarón (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Y Tu Mamá También) has combined state of the art technology and remarkable acting by Sandra Bullock in a spectacular, tension-filled adventure, Gravity.American astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), work on repairs to the Hubble space telescope as news of a nearby Russian satellite explosion is reported. The quiet serenity is suddenly displaced by hurtling debris that decimates the repair mission and causes great damage to the telescope and more. Caught up in a life threatening disaster and stranded in space without any hope of rescue, the two must improvise and utilize survival skills to survive under impossible circumstances. As hope fades and oxygen running low, the astronauts must make difficult choices to make it home alive.Caurón successfully conveys the emptiness and vastness of space and how isolated it can be. What is remarkable is that this film could not have been made so convincingly until now because of recent technological developments. Even director James Cameron (Avatar), who was consulted early on, championed the film's ambitions for space realism that was years in the making. A ground breaking achievement in visual effects, not since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13 has a film so realistically depicted space travel. Even the realistic use of sound or lack of it enhances the authenticity. Great care and research obviously went into the production.The film boldly starts with a continuous panning shot for thirteen minutes with nary a cut. When was the last time a major Hollywood film did that? There are some remarkable shots in space like the one instance where Bullock is in a womb-like position which acts as a metaphor of life. Gravity deserves to be seen in 3D (perhaps the best 3D film since Avatar) which opens up the magnitude of the visual effects. When did any 3D film show a person's tears? This one does. The realism and emptiness of space will be hard to match so convincingly in future films.Cuarón establishes a basic premise and creates a major conflict while continually upping the ante of impending danger. The suspense is palpable as we feel as if we are there with Bullock and must figure a way to first get out of harm's way and then to go home to earth. The one film this reminds you of is Marooned.This is Bullock's (The Blind Side) show all the way as you feel her fears amid every threat; she is in virtually every shot. We learn to understand her feelings and get a glimpse into her past about her regrets in life. Paradoxically, space becomes a place to escape her past or prove to be her death. One major theme for her character is learning to let go whether it be a painful past memory or letting go of something in the here and now. It's about finding a reason to live and finding a deeply personal redemption under the most trying circumstances.Clooney lends strong support as her veteran colleague and voice of reason who offers instructions and calm amid tragedy. You will never guess who voices mission control, but here's a hint- see Apollo 13.Sure, despite convenient coincidences that facilitate some plot points and a couple situations that are a bit hard to believe, Bullock sells it with her conviction and desperation; you buy into the situation regardless even if it may be hallucination or a dream.What should be noteworthy is the fact that Gravity is rated PG in an era when PG13 and R rated major releases dominate the marketplace. And it runs a lean 90 minutes. How such a simple tale of survival and hope becomes not only totally engaging but such a compelling, landmark work of cinema is the lasting legacy of Gravity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A visual masterpiece,"*SPOILER FREE*I loved this movie.As a film and theatre student I often find myself ruining movies by being over critical of them. Not this film.What it lacks in depth of story it surely makes up for in technical and emotional prowess that I've never seen before.This is the first movie I have EVER seen, where the 3D is not only a defend-able option, but is actually necessary to get the full enjoyment of the film.2 great things about this movie.1) It's special effects were not only seamless, but also engaged my senses in a way no movie has done before. At times it was hard to watch the screen, because I felt as if I could actually be falling towards earth, in space!2) Sandra Bullock. As an acting student I've learned how hard it is to be earnest and real when acting with a scene partner. Bullock would have been doing the majority of her acting with nothing but a green screen. And she maintained full emotional commitment the entire time. Breathtaking.TL;DRThis film is great. It couldn't be done without the tech, but that's fine. It's a movie that WILL NOT be as good at home, so go pay the extra $20 and see it in IMAX 3D!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Overrated,"Giving this movie 8 out of 10 stars is a huge stretch and I suspect that the fact that Clooney and Bullock, especially Bullock, is in it has a hell of a lot to do with why this film got such high marks.The movie is predictable and annoying at times, especially with Sandra Bullock and her return to the movie Speed screaming. The camera work and scenery were great, but the plot was slightly better than OK and the acting was about the same.Overall the movie is very watchable, but certainly not worth all of the hoopla. I think 6 stars out of 10 is fare.

Suspenseful and exhilarating.,"Gravity was a very unique and original movie and because it was also executed incredibly well, it was a great movie and deserves much of the praise it has received. The special effects, cinematography, perfect amount of first-person angles, sound, and lack of development all create a certain sense of unknown and suspense that keep you on the edge of your seat almost from the beginning. The acting, essentially Sandra Bullock, is also very good, albeit slightly overrated.

Not for the weak of heart... literally,"Now if you have a weak heart in any way, do not watch this movie. Im not kidding, this was the single most stressful experience of my life. Watching this movie was a very intense and frightening experience, its definitely one of my favorite movies of the year, and it just works so well, its a must see.The movie kicks off with Clooney and Bullock in where? Thats right, space. A mission specialist named Ryan Stone, played by Sandra Bullock and a vet. named Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney are working on attaching some new hardware to the Hubble telescope, which will from what I gathered allow it to see much further than it currently can. Now this is where thing really start to go wrong, the Russians are destroying one of their satellites, and the debris from the wreckage has caused a chain reaction to other satellites, which has caused millions of silent killing pieces of shrapnel speeding towards our main protagonists.Now the silence is key in this movie, because for those of you who know that in a vacuum no sound can travel, as in space, being a vacuum, the same occurs. Because of the silence, you constantly feel like nothing is rely going wrong in the movie, then things get ripped apart. The silence lulls you into a false sense of security, making you feel like every thing is peaceful and calm, but as bits of old satellite come wising past making no sound at all, you just feel terrified. Its one of the most affective scare tactics I've seen in a long time. If these silent explosions weren't, well, silent, it would be no where near as affective. Just seeing a space station silently be ripped apart by speeding pieces of shrapnel is so frightening and exciting, it really made to movie what it is.The director of this movie, Alfonso Cuaron, loves his long takes, those of you who have seen children of men will be familiar with this. This movie has very long, very interesting and very masterful takes, and just beautiful camera work. The camera moves so smoothly, panning and tracking its way around the characters, it made me feel like I was in space. And the way the characters move is just so accurate from what I can tell. In fact, if someone told me they filmed this in space, I would believe them.I did some research and apparently all of the space stations, shuttles and other space craft are exact to what they look like in real life. I also red that the fact that the satellites hit the space stations is impossible, that they orbit at a different distance from the earth, but this is just such a minor flaw that I'm sure wont matter to anyone who watches it. Another thing I wanted to mention was the music. This is so key to the scares and tension. The way it just pounds, like a heart beat, and how it suddenly rises up to the point of ear drum bursting, then suddenly cuts out was just fantastic. Because of the way the music is set, you have to go see it in the cinema, or with surround sound to really get the full affect.I also want to talk about the acting, Im not a fan of Sandra bullock, I hated her in things like the heat, and when I found out she was in this I was honestly put off. But after seeing this, I have to say she has earned some serious browny points. She is so good at portraying the character, that I was genuinely scared for her. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't have enjoyed this movie so much I don't think. Now, as for Clooney, he was great. I really enjoy many of Clooney's work, other than those Nespresso adds, I think his a fantastic actor, and gravity is no exception, however, Im kind of sick of him playing the cocky middle aged guy. He seems to always play this character, and Im a little tired of it. However, he was still amazing in this movie and Im glad he was casted.This movie is one of the greatest pieces of cinema I've seen I a long time, with its masterful use of camera work, music and acting, it left me wondering what would happen next for its full hour and a half. It was so intense I don't know if I could have taken much more of it without having a heart attack. This was amazing, a must watch movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A great sci fi flick with pull,"Visually, Gravity is the most beautiful and enthralling film I've ever seen. Watching it on just a Dell computer screen, lights off, amazed me. I actually felt I was there, if at times in the actual actor's shoes. Slumped, back in my seat, I just got lost in the cinematography. God knows what it's like in 3D or at the Imax theatre. Our two acting heavy weights, Clooney and Bullock, turn in good performances, especially Bullock, when the helmet comes off. Although she's a stereotyped actress, given these independent woman roles like a few other actresses to name. Clooney, honestly, I just wanted him to shut the f..k up. He really got annoying, whether helmet on or off. The plot borrows or unintentionally borrows the catalyst, similar to that of an old 80's sci fi flick, Starflight One. What we've got here is a space station attacked by chunks of metal from another exploding vessel, puncturing and tearing up the station, leaving Clooney and Bullock, as the only two survivors who get separated, where fatally only one is left standing. Gravity's script starts off better with Clooney and Bullock talking co-ordinates whatever, where later it's just cross conversation but interesting and thought provoking dialogue, from Clooney, still a narcissistic p..ck. Bullocks transportation from space back to ground zero, where in many seconds we're no longer viewing satellite, is something that must be seen like this movie. Though it's not worthy of Oscar nomination for film (no way) Gravity is worth the watch alone, for it's cinematography and it's brilliantly fitting music score.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Masterclass,"This review will contain spoilers, and I really mean it.Not many new films get me pumped up, at least not as many as I would like. The last time I was this eager to go to the cinema was a few years back when I was able to see Béla Tarr's ""A torinói ló"" (2011) and Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" (2011), both on the same day, actually. Before that perhaps David Lynch's ""Inland Empire"" (2006). I had read about Cuarón's ambitions, and considering ""Children of Men"" (2006) is just as masterly as they say and wrestles with just the kind of filmic issues I'm fond of (space, length of sequences, movement of camera), why wouldn't I have been over the moon to see this?But really. After this first sequence of 17 minutes I was sold, and they could have done anything, and I mean anything, after that and I still would have had the time of my life. I have seen quite a few 3D films and never felt its use was cinematically necessary, but here it's more than justified, it's integral. The movement of the camera is gut-wrenching at times, and the sense of space is achieved through the use of 3D, not through gimmicks that emphasize the technology but through subtlety, often emphasizing the naturalness of the environment. I have a list of the most uplifting and lucid film moments, and that sequence has its place there.Not that the film goes downhill after that. On the contrary, it's a cinematic masterclass in entertaining and cinematically profound filmmaking, condensed in 90 minutes. The camera soars in space, becoming a third character. We become weightless. In contrast, when we finally arrive to Earth the camera stays down on the ground, only able to glance upward, unable to rise and soar as it did because of gravity. Is there a film where something so naturally mundane to us as gravity is lifted up from its everyday context and given fresh relevance?I think this makes a fine companion to Al Reinert's ""For All Mankind"" (1989), a profound study of space, our insignificant yet beautifully meaningful part in this vast universe, the importance of achieving space travel, becoming acquainted with an unknown and thus fearsome yet grand and immensely breathtaking world, the feeling one might have when gazing upon the Earth as we gaze upon the moon from our planet.But space has no feelings for us. If we think of space in terms of its dangers, we often describe it as hostile. But it is not hostile, nor is it friendly. Space simply is. And that sense of loneliness and terror in helplessness is also grandly present in these films, as it should be. Of those of us who have ever thought about space and what it might feel like to be there, who hasn't also thought of how it might feel like when one is adrift, alone, facing the infinite-seeming blackness with no hope of return?",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
MADE FOR IMAX 3D!! The most incredible visual sense of floating in space.,"This is one of those very rare movies (like Jurassic Park) that were MADE for the BIG screen! From beginning to end, the excellent 3D effects are amazing and nearly constant. The majority of the movie is floating in space outside of the spacecraft, with a few minutes inside now and then. Things are always floating around, and there is a lot of depth and amazing views of the Earth, stars, spacecraft etc, giving you an incredible visual sense of being in space.The story is pretty good, but not the perfect edge of your seat story (e.g Aliens). If you're hoping for a Clooney / Bullock romance or chemistry, it's not there. They are coworkers trying to survive. These are the reasons for losing one star, but the 3D experience in IMAX should earn it an extra 5 stars.No other sci-fi movie I've ever seen has given such a realistic visual sense of being in space! If you read this review before Gravity leaves IMAX 3D theaters, go see it NOW, it's worth the extra money for IMAX to be engulfed by it! If it has already ended its run in IMAX 3D, I guess you'll have to settle for Blu- ray, sitting a meter from the highest quality 100 in. 3D TV and a room shaking stereo system, if you or a friend have one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

For sci-fi genre, this movie win but for thriller/suspense this movie is kind of fail. We can predict what will happen next because we always saw this type of movie but in different background and I really don't really care or pay attention about what will happen to the character, seriously.

Gravity's nonstop action thriller keeps you on the edge of your seats and guessing up until the end on how the movie ends (No Spoilers Here),"After the National Geographic's ""Live In Space"" broadcast the American astronaut revealed he watched the space thriller ""Gravity"" while whizzing around in space on the International Space Station.While the astronauts made the comparison to that of passengers on a cruise ship watching the ""Titanic,"" it has garnered renewed interest in the film, which at the time of the broadcast had recently came out on DVD, On-Demand and on iTunes two weeks prior.Gravity, winner of seven Academy Awards, including Best Director, is a fictional account of a disaster in space, with most of the physics of space and micro-gravity correctly portrayed.Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first Space Shuttle mission with only six months of training to install her own updates to the Hubble Space Telescope for her research.George Clooney plays veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, who is on his last space mission and is attempting to break the record for space walking using a prototype jetpack. And Ed Harris is the voice of mission control.What seems to be the start of a routine spacewalk, disaster strikes 10 minutes into this 91 minute film, with 81 minutes of non-stop edge of your seat drama that keeps building until a the climax at the end allows you to breath again. But only in the last 30 seconds of the film.Every time I watch this film, I swear the movie is only 60 minutes. That's how fast the action moves through the entire length.The drama starts when Stone is working on the Hubble when the Russians shoot down one of their own, obsolete satellites with a land-based missile seven minutes into the film.Without spoiling the film, the space shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalski alone in the deafening silence of space alone and tethered to only each other as they fly into the darkness of space.After loosing the last lifeline they have, communications to Mission Control, the drama heats up as Stone and Kowalski have lost any chance of rescue. Or have they?Fear turns into panic as they gulp down oxygen like it was a cold drink on a scorching hot day, adding to the growing list of problems with no solutions in sight.Stone and Kowalski realize that they must go deeper into the dark abyss of space to throw a Hail Mary that makes the one Doug Flutie threw in 1984 look like a routine shuttle pass!Gravity, directed by Mexican born Alfonso Cuarón, who also produced, edited, and co- wrote the screenplay with his son Jonás Cuarón (George Clooney was uncredited as collaborating in writing the screenplay).This is the first project that the father-son team worked on together as directors, but not their first movie project.Gravity for the most part is accurate in its portrayal of space. However, the sound effects people couldn't leave well enough alone. They broke some of the laws of physics, such as when the added sound to scenes where objects collided in space. Remember, as the film's opening says, ""there is no sound in space."" You can hear some of the sounds while the music tries to cover it up.Also, anyone who knows something about space will see that at times an action does not always have an opposite and equal reaction. As an amateur astronomer since 1973, I could pick this film apart. However, any of the small breaking of the laws of physics will not interfere with the non-stop thriller, making you feel good about having both feet on Earth.However, some of the best commentary on the film came from American Astronaut Rick Mastracchio during the live broadcast from the ISS during the NatGeo broadcast.Mastracchio said that while such a disaster like the one portrayed in ""Gravity"" may be possible, nothing like that has ever happened in space.There have been near disasters in space while aboard the Space Shuttle and the ISS, excluding the Challenger and Columbia disasters.For those who have yet to watch ""Live In Space,"" there will be no spoilers given by the astronauts here either, other than that the incidents that did happen and discussed during the live broadcast could have been as equally deadly to the ISS as in ""Gravity.""While the ISS is the most heavily fortified object in space, capable of withstanding strikes from small objects and micro-meteors, it is also protected by a virtual box that NORAD monitors. If an object enters this box, the first call goes to NASA, and the ISS has the capability to blast itself away from any danger. All I will say is that this call has been made to NASA on more than one occasion.In addition to ""Gravity,"" the father-son duo produced the 2004 hit movie ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts.If you love space movies, ""Gravity"" provides much realism, with a backdrop taken from NASA archives, and a storyline that will keep you on edge and guessing.It's dramatic impact is non-stop and the 91-minute film flies as fast as the ISS does through space.This is a movie that should be in everyone's collection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great in technical aspects... decent as a film.,"Gravity tosses you out of your house, cinema or computer directly into orbit with incredible visual effects and even more amazing Sound Effects. The movie generates a great atmosphere and background and deserves some recognition. But it holds in it several physics ergo holds many plot failures that make it improbable and plain simple... leaving alone the script. In the acting department everyone makes a fine job showing you how scary space can be; especially if you haven't experienced space that much. It certainly is Sandra Bullock's best work. Gravity is a 'good' SFX showing, although holds little movie potential and realism. Works just fine as a boring Sunday film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

My 2/10 Rating Is Made To Bring Gravity Back Down To Earth (Actual=8/10),"I really did like Gravity and don't actually think it deserves a 2/10, but when I saw the 8.7 rating my expectations went through the roof. The trailer didn't really interest me and the hype was really the only thing that made me see the movie. It was pretty much exactly what I thought it was going to be. A survival movie that shows both the physical and metal aspects of being alone in space, as well as being disconnected from the world. It also has references to the origin of life, as well as a lot of religious undertones. I think part of the reason I didn't love this film as much as others is because I am not the biggest fan of survival movies. If you like survival movies and the preview had you hooked, you will love this film as much as the others on IMDb. If you wondered what all of the hype was about, you still might be wondering after the movie. I'd give it an 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
What's with the negative reviews?,"I know this review is late, but... This movie is a masterpiece. Why are there a lot of negative reviews? Almost everything in this movie is amazing. The story is not exactly explained, but you find out along the way. It's done very well. The cinematography is beautiful. Alfonso Cuaron has really outdone himself. The music is also great and is with suspense. This movie makes you think, ""What would I do if I was in this situation?"" Overall this movie is worth being viewed by everyone.

Engrossing!!! Epic!!!,"Nobody told that a movie can be so engrossing and yet have so little dialogues or characters. In time a time when directors are trying to burden movie goers with twisted, convoluted plots and zillions of characters that many people feel the need to go the movies with notebooks comes a game changer from Alfonso Cuaron.The story starts with a space walk where Sandra Bullock in a professor who has developed a prototype which is being funded by NASA. She is accompanied by George Clooney on a space mission to check her prototype's functionality when catastrophe strikes. A sharpen storm of satellite debris destroys there shuttle and leaves them abandoned in space. The story them depicts the struggle she faces to get herself back to a pod and get herself back to Earth.Words cannot express the performance of Sandra Bullock, the way she shows her emotions, her inner demons and her struggles as she fights alone thousands of miles above Earth is really a performance to watch. A special tribute should also be given to the camera work and all the special effects that more than make up for the lack of dialogues in this movie.Overall, a game changer of a movie that was worth the wait for me. I really wanted to catch on 3D in a theater and abstained myself from renting this one earlier and the worth was totally worth it!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Cinematic Experience Like No Other,"There is no other film experience on Earth like Gravity. Which makes sense, keeping in mind the whole movie was located in space, with only the ending scene being on Earth.Alfonso Cuaron has struck gold with his masterpiece Gravity. It explores the silence of space where all you can hear are your breaths and your thoughts as you spin around aimlessly. This is usually harmless until a crisis like debris comes into play. From then on, Sandra Bullock puts on an amazing performance which will definitely give her an Oscar nod, and George Clooney is his usual affable self.One thing that really defined this movie's greatness was its careful attention to being realistic. From the tears slipping down Sandra Bullock's cheeks actually floating off her face, to the oxygen in her suit depleting at a steady rate, this movie doesn't look over any detail or flaw. Instead, it uses simplicity and directness to flow the movie along. Nothing was that unbelievable in this movie.Even though sound was a luxury in this movie, the emotional side of the film was not. Confined to tight spaces, Bullock couldn't really do anything to hide her emotions. She couldn't run anywhere to hide, or walk into a different room. Instead, we all saw and felt what she was going through, and actually cared about what happening to her character.Another thing this movie did that was great was switch perspectives of the camera. We went from seeing what was happening from the character's eyes, to a third person view, to a wide camera angle, all in a few seconds. And the best part is, the camera was so fluent and coherent that we didn't even notice that the perspectives were changing until it actually happened. Genius filmmaking.I could go on about this things this movie did right, because to be honest I can't think of anything I didn't like in the movie, which is extremely rare. Overall, this is a new kind of cinema experience that cannot be replicated again. (Yes, that was a challenge, directors!) Everyone in the target audience and beyond should see this movie because of its realistic sense of things and its careful attention to detail. The cinematography is beautiful, and the views and perspectives this movie gives are to die for. The emotional core, themes, and moral lessons this movie offers should be soaked up with ease. And the way it draws you into the story and what's happening is truly an amazing feat.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
should have been a documentary,"this could have been aired as a documentary on what do do when you are stuck in space. It is understandable why the movie was only 91 minutes long as the story line was a single event. not enough of a story to hold my interest. the view of earth was nondescript so what one is left with is the science of gravity and things floating in space. while those flying objects were fun to watch they merely ended up nowhere as all one could see in this film was SPACE. and did i mention that it was 91 minutes of SPACE. had i not viewed this film in 3D on the big screen I am certain it would have been a bore....though I would have watched it to the end just to see its conclusion. not disappointed that i saw the movie, just not sure what all the hype was about. I felt like a judge on ""the Voice"" waiting for someone to hit the ""high note"" that never came. I would never want to see this film in 2D, nor would I ever need to see this film again. While I am not saying the fierce dilemma that became the characters' motivation in this film was a ""who cares"" situation but really I didn't feel the character development allowed me to care all that much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Half of North America lost their Facebook""","The great: Amazing visuals, visually stunning, amazing direction, the type of movie 3D was made for, well acted overall.The good: Short and sweet, does not overstay its welcome.The bad: Very bad dialogue (for this type of film), especially from George Clooney's character. And seriously, what Nasa astronaut would say to themselves: ""I hate space"" or ""sunny with a chance of satellite debris""??The badder: A lot of Hollywood cliché exposition aimed directly at the audience & terrible stereotypes subtlety interwoven (Chinese play ping pong and have Budha statues, Russians drink vodka...yeah yeah yeah)The worst: The over-hype of this film & an actual line of script mentioning the similarly over-hyped Facebook. It is a sin to use trendy flavor of the week pop culture lingo in films, especially in one this good.Come on now, do you really think people will remember facebook in 20 years while watching this film? I think when that line comes up in 20 years, the kids will kids say ""what the hell is facebook""???? Visuals = Timeless. Dialogue? Not so much. It's like mentioning social networking site ""Friendster"" a decade ago...a NO NO.And the character development was a bit weak and wasted time with some meaningless quips that never paid off.

"Incredible on a big screen, just good at home","I will start by saying that this movie does not deserve a 8.7 rating. Really it does not.Visually it deserves a 9. The movie is visually stunning and Alfonso Cuaron really knows where to put his camera. You will be amazed watching this movie in a 3d cinema. Incredible space views of the Earth and special effects probably make this movie the best space sci-fi ever produced.However, the writing is quite predictable..Yes, we cannot put this movie in the same league of Fight Club, Schindler's List or Forrest Gump as current IMDb s rating is suggesting. This will be an easily forgettable movie, starts well, slow down to a point where you will start to be bored in the middle of the movie.To conclude, I think this movie deserves a 7 out of 10. 9 visually and 6 for the writing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Almost Perfect Movie,"""Gravity"" is an almost perfect film. One of the reasons for this near perfection is it seems so simple - yet a lot of work went into making this film seem so simple. Bullock's performance is very good and different from most of the other films she has done. Bullock's portrayal of Ryan Stone is very physical and very challenging. As she is swinging and rotating through space, she manages to make us believe in her character's dire situation. Again, it is remarkable how moving her character is when she has so little time to create one. Alfonso Cuaron is a gifted filmmaker. He isn't the most prolific director working today, but he spends a lot of time crafting, shaping and making films that are interesting and unique. ""Gravity"" is his best film yet and one of the best films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Different Feeling!,"First I was expecting to see a science fiction movie presenting an out of space travel with several repetitive happenings everyone could expect. However, when I watched it, it was not. It was more a philosophical thought incurring in a right place to invigorate the main points of the story. While, I believe, every one was immersed in how every thing could be so strange in a zero gravity, I was thoughtful about how lonely one can be whether she is among thousands of people or away from them thousands of miles. And then, it is the matter of how it all depends on yourself in either case to deal with it and pass it. These feeling started to become even more after everyone except her were dead and she was far from every thing with every single different laws of physics affecting her. In other words, that was a sense of familiar loneliness in a different context. The other part of the movie that thrilled me was when she touched the earth soil with a mellow sense of happiness in her face. It was not the soil of one particular area of the world. That would not matter. In that scale, that soil was familiar to her. That was where she belongs to without thinking of the borders, countries and people she might see. You might belong to a neighborhood, a city, a country, or a sphere depends on how you look at it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Discovery Channel Popcorn Movie.,"I really wanted this film to be provocative, beautiful, and entertaining. 1 out of 3 isn't bad. It really was gorgeous to look at (in IMAX 3D). My son, who is 15, said it reminded him of something they would watch at space camp or one of those IMAX tourist traps. I have to agree. I have seen some wonderful IMAX films at places like Disney and other theme parks. It's a shame that that is really all there is to this film.At a buck fifty running time there is no depth to this film. (funny because it is set in unlimited space) But it is pretty straight forward. Good looking tang people are working in space... Houston they have a problem... now it becomes a survival flick.The actors were pretty well cast. However there wasn't a lot to do in an hour plus film without even a Wilson in it to talk too. I know a vast majority of movie patrons will feel it was pretty straight forward and thus underwhelming (other than visually). But there will be those that try to find symbolism, and meaning within this film. While I am not one to shy away from an , Look what the director did there!?!"" moment; there has to be more than viewer speculation to make a great film.I almost felt like he didn't want to fill an extra thirty minutes with non dialogue scenes, and relying on Sandra to keep the audience interested. There was a film with half the visual money shots called MOON that never worried about the audience losing interest.To be fair this is a wonderful condensed version of what adrift in space would feel like. However once it turns into the POSEDION ADVENTURE meets APOLLO 13 you can understand why it won't be remembered for its storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Saw it in theaters three times, just to make sure it was actually this good.","Let me start by saying that I did not have an interest in seeing this film prior to having a discussion with my coworker about how I don't go to the movies as often anymore because the tickets are so incredibly expensive. Said coworker talked me in to spending the $11.50 for an evening student ticket by telling me that the movie was, ""made for my eyes."" Admittedly the original reason for going was more so the intrigue of gaining insight as to what type of film my coworker thought suited me so well. The first five minutes were a little slow for me. I groaned inwardly at the opening scene predicting that the movie was going to rely solely on stunning visual effects, and come out lacking in significant content. Starting minute six I was genuinely amazed. It's true the movie does contain some splendid digital effects portraying earth as a luminescent orb, hovering nearby with a somewhat omniscient presence; however, I can assure the movie does not rely on this alone.This review does not contain spoilers, so I will merely state that as a film deserves every bit of hype it's getting from critics and fans alike. Sandra Bullock gives a stunning performance, I found it to be raw and charged with the exact type of nerve required for the role. The movie is full of symbolism (for any fellow lit geeks out there), and touches on some really important struggles we all face on an individual level, such as letting go of the past and not allowing it to hold us back. It has a satisfying ending, I think it can be stated confidently that the ending is in fact perfect for the scenario.All of this being said, I would like to address some criticism I have read on the film. First of all, the movie does have quite a long run time. It could be a bit shorter, but this small fact in no way holds it back from being a great film (and more importantly a great story). Secondly, there are events that transpire that break the laws of physics like a baseball bat to an old car window. One of the most important skills we can have as viewers is to learn that suspending our disbelief will ultimately lead to our ability to appreciate a good story and film for what it truly is. Realistically, a good majority of films released these days have elements that could no way happen in real life. If you get hung up on things like that you won't every be able to enjoy a good movie. The movie deserves the nominations it has received, and I think deserves to win them as well.Thank you for reading, I strongly recommend going to see it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

The Conceptual Review,"Gravity is a movie all about ourselves raising beyond the gravity to a state of achievement. The environment puts us into various challenges which pulls us to the ground level however we need to raise to the heights of excellence to fulfill the dreams. Meanwhile the process of excellence demands sacrifices in that journey which needs to be adorned. The well effort-ed satellites (dreams) of life sometimes explode and go un-repaired. That's the time we need more and more oxygen to breath in, take in all the confidence and fearlessness and get our mind in the state of balance for moving forward. We may need the help of experience of friends, relatives, guides and mentors but its we who have to continue the journey and reach the destination. The movie takes us into such various stages where everyone is stuck at some point in life, where a question arises as whether all the human effort is made before accepting the defeat. Its God who help those who help themselves.Its the capacity and the caliber of the director Alfonso to direct such a movie to take ahead with only couple of artists who keeps running the show for the entire 90 min in great 3D effects. Its just the Sandra and George who keeps us entertaining. On the darker side of the movie, the audience shall be more or less interested in the achievements rather than the effort put forth in the process, which the director does not give the clear view. Though its all about 'standing' high, amidst challenges, the greatness of a person shall be in presenting himself as effortlessly flawless, in spite of being surrounded by drowning challenges. Another point of notice is that its better to give people the examples of situations which seems more familiar to them rather than choosing the space domain which most of the audience may be unaware of. Any way the director and his team's effort is fantabulous and is indeed successful in conveying the message that any success story needs seamless effort and sacrifice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

What an utterly worthwhile experience this is,"Like me you've probably pondered whether the planet might be better off without us humans. And maybe it would, but Sandra Bullock and director Alfonso Cuaron make a pretty good case for our having some redeeming qualities despite our usually reckless behavior. Early on in this movie I began to realize that there's no one I'd rather spacewalk with than Ms. Bullock, if only in 3-D IMAX. We're meant to care what happens to the lead, engineer Ryan Stone, and the movie focuses on and depends on that performance; I personally am convinced no other actress could have pulled this off like the endearing Ms. Bullock and I'd be very surprised if she wasn't nominated for an Academy Award.This movie is a wonderful, old-style science fiction movie where ordinary dreamers like you and I get a chance to muse about the reality of being in space. I remember as a kid thinking up pretty much the same sort of not-so-simple adventure as here though not nearly in such detail. That our guides are Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney is just icing on the cake.The earth looms below us throughout and it's made very clear how fragile life becomes away from it. Everything is about oxygen, electronics, and the ship, its fuel and its structural integrity. And one thing more, the daunting dynamics of moving in space play a very large and effective role here. Don't expect everything to be rock solid logical, there's at least one liberty taken, just enjoy the trip and you'll be very well rewarded. Any flaws amount to nothing compared to the soaring achievement of the movie itself as an unforgettable entertainment. For once it's unlikely you'll feel cheated being charged extra for either the IMAX or the 3-D, though I suspect those who see this movie without them will still feel quite well satisfied.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Buy the Hype, Buy a Ticket and Witness Something Truly Remarkable","Gravity (2013)**** (out of 4)Visual masterpiece about an astronaut (George Clooney) and a medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) who must try to find a way to survive in space after an accident leaves them cut-off from everything. GRAVITY does a lot of great things and it also puts to rest the whole notion of not watching movies in a theater. Those saying ""I'll wait for the Blu-ray"" are going to be missing quite the experience because this is a film that was born to be seen on the big screen and in 3D.There's really no way that any words can pay justice to the special effects in this film but I guess I'd say that watching this movie is the closest most people will ever get to experiencing outer space. I was really amazed at how wonderful the special effects are as they certainly live up to the hype. It seems every month movie goers get more ""hype"" about something grand but I think it's safe to say that the effects here are perhaps the greatest that you're ever going to see and not too many movies have used effects to such an advantage. I think this entire movie would fall apart if even for a split second you didn't feel as if you were with these characters, all alone and in space. The idea is terrifying on its own but the way the film turns this into an adventure is something quite amazing to watch.It's also rather amazing at how simple but powerful the story is. As the short running time moves along we're told bits and pieces about the Bullock character and when everything plays out it's certainly an incredibly touching and emotional ride. Given the right material Bullock can be truly great and this here is without question the greatest work of her career. She's certainly limited in the movements that the character can do so she must act with her eyes and she does a masterful job. Clooney is also very effective bringing his calm and cool nature to the role, which so perfectly plays well against the other character who is in a panic. I'm certainly not going to ruin how things play out but the entire film just leaves you in a state of drama from the opening scene to the closing. There's no question that GRAVITY will be remembered for decades to come. So, if you think waiting around for this is a smart idea, buy the hype, buy the ticket and witness something truly remarkable.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Lots of Physics but No Chemistry,"I've heard that this one should only be seen in an IMAX theater, which seems like sound advice. Effects that must be amazing in 3D—like the big scene-stealing Mexican frog in the splashdown sequence—are just distracting on a smallish home screen. Worse than that, it's a movie that feeds the eye and starves the brain; the green-screen wizardry is compelling, but it doesn't begin to make up for the deficiencies of plot and character development. Even two charismatic pros like Clooney and Sandra Bullock can't do much to hoist this damp petard; my wife bailed after twenty minutes or so, pronouncing it ""guy stuff,"" and I was all like, ""Wait, wait! I have a feeling this routine jeopardy plot's about to turn into a Kubrickian fantasy of death and transfiguration!"" It did, but that still didn't help much.

A Team Effort That Must Be Seen in Theaters,"One thing that has been missing in these big blockbuster films in this day and age is the ability to have a solid story and merge it with A- List talent and extraordinary technology (Enter multiple blockbusters here). This wasn't the case for Alfonso Cuaron and despite the years spent in production hell, the payoff was extraordinary. Using his ability to make long takes work in his favor (Children of Men for those who haven't seen it) he makes what could have been a disaster and turned it into cinema gold that doesn't make you feel stupid for spending money on it. Along with Cuaron's incredible directing abilities, there was the extraordinary acting of Sandra Bullock and a briefly seen yet meaningful George Clooney.As A-Lister's should, they carry the film in ways very few people can and I'm no Hollywood insider, but I can imagine that the films $100 million budget was significantly inflated hiring those two and it was worth it. As Dr. Stone, Bullock performs with her usual excellent acting and because of it, we all relate to her in this film. Someone who has to fight to survive in an environment that you never truly prepare for (Disaster), granted her character is in a situation only few can honestly understand but she represents more than those people. Her character, one can argue, represents the everyday person who has to do whatever they can so they can get home,it's someone who has to deal with work B.S. or someone who deals with issue after issue when all they want to do is complete their day. Dr. Stone is someone you can relate to and that's to the credit of Cuaron and Bullock in making that happen which comes to the biggest thing in films and in life in general (I'll explain that later). Then there's the graphics.The graphics of this film is to say the least incredible and because of it, makes it one of the very few films that actually deserved the 3-D treatment. The best way to describe it would be to compare it to watching an IMAX documentary about space that's in 3-D it's that realistic. It's one of those Avatar type films that you have to see in theaters in order to truly enjoy the film. The details that were taken into account to make this movie as real as possible really is the deal breaker because if it wasn't considered, the film would be at best average which comes to the only flaw in the film, the script itself.The story itself is not really anything to ride home about as it can be considered predictable and there are a few things you wish were avoided, but it still doesn't take away from the film itself (Much like Avatar). Then there are the theoretical life lessons this movie brings by having you be a part of Dr. Stone's journey and yes, it's Dr. Stone's journey not Clooney's (even though his performance should not be discounted as he did a hell of a job). All of these things lead to the film that is Gravity which brings this review to a full circle.When you make a film, it has to be a team effort, if not it's going to a disaster of epic proportions. You can scrap a script together put a couple A-List actors in it and let the rest of it go (Battleship is an example granted only Liam Neeson is A-List but that's not the point). But if you want to really make it work, you have to have a quality director, quality script and quality actors if you want to make it work.

Emotionally engaging from beginning to end,It's rare that I review a film as being been near perfect but Gravity was just that. The cinematography really tries to push the boundaries and perfectly executes the intention of making the viewers feel like they are in the situations unfolding on screen. Matt Kolwasky (George Clooney) quickly and easily attaches the audience to him. You love the character and feel for him. You want him to survive the entire film. George Clooney beautifully portrays a man that stays calm through extreme situations. This film would not be what it is without him. Sandra Bulloock does a great job some of the time but you feel the sense that sometime she is really forcing portraying the character of Dr. Ryan Stone in some situations but not so much that it was unbearable to watch. Director Alfonso Cuarón really out did himself here. The screenplay was well written no complaints there and the music score at the end just emotionally draws you in even more while watching this masterpiece. The only reason I gave this film a 9/10 was simply because what kind of film critic gives any movie a perfect. If I did then I would not be a film critic but from a personal point of view..........It's a 10!,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Compelling cinema,"On one level this film is a triumph in 3D technology. It's use is restrained yet glorious in places where it needs to be. In a refreshing twist the trailer gives away all but a tiny fraction of the most impressive 3D scenes. But for all of the gorgeous cinematography and breathtaking 3D action moments where you can't help but hold your breath (nearly the whole film!) where Gravity triumphs are what it has to say about humanity, and what it means to be alive and to be human; We're all infants in the universe but on earth we're all in it together even if sometimes life isn't what we had planned. Gravity explores us to enjoy the ride, whatever that may be.If I could give my fellow humans a couple words of advice, bring tissues. Lots of them. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.,"I don't normally write reviews, but I was so impressed with this movie I decided to share my experience.Rarely does a movie come along that truly impresses me. Gravity has done just that. Sandra Bullocks performance was nothing short of phenomenal. I left this movie feeling amazed, in shock and in a state of fatigue as if I had actually been in the shoes of Dr. Ryan, Sandra Bullocks Character.Visually this movie is amazing. The shots, angles, lightning and general feel make you believe you are in space.I don't want to give any spoilers away, but please do yourself a favor and go see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Over-Rated.  Somewhat Entertaining,"Astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are repairing a telescope in space when a Russian satellite explodes and sends the debris their way at very fast speeds.The beginning of this movie feels like it's the end of a movie when disaster strikes and they overcome it and we all go home. But, that can't happen as this just started. Bummer.Gravity would be better viewed in 3-D if you can manage it. The CGI visuals are truly outstanding even in 2-D. We see Kowalski and Ryan try to get back to the ISS (International Space Station) and one would think there would be tension and suspense during this attempt to get back, but this didn't happen for me. But, if you watch in 3-D you will be ducking debris every 10-seconds. Quite exciting though. For me, the tension and suspense came much later when Ryan was by herself in the abandoned Chinese space station. Hey, wouldn't you be tense in a space craft where all the buttons and controls are in Chinese and you don't know the language. Huh?Gravity was nominated for Best Picture. Say what? Give me a break. Sandra Bullock was nominated for Best Actress. Huh? The Academy must have had their collective heads in a Black Hole when they made these nominations. Sandra Bollock is a good actress, but it didn't show up in here. George Clooney was good, but his character acted too much like the disaster was a walk-in-the-park (I guess he knew this was only a movie).Still, this was somewhat entertaining, but highly over-rated. The dialogues between Kowalski and Ryan were lame for the most part. No good lines, nothing funny. The star of this movie is the CGI visuals and again, they are spectacular. But, that's it. View it in 3-D and enjoy it. Otherwise, it's a ""Help, I've fallen in Space and can't get up"" type movie. (6/10)Violence: No, not between the characters, just the violence that occurred in space.

'I hate space.',"Father and son team Alfonso Cuarón and Jonás Cuarón wrote the screenplay (with assistance from George Clooney) and Alfonso Cuarón directed (with capable assistance from director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki) what is likely to go down in cinematic history as a shining moment of the art of the craft. It manages to tell an impossibly simple story about surviving and not surviving astronauts out in space and makes the emotions so complex that the audience is left speechless. It is a staggering achievement.Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. How eventually Stone manipulates the fragments of international spacecraft in her attempt to live is profoundly touching and extraordinarily touching.Both Bullock and Clooney offer portraits not only of the characters they portray but also the hopes and fears of us all if ever faced with surviving the impossible. This is a film that must be seen to understand and appreciate the little miracle Alfonso Cuarón has created.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity: an Astounding Space Adventure,"Where to start from? Let's see I think I found it: Alfonso Cuaron is a great director and an even greater writer. The movie he put together is amazing and catching and delicious. Is about being in the space, loose your own weight and your more rooted habits. Shows how beautiful is the human body (Sandra Bullock rotating out of her space suit), how beautiful is the earth and how beautiful human beings can be (George Clooney never losing his good mood). The last scene explaining what gravity means for us all is worth an Academy Award for the best finale if ever there will be one.I am aware of all the criticism raised by others (there are already more than 1.100 reviews while I'm writing my note) about Physics laws not always completely respected but being a nerd myself I can assure you that this will not bother you, not even for a moment, unless you as a kid were bothered when Jules Verne made you travel to the Center of the Earth and return on a brazier coming out from the Vesuvius.Your eyes will be delighted and You will feel very privileged to be orbiting the earth, live the International Space Station as it were your own place, taste the oxygen blended with excessive CO2 and feel the desperate need for mother planet we all have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Spiritual and Tranquil Ride in Space,"Our earth is so stunningly pretty if we step back and look at it from space. On this enormous big blue marble, we see typhoon, sunrise/sunset, Polar lights, mountain ranges and city lights, all from a different angle. It would have been such a nice ride if not for the accident which causes Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) stranded and roaming in space, with limited fuel and oxygen.There is absolute silence except her own breathe. With loss of gravity (even with it, now we know) human is so fragile. Life is so delicate compared to indefinite space. Yet the will to live can be so strong and powerful – because we have someone we care for and we respect life – whether it is a dog woofing, a baby crying, or a frog swimming.Up there in space, there is no boundaries, no orientation, no nationality or even language barrier. Whatever you believe in does not matter anymore. Whatever we strive or fight for on Earth is not such a big deal anymore. Our hung ups should not be bothering us anymore in that absolute space. It echoed what an astronaut I interviewed years ago who said when you are up there in the space shuttle, you would not think of your national background, just found yourself a global citizen, or resident of the Earth. May we protect and keep our Earth in good shape for future generations to come.In that Zen like drift, panicking does not help. Just be calm, take a deep breath and do what you have to do while enjoying the ride. What a spiritual ride that urges you to appreciate solitude and being alive.Excellent visual effects where we are seamlessly drifting and floating together with them, even inside Dr Stone's spacesuit. The first 10 minutes were all seamed in one shot while we as the audience are also rolling, spinning and flipping gently in space. What an elating experience! How did they do that? This has to be watched in 3D.The sound effects (music and breathing) were also breathtaking which match perfectly with the mood of the spacemen and the edging circumstances.No more worry about whatever that is on your mind. This will definitely give you a new perspective of looking at life and at ourselves. Just go and enjoy the drift.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Already a Classic.,"""Gravity"" is a suspenseful action survival adventure that sets new standards in terms of a realistic depiction of what it feels like to be an astronaut in outer space. The visual effects are just amazing and are only surpassed by the unique, claustrophobic atmosphere created by the simple fact that nothing more than the small, narrow, oxygen-filled shell within your space suit separates you from the deadly vacuum out there.Being lost in space, we - by the magic of the movie camera which is digitally floating in all imaginable directions - literally witness the dramatic struggle for life through the bloodshot eyes of Sandra Bullock who, in a brilliantly intriguing performance, tries to find a way back to Earth while she is irretrievably running out of her oxygen supply; were it not for the treacherous crunching sound of people eating popcorn, the illusion would be complete! George Clooney as the experienced astronaut Matt Kowalsky, always overshadowed by Bullock's powerful play as Dr. Ryan Stone, is the only help providing some hope in a obviously desperate situation. As a rather chattering person, he contributes to comparatively few dialogs that are unfortunately not always free from typical Hollywood clichés.Strictly seen this movie has a very thin plot as the director apparently puts much more emphasis on the space experience itself which is underlined by a great, vibrant score crucial to its' huge success since - apart from some radio transmissions between the protagonists - there is of course no sound in the vacuum we would be able to hear; this lack of sound being another tribute to realism as far as it's compatible with the regularities of a blockbuster: Alfonso Cuarón did not intend to make a documentary about disasters in space instead he delivered a very authentic, minimalistic science fiction thriller that can easily form a line with all the great SF-Classics of movie history.The little kid in you who has always dreamed of becoming an astronaut will definitely leave the theater being nothing but satisfied.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Great Film,Great Movie . Great music . Great Visual . Weak Dialog,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Surviving in space ain't easy,"With the only introduction of some uncomforting music, the viewer get's thrown into space and the theme for the rest of the movie is set immediately. 2 people are doing maintenance on a shuttle, Ryan (Sandra Bullock and Matt (George Clooney) and you know they are not going to have an easy time in space. Ryan is a conflicted woman and it looks like she is literally trying to escape her problems by being in space. Only to find way more trouble up there forcing her to face herself.It's amazing to see planet earth from a distance in the background during almost the entire time and it's an remarkable achievement how they manage to recreate space. The fact that almost everything take's place in there make's this film even more fascinating.Of course the idea of astronauts  in space getting in trouble definitely isn't a new thing for horror/science fiction movies but the way Alfonso(director) handles this subject is really refreshing. This is because although this film is labeled as Science-fiction, there isn't really something futuristic in it and Alfonso tried to keep it real and personal in terms of the story and thank god there aren't aliens showing up all of a sudden. Let's be honest, the idea of being stuck in space is already horrifying enough on itself. Especially because it's so dangerous and yet we still know so little about it.The film really plays out like a kind of horror movie because in the end  it's all about escaping death and trying to survive. It sucks you in from the start and doesn't let you go until the titles roll 80 minutes later. This is also mainly because of the marvelous presentation. This kind of movie magic  is really rare to happen I personally think and i haven't seen it for a long time in a big Hollywood production. The last time was with Christopher Nolan's Inception.  It really depends on having an talented director with his own vision and giving him a large amount of money to play with. Of course this has been going wrong a lot of times but once in a time you have a director who is able to do something special with it. He really creates a fascinating setting and uses the budget to enforce the experience instead of using special effects only for the wow factor. This is a thing which is to be seen in a painfully lot of big budget Hollywood movies.There's only one small drawback for me in this movie and that are the actors. Sandra bullock does a descent job portraying an woman alone in space trying to survive and George Clooney is playing the charming guy as always. It's just that for me, this movie would be way more believable if I didn't have to look at actors i've seen an dozen times before, but instead just some unfamiliar faces who could be anyone. Of course it ain't a big problem because  you have to link famous names to an big production. This movie really is an new landmark in Hollywood after inception, creating something special with large amounts of money instead of making an special effect show-reel out of it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Its all in the visuals ...,"This movie is probably one of the hardest i have to ""review"". Normally i review movies on my enjoyement of them, and i don't care to give a 6 or a 7 if the movie entertained me, even if its legitely a ""bad movie"" per normal standards.When it comes to this one, i would give it a 4 if i would rate on my enjoyement alone. I was ...kinda bored to be honest. I looked at the time left 3 times and this is just a 90 minutes movie. That said, gotta give credit on the visuals and special effects as a whole.The movie is beautiful, and i can only imagine how impressive it must had been in 2013 on a cinema screen. Apparently this was also in 3D, wich i usually don't like, but i could totally see why this particular movie would be enhanced by it. Now myself i watched it on a regular 1080p TV on bluray, and it was still impressive.The issue is the story is not that compelling. And its even worst once you look at all the ""goofs"" on IMDB and realize a lot of what happen could simply not happen. Its not that actors act bad or that their characters have any major problems, its just that the concept of very few characters in a movie, at least to me, often result in a lack of developement. Its a survival story, thats it.Now, i personally wouldn't rewatch the movie, unless maybe on an IMAX screen or something by curiosity, but my bluray has a ton of extras and to be fair i am actually curious to watch them for once. Like how they did the zero gravity stuff and such.So in a nutshell is it worth a watch? Yeah kinda... for the visuals. And i must aknowledge that aspect, but at the same time i can't say i was really ""entertained"". So i am gonna give the movie a 6 wich i feel is a compromise between my 4 for entertainement and 8 for technical aspect.The script has issues so knock a few points there, no matter what.

Could not shut off my brain enough to like this,"The story was so bad I don't even have pity for it.Science and any reality are completely tossed out the window in this film. Alfonso Cuarón doesn't even try to have something remotely believable. There was talk about them creating suits and special effects that realistically portray current life in space. All lies, I could have overlooked some bending of the rules, but they tossed them all out.The characters themselves are supposed to be trained astronauts, but not one second of on screen time shows this. Most of the time they are incompetent, then magically they can fly a ship they have little, or no experience with like they've done it all their lives. When Sandra Bullock's character is almost out of oxygen, George Clooney character is there trying to make sure she uses up as much of it as she possibly can.The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the special effects house did a wonderful job on making things pretty.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A story of survival,"By definition, Gravity is a technical wonder. All of the details were meticulously orchestrated by Alfonso Cuaron in a very masterful way. Given the incredible work that was put into this part of the film, it's quite understandable that the story is a bit overshadowed, at least in my estimation. It's not a bad story by any means and the fight for survival is always an interesting enough subject to portray in cinema, especially when you take into account the complications that our leading star goes through. Still it fails to impress when compared to some more complex stories at this year's Oscars. As far as other aspects go I must say that Sandra Bullock handles her role very well as she brings a lot of intensity throughout the entire 90 minutes of the movie. Much like Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years A Slave, although in different circumstances, Bullock is the central focus of the movie and therefore must be very convincing. There are mostly two aspects that I'd like to highlight in the movie. The first is the amazing job Alfonso Cuaron did directing the film. You could really tell this was a passion project and the end result was something quite outstanding. On the other hand though, one can't be a little turned off by the simplistic story of survival in outer space, one that while well constructed, ultimately fails to capture the dark yet beautiful magic of the world that is Gravity.Rating 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Visually splendid epic and critically acclaimed film in which Sandra Bullock is terrific as a brave astronaut,"This is an epic and impressive drama of adventure and exploration about the ultimate trip . The opening scene, from the establishing view of Earth to Dr. Stone detaching from the structure, is a spectacular , long shot lasting about twelve and a half minutes . In 2015, bio-medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is in a space mission , she's a specialist on her first space shuttle mission, STS-157. Stone is on a spacewalk repairing a panel on the Hubble Space Telescope , accompanied by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who is commanding his final expedition . Mission Control (voice of Ed Harris) suddenly instructs them to abort their spacewalk and return . On a seemingly routine spacewalk disaster strikes , the shuttle is destroyed leaving both astronauts alone , ignoring each other and spinning around in the dark . Don't Let Go!A landmark film with important significance that was deservedly multi-awarded in many national and international festivals from the date of its premiere and achieving success in the world box office attracting the general public . A film with only two characters , Dr. Ryan Stone who's a brilliant medical engineer who makes her first shuttle mission accompanied by the veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski who commands the last flight before retiring , both of whom work together to survive after an accident leaves them stranded in space. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in an outstanding way in this claustrophobic film set in the vastness of space . A mixture of drama , thriller and Sci-fi , the film won seven Oscars , including direction , photography and editing . The director of the film, the Mexican Alfonso Cuaron, also won the Golden Globe and the BAFTA for best direction for this great work . Sustained on breathtaking special effects , the director brings to the screen a tense story dealing with the loneliness of space and the proximity of death, written by Alfonso Cuarón himself and his son Jonás . The FX and soundtrack are really stunning ; furthermore , being deeply symbolist and with many interpretations of its meaning , especially showing Man's relationship with the immeasurable Universe , I am inclined towards a meaning about a strong fight for survival . Starring Sandra Bulock stands out , he's frankly excellent as Dr. Ryan Stone , a brilliant medical engineer who makes her first shuttle mission accompanied by an expert astronaut -nicely played by George Clooney- who commanded the last flight before retiring . For most of Sandra Bullock's shots, she was placed inside a giant, mechanical rig ; she had to memorize long combinations of precise movements to hit her marks at different points in the shot . Sandra often had to coordinate her own moves with those of the wire rig attached to her and the camera.It contains colorful and evocative cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki , Alfonso Cuaron's ordinary . And thrilling as well as imaginative musical score by Steven Price . The motion picture was competently directed by ever versatile Mexican producer/writer/filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama También (2001), Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban (2004) , Children of Men (2006) , Believe (2014) , Roma (2018)) who carries out an efficient and energetic take on . Here director Cuaron also uses his customary trademarks , as he utilizes long continuous and digitally blended shots , gettting overwhelming scenes. Rating : 8/10 . Better than average , worthwhile watching. Essential and indispensable seeing for Sandra Bullock and George Clooney fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Magical cinematography but meager plot,"In ""2001, a space odyssey"" (1968, Stanley Kubrick) one of the astronauts loses contact with his spaceship and vanishes into the big emptiness of space. It was a scene that always (I have seen the film several times) made a deep impression on me.The same threat is ever present in ""Gravity"". Unlike ""2001, a space odyssey"" ""Gravity"" is however not philosophical science fiction but much more disaster science fiction. In essence it is about a space ship destroyed by space debris.The disaster element in the film is quite obvious but multiple opinions are possible about the science fictoin element. The spaceship is not destroyed by some kind of monster, as in ""Alien"" (1979, Ridley Scott), but by space debris. Director Alfonso Cuaron has admit that the film is not always scientifically correct, but is is clearly based on existing technology. In this sense the comparison of ""Gravity"" (""Houston I have a bad feeling about this mission) with ""Apollo 13"" (1995, Ron Howard) (""Houston we have a problem"") is maybe the most appropriate one (and this film is not categorized as science fiction).In making this comparison I must admit that while the cinematograpy of ""Gravity"" is magical, the story and the tensity of ""Appolo 13"" was more to my taste.On first glance this is strange because by a film based on a real event you know the ending. On the other hand the fact that the story is real increases engagement.I said earlier that ""Gravity"" unlike ""2001, a space odyssey"" is not a philosophical movie. The image of a man disappearing in deep space is however not the only image the two films share. ""2001, a space odyssey"" also has some sequences about the evolution of men. A sequence of the dawn of men at the beginning of the movie and maybe a sequence about the future of men at the multi interpretable end of the movie.In ""Gravity"" there are also some sequences that can be interpreted as handling not just about the main character Ryan Stone (played by Sandra Bullock) but about humanity as a whole. I do mean the sequence in which Ryan Stone takes a fetal stance and the ending sequence in which she crawls out of the water onto the earth and ultimately walks away on two legs, just like our predecessors did millions years ago.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Nerve Wracking and Thrilling Cinematic Experience,"Philosophy Space is Scary, out there no one can even hear you scream. There is no air, no medium for sound to travel on, it's just deadly silence and infinite darkness of the vastness of the universe which neither has a beginning nor an end and if you ever get stranded in such a place with nothing but your relentless desire to live and never ending urge to keep moving no matter how grim the chances are for survival, remember one thing and one thing only; the force that keeps pulling you down obstinately is the force which makes you walk this earth also and no matter how strong the force is we rise, walk, run and conquer. Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is an ode to the stubborn human instinct for survival, the unflinching desire to hold on to life even when death seems imminent which is shown in the most magnificent and intricate way possible. It is one epic of a movie which only comes out as often as Halley's Comet. It is a well-directed, well written and marvelously enacted action-drama which uses more body language and sound design to express emotions than any movie I have seen in a long time. Story When a group of astronauts fixing a damaged device on a satellite are bombarded with a debris of destroyed Russian Satellite orbiting the earth at a speed of a bullet which creates a chain reaction by destroying whatever comes in their way and taking it along, disaster strikes on the US Team Members killing everyone except two out of which one detached from the spaceship is left floating in the ever expanding space with limited O2 (oxygen) and no communication with earth. There is no one to hear them cry, no one to send help. There is this limitlessness and two specs of hope hovering around in enormity. Direction Alfonso Cauron has possibly made one of the most engrossing space movies of all time which is dramatic, cinematic and enigmatic but not because of the exceptionally realistic 3D effects or the awesome CGI but because of the detailed portrayal of human emotions on screen which is perfectly balanced by a great background score. His attention to detail is evident from the way he has recreated every single object hovering around in the gravity–lessness, from the Ping-Pong bats on Chinese space ships to realistic movements in zero gravity everything has been researched thoroughly which add to the viewing experience Performances George Clooney as Matt Kowalski is incredibly sharp and witty as always. He makes an impression rather inscribes a character in our mind so deep that It will be remembered for a long time. But as the story is one woman's journey for survival, Sandra Bullock steals the show by giving one of the best performances of her lifetime. She is extremely convincing with her body movements and passes across a lot of emotions without words or expressions. She's so good that she might even steal this year's Oscars for it. Background Score Steven Price has created a sound track which is incredibly outstanding and gives an ethereal experience to the viewer's emphasizing on the mood of the movie. Price may not have been present physically in the movie but his contributions to the movie being so impactful are so much that it's hard to imagine Gravity without Price's soundtrack. Final Word Gravity is not only a technical masterpiece but also a nerve wracking and thrilling cinematic experience which like wine will become better and better with time. It fuses exemplary sound design, great storytelling and out of the world CGI / 3D technology to create a marvel. No excuse can justify missing it. Overall Rating: 4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic,"I really love this movie.I read many reviews here questioning that several things in the movie are implausible, hurt science, etc., etc. I would just like to know which sci-fi movie is totally believable... kkkk none. The name itself says, it is a fiction, if it were reality it would be a documentary.""Matrix"", ""2001"", ""Interstellar"", ""Prometheus"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Alien"", ""The Terminator"", ""Star Wars"", ""Dune"", ""Arrival"", ""Contact"", etc. They are all implausible and hurt science. And? All wonderful.So this argument from implausibility is the stupidest I know. Didn't like the movie? Okay, but don't use this argument, it's a fiction, not a documentary.Finally, I would like to say that this was one of the few movies in my life that I enjoyed with Sandra Bullock. I really think her filmography is terrible, as I remember only this ""Gravity"" and ""The Lake House"" are saved. And the funny thing is that besides thinking she's very beautiful, I think she's an excellent actress, therefore, a waste of talent in so many bad movies.By the way, excellent soundtrack.10/10 rating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
And the Oscar for best cinematography and visual effects goes to...........,"This picture ranks in the top 5 of all movies known for visual effects and cinematography. If this film does not get the Academy award for those two categories on March 2nd 2014, there is a screw loose.The story is truly stunning. It is simply about the human condition of overcoming incredible odds of survival using faith, spirit, intelligence, and true grit.I felt like I was inside a spacesuit with absolutely no control over the situation and losing my oxygen.My only beef with this film are the circumstances that caused the debris field in the first place. Those damn Russians!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A+ for effort, execution, and enjoyability","""Gravity"" does things with the sound and cinematography that other movies only dream of doing. Frequently filming from the first person, the film attempts to put you in the place of an astronaut adrift in space. It succeeds in a big way. Be prepared to be on the edge of your seat for 90 minutes.The cinematography of this film is visionary. There is never an 'up' or 'down' to limit the camera. A common camera trick is to show the camera at a crooked angle to show uneasiness. Every shot in Gravity is at a crooked angle because there's never a clear up or down. That use of cinematography is brilliant in depicting the overall uneasiness of the entire movie.The use of sound is nothing short of masterful. The silence makes you lean in close, then the occasional noise makes you lean back. Watching a space station be torn to shreds without sound makes you appreciate with your eyes. Then spending so much time listening to breathing makes you focus on your own breathing. It evokes a sense in yourself that few movies ever reach.My only complaint about the movie, and I will say this is a fairly minor complaint, is that Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) basically has a 90 minute panic attack. She never calms down. I know that we are supposed to feel what she feels, and for the most part we do, but personally I doubt that adrenaline would last so long in myself.There's not much to say in words about this movie. It's visual. It's noise. It's the lack of noise. It's brilliant. Go watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Must see,"Gravity is a visually stunning movie that was enhanced by the 3D IMAX at Universal Studies in Los Angeles. The storyline was somewhat predictable but the attention to detail and visuals were amazing. From the opening scene which combines the silence of space with the beauty of the earth, the movie draws you in. Both George Clooney and Sandra Bullock were outstanding in their roles and I totally believed that Sandra was weightless as she floated through the space station. (I read that these scenes took a long time to shoot to get them right and the result was worth the effort). The movie also managed to maintain the tension throughout the film without becoming just another thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A wonderful sub-plot!,"Saw this last night, and was pleasantly surprised. Here the Thomapl review: ""This nail-biting quasi-sci-fi 3-D drama with a cast of two is not so much about an outer space tragedy/accident as it is about a kind, strong, good-hearted man helping a scientist overcome her fears, grief, and insecurities in the gentlest, most patient manner. It's about a good man who helps a good woman become better. It could easily have been the other way 'round. Think Sally Ride rather than Sandra Bullock. I won't give away any of the plot turns or denouement but watch it through my lens and I ga-run-tee you'll enjoy it. I give it an A.""",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding on many levels! 7 Stars from me!,"I wonder what it would be like just floating around space without having to overcome dangerous obstacles, either being hit by those things coming at ya or bumping into obstacles that aren't moving very fast. One cannot truly control the direction of an objects trajectory in space or the manner in which a body will move toward objects in space without proper guidance and focus.I thought the movie depicted a pretty good representation of what might occur if lost in space, but it still makes me go 'hmmmm' because of fascination. The visuals/graphics were seriously intense. How does one make a movie like this? George Clooney and especially Sandra Bullock were phenomenal astronauts. Zero gravity in space, and then full gravity on earth? That has to mess with a body's equilibrium some. Phew, I was nervous for them. It seemed so real and reasonable. I noticed Sandra Bullock doing a lot of talking to herself as well and that makes it believable.Darn, I didn't see this movie in 3D/IMAX! That has to be way more intense! The cinematography, superb! I'm interested in the documentary, 'the making of this movie' to see everyone's involvement. WOW! One could ask a lot of questions about this movie in terms of different outcomes, for sure. Sandra Bullock mentions that one of the space stations is about 100 kilometers away, which we all know is about 60 miles...and then when George Clooney comes back into the scene, he states that it is about 100 miles, which is about 40 miles more than Sandra Bullock stated. So I got a bit confused. Either they messed up about the miles/kilometers ratio or Sandra Bullock wasn't heading toward the space station, but away from it. I got a bit lost in that translation. But I only saw it once so far and I could be in the wrong. Nonetheless, still a movie worth watching, in 3D/IMAX no less. I'm wanting the IMAX version here for myself!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Best movie of the year,"""Gravity"" defies its genre. Its a science fiction, yet feels head spinningly real. From the first frame to the last, Alfonso Cuaron takes his audience right into a place 600km above earth and you are bound by the taut tale of two marooned astronauts. The story isn't new, actually the story is just a single line, but the visualisation, the imagination, the cinematography, the background score, the special effects are probably the best I have ever, and I mean 'ever' seen. This is not movie but an experience which no movie lover should ever miss. And if 3D was invented for some reason, it was for this movie.

All were thrilling and Alfonso Cuarón is a very talented guy but at a certain point it got to be a little bit too over the top and uneven. At some moments, what the movie expects me to believe with the scientific laws of nature and practicality of certain events is asking for a bit too much.

Gravity is the most creatively genius film of our time. Alfonso Cuarón challenges the entire industry to make original films. Truly Magnificent.,"Gravity is the most creatively genius film of our time. Alfonso Cuarón challenges the entire industry to make original films. Truly Magnificent.Cuarón decides to compose the film from a series of incredibly long takes. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to not be captivated. The camera's lens essentially becomes the audience's perspective; causing viewers to look on as if they were drifting throughout space with the characters in the film. A truly intimate choice for cinematography that is executed brilliantly.Cuarón takes a great risk, with not only making a 91 minute film, but essentially conveying that the film is a true minute-to-minute ratio of what the audience is actually seeing. The story clearly takes place over a several hour time period but is conveyed as if what the audience is watching is ""real time,"" with the exception of a handful of jump cuts. Cuarón takes a bold move, and succeeds in essentially tricking the audience and changing their sense of time to further entrance the viewers.There is only one critique i can give the film: the visuals were so beautiful, innovative, magnificent, and close to perfection than any movie ever made, that the emotional dialogue literally couldn't keep up with the visuals. During the scenes where dialogue is supposed to hit the film's themes home with the audience, it simply cannot. Though the themes are still very simple and obvious, they are not as powerful as Cuarón intended them to be. The audience was probably predicted to cry aloud during some line deliveries by Bullock, but could not due to the fact that they were still in complete shock at what they just witnessed.Gravity is a combination of modern technology and classic story. Gravity is a testimony that original films still exist. Brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gripping,"A solid, gripping suspense drama which literally had me holding my breath. This film is visually stunning with incredible effects and an attention to detail which makes you feel as if you are there.It is telling that the film took so long to make because they waited until the technology was good enough to create effects that would do the story justice. In a lot of modern films throw a lot of effects at you to disguise poor writing and a lack of plot, in this case the story was there first and the effects are used to enhance it.The film is also realistic and believable, by Sci-Fi standards, OK, there is an element of poetic license, the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 and the Chinese station won't be completed until 2022, however the technical aspects of the spacecraft and stations used are close to reality.Probably the best Sci-fi movie I have seen this year and I say that as a huge Star Trek fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fast moving & fun!!!!!!!!!!,"Well worth it!Do not be swayed by those who claim 'this would never happen'. This isn't a movie based on a true story, nor is it a NASA documentary, or a premonition of something to come–it is entertainment, and to that degree, a top notch motion picture! The editing, visual displays and acting are unforgettable and should not be missed, particularly in IMAX if possible. You come out of this movie before you can truly catch your breath – the fast pace and stunning images will mesmerize you and I pray a great many directors and studios follow suit. Set the camera and let the story tell itself–wonderful!Oh yes, back to my opening, for those who claim all of this is impossible–next time do YOUR homework, because Alfonso Cuaron DID his research and recent interviews with NASA have verified elements of the movie could, or have happened. The odds are greatly against all of this happening in conjunction with one another, but bear in mind we are talking entertainment here. Ham radios CAN be heard in space and the stations are equipped with them just for emergency purposes. Space debris CAN and DO hit objects, it doesn't happen often, but it does. YES, there are operational manuals on the stations and, if can translate them, you can control other crafts. You CAN access modules and crafts from the outside, it has to be set up right, but it can be done. YES, astronauts have communicated with Huston ""in the blind"" and are taught to do so when they do not receive responses. Now granted this movie happened to throw all the intangibles into a huge crock pot and the story is fascinating to the point we aren't expected to believe it could be duplicated during real missions, but WOW, what a ride and how thrilling it was to be a part of it!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Heart stopping cinematography, acting, and plot!","Gravitational force, tangential velocity, and inward acceleration aside, Gravity was the perfect film to get the gears for geeks like my friend and I, a photographer and a geochemist, rolling with its phenomenal views of earth from space, intricate and elaborate details of the insides of space crafts, heart-wrenching portrayal of the struggles with loss, solitude, and despair of the main character, and the amazing attention to details that make the film almost believable in the problem the plot presents to her. In the end, we were left asking as we wandered out of Ward Theater in Honolulu, Hawaii, could this happen in real life? (A discussion to be had over a couple of beers and a sandwich at Big City Diner - for sure!)The intensity of Sandra Bullock's performance as the main character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is incisive. There are several moments throughout the film where the deep emptiness, loneliness, cold, and despondency that can be found in space (and that was promised in the movie trailer) really hits home. It's gut and heart-wrenching, and for those moments, even this slightly clinical observer was left with a tear in her eye. George Clooney, as Matt Kowalsky, played nicely off of the character of Dr. Stone. His is a charismatic character that appeals to the hard-worker in me - the resentful one that has yet to achieve something of greatness but is ready to be done.Add to this great acting and desperation that the plot introduces, fantastic visions of the earth and its atmosphere as viewed from outer space, and what we have is a chilling interpretation of what it is like to be completely abandoned by hope and embraced by futility in an environment that is a paradise the character cannot enjoy.This was an amazing film - the best I've seen in months.

I can almost feel the pain in the writers room while the people where coming up with ideas to get at least some conversation into the movie. This makes almost all conversation feel a bit forced, conversation to huston, talking to herself and in the end also squeezing in some conversation meant for the audience to feel some sympathy in a sleazy way.I think the story where a bit to complex to be told but the movie is still engaging threw some very good visuals.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Space. Tragedy. Survival. A Visual Masterpiece.,"Gravity (3D) - 9/10Space. Tragedy. Survival. 'Gravity' is nothing less than a visual masterpiece. None of the movies in this genre have given me such an interesting view. The only life-like viewing experience prior to this was in Imax's 'Space Station 3D (2002)'.Anyway, 'Gravity' does live up-to its name and grips the viewers for its runtime of 90 minutes. Alfonso Cuarón gives us with such a great presentation with amazing direction and beautiful cinematography. The direction is smooth and steady. Specially the first-person view. It actually feels that you are living the movie.George Clooney gives a classic performance. Who sips vodka in a god- forsaken shuttle just after the tragedy? He takes the show.Sandra Bullock has gives one of her best performances. It shows. A courageous medical engineer.There are handful of scenes that would bring a smile to your face over all the tragedy that strikes and one of them is when Phaldut Sharma, who plays Shariff (the 3rd astronaut), hums the classic 'Mera Joota Hai Japani'.'Gravity' does catch the eye. 3D effects are perfect. From the spark of fire to the drop of a tear. Full marks for 3D.All in all, a perfect visual experience with a gripping and interesting storyline and screenplay.Totally recommended!

Gravity,"A technical masterpiece, proved at the Oscars, that Alfonso Cuarón brings to us. The story is very simple, a medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in orbit.""Life in space is impossible""This sentence proves itself in the movie, it's obviously very dangerous to work in space (reparing satellites) and to land on the moon (but we did it!). It all seemed to be good until a Russian satellite is hit by a missile (on purpose by the Russians, to destroy it) but the debris of it end up hitting on Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). After the first hit. the timer is set, the debris will come, and they'll have to be prepared.The plot is pretty straight forward, but the way they pull it off is brilliant. The character development was really good. Ryan had a daughter once, but she died very young because of a stupid accident, and at some points in the movie you understand why she would give up her life, to reunite with her lost child, or simply to give up because no one will care (we can see that she is a lonely person affected by tragic events). Matt gives the idea of a experienced and very calm astronaut (much like Clooney's usual characters), but we don't know much about him except some stories he's always talking about. But it's OK, the main character really is Ryan, it's her character that's important to this movie and like Cuarón said at the Oscars, Sandra Bullock is Gravity.At some points in the movie without noticing I found myself holding my breath in certain moments. It's a claustrophobic movie. That good. The change between sound and no sound is brilliant, that's why I did that, along with the change I would hold my breath to experience the same as they would. In terms of sound mixing, like I said it was well done with the sound matching the experience of the movie. Excellent visual experience, beautiful images of the earth and surroundings, a real breakthrough in special effects, and personally the best movie yet in 3D. This is absolutely worth seeing in 3D, in fact it's necessary to obtain the full movie experience.

Great Visual Experience! 8/10,"Review: What a fantastic visual experience. I was wondering what the hell the director was going to do for an hour and a half with someone floating in space, but after watching the film, I'm very impressed. I can now see what people are going on about! Sandra Bullock deserves all of the praise that she is getting for her performance. It couldn't have been easy to show emotion whilst floating from all of the place. The director cleverly added an in depth storyline to Bullocks character which made the movie watchable for everyone. The main thing that is great about the movie, has to be how the movie looks and feels. It's extremely realistic and you really do feel the intensity and emotion throughout the movie. The director has definitely upped the bar in Hollywood. A Great Watch!Round-Up: I honestly can say that I haven't seen a movie like this before. The closest movie that I can think of was Moon which was also based on one character stuck in space, but this concentrates on Bullocks journey to earth. When the debris hit that spaceship, it really did look amazing, which made me think how great it must have look in 3D or in the cinema. Anyway, this I some of those movies that I can watch over and aver again, which is very rare for me. The only problem that I personally found with the film was the ending, but that's just me being picky.Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $708millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there emotional space movies about a woman's journey down to earth. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Visually stunning and a beautiful performance from Sandra Bullock,"I was gripped from the opening 10 seconds. It was at that time I realised there was something different about Gravity. Outside the movie theatre I wasn't absolutely sure what to go and see, and it came down to a toss up between Escape Plan and Gravity. I wasn't in the mood for what I assumed would be wisecracks, explosions and fighting, so I hoped that Gravity wold be one of those movies that really immerses you in the experience. I made the right choice; from the opening sequence I was drawn in, firstly by the visuals and then, slowly but surely by the brilliant acting of Sandra Bullock, an actress of whom I have been rather dismissive in the past. George Clooney was actually nicely understated; I think the space suits reduced the possibilities of either character being out acted, and promoted the dialogue to the fore. Having said previously I wasn't up for wisecracks, explosions and fighting I guess ultimately I got all that, but not in the traditional sense. I will go and see this movie again and rave about it to friends; the perfect timing for the perfect movie, and I say again, for me Sandra Bullock was a revelation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
3D gets a new dimension!,"Days are not quite out of sight when the human race will have residential colonies on extraterrestrial zero-gravity space stations but in its own time. And till the time, when advanced science & the technology constantly making head ways in getting breakthroughs achieve that, we have another power to experience what may suggest the future in its own waythe vision to create, replicate, reproduce and design the 'dream-come-true' ultramodern set-up into another brilliant piece of art never less than the predicted and the expected one.For Alfonso Cuaron's sci-fi thriller GRAVITY (3D), adjectives like breathtaking, heart-pounding, awe-inspiring, spine-chilling, nail-biting are not merely some words mentioned in the phrase book but an experience at large. Or else you can say that these words look just plain simple formation of random alphabets when the jaw-dropping visuals of GRAVITY happen to you in the most extraordinary way that has never been tried before. It's 'out of the world' in literal and every sense.In an unpredictably splendid scenic celestial beauty, when the crew of a space-shuttle undergoes with a critical accident caused by destruction in another satellite, 2 crew-members find themselves detached from their space-stations to float around in the vast environs of zero gravity world. Oxygen level is dropping down persistently. Connections to the base are lost. Hopes are the only survival instinct. Undying Spirit is the only way out. But aren't these the rules of earth they have left long way down?Filtering GRAVITY to extract one hero, to credit its success in the name of, will not be an achievable choice. Camera-work that makes you believe what all you see is never done in a comparatively tiny little studio covered in green, is absolutely picturesque and mesmerizing. Watch out for the opening sequence of a 10-12 min long one shot and you will be submerged into thoughts that how could they even think of it. Visual effects and the 3D technology have really gone beyond expectations. They don't just make you jump or cringe into your seats for the sake of it but they grab & grasp you firmly to enjoy every bit of it like you are in there in all of your flesh and with your entire soul.Oscar award winner Sandra Bullock earns all your emotions to be with her character in all good and bad times. Her commitment to excel is very much visible through her emoting muscles and in physical appearances also. George Clooney plays an 'out and out' charismatic astronaut who, even in the worst case scenario, doesn't lose his calm and the pleasurable flirtatious attitude. Don't miss the softer moments between themof love 'in no air'.After Stanley Kubrick's philosophical sci-fi drama '2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY', this is the most astonishing 90-min long trip to space, no one should give a miss.

An enjoyable journey,"""Gravity"" is one of the few movies that try to tell a story entirely separated from everyday life and its struggles, which it accomplishes without sacrificing emotion. The characters are thrown into a troubling scenario, doing their best to battle not some ordinary political opponent, but the distant (to the audience) threat of the lack of gravity. As the movie progresses, the brilliant special effects work truly helps us understand the dangers of floating into the unknown miles off the earth. At the same time, the subtle long takes, sparingly used by the director, convey a true sense of loneliness and desolation.However, there are still a few notable flaws in the movie. The motives of the characters are too obvious and mainstream, while the dialogues often get repetitive and base. Moreover the pacing is a bit slow to emphasize the ""emptiness"" of space, but in the end it feels like a highly energetic and immersive action script has been badly chopped down to a failed drama.Overall, Gravity is a visually pleasing experience with a unique tone some may find truly inspiring. Were it a bit longer and more complicated, it could have been a true cinematic masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Two astronauts are stranded in space after the shuttle is hit by debris,"While veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are on a routine space walk their shuttle is destroyed leaving them alone to survive the emptiness of space.The comparisons will be made, and rightly so, to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, due to the meticulous attempts of realism within the absoluteness of space. In Gravity there is a film so technically brilliant that Kubrick could only begin to comprehend the leaps that Alfonso Cuarón has taken since 1968. Cuarón has developed from what Kubrick began showing space in its realism, not only in its vastness but its emptiness and its ferocity.The film opens with a spectacular shot highlighting the nothingness of space and the insignificance we hold within it as the blackness envelopes our earth. The chaos of space is also to be marvelled at early in the film as the camera movement sends us on an unreadable journey as the space shuttle collapses and our characters are flung tumbling out of control into the blackness. There is nothing for us to hold onto and the disorientation of space only grows throughout the film. The commitment of Cuarón and his team in depicting space is shown in the exquisite sequences, whether at a merciless speed or a near stand still. It is a technical masterpiece that immerses you within its world often filming from a first person point of view to show the perplexity of outer space. It is a testament to modern technology that such an experience can be created, and the way that it is harnessed is sure to be inspirational to future filmmakers.Alfonso Cuarón's use of 3D shows how exceptional the technology can be when employed in the right circumstances. It is the depth of the picture that really contributes to the understanding of the limitlessness of space in what is a visually mesmerising work. The 3D of Gravity is essential to the film, as you need to be engulfed by the surroundings; the flat screen is not enough to create the illusion of never ending space. There is also no obstruction of the 3D to the cinematography of the film with the tantalising beauty of Earth constantly radiating in the background as a constant reminder of home. This is not a film to be experienced anywhere other than at the cinema, as the beauty and magnitude can only be transcribed across the big screen.The narrative is linear without the need to go off course, as there is enough within the immediate fear of the impossibility of surviving in space to create continuous tension. The need within Hollywood to create action and overly complicated plots is often detrimental to any character development, ending in largely soulless films. By stripping the plot down to its believable minimum in this way Cuarón creates a much more intimate character led sci-fi. There is cohesion between the technical brilliance ever present in a sci-fi film, alongside the basics of character understanding in a drama that has become all but extinct in recent years.George Clooney practically plays himself in this film as the charming veteran whose smooth and calming voice is there to bring Sandra Bullock's up tight and nervy amateur to her survival senses. Sandra Bullock is outstanding throughout the film as Dr. Stone, and is toned down to the bare bones of the helplessness of this character. The tenderness that she plays the role is what makes the performance and constantly pangs at you for her survival, especially as her character grows. Sandra Bullock manages to embody the isolation and loneliness of space that is pivotal to the way Cuarón wants to display it.

Beautifully done!,"Going in, I had some serious doubts about this movie. It looked beautiful, but every time the trailer would play in theaters, the audience would break into laughter by the end of it. It looked...silly. Sandra Bullock back-flipping into the eternal emptiness of space? Is this a comedy? For some reason, the trailers never really connected with me. I found it hard to take seriously.And then, I saw it. Forget those trailers. This will connect.From the start, the movie sucks you in. You really get a feel for the scope of outer space - it's so grand and yet so empty. Clooney puts in his usual quality work, but it's Bullock who really stretches her acting legs - literally and figuratively - and shines. The story flows well, and the tense moments will have you shaking your leg in anticipation...that forever-backflip lands a much heavier blow when you see the entire scene executed.There will be parts where you'll ask ""Are you serious? What else could happen?"", and director Alfonso Cuaron DON'T GIVE A DAMN about what you thought couldn't happen, because it's GONNA HAPPEN, especially if it's the worst possible thing that could happen. Yet, it never really gets to the point where it's so unbelievable that you're knocked out of the movie. There's a fine line being walked, and Cuaron nails it. (Although -very mild spoiler-, that ""Bullock-is-an-unborn-child"" shot? I get the symbolism, but come on...lol) Needless to say, this movie is GORGEOUS. 3D is a MUST. And 3D really compliments the multiple Bullock underwear shots. (I know, I know, I'm so classy...) Gravity scores a 4.25 out of 5 on the BDBOS. See it in 3D, and expect some nominations to roll Sandra Bullock's way after this one...(Hey guys, thanks for reading through my review, hope it helps you make a good movie decision.

One of the Best Movies of the Year and Possibly One of the Greatest of all time.,"This is my first review for this site so just bear with me, please.""Gravity"" is, with almost no doubt, the best movie of the year. (Keep in mind I have not seen ""12 Years a Slave"" yet but I have seen ""Captian Philips"" which was astonishing and brilliant in so many ways, but didn't reach the same heights as ""Gravity""). If there is ever to be a near perfect movie to be made, this is it. Everything from the acting to the visual effects is top- notch and of the highest quality. The visual effects, being the standout here, are so spectacular that many may wonder, including myself, how this wasn't actually filmed in space. The attention to the tiniest of the tiniest of detail is amazing. Every single texture, every thread sewn into their clothes, every particle of the dust floating around in the space crafts, every ray of light emitting from the sun and bouncing off the metallic objects is 100% believable. There wasn't a single moment throughout the 90 minute running time that I didn't believe what I was seeing on the screen. If you are one of the many people who get annoyed with over the top special effects (like me), this movie will be the exception. That also goes for 3D and IMAX. I hate 3D. HATE it. This movie made me realize the potential 3D has for movies in the future. It added a certain depth that couldn't be possible without it. That brings me to the opening scene, which is one of the most mesmerizing in movie history. How can I explain it? There isn't a single camera cut for the first 15 minutes of the movie. Everything you see happens in one shot. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, as it is for the entire movie, but here it really stands out. The views of the Earth from space are breathtaking (literaly!). The silence of it all really emphasizes how alone they really are in space. Throughout almost the entire film, there is no sound except for the astronaut's voices and the vibrations they feel through their suits. So, no, there are no huge explosions or crashes that shake the theater, because, there is no sound in space (anyone remember the tag-line ""No one can hear your screams in space""?). One might wonder if the movie would be boring because it would be silent the entire time, right? Actually, it is quite the opposite. Steven Price's musical score for this movie is phenomenal in every sense of the word. It takes the place of all the noises that you would normally hear in a movie. It makes you really feel a sense of genuine fear and desperateness while also protruding an enormous emotional impact at the end of the movie. This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in my life. When talking of story/plot and characters, some would argue that it could've been better. I couldn't disagree more. The plot is pretty streamlined and simple, but that's the point. It's not supposed to have a narrative that rivals ""Inception"". At it's core, this is a story about the characters. And as impressive as it is technically, this movie has an excellent development of it's characters and takes them very seriously. Sandra Bullock's character is, once again, the stand out here. Her emotional journey throughout the movie has a great affect on the audience and will stay with them long after the movie is over. I haven't enjoyed and appreciated a character arc this much in a very, very long time.I believe a lot of people are dismissing this movie as a stupid special effects money-maker. It is anything but that. Director Alfronso Cuaron (""Children of Men"") has directed yet another masterpiece that will go down as one of the greatest achievements in movie-making history.This is only the 4th movie I've ever given a perfect score of 10/10 to.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A parable on loss,"Discounting one condescending reviewer who enjoyed flaunting his high IQ and disdain for all of us parasites, my intellectual friends are missing the point. This is not a movie about physics and what is or is not possible. It is a parable of accepting loss. Anyone who has experienced loss on the level of the main character will certainly benefit from this film. As one who worked in CG I could rant on mistakes as they were aplenty, however the film left me deeply moved and reconsidering my own life. Loss of such a caliber is shattering. Moving on so very difficult. Thank you for a wonderful experience, physics boondoggles and irate high IQs who have yet discovered emotions aside, this movie has made me think about moving through pain.Spoiler: Some people felt howling seemed silly. I was stunned when that happened. Some of you may at some point in your life be so overwhelmed by grief and pain that you find yourself sitting in the bottom of the shower howling until you are horse and the water long gone cold. It is a deep, primeval response that will take you by surprise and leave you empty afterward. It is my fervent wish that you never experience it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ignore the hype and it comes crashing down to earth.,"Stunning, mesmerising, breath stealing, magnificent, (excuse the obvious pun) out of this world, quite simply one of the greatest films ever......visually. Visually. Not the best film of the month, not the best film of the year; best film in those time-lines visually? Definitely yes.The film hypnotically captures your eyes and takes them for a masterclass in special effects. Not often can i associate the word beautiful with a film, but with this, every scene draws that description. And it is one small step for special effects and one giant leap for future films to look at and study and pick at and aspire to be like (couldn't help it, sorry).Now with the deserving plaudits out the way, onto the over exaggeration. Yes it is a stunning film, but it isn't undoubtedly the best film of the year as some critics have stated; clearly jumping the gun and somersaulting onto the bandwagon. And to dismiss Oscar nominated and winning films so rapidly is a farce. In terms of UK release, we have had Django Unchained, Lincoln, Zero Dark Thirty, Man of Steel; even This is the End, Trance and Filth. These are films of the top of my head that I enjoyed more than Gravity. Now of course it is within someones opinion if they enjoyed Gravity more; but i can't see why. As i have said, visually it is hard to compete with, but in terms of acting and the story, they simply don't compete with films out previously.Sandra Bullock can be a great actress as she has shown in The Blind Side, but is there really all that much to her performance? Is there all that much you need to do in that circumstance? Now don't get me wrong, it is understandable that the process she had to go through in filming would have been tough. But in terms of emotion and versatility i found her dull. The story is stereotypical of a movie where everything goes wrong. I do hate to be judgmental of the film, but i feel the acclaim it has been constantly credited with is over the top. And the piles of praise only adds to hype and that only leads to disappointment, because it can't match the hype that has been conjured up by the hallucinating media.A great film, and worthy of the watch, but don't let the heaps of hype cannonball you onto the ever populating bandwagon that seems to be trouncing the world of films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sound Travels In Space,"So you've sat down in the dark theater or maybe in the comfort of your own home. The movie quickly brings you into the world of space where no sound can be heard. As the movie goes on you realize that the lack of sound is actually the reason you are drawn in more and attached to what little sounds you do hear. The characters are brought to life with organic sounds heard through their suits. The heartbeats and breaths they take make you hang by the edge of your seat. Will they take their last breath or will they have just enough oxygen to take one more breath and make it to the destination. The use of sound in this film is what really drew me to want to watch this film. Ultimately I would recommend it to anyone. The story line is strong, and the character development has a good pace. They don't give it to you all at once but in gradual stages. If you haven't seen this movie, go out and by it right now! You won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

"If you love space, you'll like this movie; If you like this movie, you'll love space.","I usually don't bother writing reviews when there's heaps and heaps of them already but as for this one, I thought it is so deserving and thrill filled, I'm going to thrown one in. First things first, as soon as I read the tag line ""In space no one can hear you scream"" and half way through the trailer, I wanted to watch this movie right away and I did. I'm not a fan of 3D cause it kinda gives me the headache and I don't usually enjoy them but as soon as Gravity embarked on, I changed my mind and I couldn't believe what I was watching through those glasses. I was in the front row (chose to be) and I can't tell how amazing the view of the earth from the Sky is. The CGI is so admirable and I'm sitting here wondering what they had to do to accomplish the level of realism, and the wonderful sights make you believe it IS shot inspace. So, half the time I was impressed just by the CGI, it was almost an experience in itself. The movie takes you into varied emotions and a bit of chemistry between two lost souls in space; director did a good job with the very very suspenseful story. The movie is also fairly accurate with the laws of physics except for here and there but that's OK, if you're a rocket scientist then you should probably ignore flaws and eat your popcorn, it's a movie to begin with. I don't understand some of the outright negative critiques, well, maybe it's just that they don't enjoy Space or just that they are simply emotionless.

"An excellent, well written, designed and executed movie","Many other fine people have used many words to say why they loved this film, and I pretty much agree with all of these reviewers, so rather than recover old ground, let me just say a few words about why I disagree completely with so many of the very low reviews this movie received, and leave it at that.I think i can best sum up my feelings towards these negative reviewers, all of whom I can count on for getting almost every film that i like completely wrong, (and who are all males,) by relating a question one such person asked, at the beginning of his review, ""What am I missing here?"" The movie, is my least stinging response to that question :) - Also one of the main complaints about the Physics of this film, IE why would the safety line between the two main characters be tight, is easy enough to answer... it has to do with viewpoint... IE, if the camera is moving in the same way that the objects around it are rotating, nothing appears to be moving... or as Einstein said, all objects are relative to all other objects.I would also like to note that the members of the Academy are really a bunch of tight-assed little wimps... such that when they can see that a particular movie is going to win a bunch of Oscars they will yank the Oscar for the leading lady in the film... This never seems to happen to leading men. A good example of the same exact thing happened to ""The Piano"", the last film that I really agreed with the academy on their choice of best film-director etc., except here again they yanked the obvious choice for best leading female role solely so as not to appear too partial to one particular film!Stupid choice then, stupid choice now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Only the character of Clooney makes you laughs sometimes, but when he isn't anymore, everything it's not great. I must say, the acting was really great. The only problem was the screenplay, it was pure and boooring. I don't think this is the best space movie or the best movie of 2013. Sometimes, I just could't wait to end.

A new cinema experience,"Alfonso Curon's film is just pure evidence for why we still need and should be going to the cinema. It demands to be seen on the biggest 3D IMAX screen you can be find, boasting an excellent sound system. I wish I avoided the trailers (which were essentially extended scenes) and went into this one blind. The spectacle of this film is wondrous and you find yourself deeply absorbed in the blackness of not only your massive multiplex but in the space the 3D screen provides a window towards. The film offers you some of the most incredible imagery you've ever seen upon the screen, intense survival action and great character work (Bullock's performance outside of a genre film would be heralded even more than it already is). If you didn't see this at IMAX when it came out or the biggest 3D screen you could get to I pity you, but then again you were probably told enough to do so.

"Well Crafted, but Really Hard to Believe","First of all, special effects are first rate, acting pretty good, and decent suspense. It's a likable movie that deals in scientific realities and events that ""could"" happen. Like so many films that are of this genre, we have to look at the likelihood of a single person being able to accomplish what she does. Just the punishment she takes would be enough to squash most mortals. She is smashed against bulkheads, caught in webs of detritus, oxygen starved, burned and frozen, but never into submission. I guess I can't criticize her surviving since in the story she does. There is also her ability to adapt to a setting (a Russian space ship) where she seems to know an awful lot. Granted, she is an astronaut, but her ability to adapt is beyond the pale. All that said, it's a thrill-a-minute science fiction thriller with two charismatic actors (a bit of the supernatural as well).

Isn't that alone worth the price of a movie ticket? I thought so.For once I didn't care all that much about a deep story or deep characterizations.

Deceived by IMDb--utter CRAP,"I convinced my husband to go see this movie solely based on the astoundingly high rating on IMDb.com (currently 8.6)--even though it looked absolutely pathetic in previews. I laughed when I read the ""spoiler"" disclaimer--there is no plot in this movie to spoil!! Seriously, I couldn't tell you what the point of this stupid film was.What most angers me is that it has this collective 8.6 rating on IMDb.com and we would NEVER have wasted time and money if it weren't for this site, which we trusted prior to this. I don't know who paid and how much they paid, or what favors they called in (maybe they have incriminating evidence against someone high up in the company??) to get this film rated this high. I can't imagine anyone giving this film higher than a 5 (and that would be just because they are fans of Clooney and/or Bullock). SHAME ON IMDb and/or anyone involved in perpetuating these false reviews/ratings.In comparison, these are the ratings of other space movies that are far and away better than Gravity: 2001 A Space Odyssey 8.3, Apollo 13 7.5, The Right Stuff 7.9, Moon 7.9, Sunshine 7.2, Solaris (1972) 8.0, Alien/Aliens 8.5, Armageddon 6.4 (not arguing the rating, just that it is WAAAAAYYYY better than Gravity) and lastly, Gravity is currently ranking about the same or better than all of the Star Wars/Star Trek movies--SERIOUSLY???!!!!By the end of the movie I wanted to beat myself for a) not trusting my instincts, b) sitting through one of the all-time worst movies I've ever seen (prior to this that honor was held by ""The Amazing Panda Adventure""), c) spending precious dollars--even one! for this crap and d) dragging my good sport of a husband who isn't a fan of space/sci-fi films to this show and wasting precious marriage capital!Sandra Bullock must be dragging the bottom of the barrel.

Each time I watch this film I am surprised at the amount of suspended intensity. It feels like I'm holding my breath for 50% of the run-time.

There is so much to praise here, from experiencing the weightlessness of space by Emmanuel Lubezki's floating unbroken takes...to the beautiful metaphor of birth.One of the biggest regrets of my life is not watching this in theaters.It may rely heavily on CG, and it may not have an intricately developed plot, but I firmly believe that this is one of the greatest films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Stunning in every single way possible.,"GRAVITY is a space/sci-fi film directed by Alfonso Cuaron, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.The film revolves around two astronauts, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who get drifted off into space after being hit by debris. With low oxygen levels and the possibility of death, they must work together to survive the accident and return back to Earth.So the first thing that makes Gravity so different from the rest of the mainstream movies nowadays is, obviously, its a movie that takes place completely in space, but, other that that, it has a very different tone to it. Right from when you see the trailer, you can literally see how the directer plays with your senses using the pitch and type of music along with the visual effects. Its truly amazing and eerie at the same time.I went and saw the movie, in IMAX 3D, because, well, you don't usually see a space film with a plot in IMAX, and I'm going to cut short this and just say GRAVITY IS JUST STUNNING. Thats what everyone's being saying right? But WHY?! Well here's why.The acting is just first-class. Even there are just two stars in the movie, using a green screen, they portray their character so damn well. They are one of the reasons for the intensity you feel all throughout. Sandra Bullock is one the BEST things in the film; she's as good as the special effects in this film, and that's a really high bar. You can see the fear in her eyes that seems like she's slowly losing hope but still has this unknown push to keep trying. She's just so good in Gravity and if she doesn't get nominated for an Oscar this year, I'm going to flip out. George Clooney's acting is quite decent. Throughout the film, you feel like you're in the head of Sandra Bullock's character, and whenever she's nervous, you're nervous, and to sum it up, George Clooney is the guy who keeps you, calm when you're having a panic attack. He's the smooth talker that keeps the level of intensity just to the right amount. That's another one of the best things about this film. The acting makes you feel like you're another one of the characters in space, feeling what they're feeling. Another contribution to that is the directing, because you literally feel you're right in there with Sandra Bullock.The visual effects and splendid and mind-boggling. They aren't shot with IMAX cameras so that was a bit of a letdown considering they had so much of potential with it, but the visuals make up for it and the 3D is just great, and isn't any of that post-converted crap. The directing and camera-work is great too. The way they zoom in on the face, as well as the views of the Earth. Its all just so realistic.The soundtrack is extremely suitable for the film. There's this sense of calmness yet drama in it. Its wonderful how its portrayed in the film. The film starts off with the main title flashing across the screen and the music going extremely high and suddenly it cuts to the view of the Earth and there's dead silence. Great way to get the audience involved and feeling eerie. The trailer also makes that pretty clear, and the movie just carries that message forwards.The plot is quite simple, honestly, but its the rest of the components of the film that has made the film, shine. And to be honest, I have no problems with it. The only issue that some people will find is that fact that they have no gravity-defying action stunts or some cheesy villain driving fast cars. You must have the patience to stay through every one of Ryan Stone's thoughts to actually enjoy it. It is quite slow, but its really intense and just good fun.And to that I'm going to say Gravity is just amazing. Its visually breath-taking and one of cinema's best achievements yet.GRAVITY- 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Highly derivative,"Visually stunning almost-completely throughout, I found this film hardly worth watching a first time.

What we have here is 20 minutes of movie and 70 minutes of filler.My suggestion is to turn off the audio, and treat this film like a screen saver.I give this 5 points for visuals/cinematography, 0 points for writing, and 1 point for casting two Academy Award-winners.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Liked It,"I missed Gravity when it came out, and finally caught up on it after having it on my bucket list of movies to see. Wow, did I miss out on a great one.Once again, my praise of the movie has as much to do with the amount of awful and cliché kinds of movies that continually are made and come out these days that either bore me or are an insult. Most are underwhelming and what I would refer to as ""opportunities missed"". Gravity doesn't miss. It is all it can be and I would highly recommend it.The beauty and visuals of the movie are incredible and awe inspiring, but I was also surprised that the story, acting, action, and dialogue were also very good. After seeing many survival movies where only one or two people battle nature or the elements, I had a good measuring stick for what to expect.There's Castaway and The Revenant for instance and although both these movies are good, the boredom that sets in at times due to having little instances for dialogue with others you do feel. In Gravity, the key to its' ""never boring"" take on such a solo survival story is that it's short. The movie is only 1 hour and 31 minutes long so there is never a feeling that it drags at all, unlike similar movies like the aforementioned.Gravity is intense, gripping, fun to watch, emotional, and at times sprinkles in some unexpected humor to boot. Sandra Bullock is an inspiration. This is a must see, classic, science fiction movie with some of the best cinematography of a space movie ever.

"Houston, We Have the Future of Movies","Houston, We Have the Future of MoviesAssuming the average viewer interested in seeing this film knows what it's about, I'm going to skip the plot summary—albeit brief—and jump right into how much I loved this stunning piece of art.Director Alfonso Cuarón has a knack for beauty—he directed the most magical of all the Harry Potter films, recreating the world with a dark splendor; his dystopian CHILDREN OF MEN was a cinematic wonderland; Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN was so gorgeous in its simplicity—and now he creates a quasi-horror film set in space that is so dazzling and magnificent a part of you wants to keep drifting aimlessly around the globe.The film is a thrill-ride, with a booming and heart-racing score that perfectly coincides with the tempo and action. The performances from George Clooney and specifically Sandra Bullock, who basically carries the film on her shoulders, are strong. We are with Dr. Stone (Bullock) every step—or floating inch—of the way, and we don't want to lose contact. This is the future of film, and when executed the correct way, as this film is, the thought is beyond exciting. The effects are breathtaking—but most importantly they're unnoticeable. They flow along with the film as easily as Dr. Stone does in zero gravity.Be warned—I wanted to immediately re-watch the film as soon as it was over; part of me was thankful I was on earth but another part of me was curious to take a trip around space—and perhaps get lost in it's beauty. And that's just it—the film is frighteningly seductive. But I don't mind at all. Give me more!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
space junk alludes to Earth junk,"Alfonso Cuarón's ""Gravity"" comes across as a metaphor for our own world. The debris that strikes the astronauts isn't that much different from the problems that we see on Earth, whether physical (pollution) or personal (stress). But in the end, we - like the astronauts - must face the problems directly.The movie deserved its Oscar wins for the technical categories and Cuarón's direction*. It creates a chilling feeling of isolation, much like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" did. But the bulk of the praise goes to Sandra Bullock as the embattled medical engineer: the character is the perfect balance between terror-stricken and persevering in the face of a seemingly insurmountable challenge. It's a movie that you have to see to believe. I also recommend Cuarón's movies ""Y Tu Mamá También"" and ""Children of Men"".*I haven't seen ""12 Years a Slave"", but it sounds as though that one has a much more important story. As for the ones that I've seen, ""Nebraska"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" are really good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not a movie... but an experience,"The plot of the movie is Space. That itself is a challenging part for the movie, which is depicted in a brilliant way by the Director Alfonso Cuarón. The Emptiness and loneliness of space is well presented in the movie. The breathtaking visuals and very deep scores is really outstanding and go well blended with the movie.Technical study done to take this movie is impressive. It shows the dedication put in the details of the film. A pure thriller for almost every audience. Widely based on a proposed theory called Kessler syndrome (look for this after you watch the movie), which deals with satellite chain reaction in space.Well selected casting. Impressive acting by Sandra Bullock. George Clooney performed his best in the given character sketch. The fear and expressions are well presented. Every single shot has a psychological impact in many different aspects.A must watch in my opinion for Sci-Fi lovers, space enthusiasts, Thriller .etc.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Purely compelling.,"It's not to often that a movie can artfully utilize silence and nothingness (another polarizing example is Paranormal Activity 1); such applies to Gravity, a gripping thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.the story is short and simple yet quite powerful. I won't spoil the movie (for my lack of knowledge of the plot raised my expectations), but it was a wise decision making the movie under 100 minutes leaving no room for unnecessary filler or fat.From a standpoint of my eyes, the movie is a feast to look out, using gorgeous scenery and eye-popping visuals that gives the impression they shot this movie in space. The handful of scientific accuracies doesn't hurt either.The acting is well done and realistically portrayed. Using real reactions in tense situations and some clever dialogue that slightly reveals the main characters, you stoop to their level when they are in turmoil, almost like your'e suffering or prevailing with them.You will be very pleased, and very surprised, at what you see after the leave the theater after watching this incredible film. An obvious Oscar nominee/winner in the future and perhaps a film that filmmakers will study for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Might just be the best film of the year,"As a HUGE fan of director Alfonzo Cuaron (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, which I consider the best film of the series; CHILDREN OF MEN, one of the best films of the last decade), I'd been looking forward to his outer space drama GRAVITY since it was announced. Of course, word of mouth from its film festival premieres was so incredibly good that it seemed like it couldn't possibly live up to this hype, right?Short answer: YES IT DOES.Synopsizing the film doesn't do it justice, but it follows astronauts Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a first-timer in space, and Matt Kowalski, a smooth-talking chatterbox veteran who are forced to do whatever they can to survive together after a freak shower of debris destroys their shuttle in the most hostile environment that humankind has ever visited: outer space.That's really it. The film unfolds in real time, and thanks to Cuaron's vision and the talents of Bullock and Clooney and all of the technical staff, GRAVITY is not only the best film of 2013 so far (and will likely remain so), it's also the most visually immersive and absorbing film I may have ever seen in my 36 years of remembering seeing films. At a brisk but unrelentingly intense 90 minutes, GRAVITY grabs you and it NEVER lets go. The script by Cuaron and his son Jonas isn't just filled with dialogue and action that gets you from one moment to another. It has surprises, and a significant amount of heart as it becomes slowly less about just survival and more about living life.What really does it though, and this might be where the film might suffer on home video, is the ASTONISHING use of 3D. As opposed to 99.9999% of films that are shown in 3D nowadays, which is just a shoddy post-conversion so that the studio might squeeze a few more bucks out of the moviegoer, Cuaron actually USES the 3D as part of his visual storytelling. There are moments where you literally put your hands in front of your face in order to block the oncoming debris or whatever danger you might otherwise see coming at you. This speaks more to the immersive feeling of the film than just about anything else other than the storyline, performances, cinematography, effects and musical score by Steven Price because all of these things are incredibly well- done. Bullock EASILY gives the performance of her career here, and Clooney does a brilliant job at keeping things grounded.GRAVITY is not a very subtle film, and it's not designed to be. There aren't layers upon layers of commentary like CHILDREN OF MEN, and there aren't subversive elements like in PRISONER OF AZKABAN. This is cinematic storytelling without the veneer of having to be high-minded. It's pure cinema that will terrify you, exhilarate you, and absorb you like no other film in recent memory. It's a great artist that knows when to cast aside pretense that isn't necessary and just tell a breathtaking story. Cuaron is one of those rare artists, and GRAVITY is one of those very rare films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Jaw-droppingly Spectacular; It's One Hell of a Ride!,"Jaw-droppingly spectacular; it's one hell of a ride! Alfonso Cuaron, already a well-appreciated Director of artistic genius, takes us on this incredible journey with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who gets detached from her shuttle and has to find her way back home (towards Gravity). The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film. For most of us, this is the closest we can ever get to be in space; it suspends us in a state of weightlessness along with the jeopardized astronauts.The acting by the lead, Sandra Bullock, is commendable; the natural portrayal of the character makes the situation more realistic. She single-handedly caries the movie on her shoulders. The well-timed bouts of humour by George Clooney's supporting character, the veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalsky, give us the only comic relief in an otherwise gloomy suspense thriller. The cameo by the ecstatic Indian astronaut singing around ""Mera jootha hai Japani"" in space was hilarious as well.Other than being an adventurous suspense thriller, the slow character- development helps us to form an emotional bond as well. So, by the time the movie reaches climax, you're in it as much as the heroic lead, Dr. Ryan Stone. The mesmerizingly-orchestrated meteoric-shower-like scene of the entering spacecraft, towards the end of the movie, is one of the best executed scenes of cinematic history!Whether you're a fan of science-fiction thrillers or not, whether you're a fan of 3D films or not, (to quote the lead characters from the movie) either way, it's gonna be one hell of a ride!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
I DESPISE this film,"Gravity, where do I start? Good things out of the way first, the visuals are nice...for 2013....they are good for 2013. The script is dreadful, the film is slow, painful and disgustingly dull. The characters are boring, I don't care about them in the slightest. Sandra Bullock is usually good, but here she is awful.The plot is dreadful, one of the worst I've ever seen, let's have some action, some rubbish dialogue, some George Clooney thrown in for good measure. Now it's time for the main part of the film, sorry, did I say the main part? I meant some ridiculous and dull scenes from Bullock about travelling 100 miles to the Chinese space station and then some absurdly hilarious scenes of her crying over dogs. It's pathetic, I hate this film, I hate how people somehow like it, like seals clapping along with the critics who only liked it 11 years ago because it had groundbreaking CGI.Now that its CGI has been surpassed, what does it have? Nothing. Nothing apart from a poor script, bad dialogue, bad plot and horrendous characters.2/10: Has to be up there for the most overrated film ever.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazingly manages to keep its audience engrossed for an hour and a half in space,"I would love to give ""gravity"" top marks, I really would. It is a genuinely unique movie. Set in space for 98 percent of its running time. Plus its special effects are amazing, and look completely jaw dropping on the big screen. It is a great flick I have to say, but one that relies on, and in some ways NEEDS its 3D effects to get by.To me, 3D is still a gimmick. If you've seen one 3D movie, you've seen them all. If you haven't seen anything in 3D since ""Avatar,"" then ""Gravity"" will be a wonder to behold. Unfortianly though, i've seen a lot of 3D crap since ""Avatar.""Still, the flick amazingly manages to keep its audience engrossed for an hour and a half in space. Doing this without having to resort to aliens or big fiery space ship battles. Its all about Sandra Bullocks struggle to survive in a realistic (Or at least more realistic than usual) movie version of space, and I've always had a thing for these one man shows. Especially when you find yourself genuinely rooting for this characters survival, in a creepy environment, where anything can happen.So, in short, it is great.

A film affected by Kessler Syndrome.,"'GRAVITY', its the most wonderful 3D experience of my life. I have seen a number of movies about spaceships, alien worlds etc but none of those detailed the picture of space like this one. Camera movements, light and sound were just fantastic. Sandra bullock and George Clooney,their expressions were perfect. I bet audience have also enjoyed their conversations. After watching this movie I have felt how lucky i am to be a part of this wonderful world. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron is just hilarious. It was so good that even I felt the helplessness of Dr.Ryan Stone right from my seat in the cinema hall. The scenes of collisions and explosions were equally bizarre because there were no sound(and that is normal in the space). The visual effects, extraordinary 3D effects and the thrill which have been maintained throughout the whole movie will definitely make it one of the finest creations of Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity: The Best Space Film after '2001',"Watched 'Gravity' in IMAX screen, Wadala (India). Wow, I just watched the Best Film of 2013. Even calling it a film is absolute injustice. Coz it isn't a film, it's actually an experience, more of a space ride. Yes, after the movie was over, I couldn't walk comfortably because my mind was spinning just like the astronauts in the film. The whole film is set in space, two astronauts are left stranded outside their spacecraft and then its all about how they struggle to reach Earth. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock give their career's best performance especially Bullock. The movie engages you, hooked up to the screen with its amazing visuals of space that even blinking your eye is forbidden. For every 2-3 minutes you'll say 'wow'. This movie will surely fetch all the major technical awards at the Oscars especially Visual Effects, Cinematography, Sound Effects, Background score and Editing. If Sandra Bullock doesn't get an Oscar nomination for her performance then I will lose all my faith in the Oscars. I seriously recommend everyone to watch it in IMAX, even if its thrice the normal ticket price or if its far for you to travel. You'll be amazed and will cherish the film even after hours walking out of the screen. Truly the Best Film of the year. Rating: 11 out of 10! Yes, you read it right!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Promising but way too cheesy in the end,"I went to see ""Gravity"" this evening in the cinema and came out with mixed feelings. I don't want to give anything away so let's say ""Gravity"" is pretty much ""Open Water"" in space.While the CGI is very impressive, the set itself is kind of minimalistic. The build-up of tension is also very well made and the film has you on the edge of your seat more than once. That's probably where everybody just seeking a thrill can drop out - the movie definitely delivers.What really bothers me is the melodramatic undertone of the whole thing. It starts with the sound effects during collisions in space. Why bother mentioning that there is no sound in space at the beginning of the film when you don't let the pictures of destruction run in absolute and horrifying silence afterward but use all the methods of dramatization like synthi-horns etc. instead? For me, it takes away a large portion of atmosphere against the background of this very special setting.Music is generally a big problem of this movie. There is music that is a vital part of the scenery in a film (e.g. The Sining) and there is music that is nothing but a suggestive instrument to arouse emotion (e.g. any given patriotic action movie). Unfortunately ""Gravity"" uses the latter and thereby loads the otherwise cold and deadly solitude of space up with a ""feel this, feel that..""-music that doesn't fit at all. The score makes this film really laughable at times and I have to say that ""Open Water"" made many things a lot better, simply by sticking to the horror such a situation bears itself.Concentrating on the deadly silence of space would have made this film great but it really falls victim to the overly dramatic use of music. Judge for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
How long can you hold your breath?,"One after another, Hollywood churns out films that are either sequels, prequels, remakes, or reboots. It seems there is a real problem with writers these days, as the ability to make anything original seems to be in very short supply. Want to make a summer blockbuster? Put a costume on, spend some time setting up a story, and then spend sixty minutes blowing everything up. Superman, World War Z, Elysium, and Iron Man 3 would be some good examples. All these films were visually satisfying, but for this viewer, emotionally empty. Which is not to say that I didn't enjoy all of them in some way, along with the popcorn and Milk Duds.Now we have Gravity, and instead of characters who are larger than life, we have Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone. Maybe that's a key here...the lead is a woman, and while men are logical, women are emotional. So it's easier from that standpoint for an audience to build an emotional connection. Stone is any of us, if we somehow were brilliant enough to make it in to Space, yet she still crashed the simulator, every time. We can relate.So why do I think this movie is a 10? It really isn't perfect. How much abuse can a person's body take without breaking? This, like many other films, subjects its stars to some serious body blows. There are things that are repeated in its zippy 90 minutes. Still, it had me holding my breath, literally, more than any film since Hurt Locker. Gravity had me feeling that I was there with Ryan Stone as all hell was breaking loose, and I believed that it was possible to survive, to keep living...to tell you a story.

A modern masterpiece,"Gravity is a film I've been looking forward to for a ridiculously long amount of time. It's essentially about two astronauts who struggle for survival after floating debris collides with their spaceship, leaving them detached and adrift in space. It's not so much sci-fi as it is drama-thriller, and when I say ""thriller"" I don't mean that lightly. It was literally the most stressful 90-minutes of my life, but I was in awe of every second of it.Cuarón, who directed, co-wrote, produced, and even helped edit the film, hasn't done a full- length feature since 2006's bitingly poignant Children of Men, but Gravity was well worth the wait. It's one of the best-directed films I've ever seen. Cuarón's use of incredibly long takes sucks the viewer in so that they physically cannot turn away. The film starts out with a 17- minute shot—no editing, no cuts. It's just the camera moving from one subject to another, in-and-out, close up and far away—all over the place, really. Space is limitless, and so is Cuarón.It's tough to appreciate just how masterful this film is until you see it for yourself. Being set miles above earth's surface, every single take is absolutely gorgeous. The visuals are stunning, and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is some of the best work I've ever seen, with Steven Price's electric and ethereal score only adding to the tense atmosphere. The earth itself turns into a character, and it's used brilliantly all the way up until the very end.As for the performances, well, there are really only two significant roles. George Clooney plays a veteran astronaut out on his last mission, and serves as a form of moral support to Sandra Bullock's character—Dr. Ryan Stone—who's up on her very first mission. Clooney does a fine job and is an integral part of the plot line, but it's Bullock who utterly dominates the screen time, giving a fearless and absorbing performance like never before.It's by far the best work of her career—Dr. Stone is so real that it's scary. You laugh when she laughs, you cry when she cries, and you're breathless as she's struggling for air. The emotions that Cuarón was able to elicit from her truly pull you into the film and make this an experience like no other. While the script isn't necessarily the best written, and most certainly skims the line of oversentimentality at times, those issues are secondary to the visuals and performances themselves.It's truly an out-of-body experience, and probably the closet most of us will ever get to actually being in space.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Fantastic visuals, stilted writing","""Gravity"" is worth your money just for the opening scene. In a world where movies are plagued by directors/producers who think any shot longer than .5 seconds is dreadfully boring (yes you, Michael Bay), keeping the camera perfectly steady for at least two minutes is an amazingly daring approach that turned out to be a brilliant fetch. It immediately captures your attention by doing everything Hollywood hates (that's ironic, but not very), it's a magnificent opening. There are more breath-taking scenes spread throughout the movie, visually it's an amazing experience and it actually shows us that movies like these can be made for other reasons than just to show of new technologies. The technical side is amazing, but it's also functional, and that's something a lot of movies seem to forget. In the second half however, this movie's flaws really come into play. The screenplay is just really mediocre, when you take away how fantastic the movie looks it's really just a basic tearjerker with an absolutely terrible ending. The character development doesn't flow at all, it's just thrown into there as forcibly as possible as they kinda hope nobody notices. What's the significance of Bullock's character losing her child anyway? Isn't being lost in space with no oxygen enough drama to keep the plot going? I stared in awe at the first half, but the second half just doesn't add up. Movie of the year? Visually yes, but I don't know if that's enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The New 2001: A Space Odessey?,"Few cinematic experiences are quite as immersive or as complete as Gravity, the tightly developed and much-hyped space drama by writer/director Alfonso Cuarón – and the director's first movie since 2006's highly acclaimed Children of Men.With Gravity, Cuarón gives audiences a vastly different experience than he has before, one so unique in its presentation that it's curious any studio would finance it (to the tune of $80 million) and give it a wide release. Warner Bros. took that chance, and early buzz indicates it might pay off.And yet there's something familiar about Gravity, especially within the science fiction genre. Anyone who has enjoyed a small-cast science fiction film – say, the Sam Rockwell vehicle Moon, or the horror classic Alien – will similarly like Gravity, which epitomizes the sub-genre. It follows a medical engineer on her first mission to low-Earth orbit (Sandra Bullock) and a nearly retired veteran astronaut (George Clooney) as they struggle to survive floating untethered in space after a barrage of debris violently destroys their spacecraft. A title card in the film's opening frames sets the stakes: ""Life in space is impossible.""Except for a few transmissions with mission control (voiced by Ed Harris) and some quick, jarring shots, Bullock and Clooney comprise the film's full cast. It's just the two of them in stark contrast with the infinite and hostile vastness of space, low on oxygen and fuel, struggling to make it to safety. Turns out there isn't a lot of that in space.The film begins with a single extended shot that lasts – so I've read; I didn't time it – some 17 minutes. Cuarón is a master at the extended shot (the one-take war shot near the end of Children of Men was one of the last decade's best scenes), and Gravity is full of them, but the beginning is striking. It starts quietly, serenely, with gorgeous shots of Earth and space, as Cuarón plays with the lack of stable perspective inherent in zero-G, but once the action starts, it doesn't stop. There are plenty of nerve-wracking moments and a number of shocks and surprises, with some of the tensest moments saved for the final scenes. But to say much more would diminish the fun of this movie.Gravity is a technical masterpiece on all fronts, an all-out sensory blitz with deft, cleverly utilized sound editing and production. (My favorite touch was at a moment when Bullock hits her head hard, followed by several stressful seconds of ringing.) And the attention to detail is mesmerizing, with Cuarón making only a few minor physics missteps – mostly necessary, even intentional, in order to advance the plot. Clocking in at just 90 minutes, the film doesn't spend a lot of time ruminating on philosophy, which is perhaps a missed opportunity. But it feels tight: Every scene, every frame, is necessary to tell the story, and every aspect of the film's production works in concert to create one of the most engrossing films audiences are likely to see.But it's the film's astonishing visuals that make it so thoroughly captivating, thanks to some amazing special effects and the camera-work of frequent Cuarón and Terrence Malick collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki. Astronauts who have caught early screenings have said that Gravity is the closest they have felt to being in orbit without leaving Earth. If you lean back and let yourself get lost in the cinematography, you'll feel the same. I've never felt so immersed in a film as I did watching Gravity. This is definitely a movie to catch in 3D.It's still early in awards season, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Bullock, Clooney and Cuarón were expanding their award shelves in anticipation. On many fronts, Gravity is probably the year's best movie to date, and if you don't pick too many nits about orbital physics, you will likely agree. Just get lost in the experience, and be sure to unclench your fists when the credits start rolling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Sandra Bullock and George Clooney made me sit on the edge of my seat more than once in this movie. I honestly don't care if it is realistic or not, it's most probably not, I just wanted to be entertained and that's exactly what I got, entertainment. Visually it's just perfect, as the CGI's make you feel like you're in space yourself. The soundtrack brings a special atmosphere to the movie so that was also good. Am I surprised Gravity won seven Oscars? Absolutely not! Gravity deserves all their Oscars as this movie is one of the best of 2013.

A masterpiece without no doubt.,"Before this I only watched two films that was directed by Alfonso Cuarón. One which is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the second is Children of Men. Both of these films especially Children of Men is really one of the great cinematic masterpieces made by Alfonso Cuarón. The only films that I've seen he produced is, his collaborations with Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. Pan's Labyrinth was also a great films with stunning visuals and story. Nevertheless, what Alfonso Cuarón produced is not important here. It is the direction and writing from Alfonso Cuarón and Jonás Cuarón that what makes me loves Gravity.By only seeing his two films, I can honestly say that I loves Alfonso Cuarón films. I knew Gravity back when I saw the poster at my local cinema. Immediately I saw Alfonso Cuarón name on it. After that, I watched the trailer and I am impressed with the visuals shown in it. To be honest, the less you know about the film, the better.The film starts out by showing fantastic view of the world accompanying with the dazzling score made by Steven Price. In the intro comes Dr. Ryan Stone who is played by Sandra Bullock and Matt Kowalski who is played by the handsome George Clooney. Both of them including the third astronaut who's an Indian played by Paul Sharma, are on to do their duty. Here, film also shown a glimpse of graphic violence which prove a bit unsettling for some viewers.The films starts to build up the suspense and thrills when the debris from a satellite crashes into the space shuttle Explorer, destroying most of it and leaving them stranded in space with limited air. A moment of silence used in the films is also spot-on. Every moment of silence in the film is well used. I also noticed there's a plenty of continuous shot used in Gravity. From moment to another moment, most of the shot used by Alfonso Cuaron is a long and continuous shot. That kind of shot is what makes Gravity more authentic and breathtaking. The view of the world from the space is just simply astonishing.Scene after scene shows the hardness of survival from the aftermath of the debris that hit them. George Clooney performance is well enough to be mention as well as showing the funny element in the film. As for Sandra Bullock, her performance is great. She shows the emotions and acts to survive. Her struggle, determination and persistent is what best to describe her performance in the Gravity.The plot in the film itself is not that deep, and it is more straight forward but in the mean time, this does not mean the film story is not good. Gravity is one of the most well crafted film made by an impressive filmmaker. The film stunning visual, should be credited to cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, in which it keeps me attached to my seat right along with the astronauts. Gravity is the closest we will ever get to the real deal of being in the deep space. The physics shown in Gravity makes you realize that this film is very hard to make and we can see there's a lot of effort is put to make the film.The only flaw this film had, is just a small bit which is on the ending. But I don't want to spoil anything here.Overall, Gravity is one of the most impressive visual films I've seen so far this year. If you are a fan of space drama such as Moon or Sunshine or Kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey, you'll love Gravity. The build up of the suspense, the thrills, the emotions shown and the scores is what makes Gravity one of the best films in this year for me. The authenticity in the movie is just top notch. In the end, Gravity shows that in life we need gravity. It is vital as we're humans need it just like air to breath. Oxygen and gravity is the science elements of life that we need to prosper. In Gravity itself shows there's a lot of message in it. It is showing to us that gravity is an essential part in life in order to live.To conclude, Gravity is one of the great films I've seen so far this year. If you like sci-fi and space drama with an exceptional visual and great acting plus great story, give Gravity a try. It should be appreciate as a great masterpiece without a doubt. Credit should be given to Alfonso Cuaron because of his direction, Sandra Bullock for her strong performances, Emmanuel Lubezki for the stunning cinematography in the film and also the rest of the crew.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Beyond Extraordinary,"Films like Blackhawk Down attempt, through the art of the film-maker, to bring the viewer into the experience of something that is planned a certain way yet goes horribly wrong.That said, what this extraordinary piece of film art has in common with Blackhawk Down, and most other films of that genre, is pretty much nothing.Because in Gravity the writer/director started with the same theme (something planned that goes horribly wrong) and transformed, transfigured, morphed, it into a story that defines the very best aspects of what it is to be human; to be alive.I have done a fair number of reviews for IMDb but I confess I am humbled by this one.The technicals? Sound, direction, settings, special effects, editing. Perfect. Better than I have ever seen. You know you are looking at someone's idea of what it is to be in deep space, and the cynic in you keeps trying to find flaws, stunts that do not work. But there are none to be found. Perfect.Now the acting. Perfect again. Bullock has never given a better performance in her career and - no disrespect -- may never surpass this one. There is a throwaway line late in the film -- what used to be called an ""aside"" in stage plays -- which reads in the script, ""I hate space."" It is tribute to her work here that she not only nails the line but after you leave the theatre (or close the DVD) you cannot imagine any other actor doing that line and making it work as well.Clooney? During the run of the original CSI VEGAS, the producers were embarrassed by surveys showing that ""Grissom"" was the boss most Americans wanted to work for, regardless of their job or where they lived.After watching this film, and even though he has minimal screen time, AND ONLY A FEW MOMENTS OF FACE TIME, George Clooney is like the only person you would want to call if you were in a dangerous situation and needed counselling. That's how good he is.And just when you think this perfect film could not get any better, you get an ending that makes you cry, laugh, and wince all at the same time.Extraordinary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
More effects and technology than acting opportunities,"I am not an eager follower of sci-fi movies / space dramas without real enemies to fight, and the reasons I decided to watch Gravity were good actors and short duration (the latter is uncommon for such movies); true, I had read about high praise, but I did not get it under my skin :) Therefore, I observed a pleasant and talented actress Sandra Bullock and her similar counterpart George Clooney in the course of their actions... They did well as usual - although Bullock had much bigger role and I recalled similar Clooney from Solaris - and everything was decent/good, but no wow! feeling... As for the plot/script, even for me as non-physicist, there were too many odd phenomena, and floating Post-It notes and pens in the spaceship seemed more like a practical joke. Of course, cinematography and directing are well done, but all in all - with no new angles in the script and the ending's predictable nature, I am unable to consider it conceptional in the movie industry, just a well-polished creation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Gravity is all cinema should be.,"Gravity is all cinema should be. Perilous, contradictory, cathartic, insightful. It's a film about everyone and a film about just one person. It results in a film that's at once the biggest scale film possible and incredibly intimate and personal. This is a rare event to be treasured. After one of my all-time favourite films Children of Men, the brilliant sensual Y Tu Mama Tambien and the best of the Harry Potter films Prisoner of Azkaban, it was quite clear that Alfonso Cuaron is a talented director who will stand the test of time. Which meant he was free to take his time as it seemed like we were waiting forever for Gravity, coming 7 years after we last saw him. I read the script while it was still playing the festival circuit and even on paper, it was compelling, moving and unpredictable. Even though I knew what happens, I couldn't have been more excited and the hype was the highest it's been for a film in a long time.And what a total full-body full-soul roller-coaster it was. Like the rest of the world, I had tears in my eyes the whole time with my jaw dropped in awe and my breathing in sync with its protagonist. It captures the human condition in all its physical and meta-physicality. Needless to say about its true star, this is most likely the best visual effects there's ever been. It seems every year we're going to get a special effects laden blockbuster from an auteur that innovates the technology, gathers all the technical Oscars and attempts to use it to its full artistic potential. Sometimes that potential is limited, with Martin Scorsese's Hugo and James Cameron's Avatar disappointing. Sometimes that potential is pretty good, with Ang Lee's Life Of Pi and Christopher Nolan's Inception satisfying enough. But it's never been quite as extraordinary as Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity.Combined with the careful and stunning use of sound design and Emmanuel Lubezki's thrilling and intelligent cinematography, its conviction provides a convincing and heart-pounding experience. It has ideal pacing as it stays suspenseful yet is able to breathe. There's a priceless excitement and cinematic magic with excessively unbroken shots that films of all genres indulge in, but Gravity takes it to another level in its shots that last over 15 minutes. Sure there was undoubtedly extensive post-production work involved to stitch shots together but that work was meticulous that you can't help but get swept away in the illusion. In the IMAX, saw a trailer for the next Hobbit film beforehand and I immediately regretted what I had gotten myself into. 3D just doesn't seem ready to do justice to its name. I only ever enjoyed it once and that was Toy Story 3, where the filmmakers had control of all the layers.However, Gravity may be the first live-action 3D film I've seen to actually make it work. Life Of Pi may have deserved some of its acclaim, but it only worked in certain shots. That's because not all the layers were designed for 3D. Gravity has the benefit of having very few layers - often it was only astronaut and/or space station, Earth, background resulting in more control and less to get in the way. In the script the distances between things were often miles apart, but with nothing to obstruct the view. 3D enhances that sense of scale and makes it immersive and utterly visceral. Even now, life still feels so small scale in comparison. Despite its limitations of plot and character, it's extremely rewarding that Gravity is a film where every viewer takes something different and valuable away from it. Whether it be about a woman's plight with gravity, the human instinct of perseverance or simply having a story to tell.The idea that stuck with me most is the acceptance of death. If not now, if not in an hour, then anytime in the future. It's something that has always motivated art and Gravity hits the spot. While it is thanks to the depth of the writing in such an action packed film, reading the script didn't have the same effect. It's due to Sandra Bullock's committed performance. There's a lot to admire in Bullock and George Clooney's performances. The way Gravity was shot required them to repeat actions to the milli-meter. For them to still incorporate soul into their characters with such restrictions requires genuine talent, and although I skipped The Blind Side, I definitely believe in Bullock. That said, Clooney is getting a lot of the complaints in that he's irritatingly 'just being Clooney.' While I feel I can defend that in the level of precision required in every take that the fact he does 'just do Clooney' is a feat in itself, the film does suffer from its Hollywood cheese-charm dialogue. It does add an essential flavour in the otherwise sparse film, but its timing is the problem, and often it feels inappropriate.Unfortunately, that 'Americanised' appeal added to the film also damages the score, that too often feels invasive and manipulative. It's a great score, but it needed to be dialled down a few notches for a more subtle and graceful effect. Regardless of these minor inconsistencies, Gravity is an instant iconic film for the ages. It may be another special effect heavy film that will most likely play second fiddle to something more to the Academy's taste, assuming the predicted 12 Years A Slave/Gravity love split stays strong til Oscar night, but this time it's a completely worthy one. Even detractors have to admit, in many ways Gravity is simply astonishing. However, the concern is - how will it fare on DVD? Is this exclusively a 3D IMAX experience? We'll have to wait a few months to find out but I urge anyone to witness it in that way rather than tablets and phones. Now I'm going to find an even bigger screen to watch it again.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Perfect Movie,"There is not a thing that I would change about Gravity. It's straightforward, and its execution is flawless. This film accomplishes two things so well that it deserves praise, it makes you feel great about being in a theater, and it makes you happy to be aliveIf you've heard anything about this movie already, you've heard something alluding to how it makes you feel like you're in space, how stunning it looks, visuals, etc. and its true. Having seen Transformers in IMAX and Resident Evil in 3D, huge wastes of money, Gravity reinvigorates the need and greatness of 3D and IMAX that Avatar promised. Gravity not only joins the field of best 3D movies, but directly challenges for its top spot. Gravity hit closer to home. Cuaron just chose a simpler more realistic plot, didn't waste any time with annoying filler (its only 90 minutes), and reminded us that going to the theater is sometimes really, truly worth it.This simple premise, of escaping earth for just a moment, tapped into so many themes relating to individual human experience, that it created an unexpected rush and excitement that most action movies can't even accomplish. One of the more important themes that is felt throughout is the choice of truly WANTING to live. The main character has a tragic past, and has simply been carrying on in life without any hope or joy anymore. Suddenly, she is faced with the option of a beautiful death: the truest, darkest, quiet, easy fade into nothingness. And our main protagonist must dig deep into herself to choose to live or not. This kind of theme may have been approached before, but Gravity truly makes you FEEL it.I will definitely return to watch it again. Beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
I couldn't see anything unconventional in this film except a few beautiful shots,"I saw the movie in IMAX 3D (despite the fact that I am not a fan of it) and the experience itself was effective, yes, but the film was not. The film was visually beautiful, but not that dazzling except two scenes (the beginning and the ""octopussy-like cords"" scene. Honestly, as said despite I found the movie visually beautiful, it was not a jaw dropping visual feast in contrast with the hype. For example, The Tree of Life was much better visually or Holy Motors. In terms of ""space experience"", I prefer Into The Darkness as a recent sci-fi film (it was not perfect, but near perfect as a sci-fi blockbuster) and 2001 from the past, the mother of all sci-fi movies. Children of Men is a masterpiece for me, and it was a brilliant film from a genius director, but I couldn't see or feel that in Gravity. The idea is brilliant, but the movie is not unconventional to carry this idea. This is not an offbeat film, there are just a few ""different"" angles and shots, the editing in some scenes is impressive, but all these are technical aspects of the film, so is this enough? What about the story, what about the decisions (some silly decisions) of the characters, what about their motivation or what about their weird reactions just to affect or manipulate the audience? I am a Clooney fan, also I really like Mrs. Bullock (when I was a kid, I fell in love with her when I watched The Demolition Man), so seeing these people in the movie was a joy for me, but after a while, the movie turned into a conventional space drama thriller like Apollo 13 or even Red Planet (by the way Apollo 13 is a great film), but wasn't this movie supposed to be an offbeat space film? or at least an original film? Just the idea is original here, not the execution or the story, especially the development and the conclusion part of the story are pretty typical. The atmosphere could have been more uncanny, the situations could have been more suspenseful, the story could have been darker and the story could have been more mysterious. The spiritual background of the film was not that deep, just a few obvious symbols and themes, that's all. The movie was rather far-fetched than being subtle in transferring emotions and ideas, also it was rather ""mechanic"" than a thrill-ride. This is not a psychological film, because there is no time for that, the film was too short maybe and I didn't find the film inspiring including the finale. Gravity is not the new ""A Space Odyssey"".",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Both Clooney and Bullock put on a great show in Gravity. With Sandra Bullock actually putting on an acting clinic at times that I, for one, never gave her credit for in the past. Without spoiling the movie for anyone, I will tell you that these two are the only people you see on screen, with the rest of the very short cast list appearing in voice form only. the director Alfonso Caron once proofs again that he is one of the smartest guys in Hollywood. i had really no expectations, but believe me: after this space-classic you will look differently to the sky!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Going to space would be cool, right?","It's every kid's dream to go into space and one day venture into our Universe.

The black space full of stars was now filled with shrapnel headed towards you at very fast speeds. What if you no longer had no control over yourself?Gravity is an excellent movie with arguably Sandra Bullock's best performance of her career. With George Clooney as the perfect co-astronaut, the exceptional casting in this film definitely helped. The thought of wandering the Universe and exploring the unknown ends is a dream to some while drifting away without end is a nightmare for others.Overall, Gravity is a great film due not only to its superb special effects or compelling acting, but because it strokes the strings in every person's heart for adventure and thrill.

Gravity for your eyelids,"Open Water in Space, i guess: A lame story which fits on a coaster stretched to the excess before people would get bored to death. All solely carried by visual effects. The problem here, to convey the infinity wideness of space to the audience, you need a reference point, otherwise, all you could show is a black background with little light dots on. Obviously, you have to show the only reference point available over and over again: the Earth from 400 km above, and what you see is more or less the same, for 90 min..And, honestly, Sandra Bullock in a space suit doesn't give me the slightest impression of what it would mean, to be in such a situation as an astronaut. Either you see a white space suit in front of the Earth, spinning around, or, you see a face from inside the helmet of a space suit.The 'drama'-plot could be easily translated to someone being captured in a small room anywhere, that the whole thing happens in Space does not make any difference, plot-wise.The possible ways to get rescued are crystal clear, either someone picks you up or you die. And if this wouldn't be boring enough for the viewer, there's only one possible way to die, no sharks, or whatever...and you can't die from being attracted by gravity!

"Great film, don't listen to the wannabe geeks and hipsters","1. how many self-proclaimed geeks have attacked this movie with flimsy arguments about the science behind it. They must have hated ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and just about every film set in space ever. Note to self: Never listen to a self-proclaimed geek when it comes to movies.2. A number of hipsters have submitted reviews critiques that criticize the plot or dialogue. What did they expect? A conspiracy? Wow people have really lost touch with the meaning of survival in this post-modern era. One reviewer complained ""CSS doesn't exist"", to which I say, nor did the USS Enterprise (Star Trek), or the Discovery 1 (2001). At least the CSS is actually in the works in the rel world. Reviewers who don't understand the concept of FICTION probably shouldn't be making them about fiction films.The movie was spectacular. First, the physics of zero-gravity and space travel were spot on; probably the best ever on screen. Second, the plot was moving...not because there were conspiracies or fantasy elements, but because it was more about human survival and perseverance in the most inhospitable environment known to man. Bullock was surprisingly good out of her normal role as a romantic interest of some rich New Yorker. Clooney was both firm (as a mission commander) and comical (as a human) which helped the film get going and, in a wise move by the director, his role was surprisingly short in the film, dampening any negative aspects of his character. While perhaps not perfect, this film was damn close. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Ignore the BAD reviews - this is a thinking person's epic sci-fi movie,"You know, sometimes people are so fickle. I would like to laugh at people who turn their noses up or just feel they need to be heard and state an opinion so contrary to popular opinion so as to appear to be enlightened thinkers.Even if you do not like the movie because it's not to your taste, there is absolutely NO way you could give it one out of ten.I personally give it a nine because I'm a little bit loathe to calling anything perfection.Let me tell you what it is that I like about the film and why I rated it on par with common held belief. No, it's not because I'm a sheep.The absence of dialogue and the apparent lack of action action give your eyes time to feast on the visuals and your brain to agonise over how in the hell the crew were able to simulate the conditions of space. The way the camera passes through Sandra Bullock's helmet, for example and allows you to see the telemetry on her visor is, although minor, a breathtaking effect that takes you from first person perspective to onlooker seamlessly yet transports you from the confinement of the space suit to the immense darkness of space itself. I'm not sure which perspective was more terrifying but having the benefit of both views enhanced the suspense that was unfolding.For those who scoff and say that it was unrealistic, what do these people want? Of course the final scene is implausible (not going to give anything away here) but I found myself on the edge of my seat.The long shots are jaw dropping and the flowing nature of the direction really draws you in to sharing the weightlessness and disorientation of the astronauts.The major surprise for me is that the director showed his complete lack of arrogance by not prolonging the film for any longer than in needed to me. 90 minutes for a movie of this budget must be unheard of but in this case, less is certainly more. James Cameron would have found at extra hour of ""filler"" from somewhere.I, for one, will be going to see this movie again on the weekend just to pick up on all the stuff I missed the last time.For those who didn't like the movie, I suggest they go watch a film with gratuitous violence and a couple of nude scenes.If your idea of a complete filmgoing experience is to leave the theatre perplexed and spend the next 2 hours with friends discussing the drama that unfolded, this is a perfect movie for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Fresh and Gripping; Space Masterpiece,"""Gravity"", the movie that's been talked about for quite a few months now, is something unlike any other. It has extremely beautiful shots, dazzling visuals, gripping narrative, and fantastic music. Alfonso Cuaron, director of the third ""Harry Potter"" film, has a guaranteed a spot as one of the masters of film-making with this film.Set in space, a very intriguing setting, ""Gravity"" is a survival thriller about bio-medical engineer Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone and astronaut Matt Kowalski and their exciting tale in space as debris from a Russian anti-satellite test creates a chain of destruction that damage their space shuttle and leave them stranded in space.The movie is pure thrill. There are so many unexpected situations and each of them is memorable. The suspense starts fairly quickly when their space shuttle is hit by high- speed debris. The music elevates the tension and therefore, each of the suspenseful scenes never fails to please the crowd. Dying and getting lost in space is quite a terrifying scenario and terrible way to end one's life, and therefore, you're going to be on the edge of your seats as the action ensues.The visuals were magnificent. Space is intriguing and this movie provides plenty of space panoramas. We see different parts of the Earth from space and it's just splendid. I also loved that the shots were long, instead of short unsatisfying ones. The scope of the setting is massive, and this is meant to be seen in a large screen, possibly IMAX. The 3D is pure enhancements and it's definitely recommended.""Gravity"" doesn't have too many characters to play around with. Instead, we focus on Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone, the female protagonist of the story. The other leading guy is Matt Kowalski, portrayed by George Clooney. By not having too many characters, we get to take a look inside these characters, really get to know them and this film does it, especially with the character of Dr. Ryan Stone.The movie is headlined by two Academy Award winning actors and they are nothing short of excellent here. Bullock is so good in portraying the role of Dr. Ryan Stone here. She brought all the emotions here and was great. George Clooney was also impressive as the slightly cocky Matt Kowalski (although his role is less compared to Bullock's). They are experienced actors and this film shows just how professional they are.Brilliant. That's the word for the film ""Gravity"". Never before have I seen something like this. It's gripping, it's beautiful, and perfect. This year has not been a very successful year for sci-fi but ""Gravity"" is different from the rest. It may contain more drama but it is nothing short of spectacular. Not all will find the brilliance but older audiences should discover just how magnificent this film is.

Good But A Tad Over-hyped,"Visually stunning...but Claustrophobic! I had the urge to walk out after 10 or 15 minutes, not because it was bad, but because you really do feel like you're in space.

Just the right amount of CGI, which, after the usual blockbuster overkill of ""things moving everywhere on the screen,"" I appreciated. You feel the vastness and silence of space, and it's not someplace I want to be. Not sure what folks are thinking about Sandra Bullock's performance being ""Oscar-worthy.""

'Gravity' will probably be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I'm honestly praying it wins.,"'Gravity' is about two astronauts who are stranded in space as their space shuttle is destroyed by space debris coming from a destroyed satellite. They must struggle to survive and get back to earth before it's too late. I have never seen a film quite like this before. It's visually stunning and has a very emotional element to it that is hard to ignore. I must say, lots of tears were flowing from my eyes. The cinematography is breathtaking. The whole movie felt like I was actually in space with these two astronauts, experiencing what they were experiencing as they tried to get back home.I saw 'Gravity' in I MAX 3D, which is probably the best format to see it in. The 3D was perfect, and this is coming from a guy who hates 3D. There are only a few films I have seen that actually worked in 3D and this definitely tops them all. Most of the films setting is in space, and I must say, the visuals were absolutely astounding. Every details of space seemed to have been made to absolute perfection. An Oscar for visual effects will be given to this film. If it's not, I've lost hope.Steven Price's score was the best I've heard in awhile. It's definitely one I'd love to listen to on an off day. The music really made the movie just that much more emotional. Alfonso Cuaron is well known for directed 'Children of Men' and 'Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban', so we know what the man is capable of. His talents are put on display more than ever in this film. He also wrote the screenplay, which is really well written. There's only so much you can talk about while in space, but the screenplay was perfect with such an emotional impact.I've always had a soft spot for Sandra Bullock. She always gets to me, whether it would be making laugh or making me cry. She knows how to tell an emotional story and make you feel impacted by it. Her performance in this was amazing, with her ability to make me laugh and cry at the same time. I've never seen anything like this from her before. George Clooney was also great in this film. He played a calm and more laid back character. He has some great one liners as well.'Gravity' will probably be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I'm honestly praying it wins. The film was visually and emotional breathtaking and is something that shouldn't be missed. I was originally not going to see it, but decided to take a chance. Thank God I did. I recommend 'Gravity' to someone who just wants to watch a great film. I guarantee you will be in awe throughout the film. The runtime is perfect. At just an hour and a half, you will leave the theatre satisfied. I'm happy that I'm getting to see all these great films. Usually, I skip out on them to go see the blockbusters. I guarantee that won't happen anymore.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great visual experience with minor momentum moments.,"Gravity is an instance visual experience with great performances from Oscar winning actors and occasional silliness that can kill the momentum. Sandra Bullock brings her A game both in acting and in the physique department sending a clear message to young Hollywood lionesses that she is still the head huntress.Clooney is as usual killing it for all us single guys with his suave persona and wine-like looks that seem to get better with age. His calm yet imposing demeanor makes him a good mentor figure, guiding Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) through an almost hopeless situation. The back and forth between the two was a pleasant distraction from impending disaster. Like in any disastrous situation, the experienced will calm and guide the rookies throughout the ordeal. The conversation between the two reveals a sad story of Ryan Stone's life which made it easier to sympathize with her and root for her even more.Gravity looks absolutely breathtaking and for the first time I sat through a 3D movie without headaches, or constant struggle between 3D and my actual glasses for space on the bridge of my nose. The movie does 3D right, creating an immersive environment in which dodging space debris almost feels instinctive. The ever presence of Earth in the backdrop is both scary and humbling, creating an odd sense of wonder and insignificance.Gravity could have been a near perfect movie if it didn't have some momentum killing moments. There were times where I had to tell myself that ""it's just a movie, so go with it"", and that's where the movie lost me. Any time I have to tell myself ""it's just a movie"" is when I start to dislike movies, and sadly Gravity is one of those movies. There is a limit to how much a movie should push a single situation or scenario and in my humble opinion Gravity breaks that limit a few times. It's hard to get back into a movie once you start to question the reality presented to you.Overall, Gravity is a fun movie that will definitely get your heart going, have you dodging space debris and clinching your seat. Absolutely worth the watch even if it's just for the amazing visuals. If you don't like to do too much thinking and are looking for a fun immersive movie Gravity will not disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

HEROES are people that are fighting with lack of gravity in Space.,"As a truly passionate person about space for many years, I wanted to watch this movie in the best conditions ever.

That fascinating place where our cosmonauts dare to travel, to work for science, for Earth, for us. Think about the risks and the stress they endure to perform their tasks in non-optimal conditions, as long as the situation allow them to do. Think about that these RARE people who have a no-guaranteed-ticket back to Earth (history has proof, and it's all recent) were trained to go above us all. And unfortunately, there are people who had never come back.The story. As you can watch in the trailer, a few cosmonauts are trying to repair/maintain something in space, more precisely, the Hubble telescope but something happens and they need to stop the mission. The smallest accident in space may be fatal.The main characters. While I had no doubts about Clooney, (secondary character) I was afraid Sandra won't fulfill his role. Bad mistake. This is probably the best role she has ever had. I won't enter into details but Sandra is transporting herself perfectly in her role. The emotions she's getting trough are so palpable, maybe I'm going a bit out of the way but just remember Natalie Portman in Black Swan, how she completed her role. Sandra is doing as much as the same. The emotions! George's character is under exploited but it has enough meaning to count in the movie.The Motion Picture & Visual FX Sometimes you have the impression you are watching a real documentary. The Earth seems to be so real, the lights, the shadows, everything is pushed to another level so close to reality. It feels so real. There are many moments where you are feeling like you're inside a cosmonaut suit, turning around in space at no gravity, while Earth is turning as well around itself and the sun.The Soundtrack In space, there is nothing to carry on the sound. Excellent job by Steve Price. :) Minimal but sometimes heavily spontaneous, just as like the movie is.Conclusion. This movie is unique in his style. Survival, Drama, Adventure? One thing is sure, it must be watched in IMAX or at least in 3D Relief to really appreciate the huge amount of work that has been done on this side. I guess it is the only way to totally immerse yourself in this almost-realistic unforgettable adventure of Dr Ryan Stone.Farewell",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Hands Down The Best Movie of the Year; Gravity puts you on your feet,"There are few films like 'Gravity' that are able to consume you and utilize the entire running time to the full extent of their ability. From start to finish it keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing what will happen next. The script is simplistic. It is purely about human survival and how our will to live is so much more powerful than we could ever imagine. Throughout the entire film, Bullock's performance never waivers. It is the best she's ever been and she has the power to move you to tears. The film places you in the position of her character and makes you feel as though you are in space, along for the ride. The visual effects will fool you so well, you'll think you were just transported to space for an hour and a half. The sound design perfectly ads the tension and fear that is pushing you to the edge of your seat. All these elements combined make for one considerable directorial monument for Alfonso Cuarón. 'Gravity' is one hell of a roller coaster ride that deserves, no, beckons to be seen in 3D on the largest screen possible. There is no other way to do this masterpiece justice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The most intense film experience of the year.,"Gravity is an intense, pulse-pounding, edge-of-your-seat cinematic experience. Am I forgetting any movie review clichés? Regardless, they all apply to this instant classic that redefines the rules for every film about space exploration that has been put to celluloid over the past 50 years.Gravity is directed by Alfonso Cuaron whose previous film, Children of Men, stands among the very best films of the past decade. Much like Hitchcock's Rope, Cuaron's signature is the use of lengthy single-shot sequences. The climactic scene from Children of Men is one of the reasons the film is so memorable. Cuaron once again expertly uses this technique.This time he opens the film with a 13 minute uncut scene as we follow the astronauts while they work on the exterior of the shuttle. Cuaron also seamlessly transitions as the camera slowly floats around space as we watch the astronauts, to inside Stone's helmet, to seeing everything from her perspective. The camera work and the use of CGI is pulled off so well that it really gives the illusion as if we are floating in space along with the astronauts.There really isn't much to Gravity's plot. It's basically a two person Broadway play that takes place in outer space. George Clooney plays Matt Kowalski, a veteran astronaut who's completing his final space mission. Even in the depths of space and all the dangers that accompany it, Clooney plays it cool, often leisurely floating around without a care in the world like he's taking a stroll in the park.Sandra Bullock is his polar opposite. She plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer embarking on her first space mission. Stone is quiet and understandably tense as she navigates around the outside of the space shuttle. Bullock's character seems to be wrapped in an orbit of sadness and despair. Even in the rare playful scenes between her and Kowalski, she seems sullen and her interactions with him feel forced and contrived. Soon we realize the reason for Stone's demeanor. Some will find her back-story a tad heavy-handed, but I had no problem with it.At the start of the film, the astronauts are working on the outside of the space shuttle when an unexpected event sends debris hurtling towards them. From that point on, all hell breaks loose. This is where Gravity really starts to shine. Cuaron does an amazing job of immersing the viewer in the film. He captures the absolute emptiness of space with perfection.Gravity also deals with interesting contrasts. One moment we feel the suffocating claustrophobia of Stone while she's in her helmet gasping for air and the next instant we are viewing the astronauts as a white speck in the vast expanses of outer space. There's also instances of deafening sound and utter silence.Early in the film, there is a scene that is shot so beautifully that to try and explain it would ruin what makes it so special. The most I will say is that it symbolizes rebirth. From that moment on, Stone is determined to survive. This happens to be the main theme of Gravity: humanity's sheer animal instinct to survive at all costs.Gravity also happens to be the rare film experience that actually uses 3D for the better. The use of 3D does a great job of using depth of field to separate the astronauts from the backdrop of Earth. Without giving too much away, there are numerous scenes that use 3D so perfectly I was so happy I chose to see it in this overused and often misused format.The standout performance of Gravity is clearly Sandra Bullock. It's her film. She captures your attention like James Franco did recently in 127 Hours or like Tom Hanks did in Cast Away 13 years ago. Although Bullock won an Oscar for The Blind Side, her work in Gravity will go down as her best.Also, film buffs with a keen ear might recognize a familiar voice as NASA's mission control. I won't spoil the surprise.Gravity might be light on plot, but if you're looking for a memorable, non-stop experience, then buy a ticket to Gravity, sit back and prepare for liftoff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"See it for its technical marvels, but this film's significance will fade with time.","Gravity (2013), directed by Alfonso Cuaron, explores the emotionally grueling experiences of a medical engineer, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), who has been sent up into space to service the Hubble space telescope alongside veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and flight engineer Shariff Dasari (Paul Sharma). Things begin to go awry when Houston advises the crew that the Russians have destroyed a satellite with a missile strike, which has resulted in a chain reaction of space debris orbiting the planet at their altitude. This debris eventually hits their location and destroys the shuttle, marooning the remaining crew members at an altitude of 559 kilometers. The film takes on the perspective of Dr. Stone as she uses her wits and limited training to find a way to get back to Earth.The actual narrative is pretty bare, but this is a non-issue to me given that it is a film about a personal journey. Why did Russia blow up a satellite? What is the political environment at the time of this film (which takes place in the near future)? We don't know; but we don't need to know. This film isn't about the context of the situation, but the situation itself. The film, more-or-less, is paced in real time, and thus, eliminates the need for exposition to fill gaps of time that we do not witness.The first 10 minutes or so of this film has one of the most technically- advanced sequences that you will ever see on the big screen. For me, it brought back memories of Cuaron's Children of Men (2006), which had a car-sequence involving a flaming tree, machine gunners on dirt bikes, and a ping pong ball that, at the time, was one of the most impressive interpretations of the ""long take"" that I had ever seen. The opening sequence of Gravity is no less impressive, with zero-gravity acrobatics providing a visceral experience that may very well be the closest many of us ever come to floating in space.Additionally, Sandra Bullock's acting is as good as we have ever seen from her. She's a natural at playing a neurotic character brought into extraordinary circumstances. Think of Bullock's portrayal of Dr. Stone as a more seasoned and mature interpretation of her role as Annie Porter in Speed (1994). Gravity sees her tread a more pronounced character arc, but both films highlight the emotional highs and lows that Bullock can take the audience. There is one sequence in particular that I feel will resonate for most people. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I'll be relatively non-descript and just say that this scene involves her character using a radio to communicate with Houston at what appears to be her lowest moment, only to find that she has tapped into the signal of an Inuit fisherman. This man, Dr. Stone's only connection to Earth, then begins to sing a bed-time song for his child. Bullock's character, feeling that there is no hope for survival, begins to use the song to comfort herself in one of the most beautiful and devastating scenes in the film.There is little doubt that the film is a technical masterpiece with solid performances, but I feel that where the film falls flat is in its incessant need to entertain the viewers with zero gravity explosions and tense sequence after tense sequence. I was certainly swept up in the theatrics of it all for the first half, but towards the end the misadventures of Dr. Stone start to become tiresome and unbelievable. Now, I understand that this film is about overcoming impossible odds, but I feel the filmmakers passed a threshold when it comes to suspended disbelief. By the end, I was holding myself back from shouting ""Oh, come on!"" in the theater. At one point, a woman beside me let out some exhausted laughter over the lead character's rotten luck. This ultimately took me out of the experience and made me very aware that I was watching a movie.There are other minor issues that I have with Gravity (including a ham- fisted homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey), but what really resulted in me leaving the cinema disappointed was that I went into this film hoping that this could be added to the canon of great sci-fi. To me, sci-fi is at its best when it deals with very complex or controversial ideas, or when it's used as a societal critique. ""Gravity"" is more of an action film set in space. Don't misunderstand me, it's a good action film peppered with moments of artistic brilliance, but I don't see it being remembered and revered in the decades to come.Final verdict: 3.5 out of 5__________________________________Read this review and more at http://cinemacave.blogspot.ca !",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A new breathtaking experience in Cinema!!!,"Being a big fan of Sandra Bullock, let me say this one is her best performance so far even better than her Oscar winning role in the blind side.The film starts slowly but with very beautiful and breathtaking outerspace scenes, and taking it's time to connect us to the main protagonists and developing a sequence of events which are least to say the most breathtaking, beautiful, thrilling and not to forget horrifying. By halftime of the movie i was deeply attached to story and the characters that left me crying non-stop.A truly revolutionary or redefining the idea of great quality movie making after AVATAR.

The best film of 2013,"GRAVITY is an incredible film. It uses 3D to an amazing effect, and I usually dismiss 3D as a gimmick. The cinematography is spellbinding, and you feel as if it was shot in space, none the less feel like you are in space while watching it. The special effects are incredible. They are computerized, but it does not seem computerized, as it just looks like it has always been that way. Acting from Sandra Bullock is just amazing, and I think she will win another Oscar. The script was great too. Alfonso Cuaron has made an impeccable job of this film, and it should be enjoyed by everyone who enjoys good films. I hope that you will enjoy this film as much as i did?",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The finest science fiction movie since Inception.,"Gravity was a flat-out amazing experience at the movies that filmgoers will keep talking about for years. Everything in this movie was absolutely gorgeous, from the visual effects, the perfectly planned cinematography and 3D, the flawless direction of Alfonso Cuaron, the believable script and the unforgettable performance of Sandra Bullock. From the moment you see the opening shot of the Explorer Shuttle get closer and closer to the camera in one shot, and introducing the main characters of Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney, and Ryan Stone, performed by Sandra Bullock; this shot shows how they see space in their own different ways. Gravity is the Citizen Kane of digital cinema.There are no problems with this fine film; everything in the film has a purpose whether it be beauty in the imagery (especially some of the shots of Earth in the film) or the terrifying experience of spinning into the starry-black abyss of space, out of control, or the character reveals that play out through a scene. If it weren't for Alfonso Cuaron's bold vision of the potential modern cinema can have, Gravity may have turned out to be a very different movie.Gravity is an honest film in that it knows to use the imagery to full effect and have the visual effects affect the characters, not have them be invincible to giant CGI robots or something like massive explosions. Alfonso wants the film to be an experience that is full of moments that are awe-spiring, beautiful, unpredictable, terrifying, and full of impact.I thought Gravity was THE film of 2013: a must see that no one should miss. Even if you never got to see it at the cinemas in 3D, still watch however and whenever you can.Gravity gets a platinum /10/10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity's Big Miss was Important,"It's ""big miss"" is the already admitted impossible ""let go"" of George Clooney's character Kowalski by Sandra Bullock's Character Dr. Stone. (When Dr. Stone let's go of Kowalski's hand Kowalski would not have floated off into the wild black yonder, he would have stayed exactly where he was. And, in fact, there was no reason to let go of Kowalski's hand -- all she needed to do was pull him back to the tether line ... because he's weightless. It seems that it's no big deal to the people who like this film a lot. Well, I liked the movie too but there are a lot of other ways that Kowalski could have ""died"" in the movie and any one of them would not have been as dumb as the one they used. (What if in ""Gone with the Wind"" Scarlett floated down the staircase instead of walking down the staircase.) But ... since this is a space movie such a dumb impossibility is forgiven.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A virtual masterpiece of suspense as two stranded astronauts fight to survive.,"Gravity isn't just a good film, it is a great film. I have been watching movies for well over 4 decades and this might have been one of the most emotionally harrowing film experiences I have ever had. I rarely use the word masterpiece but, if this isn't one, it's damn close and as close to a perfect movie as I've seen in a long time. Gravity's story is simple, a crew of 5 astronauts in the space shuttle Explorer are working on additions to the Hubble Telescope. Mid-mission they receive news that the Russians have destroyed one of their own satellites with a missile test and debris has been sent rocketing close to their proximity news which becomes a dire warning as the satellite debris has impacted other satellites and now a cloud of wreckage is heading right for them at an increasing velocity and they have moments to abort their mission and get out of harm's way. Despite their efforts to get out of danger, the debris hits them full on and only Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who is on his last mission, are left alive tethered together with with Kowalski's jet propulsion pack running out of power and Stone running out of air. Can they reach the International Space Station and before the cloud of debris orbits Earth and returns? And if they do, are they even safe there? Co-written (with Jonás Cuarón) and directed by Alfonso Cuarón, Gravity is 90 minutes of one of the most emotionally gripping and suspenseful movie going experiences you're likely to have as he quickly establishes two very likable human beings who are put in one of the most frightening scenarios one can imagine. Cuarón not only gives us two people to root and care for but, his masterful camera work and the flawless SPFX create a vast and frightening void that is as beautiful as it is intimidating. One false move and you can be lost in the vast empty coldness and with no air and no one coming to your rescue. Cuarón uses a lot of POV and stunning camera shots to put us in space right there with our two stranded astronauts and we experience what they do and feel their fear every step of the way. Not to mention that the Children Of Men filmmaker gets two Oscar worthy performances out of Clooney and Bullock and these veteran actors create two very endearing three dimensional characters we embrace all the way and are right along with in experiencing every heartbreaking setback and grasping every glimmer of hope. The film is truly an emotional roller coaster ride that most movies promise but, few can actually deliver. By the time the credits rolled I felt I had been through everything the characters had and thanks to Cuarón's skillful directing and wonderful script, I had. An exhilarating, harrowing and wonderfully suspenseful movie that is more then just a film, it's an experience. A must see movie! Best film of year for me and doubt I will see anything as powerful for some time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Visually Stunning, Laughable at Times","Gravity is a beautiful film! It shows how far we've come in special effects. It portrays itself as a realistic film, that is, with realistic images of floating in space, flying through the atmosphere, etc. I can't decide whether this film is a 7 or 8.I think 7.5 just for the images in space, the curve of Earth, the space stations, the reflection off the glass, Sandra's breathing condensing on the glass, Sandra's effortless floating glide through the Russian and Chinese stations. Quite visually beautiful.But really, it is more fantasy than science fiction. I think I would have rate this higher (8.-8.5) if I knew to expect a fantasy film. But I feel a bit disappointed as many others. Almost none of the physics are real and it defies what really happens in space and defies NASA protocols. For accuracy, here's an astronaut's comments:http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/astronaut-fact-checks-gravity.htmlThe script from minute one was just bad at times. George Clooney trash talking and zipping around without a tether. He'd be released from NASA, never be allowed in space again. Acting by Clooney was actually better than acting by Sandra Bullock who more or less played herself. She is a bit kooky and she has a bit of her Miss Congeniality in her. George also played himself but somewhat had more charm than Sandra. Too much testosterone. However, the best moment was when Ryan Stone (Sandra) drifts off into unconsciousness and she imaginesor is it communication from the dead? It is a well-crafted touching scene with Clooney and Bullock talking. And then she talks about her daughter. The girl with one shoe, I believe she said. A statement on our mortality. Perhaps the best drama scene in the film.Definitely this film deserves the Oscar and BAFTA for visual effects and cinematographyand maybe a couple more. But Best Director? or nomination for Best Actress? It's an empowering film for a female lead. It empowers Sandra Bullock. And inspires many young girls to be an astronaut perhaps. Liberating and uplifting. But really, if you check the URL above, almost nothing would have happened. As pointed out, Sandra's character, Ryan Stone, would have never been trained in a simulator. Worst, Sandra doesn't quite portray a woman of confidence or science. Rather she relies on the manly Clooney coming to the rescue. Dr. Stone is more like Dr. Claustrophobic and Ms. Panic. She's not the composed, strong woman that a real astronaut probably would be in space. Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney would have never let go and leave her alone. There is no gravity acting on Matt in the scene where she is caught in the lines and he is holding on. It therefore kind of resembles joyride of ""Armageddon"". Yet Gravity is a better film.Gravity is a dramatic movie with little realism, but still plenty of fun. It actually reminded me of another extract-yourself-from-the-debris action movie, Daylight, with Sylvester Stallone. But Daylight has a remote likelihood but Gravity lacks most realism. That is why I laughed at Ryan Stone's eight or ninth time she should have died. Perhaps she is a Terminator? Never dying. A superhero. She needs a cape.Gravity ranks among the best films based in space but it clearly isn't 2001 or Contact. The latter film with Jodie Foster is much superior in script, acting, direction and even comes close with nice special effects. Gravity is a 7-7.5 and Contact might be 8.0-8.5. Gravity has nine lives. It's your day, Dr Stone.I wonder if Cate Blanchett or Julianne Moore might have been a more credible, calmer Ryan. I would have like a stronger woman in charge, more convincing as an astronaut. Just that the opening scenes and Ryan's goofy inexperience in space make her reminiscent of Miss Congeniality.Gravity might have been the best science fiction/fantasy film of the year. If only the plot was more realistic and script were better. Then it might deserve a spot as one of the best space films. But even with flaws, the visual effects rank it high among the very best if that's your piece of cake. For space films, it deserves a top 10-12 rank. For fantasy/scifi, top 25. But that many Oscars? Yes, we will be all asking that question ten years from now as there were many better movies in a strong 2013.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The GRAVITY Of This Outer Space Situation,"Probably about as original and realistic a film as one could be that is set in the vastness of space, even if it is just above the Earth's atmosphere, that Hollywood has made after films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, MAROONED, and APOLLO 13, films that it resembles quite strikingly at times, GRAVITY stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts doing a routine repair job on the Hubble Space Telescope who find themselves in the middle of a crisis when a huge debris field, created by the accidental missile hit on a Russian satellite, destroys both the space shuttle and the telescope itself, and the remaining shuttle crew. The horrifying incident leaves the two of them stranded some 300 miles above the Earth's surface, with only their spacesuits for protection against the airless and soundless vacuum of the void.Clooney sacrifices himself in order to get Bullock into the remaining Soyuz escape pod still attached to the heavily damaged International Space Station; but again, many further complications arise. Only after a hair-raising, eye-popping dilemma does Bullock get into the pod and head for the nearby Chinese space station, which itself has suffered tremendous damage. Bullock, understandably in a huge panic, has only a limited amount of time before she gets into the Chinese escape pod and survives the intense heat of re-entry, not to mention another debris field created by the Chinese space station as it re-enters the atmosphere.Whether seen in the regular wide screen format, in 3-D, or in the specialized IMAX 3-D (where it would share a further comparison with the 1987 IMAX documentary about the space shuttle program, THE DREAM IS ALIVE), GRAVITY succeeds as great science fiction; and while it is at times overwhelmed with the 3-D process and the avalanche of special CGI effects (though the budget stayed at $80 million), the effects don't overshadow the storyline or the characters, which is a marked and refreshing contrast from most Hollywood big-budget spectacles of the 21st century. What is perhaps most remarkable about GRAVITY is that it was a Mexican-born filmmaker, Alfonso Cuaron (who also directed 2001's Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, and 2004's HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN), who both directed and co-wrote it (along with his son Jonas). Even with all the ultra-high tech bells and whistles at his disposal, Cuaron in general has made a film that has a lot of the grace of ""2001"", the extreme tension of MAROONED, and the dogged realism of APOLLO 13, films that it can stand up to comparison quite well.Most of the film's focus is on Bullock using her intelligence and hard-won courage to ensure her own survival, which had best been hinted at before in the 1994 action blockbuster SPEED. Even Clooney is on for only the first 40 minutes of this 90-minute saga; and Ed Harris, who portrayed NASA flight director Gene Kranz in APOLLO 13, is only credited with being the voice of Mission Control. In essence, GRAVITY is an outer space character study, and Bullock is the character in question; and she carries that role quite well. All of these things serve to make GRAVITY one of the best films of 2013.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
a momentous achievement that must be seen as advertised,"Spectacular, visually stunning space odyssey/suspense thriller focusing on a medical specialist (Bullock) on her first space shuttle mission, and a veteran astronaut (Clooney) commanding his final expedition, and their arduous journey after an accident leaves them stranded in outer space. With a setup that initially seems indistinguishable from other films in this genre there's reason to be skeptical, but it immediately grabs you by the collar with a taut, multilayered story of strength, faith, and survival, and overwhelms you with some of the most arresting visual effects ever put on film. If there were ever a case to justify using 3-D for a mainstream Hollywood movie, this would definitely be it! Bullock easily gives the finest performance of her career, creating genuine pathos and conveying a gamut of emotions that have not yet been seen in her previous efforts.

Fantastic - Only Comparable to Apollo-13,"The best science fiction ever made in last decade, a masterpiece, in fact it can only be compared to another ground breaking movie and my all time favorite – Apollo-13. Friends, please don't judge it by downloading in your computers, you will get nothing out of it, it is a 3D marvel. Sundra Bullock was never considered to be in the league of highly extraordinary Hollywood actresses, but here she has given performance of a lifetime, kudos! You will feel the horror, the fear, the loneliness, the desperation; even more than the astronaut thanks to the director. I am a great sci-fi fan and love aliens and monsters :-P, but this movie is a great example that you don't need ugly aliens or horrific martians to make an impact, all you need is to create the right atmosphere. George Cloonie also has made a great impression though his on screen presence was much less than that of Sandra's. The 3D visions of beautiful earth from space was just mesmerizing, so was the debris of the satellite coming towards you. Coming to the story, a Russian satellite which was destroyed intentionally started a chain reaction and turned the mission to a struggle for existence. But unlike Apollo-13 you don't have Ed Harris to save you out from Houston, you are all alone and nobody can hear your scream! Though it's a adventure/sci-fi genre, few of the conversations were really touching, specially when Sandra got hold of a Chinese wavelength where a father was singing to an infant which did not help her anyway for survival but reminds her of her dead daughter. It shows so beautifully that whichever language we speak, our emotions are all the same, we are only human.5/5 from me, an excellent cinema experience, MUST WATCH!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"see this in IMAX, but 3D unnecessary","Four films come to mind when I think about Gravity: Mission to Mars, Deep Impact, WALL-E and, of course, Apollo 13.

An IMAX screen is ideal. 2D is fine. 3D is fine, too, but unnecessary because the 3D effect is used only occasionally.Despite ideas lifted from a certain Brian De Palma film and a certain Pixar film, Gravity is thoroughly enjoyable. As a side note, the similarity between George Clooney's character and Tim Allen's Buzz LIghtyear in voice and appearance is so close I kept expecting him to say, ""To infinity and beyond!""Anyway, back to the movie. The action begins nearly right away and continues nonstop. I've seen 80-minute films that felt like 3 hours. But this 90-minute film felt more like 5 minutes.

Gravity is also perhaps one of, if not the most gorgeous space movie I have ever seen, it's use of color and just the overall cinematography is truly unforgettable.

"Best film of the year, one of a kind","Gravity is a one of a kind film that portrays a realistic view of being up in space with a thrilling story that asks us can we continue and move on with our lives when hope seems lost and we feel we have nothing left to go back to.While I am normally not a fan of Sandra Bullock, she exceeds beyond expectations as she delivers a wide range of believable emotions and the audience become a part of her character as we see through her perspective of both the life-threatening and personal challenges she faces to get back home. And lets not forget about George Clooney as he becomes the perfect voice of reason, motivation and comfort that we need to hear when hope seems lost for Bullock's character.The effects in this film are just jaw-dropping. Really convinces you are actually in space especially since there is no sound of in any of the scenes in space. The cg planet Earth in the film is so beautiful and well-detailed.By the end of this film you a have a greater appreciation for our planet having air, gravity and sound. This film definitely deserves an Oscar for best director, Alfonso Cuaron, along with best screenplay, best cinematography and best vfx.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Well Done for What it is,"This film is about 2 things, as I see it: space-station missions and survival. I think the movie accomplished an interesting story in both respects. As to the latter, the film did a good job of establishing a desperate pace, in which: every second counts; there is little rest for the weary, and Murphy's Law is in full effect; and no one is going to save you but yourself, so you better nut up or shut upfor good. Space is a perfect setting for these themes, as the movie effectively conveyed the isolation of space, the importance of rigorous training so ingrained that certain actions become involuntary, and the sheer wonder of modern technology. These aspects of the film, along with its breathtaking scenery and its compelling acting (by the way, props to Bullock for her hard work on that rocking 49-year-old body!), almost make it a Must See; but overall, my reaction to a friend who tells me that he hasn't seen this flick will probably be more like ""It's worth it if you ever do, and see it in 3-D, if you can"" than ""You really need to see that movie.""

"What a Scam , If you saw the trailer you've seen the movie...","What a load, I mean what was there was pretty good, the graphics and special effects were what the movie was about. There was no plot to the story, it was simply about being lost in space, which is evident in the trailer. No character back grounds are given when they had tons of opportunity to tell us about the characters, but for some inexplicable reasons they did not. They decide to end a $16.00 movie without a beginning or an end, I am not sure which. An hour and a half movie that was no where near a full movie. It clearly was not finished. As soon as the lights in the theater came on everyone around us was complaining. I heard ""I want my money back."" ""That's it?"" ""Too short!"" And the best was ""I think they forgot the rest!"" Clearly, this movie lacked substance and a storyline. Ultimately, if you've seen the movie trailer, you don't need to see the movie. There's nothing else you're missing. I hope they don't make their money back. I think my review was longer than the film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Don't Let Go! any chance of seeing it,"Do you know, why 3D was invented? I do. Because we had to see this in 3D, because Gravity is the best film experience I've ever had, just like Life of Pi last year, and Avatar four years ago. Director Alfonso Cuarón managed bring absolutely different experience of breathtaking visuals, bright colors and great directing.Gravity follows a medical engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and an astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) working together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space, where even one mistake can cost you a life. Since there is no one in the film except those two and Dr. Stone is left alone quite shortly after the movie starts, there are no much dialogues, however it still manages to keep you tense and stressed any minute of it, mostly because technically perfectly made visual & 3D effects.Emmanuel Lubezki is finally getting his first cinematography Oscar, for doing and outstanding job of capturing Earth from space, using lights to show us sunrise and making space very real for us. Gravity is the only and first space movie that actually shows how beautiful world is from the astronaut's view. The hardest part for cinematographer as usual is to properly deliver the reflections on real object in mirrors, glasses and etc. The scenes, where astronauts are spinning in the open space seems to be very carefully done and watching/realizing this brought so much enjoyment.And of course, visuals are massive, effective and thrilling, they totally bring tensity and scary emotions of being out there. Additionally, music composed by Steven Price absolutely gorgeous, making each scene more beautiful and involving. I personally think that he's one of the front-runners in this year composer race.What I did not like it the scenario how everything was happening. Movie repeated every scene time by time: they're under attack, they stay alive and reach new destinations, the are under attack, they stay alive and reach another destination and so on. It seemed a little artificial and boring. The same time, there is no much material for writing, because of quite few dialogues. But some Clooney's jokes were actually funny (and he entertained a lot).However, I should admit that Sandra Bullock is at the top of her acting career. In Gravity she did the best performance of her ever. First, because it's not easy to play that role, to deliver emotions at its finest, be strong and weak the same time. Second, she definitely has better awards material than in The Blind Side, so she can easily make final top 5 at Oscars and Golden Globes - woman, who's sentimental to her dead baby, fighting for survival in the space, attempting suicide and staying alive - it's kind of winning formula.But Alfonso Cuarón is the one who really deserves applause because he combined sensation, visual beauty, tension and great acting in one movie, which almost never happens and brought it to the screens in most entertaining way I could imagine. Directors who shot action-based Sci-Fi thrillers have one of the hardest jobs to do. They have to capture things that they have never seen in reality (in this case space) and to make the viewers experience the most realistic feelings. I had the sense as if I was floating in above the Earth.All in all, Gravity is technical perfection, but there could have been done more in writing part. However it's already a landmark in Sci-Fi, as it's been Avatar when premiered.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Just Starting to Relax,"Space nut here. (If I wasn't such a coward, I would have signed up to go to Mars.) So, I was tense throughout the movie since I read a lot and watch a lot about space (""the final frontier"")- non-fiction - and know some of the dangers.In addition, the way the film is written and directed, I felt I knew the characters right from the start, so I felt for their plight. Slightly teary was I.So, although physically tensed in my seat, and teary-eyed, I found this a thoroughly enjoyable film.

Stunning images,"It's hard to write of Gravity without introducing spoilers, but I'll give it a summarized shot.The images are stunning. The local theater is only showing 3D; that may be the only choice. I'm not a glasses fan, but the 3D is done very well. The sets are also very nicely done.There are a lot of places where it is quite difficult to suspend disbelief on some of the technical points. Gravity is not accurate in the physics sense (from what I read) and a few other places, but to discuss them is to give away things.

of the rare variety that will actually inspire people to get into making films...,"The story is pretty straight forward and easy to encapsulate. A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.With the aid of a video reference book, I once estimated that I have watched about 4,500 movies in my lifetime. I especially enjoy movies that entertain through fantastic settings or story-lines.You've probably heard and/or read a fair amount about this movie. It did very well at the Cannes Film Festival. It's IMDb rating is very high (8.6 average after 100K votes) and it has been #1 at the box office its first 3 weeks of its release. As is fitting with a movie about space, (a.k.a the final frontier), I have ventured into a new frontier myself with this film. I dropped $ 13 for a single ticket and watched the IMAX 3D print.I went into this movie with extremely high expectations.They were all surpassed.GRAVITY is, to be honest and objective, one of the greatest motion pictures I've ever seen.I predict it will continue to make piles of money. I further predict it will be nominated and could very well win the Academy Award for best picture of the year.Where it works : (get comfy, this will take a little while) Photography - It's being said that this film sets a new and very high benchmark for cinematography. That is an understatement. Not only do the effects and use of mirror or ""stereo"" cameras give you the sense you are in space, at times you seamlessly move from being next to characters, to inside their spacesuits. It is shot in such a way that you get the sense, through point of view and lighting effects, that you are weightless. Music - Steven Price's score is a character in and of itself. Exciting, rich, somber, emotional, triumphant. Visual Effects - I view 3D, even with its impressive modern enhancements, as a gimmick to bump ticket prices. While this film didn't make me change my mind about that, I will say this....I paid $ 13 for a single ticket...and I got my money's worth. The effects in the film are nothing short of jaw-dropping. The 3D was utilized very well and IMAX allows you to be swallowed up by the stars and the action. Tension/suspense - Take just about every disaster movie, space movie, chase movie, and action movie....think of your top 5 to 10.......do you have them in your head ? This film is going to make you reshuffle that list. I was gripping my armrest, eyes wide, through 90 % of this film. The oft used phrase ""Edge of your seat"" was originally penned for experiences like this one. Acting - Bullock and Clooney are consummate professionals. No shock they are going to do well. Sandra Bullock owns this movie. Could very well see another Academy Award on her shelf by this time next year. Story/plot - What would appear to be a movie about survival, is more about dealing with unforeseen and/or undeserved consequences, and moving on (in the face of INCREDIBLE adversity). -CLICHE ALERT- This is a film that leaves you feeling lucky and glad to be alive.Where it doesn't work as well: ((((crickets)))) If I have to pick something, some people might find it too strenuous or come away with the thought, ""really, are they really going to have to deal with all of that ?"" But, the sheer beauty, impact, and power of the film makes that criticism seem petty.Overall, I can't recommend it strongly enough. GO SEE IT. If you can afford it, SPEND THE EXTRA $$ ON 3D and/or IMAX.This film is of the rare variety that it will actually inspire people to get into making films, acting, directing, or photography.I went with a friend of mine who ""loved it"".My personal rating: 10 out of 10 (Masterpiece)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good film, very overrated.","I am definitely in the minority here, but I will go ahead and admit that Gravity failed to impress me that much. I went to the theater with very high expectations after hearing how it was ""the best movie of the year"" and seeing its 97% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Although I thought that, yes, Gravity was good, it was not nearly as amazing as the critics made is out to be.The visual effects are obviously the best aspect of Gravity. The scenery was stunning and some of the effects the filmmakers were able to pull off were awe-inducing. Another great aspect of the film was its ability to thrill and stress the audience. Gravity was made centered around the audience.Sandra Bullock's performance was mostly very good. There were parts that I felt her acting went a bit over-the-top.The main aspect of Gravity that I had a problem with was the characters, or lack thereof. The movie obviously centered itself around Sandra Bullock's character, almost too much so. There were basically only two other actors that you ever saw. I can understand why Alfonso Cuaron would do this, to make the audience feel the sense of isolation, but it was way too much. With only one character to focus on, the movie's plot was almost uninteresting. Also, another thing that bothered me was how cliché Sandra Bullock's character was. Her back story is almost identical to every other Hollywood Blockbuster character's story.Overall, the visuals were fantastic, but the plot and characters were only so-so. I have seen critics mention these downfalls before, then defend Gravity by saying that it isn't a movie about the story, its about the visuals. Yet I find it somewhat ironic that these same critics praising Gravity slammed Avatar back in 2009 for it being all about the visuals.So yes, Gravity is good. It's a nice, solid movie. But it is not a movie to watch more than once, or to watch outside of a theater. Undoubtedly, Gravity will win a substantial amount of awards. I am not saying that it does not deserve it. I can tell that the filmmakers put their heart and souls into making this film, but Gravity still has several weak points that should have been fixed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

When you think they were done with pushing the boundaries of cheesiness and plot less explosions, somebody raises millions of dollars do to so.

It looks like a mix of well known a-thousand-time-heard chunks of fast- food plot. Really. A joke. Dramatic family pictures, dramatic love story, know-it-all veteran, the poor mother who realizes she love her daughter, hot actress in underwear, violin music every 5 minutes, ""let me go - no, because you will die - but its OK - but no - but aahhh""...

Gravity Overview,"Gravity is a movie that takes on a whole new perspective of astronauts. The movie takes you on a journey with a space crew and their final space walk to set up a telescope on a space station. While you are watching the movies you can really feel the zero gravity and will even find yourself breathing at the same rate that the crew does. The environment of space is portrayed beautifully. In the beginning, the movie stresses that life in space is impossible. This makes it very clear that literally nothing is in space. No sound, no air, and nothing to slow you down if you are caught drifting. Overall, this is a very well written and made movie. There isn't much to say about 'Gravity' without spoiling it because the movie will keep you guessing from start to finish. The main focus of this movie is persistence. 'Gravity' makes it clear that without persistence you are doomed to live without any happiness, and then life becomes pointless. Without the amazing character development set up in the first scene we would be forced to watch a long and drawn out movie. Luckily that is not the case. If it wasn't for Clooney's and Bullock's performance we would have drifted through space with blank characters. With the interesting stories that the characters tell each other while in the void of space we are entertained all the way through the movie. With the acceptation of a couple of minor plot holes and a few scenes that were a minute to long, Gravity is a must see.Check out more of our reviews at www.brickmoviereviews.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Nearest space experience 99.998% of us will experience!,"This film transports you to space in every cinematic way possible. The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they shot part of it in space. The opening shot is 13 min longand not once you think that they are doing it too long. There is a sensational and overwhelming power that Alfonso Cuarón's space thriller ""Gravity"" possesses and manages to sustain through out the run time! The whole movie is shot in just one room plus some world-class CGI. Which is breathtakingly amazing! The detail to ISS,HST and the earth view is top notch. But Its not just the graphics that keep the movie together. Its Sandy bullock's performance too! Though George Clooney's role is kinda short but still I enjoyed every minute of it. Bullock takes this science fiction thriller and turns it into a very human story. A conflict between the fight to survive and the fight to go on living. Throughout the film it is clear that Stone is distant, almost detached from the other characters. She seems almost indifferent at times to the horror that surrounds her. It becomes clear that she had never come to terms with life after the death of her young daughter. The audience need only look into her eyes to see the cold indifference behind the fear. It is an emotion that is all the stronger when one is in space, and able to see just how inconsequential they are to the grand scale of the world and the universe. The audience, along with Stone, is left to wonder, does it really matter? If you die, the world will continue to spin as if nothing ever happened. The cinematographer is dazzling. I felt as though the cuts were non- existent. I was never aware of an edit, almost as if the entire film consisted of one continuous shot. All the elements of the film came together perfectly to make this movie and to serve the story. But as I said before, Gravity goes far beyond just a simple story. It is an experience.The movie is not entirely dependent on CGI and Sandy B, But writing is also its strong part! So is the background score. Sometimes the way it transits from the heavy heartbeats to silence.Just perfect! The dialogs are very good too!There are times when you think you can predict the story but I bet you cant! I would recommend this movie for everyone! Even if it's a 10 yr old..I am sure they too will enjoy mind blowing effects! Gravity is a sure-shot Oscar winner for Best film, Best actress, Best background score and Best director. I really really hope that Clooney too gets something for his supporting role. Maybe for best editing too! A hard 10 on 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A masterpiece on its own,"A simple, almost minimalistic storyline, is just an excuse for a reflexion about the hostility of space, and for one of the most scientifically accurate movies about space since 2001.There is a remarkable and well thought management of camera planes, which constantly gives the viewer an almost uncomfortable sensation of buoyancy and dizziness, sometimes even nauseating. I do not think there is another movie that so powerfully generates in the viewer a sensation so close to a weightless trip on an EVA, i must admit that sometimes i felt space-sick, or what i believe could be accounted as such.Not every movie around has to be a brain dazzling exercise of metaphors. Gravity is much less pretentious, absolutely linear, hardly more than just descriptive. But it is so visually outstanding, the story although simple is so well told, the movie just flows naturally.Sandra Bullock is perfectly fitted for the role, she delivers what she is supposed to, and maybe even more than you would expect.So, if you like space movies, but you want them to keep at least a minimum grade of scientific honesty, while being an incredibly well developed piece of entertainment, go and see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining,"Even though my boyfriend convincingly explained some lacks in the storyline to me after we watched the movie, I still thought it didn't take away too much of its entertainment value. I gave Gravity a 10 since I thought it was the perfect mix of suspense and comedy. This movie is perfect entertainment. It is the opposite of long-winded - my boyfriend and I looked at each other one scene and when we looked back to the screen, the protagonists were already in a different place. Sandra Bullock played her role very authentically and added the drama to the story while George Clooney added the humor. Even though the movie was very suspenseful and the characters were in a desperate situation, there were still a few moments I had to laugh. The 3D effects were great also.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Brilliant Effects & production, otherwise disappointing.","For the special effects and production I would award 10/10, and it is worthy of an Oscar nomination for that alone, if there is such a category. However, the script is pitiful, the dialog for the most part banal, and even for someone with a basic high school knowledge of physics, the technical feasibility is way, way off in far too many areas to list. OK it's a movie and we can expect a degree of artistic license with the science, but really this is so way off that the whole movie loses credibility. No complaints about the acting, given the script they had to work with, but I don't see anything especially worthy of nominations or awards for these performances. So, 10/10 for the effects, 4/10 for the everything else, 6/10 overall, but worth watching just for the zero gravity effects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Slow but steady,"I did not put much expectation for this movie in the beginning. Firstly, hats off to the Cuaron brothers for their original story. Its not the usual and common science fiction story you watch everyday such as asteroid alarm, alien attacks and war between two planets. The story focuses on life on space,how unpredictable it could be,how helpless we are outside the atmosphere of earth and gravity and also hope.Secondly, graphic was good and realistic. I realized the team did a pretty good job on making the movements of objects and person as how it could be when there is no gravity acting on them.Next,acting. Sandra Bullock gave her best since her performance in The Blind Side. Sadly its not Oscar deserving. She brought the role perfectly but not the emotions. It seems not natural. She failed to shine during breakdowns or when under pressure. Well credits for her initiative to befriend astronaut Andy Coleman in order to understand their lifestyle in space. George Clooney, well his role can be clearly seen as supporting actor which did not suit him. He is an astronaut so he could had been more serious and less romantic and funny maybe. Nobody jokes when we are in the outer space.Few mistakes here and there but great screenplay. Finally, then ending. Few moments to the ending tend to be biased to make her survive. It didn't take me long to realize that she will survive every single obstacle till the last Chinese capsule. I would prefer if she died trying in the ending.Shooting was completed in 2011 so i assume a lot of time was spent to edit and improve the visual effects. Kudos to the team. Overall i would give this movie 8/10 for the vast amount of effort put by the actors and staffs to produce this original and almost realistic piece of work. Thank you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not Oscar Worthy!,"Although the eye candy is delicious, this movie is more far-fetched than a James Bond flick. Just because it has a star line-up, doesn't mean the film has content that qualifies for the Academy Awards. Many people criticize the Oscars, and this is a first for me to say that this nomination was a mistake. Don't get me wrong...Gravity was entertaining, and kudos to the CGI people, but that's where it ends. The film's big problem is leading the viewer to believe that this could happen based on facts and science. The acting was adequate and the director was able to transfer emotion and circumstance to the viewer fairly well. Instead of miraculous survival, the film should have focused on how one faces certain death.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

You see movies like Avatar with stunning visuals, you see movies like Inception with intriguing plots. And there's Gravity, a movie truly live up to the title of Art. The settings are a few, actors you could count with one hand, three outfits for the lead all together, and not even any weather change to complement the mood. To make a movie with only these, how good would the actors, the settings must be to make a good movie?""movie is about director and actor expressing their feelings and you relate it to your own"", it always sounded cliché until i watched this movie. The reason i will never watch it again is because i felt every single feelings Ryan (Sandra) did in the movie. The shock, the fear, the despair, the hopelessness, the courage, the craziness and at last the happiness. That was what happened in the movie. I think i developed spacephobia just from this movie.Never noticed Sandra as an actress, but in this movie, to move on Earth like she's moving in space was stunning.

A beautiful walk into space,"Ever heard of the famous movie quote ""Survival is the spirit, the soul""? - Well Alfonso Cuarón's ""Gravity"" more or less depicts the same. It's the story of two astronauts on a typical outer space mission and an out coming peril of a collateral event of satellite debris, loss of communication and face of death by lack of oxygen. Cuarón's selection for the cast – George Clooney and Sandra Bullock justify their respective characterization. It's more of Bullock's show than Clooney's.The director portrays the turnaround events in a sumptuous way amidst the rapid screenplay that takes the viewer's experience to the next level. The plot is inventive and unpredictable. The movie flows smoothly from scene to scene with ambient effects. The mechanics of the movie were too good. The haul of microgravity, the wafts and drifts in space is something to be lost in as a viewer and every scene backs it up. It's like a beautiful dance in space.""Gravity"" not only offers you some of the most vivid images, but sound as well. Composer Steven price's score befits each and every moment from complete silence of space to the chaotic crashing of the shuttle and satellite debris. It feels as if your ear drums were going to blow and then the next moment you could hear a pin drop from the silence.The story goes too fast that there's a slight lack of hoist to it all in that regard. Everything is so immediate that when it ends, it more or less just relieves the viewer feeling satisfied - not really left with as much as to stick with you. You don't so much watch the film as experience it.Notable scenes: 1) The scene when bullock's tear simply floats off her cheek was brilliant. 2) The heart beat pounding in some intense scenes. 3) Bullock enacting the howl of a dog while inside the Soyuz space capsule and the same done by dog over the radio impart something bad happening. 4) The climax scene where Bullock tries to stand up on feet after spending a brief time in zero G can be related to a baby who tries to stand up on its feet.A good 8 out of 10. Likely to win some Oscars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Visually stunning, a surely memorable experience.","When I was a kid, once I dreamed to be an astronaut. And sometimes my friends like to scare me that astronauts might not get back to Earth for several reasons, like running out of oxygen. Now I get to see Sandra Bullock and George Clooney floats around in space, a situation like once I used to fear.Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer doing her first space mission, accompanied by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). Everything seems smooth and goes as planned, until a Russian satellite was destroyed by their own missile, and the extremely high speed debris are going Stone and Kowalski's way. Out of nowhere, shower of the satellite debris come right at them and destroyed their space shuttle, leaving them completely alone 600 km above Earth.Low on oxygen and jet-pack fuel, Stone and Kowalski are stranded in zero-gravity environment. The communications with the terrestrial space command are lost, and they have to rely on each other to survive in this extreme environment. And in the next 90 minutes, their hope on survival could get destroyed—by the debris itself. And things are gonna get worse, believe me.One word—or two: Visually stunning. Director Alfonso Cuarón—which has been on a hiatus after his last feature film, Children of Men—made a great comeback with this critically acclaimed survival sci-fi drama, Gravity, soaring on top of Rotten Tomatoes with 98% fresh and a-96 Metascore rating in the first week of the release.Cuarón and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki guarantee that you will hold you breath and make your jaw drop for 90 minutes. Yep, right from the start of the flick, a great 13 minute long opening shot, starting with a narration to describe how does it feel to be in space. Every scene is intense, thrilling, and makes you feel like you're also stranded with Bullock and Clooney, trying to survive no matter how. With intense scoring from Steven Price. A score + cinematography combo covers the simple—or I may call it plain—storyline. While Cuarón can't really develop the story any further, the score and beautiful cinematography are what keeping audiences awake and hold their breath.There are several survival films out there, such as Buried, 127 Hours, or even the classic Cast Away. But they don't give you this 90 minutes full of thrill and seat gripping, heart pounding moments, that's the point. Gravity will make you blown away and rant throughout the film.The two main casts, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney—both Oscars winners—showed their true quality in acting. Every emotions, either it is nauseated, nervous, scared, or even relieved is portrayed flawlessly by Bullock. And Clooney? He's flamboyant and charming as usual. No need to doubt their acting skills.Basically, Gravity is one of a kind cinematic experience. It's designed for you to feel what the main characters are feeling, see what they are seeing. It's designed to be enjoyed on either IMAX or 4DX, while choosing 3D is a must to experience the best. It's up to you to choose either a stunning visual on a huge IMAX screen, or be part of the movie by choosing the cutting-edge 4DX technology.Gravity in 4DX is one hell of an experience. It's a space simulator, with vibrating and moving seats, it feels like you're experiencing the same thing happening with Stone & Kowalski. Not just that, sharp wind shots and fogs effect that occur several times during the film add additional enjoyment. The 3D itself is amazing, and certainly worth the additional bucks. Just forget that million-dollars space tour, and buy a 4DX or IMAX Gravity ticket.If you think this Gravity hype is just a buzz, it isn't. Gravity is so beautiful even in regular non-IMAX screens. With amazing special effects and shot techniques, Gravity is a masterpiece. 90 minutes flew so fast, as fast as the debris. A strong candidate for next year's Oscars Best Pictures nominee, and a must see for all you film snobs.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
the infinity of the womb,"I've been absent. Not only from writing about films, but from watching them with the frequency of past days as well. Part of it was life-driven, as i don't have the time i used to have. Part of it is because from time to time i feel the need to step a little back from whatever i'm doing more intensely and reevaluate things. Passions are better enhanced through fasting. I've had 6 or 7 very intense years where my life mixed a great deal with the lives of the films i've watched. That's the beauty of films, when you approach the films that change you by allowing then to become a part of your life, by blending them into you - as if you had a choice... Cuarón had changed me before, he's so intense because his narrative is always in the eye. His films are bits intimacies that arise from the magic of the relation between character, space, and camera. That's the basis of his dramatic construction, that's where the story lies. That's what allows him to spin and make beautiful free yet coordinated movements, like a planet circling the sun. Children of men changed me because of that. When i heard that Cuarón decided to go to space and enhance even more that special relation between space and camera, i knew he was going for something even bigger. He changes me now, once againNothing is more powerful, and as such more difficult to bend as space. It's infinite in its possibilities (like desert), it is totally spatial and it is the opposite of architecture, which is also all about space. Children of men mastered the built space, as this one masters the infinite. Intimacy of a space capsule as opposed to the possibilities of gravity zero. The camera as the ultimate non-animated disembodied character, as chaotic as space itself, yet as emotional as any of the 2 characters in the film. Cuarón ranks at the highest point, together with Kalatozov, in that so dear (to me) theme of space manipulation and film.Both actors do what was expected. Clooney plays Clooney's character, and becomes a useful wheel in the mechanism, allowing with his persona to make the audiences enter easily this otherwise strange unexplored film frame. Sandra tries hard, as she always does, perhaps harder than she should, and also as always, she seats uneasily in the role, but again that works in favor of the narrative, as her character also does not belong to the world where she moves. Than comes the magic. And world, from the moment it starts to shake, is always a sequence of total stillness followed by spatial chaos. Meteo rain vs the silence inside a capsule, breaking cranes (again the cranes are flying...) vs the sight of Earth framed by a window. We get the most powerful womb representation that i can think of in my whole life in films, and the metaphor of poles, of touching extremes is complete, as the intimacy of the uterus kisses the intimacy of the infinite, where Clooney is allowed to sing while he sees the sunset, or rise.This is the second film in 2 years that: -really changed me; -was compared by a great deal of people to 2001; -which i find has nothing to do with it. Is it the fact that he films planets and black space? That the actors are dressed as astronauts? That we have scenes in zero gravity? The other film was Malick's Tree of Life.This is the best 3D i've seen. Nowhere else have i seen such a meaningful use of the possibilities.My opinion: 5/5",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Much better than I excepted,On the paper this movie didn't seem that interesting but I decided to bite the bullet and go watch this on 3D and oh boy what an exciting ride it was. Never before a movie with only two characters have been so interesting and exciting that you actually felt sorry that it ended already. Yes maybe there were one or two too many close calls so it started to feel a bit outdated already but anyhow this was the best movie I have seen in theaters for a long time. Also the 3D actually first time worked in this one. It was much better than even in Avatar which was the previous movie where 3D actually brought something to the table.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gripping tension and visual splendor. A true movie event.,"Gravity (Cuaron, 2013, A)To my mind, those who knock the script are mostly failing to see the forest for the trees. Problems are there to be sure, but to avoid seeing this would be a regrettable miscalculation. For me, the script worked in a terse, elemental sort of way as it pokes toward transcendent themes that are better evoked through the visual and aural landscape than the dialog. But I think the story elements stand solely because Bullock lifts them on up on her shoulders and ultimately her performance not only deeply impressed me, but moved me. I believe most writers (and I fall squarely within this camp) lack the necessary vocabulary to express the wonder of these visuals. Thankfully, they speak for themselves. Yet, perhaps I am most pleased to find a film, so rare in the current American mega-production model, that is precisely as long as it must be. I can't speculate how this one will age (even four years have not been kind to AVATAR) but for now it is miraculous.Final thought: For a much more eloquent assessment, I suggest you consult MZS's review at RogerEbert.com (www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gravity-2013) or AO Scott at the New York Times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity did grab my attention,"With all the hype surrounding this movie, and being a fan of Sandra Bullock in the process, I simply had to see what it was all about; needless to say I liked it well enough but can't help but wonder if all that hype is misguided.Alfonso Cuaron directs a 90 minute film in fine style; the spectacular cinematography and effects are conducted with such tenacity you can't help but feel you're actually in space! It really is astounding work, that alone marks a 10/10!The casting of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney is an interesting aspect; in my opinion, Clooney is bordering on the annoying side but Bullock adds a real sense of sensitivity and emotion to the part of Ryan Stone (even if she is just talking to herself nearly all of the time), while any dramatic scenes add a sense of urgency and feeling to the viewer to want to stick with the story and find out what happens next. It is these characteristics to Gravity that make it stand on its own two feet well enough.However, although Gravity proved an amiable enough film to me (perhaps due to the technical complexity surrounding it), too much emphasis has been placed on this. In the not so near future it may be seen to be a slightly - if not highly - overrated movie. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
DO NOT Waste Time or Money Seeing This - FALSELY Rated Film,To say I feel disgusted and ripped off by this film is an understatement. I watch a LOT of movies and this is just an outright terrible film. I saw it in 3D which added nothing to the movie experience and to be honest was a complete waste of time and money and there were few scenes (if any) that merited 3D at all.However my greatest contempt is for this website itself (IMDb) who have either actively been involved or deliberately allowed a false rating to be contrived and displayed on this website to dupe people into seeing it.Either the film studio has paid people to write and give falsely great reviews (films above 8.0 are rare) or IMDb have taken money to deceive people like myself into seeing this film with its artificially created high rating.Whether I like a film or not it is irrelevant because I can always find reasons why others would disagree with me but this film had nothing at all to offer.To summarize it was a very weak story line with rather unbelievable lines as to how anyone could have survived and little or no special effects making me for only the third time in my life want to ask for my money back but this film definitely was my highest rated rip off film of all time as I was conned by this site into seeing it because of its false 8.7 rating.I feel so strongly that I may even sue the film studio for misrepresentation as I was definitely not entertained in any shape or form by this film an very much doubt I shall be using this site in future unless they do something about this rating fixing.,1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The director Cuaron must have been born under a lucky star,"I've read both Angelina Jolie and Natalie Portman were ready to play Sandra Bullock's part. Neither would have reached the delightful heights Ms. Bullock does. Trust me, out of the three she is far and away the best choice; halfway through this arresting movie I was thinking how completely perfect the casting was, and that casting is of Clooney and Bullock. Apparently this movie was blessed from the beginning in being able to land the one star who was capable of lifting this movie way beyond even its lofty ambitions.The idea of bringing a story like this to the screen is a completely reckless one. There are so many obviously impossible shots in this story only a madman would have agreed to tackle it. And yet it works. From the moment it started I was physically engaged in the action. For once, it paid to watch it in Imax and 3-D, but I'm not sure the movie's impact would have suffered if I watched it low tech.The story is a simple one of survival in space. But that's enough to make it utterly unforgettable in the way only the best basic science-fiction used to pull off when I was a kid. There are leaps of logic here, but you won't mind them, if you have any heart.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Perfect Combination of Thrill Ride and Meaningful Message,"I can't understand why so many people rate this movie so low. This is a precious film. I don't care if it's not accurate in terms of facts in physics or spacecraft knowledge. But while I was watching it, I felt like I was being put into the space and experience how it feels and how difficulty life can be for human when we are without ""gravity,"" how the earth is beautiful and created just perfectly to be our home. I don't think the point of the movie is to make a perfect scientific film. It has a much deeper meaning about human being and our place in the universe. It also has a theme about not giving up, stop dwelling in the despair and give life everything you have although you don't know if you will make it to the destination. Not matter how it turns out, life ""is one hell of a ride!"" It is a film with a spiritual message, particularly that scene that makes the main character get back her courage and her will to live. (Some people think that the scene is ridiculous but to me it's so beautiful and carries a very good meaning. I love it.) And I also love the way they put the belief about afterlife into it, not much but just enough to make this film precious and worth more than the whole crap of non-sense scientific film from Hollywood today. Watching this film...I gain back my courage and the will to live, and I'll try to be thankful for every moment of life, and for the earth that we are living in.Besides, I think it is smart that the film uses only a very small cast and put most effort into special effect, creating a fascinating picture of what is like to be out in the space and be without gravity, making it look so real. The storyline is good. I enjoy the thrill ride from the beginning to the end. It was a very entertaining film to me as well.

I was absolutely sucker punched in the face. It is definitely the best looking special effects film in history. The details, the physics, everything just makes sense, it keeps you watching and interested. It's a 1 1/2 hour long film and it feels like 2+ hours. One thing I do recommend, watch it in 3D.

Simply the best movie of the year,"http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/gravity-3d-2013-2/Gravity is simply brilliant movie. Gravity is claustrophobic thriller about surviving. Gravity is incredible realistic space adventure. Gravity is extremely beautiful to watch. Gravity sounds perfect balance between Steven Prices roaring score and absolute silence. Gravity is simply the best movie of the year. If I have to bet next spring Oscars, I would say that Gravity will get the most of the nominations and perhaps trophy's too. I bet the next ones:Best movie.Best director.Best leading actress.Best cinematography.Best staging.Best sound recording.We will see how many I hit it right. 3D is beautifully used and it brings great depth and that feeling of helplessness when you try to reach out the rescue that verge on your fingertips and you are totally powerless to affect to reach it. Gravity is one of the most visually stunning space adventure motion picture. From a simply story movie grows to breathtaking survival story which fights against the time and decreasing oxygen. Sandra Bullock makes the most perfect role of her career as Dr. Ryan Stone. George Clooney is great as always, even his role stays Sandra Bullock's shadow. Movie is certainly worth to watch.

Technology blows my mind every year and Visionary Directors like Alfonso Cuarón himself knew exactly what he was doing. -The story itself? An incredible journey.

3D or Not... Either Way Gravity Is Going To Be One Hell of An Experience.,"Surpassing all hype & expectations with finesse, exhibiting excellence in nearly all aspects of filmmaking & making exceptional use of its third dimension, Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity is a cinematic spacewalk of jaw-dropping beauty, wonder & amazement that not only succeeds as one of the best films of its year but is a marvel of technical filmmaking that pushes the cinematic art form to new realms while also marking a huge leap for VFX in cinema.Set in space, Gravity tells the story of mission specialist Ryan Stone aboard a NASA space shuttle on her very first assignment which is being supervised by a veteran astronaut out on his final mission. Disaster strikes when the high-speed debris of a defunct satellite destroys their spaceship, thus leaving the two stranded in space with nothing but each other. Rest of the story focuses on Stone's journey as she finds hope & will to survive in the face of imminent death.Co-written & directed by Alfonso Cuarón, Gravity presents the notable filmmaker at the very peak of his so-far-illustrious career for he's taken a simple setting of a catastrophe, applied it in space, refined it with precision detailing & accurate science, intertwined each aspect with liberal arts and finally encapsulated the whole picture with the third dimension to provide a breathtaking experience of sheer awe & astonishment while the core content also deals with the themes of loss, isolation, resilience, mortality & rebirth in a concise manner.Coming to the technical aspects, Gravity is a triumph in every department. Starting with Cinematography, Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work introduces some new inventions in 3D photography and employs the long, continuous & unbroken single takes with sublime effectiveness to immerse the viewers into its world. And with the help of its fluid movements & contrasting shots, which seamlessly blends the warm imagery of Earth with bleakness of the rest of space, also does a fab job in narrating the plot visually.Editing trims the whole narrative down to 90 minutes which is expertly paced although there are a few moments in the middle when it feels like hitting a snag but that's only for a short duration & doesn't really hurt the whole experience. The silence of outer space does serve as accurate science to a considerable extent but it never stopped Steven Price to come up with a spectacular score that ultimately turned this already effective thriller into an absolute nightmare of escalating terror with its loud, intense & unsparing tracks.Apart from its two actors, almost everything in this film is computer-generated and yet the crisp images retain such high degree of realism with its authentic depiction of zero gravity, spacewalks, explosions along with geographic view of Earth, solar reflections & many other elements that it further signifies the careful attention with which the whole production was carried out and on an overall scale marks a huge step for VFX in cinema. Add to that, even the Sound aspect is nicely taken care of & exists only where it needs to.As far as performances go, there are only two characters we interact with in this narrative, actually one for the majority of its runtime. Now I'm not a fan of Sandra Bullock yet here I was quite enamoured by her vulnerable character who goes through plethora of emotions ranging from fear, frustration & hopelessness to rediscovered resilience, willingness to live & eventual spiritual reincarnation. Supporting her briefly is George Clooney in a tailor-made role that also provided little comic relief in what is an unforgiving & harrowing depiction of life in vacuum.Throughout its runtime, Gravity also pays tribute to a number of space classics, including Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Ridley Scott's Alien, Ron Howard's Apollo 13 & surprisingly Pixar's WALLE as well. Although it is heavily influenced from many disaster films of the past, the very experience it provides, especially in 3D, is unlike anything put on screen before. The third dimension really adds a great amount of depth to its premise while amplifying the rest of the elements, thus turning it into something that feels all the more special & personal.On an overall scale, Gravity is a fascinating blend of cinematic art & big-screen spectacle that qualifies as the finest film of its year, is the closest we've come to experiencing outer space on silver screen, and is an incredibly riveting thriller that's totally worth your time & money. Outstandingly directed, finely written, brilliantly performed, cleverly edited, briskly paced, gorgeously photographed, magnificently scored & skilfully balancing all its elements from start to finish, Gravity is as rewarding an experience emotionally as it is viscerally, is deserving of all the praise it has garnered to date & is a must-watch on the biggest screen possible.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Seen this so many times before...,"As you listen to the critics gush you hope this will be the movie you have waited for all year.

Pale Blue Dot,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hopefully you aren't expecting yet another in the seemingly endless stream of unadulterated praise fests for Alfonso Cuaron's critically beloved and audience pleasing Gravity. While the mass appeal is certainly understandable, I've never been one to sit back and accept the surface value.There are two elements for discussion here: the visually stunning and technical marvel from a filmmaking perspective, and the emotionally-manipulating and somewhat emptiness of the narrative story-telling and characters. On the technical front, one would be hard-pressed to come up with a more impressive film. It is simply breath-taking, especially when seen in the format it should be seen ... 3D IMAX. Rarely, if ever, has space seemed more real, more beautiful and more ominous. From the extended opening take (Cuaron is known for his long takes), to the numerous shots of Planet Earth (from dominating the screen, to reflections in helmet shields), we are drawn in to the space walking and perils of Kowalski (George Clooney) and Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock).From an entertainment viewpoint, the film works as high-stress, thrilling space mission gone bad and ultimate survival story. What left me feeling a bit distracted and hence, quite annoyed, was the often eye-rolling dialogue seemingly designed to force our connection with the Clooney and, especially, Bullock characters. I prefer to experience my own emotions in both real life and in movies ... obvious cues and manipulating tugs through weak character development drives me away from, rather than towards the desired connectivity. My issues with the film are not related to the numerous scientific issues identified by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. This is all explained away by Mr. Cuaron's statement that the film is ""not a documentary"". If we can be cool with Forrest Gump creating the smiley face, we can accept that Sandra Bullock can navigate her way between space stations with a fire extinguisher.Despite this, it's tough to argue against the technical marvel and thrilling experience created here. The 3D adds depth of field and adds a touch of realism, rather than the gimmicky tricks we often see with the format. With only a couple of jarring exceptions, Steven Price's score is minimal and complimentary to the quietness of space. Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men) re-teams with Cuaron for the extraordinary look. Some of the symbolism was a bit overdone - recurring umbilical imagery for the re-birth, but it's done to ensure no viewer misses the point. Finally, I got a kick out of Ed Harris' voice coming from Mission Control (think back to The Right Stuff and Apollo 13).",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Technical Dazzle Matched by Real Film-making,"Gravity is the most technically astounding and visually stimulating film I have ever seen. The immersive cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki lays the building blocks for fantastic visual achievement. It is built upon by amazing editing that makes the film seem seamless, with multiple- minute shots quite common. The awe-inspiring visual effects are laid on top, creating an incredibly accurate picture of space. The sound editing also accounts for the fact that no sound can be heard in space, as we only hear what the astronauts themselves can hear. This allows the film's score to take center stage, and it does just that. The score creates another immersive facet of this film due to its eerie tone and sudden stops. The production design is also top-notch, accurately portraying all of the spacecraft the astronauts utilize.Now, all of this would be for naught if the story and acting were lackluster in any way. Thankfully, they both excel. The story has a very deliberate pace that excels at balancing character development and suspenseful action sequences. Because the movie is short, it never truly drops its pace, allowing it to pack quite a punch. The acting is truly impeccable. Sandra Bullock gives arguably the best performance of her career, while Clooney supports her nicely as Bullock's foil. Clooney, playing the more experienced astronaut, remains calm during the crises on screen; Bullock panics quite often and is always tense, being the rookie. Subtleties like these manifest themselves quite well on screen and fill in several unspoken pieces of character background. In conclusion, Gravity's technical dazzle is completely matched by its highly competent story and acting, creating a groundbreaking masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Groundbreaking and Mind Blowing Entertainment,"I have to agree with James Cameron on this one, gravity is definitely one of the best space movies ever made.

The CGI and cinematography were very well executed and how space was visualized is just beautiful and breathtaking.

Realistic and stunning visuals,"If you are scientifically orientated and ever watched the usual space movies, you might be bothered by the often inaccurate portrayal of the physics that govern the vast void. I have to admit I felt that way when watching the protagonists fly their ship at the speed of light in the Star Wars-movies (even though I liked those movies, and am not exceptionally educated in natural sciences). This movie is of course nothing of that sort. It contains nothing magical that couldn't happen in the real world.Without giving anything away, Gravity is a movie about surviving in extreme conditions and, to a lesser extent, about portraying the motive one has to carry on despite overwhelming odds against one. It features impressive visuals best experienced in a movie theater (preferably 3D!). That said it's well worth watching and the excitement you'll receive will be greater than the feeling of getting ripped off by the expensive movie tickets. I would, however, have wished for a deeper pondering about the motives of hope a human being has amidst a seemingly hopeless situation. I found the real motives of the protagonists to stay alive too superficial, but if you are more into core action - then this movie will seem almost flawless.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Nice, but...","The movie is visually beautiful and tense, but it takes as much care about laws of physics as Harry Potter serial does. To avoid spoilers, I won't be too specific, but watching the movie reader will understand. Rule of thumb (avoiding technicalities) - to maintain stable orbit on certain altitude object needs to have specific (angular) speed relative to the center of the earth. For example ISS performs DAP (avoidance procedures) -moving significantly up or down by increasing or decreasing speed by 1m/s. Therefore, when increasing speed object will move in higher orbit, decreasing speed it will move to lower orbit. Aiming at space station from 100 miles distance and then accelerating significantly in its direction wouldn't bring you anywhere near it. If the orbits were perfectly aligned, one would end up few miles above of below it. Disregarding that, approaching station with speed difference of, let's guess 30m/s, isn't good idea. If aimed correctly, astronaut would end up as fly on windshield, with or without auxiliary source of thrust. Cloud of debris, due to earlier mentioned rule, can't return on the same ""place"" unless orbits were perfectly aligned in opposite direction. Besides, If speed of debris differs from target, they would move to different orbit. Just to mention that Hubble orbits almost 100 miles above ISS with different inclination. Moving between those two orbits is very complex task requiring quite lot of calculation Still, after accepting Harry Potter as reality standard, I like the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"If the movie breathes, I like the deep breath of this!","I felt that I had difficulty breathing for this movie. And the air was so fresh after watching.

If I were in her situation, I would give up on survival quickly. I'm not good at the silence and the emptiness. Perhaps it's harder to doubt your existance by yourself than the death.
The short of breathe which Cuarón depicted is including suffering as much as I don't want to watch it again. In spite of it, I am fascinated because my heart is shaken by a katharsis and a salvation enough to surpass them.
The impression and the comedy have the same gimmicks. Those are carried by ups and downs of tension. The more extreme the situation is, the bigger the emotional range is.In Japan, it is called 'Zero Gravity.' But the original title is just 'Gravity.'

Innovative Thriller A Must-see,"Alfonso Cuaron does it yet again! After ""Children of Men"", I had high expectations for this film. I was worried that the trailer would fully summarize the film, but there is a lot to experience by watching the entire film. I would certainly classify this as a thriller, because space is a scary place. With good use of sound (or lack thereof), camera angles, and cinematography, this movie deserves a solid 7/10. Though the movie is intended to make the audience feel alone and isolated, I still wish that the cast was larger (or at least more developed). Other than that, I saw no issues with this movie.

Acting is well, expected to be good with Sandra and Clooney.At some moments in the movie, I expected a philosophical angle or an inspirational side to it. But even that was found wanting. The end was especially disappointing. Seemed like, they didn't had a proper script to bring her back to Earth and just went with a 2nd grader method of solving problems.Watch but lower your expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Visually great, technically irreproachable, but the script has serious problems.","I watched this movie yesterday or the night before last and, frankly, I was a bit divided about it. I expected something more. The script is simple: in the near future, a severe blast causes a chain reaction destroying most orbiting satellites and launching a shower of space debris compromising the survival of a team of American astronauts who were repairing the Hubble Telescope. It's a plot that works but has serious credibility problems based on the great improbability of all our satellites being destroyed at the same time. It also totally ignores some science issues such as the abundance of space junk in Earth's orbit and has a plot hole that rubs the absurd: how the astronauts were able to listen to dogs in China if they were not even able to communicate with the own base in Houston? Sandra Bullock is the main character, in the role of a scientist who was selected for that mission by being an expert on the subject. The actress is good and her quality is unquestionable but I think her character wasn't well thought. Despite being a rookie in space and showing little training, her character is able to decently decouple herself in a ISS shuttle and in a Chinese one, something her training would probably never have prepared her for not being strictly necessary to her mission. There is a latent contradiction here, and it does not to be a physical or a genius to realize that and to detect others in the film. George Clooney is a good supporting actor but sometimes his posture, somewhat childish and relaxed, prevented me from actually feeling any tension, not to mention that the way he dies is absolutely cliché. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron works reasonably, and I think I realized some scenes that intentionally copy great films of the past in order to to honor them. This is beautiful and symbolic. The end of the film also seems loaded with symbolism.The technical issue, however, is beyond reproach. CGI is absolutely grand and the images of our planet are breathtaking. I liked cinematography and soundtrack, discrete but competent. The way they put the actors floating weightless also seems incredible and realistic, just like the ships, tools, space suits and even the floating debris. Visually, the film is powerful and realistic but it's not the first time I say this: it's not a CGI storm that makes a good movie. The script has to be good. And the fact is that the script of this film, although it works, has a lot of holes, errors, absurd moments and contradictions. No matter how improbable is the situation the movie shows, the audience has to feel that it's real and it's happening. And I could not feel it here.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful story about the personal lives of 3 astronauts during a terrible time.,"many people want to say it wont have a story because there is no way you can fit 90 minutes of space into a film. BUT It did have a story. it goes into the Drama/adventure Genre. Adventure being a journey. People say there's no compelling story, but (small spoiler**) the journey is them going back to Earth.** The hobbit's story (among a few others interlaced within) is them making their way to a destination, with all the mishaps that happen during the trip.there are four types of literary conflict: Man V Man, Man V Self, Man V Situation/Nature, Man V Social. This Film is Man V Self and Man V Situation/Nature.The reason it's so foreign to many people is that the most common in films lately is Man V Man. This one, however is not man V Man in any way.this is a film where it's best to watch it in 3D, and imagining yourself in their shoes. 3D because when people walk in space, they feel disoriented because there's no true orientation of X, Y, and Zedd axis, and the 3D mixed with the camera floating around freely helps put you in THEIR place. I saw it in 2D but it just doesn't work for this film.I LOVED this movie. I watched it twice. once on my own and another with a group because after them seeing my excitement after the film they were compelled to see if I was right, and They all agreed: this movie was awesome.TECHNICAL: They didn't bend the real laws of physics in this film, at least not in an immediately noticeable way. The cinematography is brilliant. Color is amazing. Acting rocks! don't expect action when it's not needed, but don't expect to be disappointed when there is action. the score ROCKS! Steven Price did an AMAZING job with the soundtrack, filling the gaps of would be near silent audio. sound editing is brilliant, I don't want to give a whole lot away about the feel of the film, but the underwater no- air sound was done extremely well. I was jaw dropped through the majority of the film. there was never a dull moment, and when you put it all together, you get 15 minute cuts. some entire scenes are done with just 1 or 3 takes, but don't expect it to feel like a tripod shot. you'll hardly notice and even forget that there wasn't many cuts.the point i'm trying to make here, is that, ignore the trailer, the actual film itself is one of the best of this year, and one of the best from and for many years to come. it's up there. the boundaries in every sense has been pushed. I will be wanting to watch this again VERY soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

A modern classic,"What can I say about this film? Well, it was incredible. If you haven't seen it yet, you better hurry on down to your local theatre at once - because this is an experience that is intended for the big screen. I was very lucky - only 2 other people in the theatre with me (I viewed it at non-peak times), and this just added to the integrity of the film. The second the first frame comes into focus you really have to appreciate the aspiring atmosphere and view of Earth from space.The movie is fairly short with a run time of just 90 mins. However, I felt that if the run time had been extended, there would have been too much dialogue and unnecessary sequences, which would distract from the overall experience. I really can't admire Sandra Bullock enough for her outstanding performance in this role, and I fell she performs even better, and incorporates more emotion into her performance than in her Oscar winning film 'The blind side'.The visuals are something that needs to be seen in 3D. The depth is incredible. Alfonso Cuaron does not attempt to use any cheesy 'pop out' 3D spectacles, but instead uses subtle elements to really place the viewer in the moment. Such might include a small crew floating past the screen or a water droplet. If you thought 'Apollo 13' looked amazing, just you wait.Clooney is also good for his role..But what's important here is the film was pulled off to a exquisite extent and incorporates loss, hope and the beauty of life all in one short package. I will be buying this in 3D bluray upon release, but as I have previously mentioned, you must see it on the big screen to fully appreciate it for what it is....I'd like to see Star Wars VII top this, visually...",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"An Outstanding Military Film, that's Pitch Perfect","Background on myself, I have been an IMDb user for over three years, I am from the Ohio area, but I support all mid-west arts, film and creative types. I saw this film in Chicago at the historic Wilmette Theater, and I REALLY enjoyed both great movies from Monterey Media this year that were coincidentally films made in Michigan including ""The Citizen"" and ""Approaching Midnight"". I am admitting to being slightly biased as a mid-west film scene supporter but praise has to be given to intense work from such amazing MoTown Filmmakers. As for this one, I don't want to give away any twist endings that the trailer almost gives away, but the film is stellar! I also loved Cinematographer Carl Ballou's work on this movie, it's like ""The Thin Red Line,"" very Emmanuel Lubezki like, kind of reminded me of ""Tree of Life"" too. The movies soundtrack was very omniscient, and I have been watching the very cool works of composer James Stonehouse or a long time who created a track on this film that was a borderline of Hanz Zimmer and John Ottman, who scored the Usual Suspects. Which is funny, because when I was watching the film at the theater in the suburban Chicago area, the theater had an awesome 5.1 setup that fantastically captured the elements of the soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
impressive,"for images. and for story. for powerful emotions. and for music. for something who escapes to words. because it has the rare gift to remind many other movies about space but be different at whole. it is easy to admire it or criticize the errors. but, in fact, it is more a letter/parable than a movie. the precision of technique tools, the magnificent work of Alfonso Cuaron, one of the best roles of Sandra Bullock are pieces of a wise puzzle about life, survive, fight, hope and fragility. a film who impress not only as complete work but for the gentle, inspired manner to send a profound universal message. and for visual delight who shatters the limits between chair and screen.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Special effects never felt so real.,"Let me start off: I didn't get to see the movie in 3D, devastating, I know, but I was still able to absorb the glistening and awe inspiring visuals even in classic 2D.There are an abundance of films that are special effects orientated out there today, and quite a few use CGI without realizing that they are taking away depth and story away from the film, CGI and film always coincide with each other in balancing out story and effects.This film however had no problem with that, everything from the subtle P.O.V shots of earth to objects colliding in this film seemed to vividly jaw dropping, from start to finish, every bit of the film consisted of CGI but yet it felt so organic I felt as if I was within the drama, weightlessly floating in space with only oxygen and a space suit. Space never felt so enthralling yet so isolated, and by the time it was over those 90 minutes felt more like a heartbeat.I can't give any of the plot away because any giving of information other than the visuals of the movie would give away this compendious plot, that being said, it still works wonderfully with the CGI this whole movie essentially enshrouds itself in.Well, if you haven't seen gravity yet, what are you waiting for? Its one of the best films of the space genre and is sure to be around at the Oscars for best special effects, I do recommend 3D for a more immersive experience though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

A unique cinematic sensory experience,"I saw it in 3D on Friday (couple of days ago) with a mate. I wasn't expecting much, but I was convinced by my friend that he had been told that the 3D was very good and worth the over £12 we paid for the ticked (quite pricey in my opinion), so I didn't go with any further expectations. I don't think he went with any expectations either, and a few minutes into the movie our jaws dropped and remained like that for most of the remaining of the movie.Gravity is an incredible cinematic experience and deserves the good marks that it is receiving. I would avoid the opinion of those miserable pedantic internet wise little people talking about script/plot etc. Seriously. It doesn't try to wow you with epic phrases or a plot involving anything other than potentially real situations in space and strong and specific characters, it does wow you by traveling with you in the skin of the main character, making you feel what she feels. It also wows you with stunning, realistic and memorable scenes, and some symbolism to take its meaning a bit further.I absolutely recommend it.

"Best visual, 3D movie till today with a superb acting Bullock","I rated a 10, exceptional, and that it is. I have rated 3 movies with a 10, so it is not my custom way of doing. Certainly better films will come, but today it is one of the best I ever seen. The subject is unique and it is a very hard one not to make a boring movie. It is NOT, you are nailed on your seat. Only 2 actors, George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, no site stories, no chases, just Sandra and George and their story to survive in outer space and to try to save themselves. Such a ""clean"" movie and such a thriller. Lets make it clear directly : This is a Sandra Bullock movie and she does a superb job. This time George Clooney is just George and providing the movie of some relaxing moments. Sandra Bullock is a good actress and in this movie she proves it. In fact she already did so in Crash, but this one is to confirm it. She has to survive, but she will also overcome her personal problems. Just good acting ! Why she bothers to evolve herself with some crap movies?! You have to see it in 3D, it is a must. The movie will loose a lot when seen in 2D. Their are some fantastic visual shots of earth, of the debris passing by the ISS, of the water floating in space, better said in the theater. The camera-work is done in an almost excellent way. For example when the camera moves in the helmet of Dr Stone, in 3D, it is like you are in her place. The visuals on earth and space is an eye festivity. The story is well done, not complicated, just find the way back you could say and 1:30 hrs is just the time to do so, not boring at all. May be you want to search for some mistakes in the movie. Well there are, obvious. But which movie doesn't have ? Example : On a certain moment it seems there is gravity in space when holding some objects ... OK, that is it. Just go to see it in 3D. It is a masterpiece of today's possibilities in movie making.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A visual masterpiece, although far from flawless concerning story and characters","Gravity, or, as I like to call it, 99 Reasonable Arguments Against Becoming an Astronaut, is one of the most visually striking and impressive films in recent history and definitely a benchmark for all the science-fiction flicks to come after it. The good news about this is that Alfonso Cuarón didn't solely achieve this because of the hundred million budget he was provided with, but also through wonderful imagination and, I assume, loads of research.Writing a script with only one or two on-screen characters in a life- threatening situation has lately become a Hollywood screenwriter's favourite thing to do and Gravity doesn't exactly reinvent this drama sub-genre. That isn't of much consequence however, as the UK/US co- production is centred on a person's behaviour and the emotions induced under these grave circumstances. Sandra Bullock is this person in Gravity and quite possibly gives the performance of her career (if not an Oscar-worthy one), as she remains realistic even when she's the only person we see and thus undergoes even more scrutiny than otherwise. There isn't really anything we get to know about her character other than her daughter having died at the age of four, but just her being in and attempting to handle such a situation is highly interesting to watch.Anyway, what you'll really remember about Gravity are the visuals. As far as I've read, pretty much anything besides the faces of Bullock and her colleague in peril, George Clooney, was created through special effects, and yet, the film is one of the most lifelike and believable depictions of space ever made. And while I'm unaware of how much cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki participated in the looks of Gravity, the result is an immensely good-looking motion picture, showing space as a place of heaven-like beauty in one scene and as a frightening and dark setting for a horror film in the other. Every visual aspect about it is meticulously wrought and stunning to look at, making you appreciate just how much work was invested in realising every tiny detail about the film in the best way.With such a big-scale production, a plot less thin and predictable would've been desirable, especially due to the fact that you need more than just visuals to make a film rewatchable. But there is really no denying that Cuarón has accomplished a most impressive and breathtaking film with Gravity, that should at least scoop the technical trophies at the Academy Awards.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
An experience over story,"Gravity is one of those movies you regret not seeing in the biggest theater possible. The way it looks, how the camera moves around, the angles they go with, the special effects, the whole visual package is just phenomenal to look at. Easily one of the most impressive films in a while when it comes to the whole ""moving pictures"" aspect.Gravity keeps things simple and focuses on the essentials. It is meant to be an experience, rather than a statement of something profound. That doesn't mean there isn't a story or even a point to be found within it, but they are both secondary to the vision. Kind of like a Nirvana song. There are lyrics, but the music came first.And what music, or visuals in this case, it is. Gravity steals your breath away from the very first scene, with a long establishing shot where the camera simple circles around the space station from one astronaut to another, without a single cut to be seen. Amazingly beautiful, which the rest of the movie easily keeps up until the very end. I'm also impressed how full they managed to make the space look. This could have simply been white human blobs floating against the darkness of vacuum, but through good angles and orbital location, they manage to make it look better than that.The rest of the aspects work very well as well. The absence of sound in space is utilized well and the actors are all at the top of their game. Though, to be fair, whereas Sandra Bullock completely submerges herself into the role of Ryan Stone, giving a very impressive performance, with George Clooney I always saw only George Clooney in space. Still a good performance, though.Gravity will pull you into an unforgettable journey and is one of the most ambitious and impressive scifi films to come out in years. Definitely worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

From its stunning cinematography, superb acting (with a limited cast), faultless production, and exceptional use of 3D CGI, Gravity is a terrifyingly accurate portrayal of lifelessness in space and the sheer struggle of life over death in the most hopeless of situations. Gravity whilst sharing it's disaster theme with many other movies is something new that goes deeper, particularly in the scenes where Ryan talks about her daughter, at least thats how I saw it.

Loving Movie,"As a piece of technology, Gravity is really impressive. I always think that the absolute best use of special effects in films are those where you forget how impressive they are because they really don't stand out as different from everything else but are just part of the construct. That is the case here as space just feels real and the huge amount of work to make it happen isn't made a fuss of and doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film. Helping you forget this is the fact that the film is a real experience in terms of the story as a ride. Within a few minutes you are in the middle of the experience and it really doesn't stop until the end. Visually I did still feel the 3D made the images darker than they should have been and reduced the clarity of my whole field of vision, but in this case the feeling of being ""in"" the film really work and aside from one or two ""thing coming at you"" moments, it really worked. For me equally impressive was the sound engineering; most sound effects are given a really satisfying ""via contact"" sound – the sound where the vibrations come via water or another material like they vibrate through your body rather than in the air.

Space Thriller,"Alfonso Cuaron's gripping 3D extravaganza finally delivers a movie well-worth its 3D special effects, which puts to shame the simplistic idiocy of ""Avatar"". Around the Earth's orbit a team of American astronauts are repairing communication lines on a space shuttle. While scientist-engineer Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) focuses on the technical issues, experienced, slightly cowboyish Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) frivolously space-walks engaging into boyish banter of 'did I ever tell you of the time...' When a Russian destruction of a obsolete satellite results in the a cascading domino effect of catastrophic scale, the shuttle is destroyed with Kowalski and Stone drifting in space with oxygen slowly running out.Not exactly a sci-fi, as basically the only element that hints at anything remotely other-worldly is a short dream sequence near the end of the movie. Apart from that, save for some small script liberties, this is a factual riveting thriller, basically as down-to-earth as cosmic space stories goes as possible. Sandra Bullock returns to form with her great portrayal, grasping all the moments from despair and panic to resignation and the will to live. She is also expertly paired up with the whimsical, but stoic, Kowalski, together with some superb visuals and perfect building of tension, bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase: In space no one will hear you scream...The dramatic/philosophical edge to the movie may not work as well, with the whole backdrop of Stone's dead child somewhat struggling to add relevance to the story, nonetheless this is in no way written or delivered in a substandard way, thus not of any detriment to overall enjoyment.Required watching.

"Some Sci-Fi, Some Action, Some Drama, Average Script, Average Acting = about a 7/10","I like sci-fi, do you? then you may likeee this movie*but* it's no documentary (i.e. don't expect to learn anything new or cool that you didn't already know or assume). Double I.E. - whatever you've ever hoped to be portrayed in floating-in-space movies you've already seen in movies like Apollo 13 and Armageddon.I like action, do you? well, this movie has some, i.e. a little, like 4/10 worth quantity-wise, but it's like 8/10 largely due to the nice visuals, animation-graphics/cgi/rotoscoping/whatever-you-call-it. If you like to play video games like me you may like the occasional moments of being suspended in space and wondering which buttons one might push to reorient yourself, while avoiding debris at the same time.I like drama, do you? this movie could just barely qualify for drama, though it's no save-the-world Armageddon, or Downtown Abbey, or whatever you please. I did tear up in parts near the end, but i do that moreso than most others do generally anyways, i presume. I tear up too when the trumpets blow during starting-television coverage of breakfast at Wimbledon each year, if you know what i mean.What fails most about this movie is the blatant use of two of the worst and most-gratuitously used emotional tugs of all time, the same-old never-ending cliché' oft-used in movies about ""Ditzy girl gets chased, falls down, shoe comes off (or heel breaks)', barely makes it out"" routine, and the man needlessly sacrifices self for woman routine. I found myself angry at the film about 5 to 10 minutes in when i realized that that was the direction they were taking it with the S.Bullock character. And then i more or less had to give-up completely on the reality-aspect and emotionally-involved aspects of the film with the purposefully and needlessly gratuitous hangin'-by-a-thread/throw-me-a- line use-of-death routine.

I have no problem with total carnage, ala Saving Private Ryan, or everyone lives, ala The Lord of The Rings, but gratuitous use of men stepping on grenades so that some ditz- girl can go the distance is bound to turn off much of the population, both male and female.Like i said in the subject line, about a 7/10. IMDb says budget was 100mil - i guess i can see that, and you can too just by looking at the long list of animators used on this film on IMDb's credit-page for this movie. I'm glad i saw it; i wouldn't say it wasn't worth the money, as it at-least adds to the cannon of sci-fi movies i've seen over the years, but i doubt it rises to the level of water-cooler talk that a Apollo-13 did, nor should it. I suppose it's OK, in-a-way, to see a director or script-writer try to make a minimalist movie that largely revolves around 2 characters, as that tactic is seldom used, and for that the director could receive some credit, however, if he'd wanted to, he could have elongated the introduction and the conclusion just a bit, though what he had worked in a get-to-the-point and let-the-viewers'- imagination-decides-what-happens-next sort of ways. I can't really comment too much on the acting, since these are your typical, typecast, big-budget actors doing big-budget roles, and sadly, they seemingly took stereotypical scripts that involved the aforesaid helpless-girl/chivalrous-guy routines.Don't expect to learn anything, but be impressed with the visuals, much like you might for a Transformers, or really any modern movie that now uses cool-unknown effects from the minds of all sorts of background contributing artists. Whoever is responsible for some of the scenes and/or camera work involving the destructive-chaos and debris-mayhem, what with the dangerous fly-bys and rotating camera views, deserves some props for viewing-angle-choreography.Last word, i almost forgot... yeah i partly went to see if because i was wondering if it was at all based on reality, which it is obviously not. There's no Apollo 13, true-to-life history to be had here. It's all fiction. And lastly, there were a couple brief shots of S.Bullock trying to make her look like the Tomb Raider girl (if you know what i mean), albeit in an A Space Odyssey fetalesqe position, it's just too bad they had to use a B-rated, KeanuReevesish/MatthewMacConaughy type actress to do it. I would of rather wished she either puked or crapped her pants at some point, or just gone all-out hysterical, as no doubt many of us would, or at least let out some primal-scream of victory at the end, not the emotional mediocrity we were given. Washed-up-on-the- beach yes, but Lost it is not.Oh, and also (last last word), the other reason you may decide to see it is because of the title character, Clooney. i admit his bearded-pieces in recent years have given me more hope that he, too, may rise from B- actor, kevin-costner-like movie-qualities, even though his bearded characters still had a one-dimensional, or overly violent quality to them. Sadly, it seems he has taken a minor step back in this role, though due partly to the script/script-choice, as his character is whittled down from main-draw marketing, to passe'-narrator, repeating for 1/2 an hour what we were all already thinking (relax, breathe, calm- down, relax, calm-down, breathe, relax, breathe, calm-down, etc. etc.).",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Stop advertising as a good movie,"I went to see this movie based on IMDb rating but i just don't understand why this score and all the good reviews over the net are all about. This movie has no story development, no character development and the scrip sucks. What took me by surprise was George Clooney taking this mediocre paper that just throws a couple of jokes. It goes nowhere and the scientific flaws are everywhere. The sound effects and music are the only you can rescue here. If you want to hear a girl moaning all the run time this is for you. No even the 3d or Imax can save this movie. Waste of time. Your better go watch 2001: A Space Odissey a real masterpiece of science fiction and we will talk then.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Will be revered for generations to come.,"Comparisons to Kubrick's sacred 1968 masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey may seem premature, but I see no reason why Alfonso Cuaron's sumptuous space saga won't be revered just as highly for generations to come. Gravity is undoubtedly one of the most visually stunning and awe-inspiring films of the year - hell, the millennium - with it's flawless CGI, immersive 3D and technically astounding single-shot sequences. Cuaron announced himself as a ground-breaking filmmaker with his superb Children of Men back in 2006, but he outdoes himself here, with the reported 2 years of post-production paying off in spades. Never do you feel like you're not hundreds of kilometres in the sky, floating around gasping finite amounts of oxygen in an environment where no-one can hear your pleas of rescue and your thoughts are louder than the explosions that tear apart space stations. There's never a second of superfluous material or plodding narrative; every frame is meticulously crafted, every word of dialogue essential and every note of music encapsulating, keeping you enraptured both optically and aurally from start to finish. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are in fine form too, generating real emotions despite being stuck in bulky spacesuits for majority of the runtime and occasionally having to handle the tricky proposition of talking to themselves. If you're a fan of cinema then do yourself a favour and fork out your hard earned cash to view the glorious Gravity on the big screen, it'll be an experience you won't soon forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A phenomenal technological feat.,"I went to see Gravity at the IMAX 3D,and I was not disappointed. The size of the screen, coupled with the technologically magnificent use of the medium, staggered me. The use of occasional first-person camera views and the 3D camera really put you in the shoes of the characters. Although some might have found these scenes boring, I found the broad sweeping views of space, the utter silence, and the sheer scale of everything, a humbling experience. The CGI creates a sense of reality as opposed to a world of imagination.The basic premise of the film is two surviving astronauts, after having their shuttle destroyed and being flung into space, attempting to survive. But it is not just floating around space the entire film, it's a heart-pounding thriller, as the characters are faced with almost continuous danger throughout the film.There is a fair amount of symbolism and philosophical subtext to a lot of the film, much of it centered around rebirth and self-realization. Bullock and Clooney are portrayed as having hugely divergent reactions and outlooks to the crisis and on a deeper level, life itself. The debris could be viewed simply as just that, debris. It could be viewed as the tendency for humans to abdicate responsibility (out of sight, out of mind) on a global scale, but it is always at our detriment. Or it could be viewed on a personally psychological level, as things we push aside and avoid coming back to haunt us. Gravity is hugely multifaceted, as are it's characters, and as such every viewer will view it and connect with the characters differently. The script is very well written.I highly recommend that you see this film in the full immersion experience of IMAX 3D, so you can fully appreciate the wondrous cinematography. But don't worry, if that's not an option, Gravity offers so much more. Quite easily my favourite film of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great thrill ride,"Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is an inexperienced astronaut repairing a satellite. Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) is a veteran close to breaking the spacewalk record. Meanwhile, a Russian attempt to bring down a satellite sets off a chain reaction as a cloud of debris destroys the shuttle. Then Stone and Kowalsky scrambles to get another way return home.As a story, there isn't much. As a movie, it's a thrilling ride. Director Alfonso Cuarón is using all the latest tech to create a believable adventure. The action is so realistic that it's like a scary amusement park ride. The leap forward is that the astronauts are so realistic. It could have been so easily reduced to a video game. But I actually believe the actors were in the suits, and we were crashing into all those space stuff. It's a must see on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The best 156 shots you'll ever see!,Gravity is a technical and directorial tour de force from Alfonso Cuarón sure to win some Oscars. Sandra Bullock almost single handily carries the film with an excellent screen performance. The technical complexity of this film which spent 4 years in development because technology wasn't advanced enough is quite mind-boggling. The opening shot is one continuous 17-min shot and the whole film is comprised of only 156 shots! Despite this low shot count there is plenty of complex camera movement. The visual effects are also very realistic and some of those VFX shots will go down in history as some of the most impressive ever seen. The 3D effect which in some movies doesn't work at all works very well here. This really is a film which you HAVE to see in the cinema if only for those space shots of the astronauts above our big blue planet. A very highly recommended masterpiece!,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"So women can't drive - is that your point, Mr. Cuaron?","I was disappointed by this movie. The plot is a dumbed-down version of Apollo 13. Unrealistic elements abound. Every seven-year-old can spot the flaws. The character of Ryan Stone is so incompetent, it is annoying. While the acting (impersonating a stupid character) may be great, the character itself is an abomination and spoils the entire movie. No space agency would launch such a person into space. Or perhaps the director wants to show that women cannot drive?Some say that the visuals are great. Yes they are, but we have seen it all before. Avatar and a hundred other films have great visuals. So that is not enough. I give it 3/10 because I was on the verge of walking out the theatre.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
First half better than second half,"Not really a spoiler, but I will put a spoiler warning on here just in case. First half of the movie is excellent, suspenseful and ultra realistic. The second half however goes a bit too far and loses its realism and the suspense takes a hit as a result. The film is most suspenseful when things are in the realm of possibility, but after one too many death defying feats one after the next you begin to realize you are just watching a movie and the suspension of disbelief is destroyed for the more avid/sophisticated viewer. I know, I know, I sound like a total film snob, but I think directors try to do too much to create suspense and they end up having the adverse effect by going a bit overboard.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
IMHO best movie ever!,"Short movie review of Gravity.After being an observer at IMDb for several years, I have decided to make an account, the reason is this movie Gravity.Just came back from this movie and I really had the feeling I was in space for the last 90 minutes or so. Sometimes the tension was to much to handle, there where some really scary moments during this movie. The effects also tricked me in believing I was really up there, never did I had the feeling that the CGI effects where faked, it looked like the real thing. The 3d effects also where top notch. The acting from SB & GC was also very realistic and both performed very well.To sum things up:Best movie I have ever seen!Why?*Original story (also liked skipping the unnecessary interlude, straight to the action) *Great cast/acting *Fantastic SE *Great ambiance *Optimal usage of 3d effects *It really does its name (Gravity) justice, you will understand this when you have seen the movieThis movie was so good that after seeing it, I would never even (if given the opportunity) think about going to space, it scarred the sh*t out of me, the movie (acting, story, sound, effects, ambiance) really catches the claustrophobic and fragile dependency on machinery very well.Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie in 3D!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
An unforgettable experience for the eyes and the mind.,"Gravity is the kind of film that doesn't often get made in Hollywood. The film was shot in the United Kingdom and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Director Alfonso Cuaron manages to grab us from the beginning in this science-fiction thriller with majestic views of Earth from space. We get introduced to Dr. Ryan Stone, played by Sandra Bullock, and Lieutenant Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney. The performances by Bullock and Clooney are both excellent. It's Bullock, however, who carries the film like an expert with a performance that makes her character sympathetic but also distant. Bullock is known both for her comedic roles (While You Were Sleeping, Demolition Man) and her dramatic roles (Speed, Crash). Gravity is very much an experience and the film should be seen in a theater. Cuaron combines drama and thrills for an emotionally satisfying result. The excellent visual effects may make some viewers wonder how they were achieved. They make us feel almost as if we're there in space with the characters. It's worth mentioning that Cuaron's work, and especially this film, has been influenced by director Elem Klimov's great 1985 war drama Come And See. If you watch both Gravity and Come And See you'll notice the striking similarities. In addition to Cuaron's expert direction and Emmanuel Lubezki's stunning cinematography we're also treated to an effective soundtrack by Steven Price, which works wonders in some scenes. Some reviewers ranked Gravity on the same level as science-fiction greats like Blade Runner (1982), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solaris (1972). I'm not going to jump to such conclusions at this time, but Gravity is easily one of the best films of recent years. I certainly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
I used to think being an astronaut was great... but for sure you see a hell of a landscape,"As everybody knows there are only two actors in the movie and they wear spacesuits and helmets most of the time. Therefore, acting and human interaction are not the key. Personally, I think too much time was given to Sandra Bullock and her dramatic situation. Clooney would have provided some buoyancy and made the movie more interesting character-wise.If I have to point out one major defect, I found it silly to have Bullock look so good, with no sign of injuries or dirtiness and with her hair perfectly combed. Yes, she was mercifully make-up free, but otherwise she looked like she had just stepped out of her bed after a refreshing night's sleep.For me, the film is an ode to the beauty and dangers of space, the only ""virgin"" territory left to explore. I used to think that being an astronaut was great, but I had to reconsider. Besides, the film is an example of 3D put to good use. The three-dimensional effects worked wonders in most sequences.We see earth and all the meteorological events we observe from down here, we see sunrise from an astonishing angle, small objects float towards us and we even get the ""personal"" point of view of gazing through the helmet of one astronaut. The soundtrack was also great, underlying dramatic moments without being too bombastic.There was also a major technical blunder which you can found out by yourself, but on the whole I must confess I am a sucker for movies set in space where the space is the main character and I got totally lost in this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Nothing more than action, playing with your senses, all form, no content","I agree with reviewer tcara111. An empty film this one, truly empty.Strange though, how ones body can react so intensely on something that is about nothing at all. Seen in 3D, it makes you dance around in your chair, dodging space dust, grabbing your seat, engaging with the bodies of the characters, who risk floating into deep space forever if they can't hold on to the space station.But this is the sole thing the film does. It plays with your senses, and nothing more.This is just fetish: fetish with new effects, used as toys, to play with your eyes, ears, and sense of suspension.And at the end you have nothing. Nothing, nothing.Nothing wrong with entertainment. Loved Pirates of the Caribbean, of the same director. A very funny film, colorful characters.But this is not only not funny, it is anti-funny. The jokes are so lame, made of the same wood as the jokes Indiana Jones makes: making ironic remarks while in an impossible situation. Hollywood seems to have a monopoly on this stupid form of irony, which made exactly zero people laugh in the theater.So 1 star, because 1: this film is about nothing at all and 2: it is about nothing, nothing at all.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
I Can't Even Explain...Just WOW,"Well I just watched most intense movie EVER....it was amazing, mind boggling, and extremely stressful in a good way. When I went to see ""Gravity,"" I was expecting to come back and be able to write a wordy review telling how it was just two people floating around in space talking about life while they die, this was not the case. What I saw is beyond words, beyond anything I have ever seen. This is the kind of movie that brings film back to the height of innovation, it felt like seeing a movie for the first time. The movie was 91 minutes, but it felt like 20. It was spectacular, jaw dropping, suspenseful, and the most starkly beautiful film I have seen in a long time. It's hard to put what I saw into words, so what I can recommend is just see it, because it is going to go down in the history books. Also see it in 3D, 1000% worth it!I'm just going to go sit and think about it now and maybe have a warm cup of soothing tea...and fall and kiss the earth, because I can.

Try getting out of the theater. 'Gravity' won't let you.,"For years film makers have been trying to convert cinema theaters into warp zones for traveling to new vistas. The result, is 'Gravity'.Don't say the question ""what would one do if stranded in space"", never came to your mind. We have seen the images in Kubrick's ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" and Danny Boyle's ""Sunshine"", and those left us pretty scared. Whoa, we got ourselves a new genre - SPACE HORROR!! But Alfonso Cuaron's 'Gravity' isn't just a movie, it's an experience. Sitting in our seats we feel the anxiety, emptiness of space (adoring the beauty at the same time) and gasping for air. Its a story of survival, embracing our fears and making decisions when the most necessary of all resources are absent. Do we let the situation take control of us and lose hope or take a grasp on our life? This experience is not as empty as the vast vacuum of space.Its surprising how convincingly real the images are. The cinematography and the lighting leave us awestruck. And the most amazing part is the physics of the bodies in space. The 3D immerses us further into the scene and wow - we are floating. Alfonso Cuaron, after giving us visual masterpieces like 'Children of Men' and 'Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban (my favorite of the eight movies)' lands a benchmark in every way. Difficult 15 minute shots with no cuts, visual transitions from third person to first in the same scene are rare achievements.Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has just enlisted himself among best cinematographers ever in history. Is there any stopping him? He stunned us with his work in 'The Tree of Life' and 'Children of Men'. He has even surpassed himself.Flawless in every way, 'Gravity' is the cinema experience that happens only once a decade and opens our minds to new stories and fresh approach.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sandra made this movie great,"I am not a fan of Sci-Fi, but this one movie is surprisingly awesome for me. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney gave this movie a nice touch as I just cannot imagine other actors in their places. Seeing Bullock in such a movie was new to me as she is always in comedies. However, she played her role very good, and I guess that is how true professionals show their talent by playing a role outside of their comfort zones. About Clooney, I can say that despite his role being so short he was also an important part of the movie as he and Bullock were so lovely with each other, and that made the movie more likable.

"GRAVITY (Alfonso Cuaron, 2013) **1/2","I really cannot understand the gushing reviews this has been getting and the accolades being constantly bestowed upon it: there is really nothing outstanding, or even new, about it – period! Much has been said about its excellent visual effects – but the same is true of countless other sci-fi efforts, so, no big deal there! Similarly, it was acclaimed as a tension-filled two-parter set against a forbidding backdrop: well, this type of film has been done – and much more engagingly, if you ask me – for years...take John Boorman's HELL IN THE PACIFIC (1968), for one! As space operas go, then, its unabashed references to the likes of PLANET OF THE APES, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (both 1968) and ALIEN (1979) only serve to expose its essential dramatic (and artistic) shallowness – enough said! And, frankly, the decision to cast stars (annoying Sandra Bullock and narcissistic George Clooney – yeah right, I totally buy them as astronautswhich goes to show that very little has changed from the practices redolent during the old studio system, where they used to cast Caucasian actors as all sorts of ethnic types) in what clearly amounts to character roles is ample proof that the producers themselves did not have enough faith that the premise would sell itself!Thankfully, the intrinsic streamlining also extends to the film's running-time, so we do not get any tear-jerking flashbacks to Bullock's tragic past on Earth; even so, her assumption that she does not know how to pray is as clichéd as they come! Anyway, the narrative is taken up by scientific jargon (which we have all been suffering from these last 50 years or so), panic attacks (contact with Base is invariably lost early on: incidentally, Ed Harris has been typecast as the voice of Houston ever since APOLLO 13 {1995}!), floating all too easily between various space stations (most of them conveniently unworkable – being peopled by corpses, boasting non-English friendly equipment, oddly self-combustible or simply meteorite targets)! As for its visually arresting 'silent' sequences of the extensive shuttle damage, again, this is no novelty (Michelangelo Antonioni did something similar a good 45 years ago with ZABRISKIE POINT!) and, in any case, it eventually wears thin with the repetition! And is it not a downright cheat to have Bullock fantasize about Clooney 'bailing her out' when all hope seemed lost (by the way, his lengthy conversations with the heroine in an attempt to reassure and guide her, while he is himself headed for certain death, come off as comical more than anything else)?!One might argue that I have said very little in the movie's favour to justify even its ""average"" rating: this alone speaks volumes about the way modern cinema generally leaves me cold – with very few titles made in the recent past that I deem worthy of more than a cursory glance...!",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

I found myself totally engrossed and felt as though I experienced everything Sandra Bullock's character experienced as I was taken on a journey I would hate to be taken on for real.Go see this film in an Imax 3D theatre, nothing else will do it justice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Movie Review: Gravity is an excellent 3D thrill ride,"DIRECTION The first thing to know about Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, is that it's not just a visual spectacle, but it's an interesting character piece as well. However, it's the visual style here that places this movie among some of the best we've ever seen. It's the best 3D movie since Avatar and you can tell he's been working on this for years. Many shots specifically rely on the 3D effect to give you the trill ride Cuarón is looking for and it's incredibly effective. The aesthetic is the best I've ever seen for a space movie and is one of the more realistic one's you'll encounter to date. You really feel like you're in space floating around and experiencing something you never have before. The camera almost operates as it's floating around too. It circles often, turns in various ways and it very specific to show you depth and the different ranges of space. The visuals of earth and the sun are absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking. This is easily the best visual effects in quite some time and easily the best of 2013. Buckle up and enjoy the ride.Grade: A+SCRIPT The story is pretty simple on the surface. Ryan Stone, Sandra Bullock, is a medical engineer and is teamed up with astronaut Matt Kowalski, George Clooney, who are working on a new project up in space in lower Earth orbit when disaster strikes. It's a simple survivor story right? Wrong. They both become adrift in space and now have to team up to survive and figure out how to get back home. Throughout the struggle, we find out that Stone has some bad heartache and is still learning to grieve and let go of her pain. Yet, Kowalski, is a fun-loving guy looking to break some space records but ultimately knows what to do in order to survive. Once you start digging beneath the surface, Gravity speaks to amazing concepts of struggle and the fight to survive. This is especially difficult when you don't have anything to live for, but when you find that reason, it's not about just getting by but living each moment like it's your last. Sure, some parts of the script rely on coincidences and luck, but those moments are forgivable and small in the big picture of things.Grade: A-PERFORMANCES Sandra Bullock can be hit or miss, depending on who you ask, but in Gravity, she's a homerun. Regardless of what you think about Bullock, she does drama well and as a character who is traumatized in life and now the situation she faces, Bullock shines. Her character has depth and she brings a lot of emotion to her which is incredibly effective. You fall for her character and the struggle that she's in, both as a person and the situation. To me, this is Sandra Bullock's best role she's ever done. George Clooney has less screen time than expected but is also very good. He's the jokster, fun-loving astronaut that has a lot of stories to tell. He's also smart and comes across very engaging. Clooney doesn't have as much to do but is really good for what his character calls for. And you have to love the Ed Harris cameo. He was amazing in Apollo 13 as the NASA commander and is back in Houston as the voice that communicates back to our struggling astronauts.Grade: A+SCORE This is by far Steven Price's best score. He was great in The World's End, but his score not only is effective here but it's a critical piece to the film. This movie calls for emotion and is a huge spectacle and Price's score reflects that beautifully. He uses a lot of strings mixed with digital music and even some voice work. It's a good listen outside of the film and is perfect for what this film needed.Grade: A+FINAL THOUGHTS Gravity is a movie you want to see in 3D. In fact, go to the biggest IMAX 3D screen you can find. The visuals are absolutely stunning and gives you the best 3D thrill ride you've seen in a long time. The performances shine and you feel like you're a part of the action in space. If you want to know what it's like in space without ever going there, watch this movie. It's absolutely incredible.Overall Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A gripping tale of survival,"Everyone has been talking about how amazing ""Gravity"" is, and fortunately no one had spoilt the film for me. I was already stunned by the visuals of space right from the beginning. The magnificent views from an unearthly viewpoint, looking back at Earth with the bluish hue of the atmosphere around its edge is truly memorable. On the other hand, the trade off is that there is much dangers in space, let alone the challenges of the unfamiliarity and the weightlessness environment.In ""Gravity"" we see the two astronauts in grave danger, and they have to fight against literally all odds just to survive. The magnificent desolation, as an astronaut had described, becomes deadly hopelessness. I cannot remember another film that made my palms sweat the way I did, and it's been a quite a while since I literally held my breath, waiting for critical events to unfold. ""Gravity"" successfully delivers suspense in every scene, chronicling their impossible struggle to survive.""Gravity"" is not just a film, but a gripping tale of survival in space that will engage even those who aren't astronomically inclined.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"great effects, middling drama","An astronaut with a tragic past finds herself alone in space after a catastrophic event engulfs her shuttle. It is only through facing certain death that she re-discovers the will to live.This is perhaps the most immersive, compelling use of the 3D format to date, though given that the format has failed to live up to its potential, that is not exactly high praise. The arena of space is thoroughly explored in 3D, and the swinging camera, extreme close ups and mammoth wide shots suitably convey the claustrophobia and agoraphobia that space must engender in astronauts. Sound design is also persuasively authentic, though the screeching soundtrack that cuts before silence in the open sequence could have been toned down a decibel or two. The special effects are top notch and clearly the film's biggest selling point. They unashamedly draw attention to themselves, which unfortunately means they work at the expense of the narrative.The plight and journey of Bullock's character would have been much more cathartic if more thought had been given to dialogue and tempo. Instead, she swings from one mini-disaster to another, Bullock apparently channeling Annie Porter doing her best to drive that bus in 'Speed.' Bullock's performance is engaging rather than outstanding. Clooney, on the other hand, is simply miscast. Like the effects he is too obviously cinematic, too much his cheeky, charming self, too much a reminder of the artifice and Hollywood-ness of it all. I suspect a more grounded character actor like Stanley Tucci might have excised this role of the frivolousness Clooney's presence inspires.Wonderful effects, a considered deployment of 3D, and a story that is enjoyable if not exactly sublime, make this a good outing for those who enjoy event cinema. Like Avatar, this film's weaknesses will come into sharp focus on DVD. And with a running time close to 90 minutes, the filmmakers should win awards for economy and self-discipline.

The shots of earth and the sun in the distance were stunning to watch. But what made this film even more fantastic was Sandra Bullock. She gave a truly amazing performance. She proved she is a great actress in not just a comedic role, but in a dramatic one as well. I've never felt more connected to a character on screen than i did with ms. Bullocks Ryan Stone. Very emotional at times. She tapped into every human emotion. Truly amazing. She deserves an Oscar nomination for this. I also want to praise the director Alfonso Cuaron for his great visual style, the camera work that he did made you feel like you were in Sandra bullocks spot .

Visual Stunning,"As many Oscar best picture nominated films, and winners, Gravity excels due to its technical aspect of the film. Where in other places it does not, it exceeds because of how visually stunning and memorizing the scenery is. High quality global journalism requires investment.Starring Sandra Bullock, we see her as she gives us a calamity dame for a crisis, bravery battling adversity, hysteria and a fitfully firing backstory about a dead daughter.Director and co-writer Alfonso Cuarón, a space novice self-launched after a career in terrestrial drama and fantasy, brings an innocent's freshness to the genre. The 3D is most brilliantly unnerving when most seemingly trivial. The weightless hazard-objects that float past our faces in cabins – a torch, fork, spanner – mimic and prefigure the bigger bric-a-brac to come. In the end we are witnessed to a more so predicable take but as it works for the best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
An amazing experience that was somewhat ruined...,"This film is definitely one of the most stunning films ever to reach the silver screen. Both the technicality and simplicity of the shots allows the viewer to fall straight into the film. However, this experience was short lived. I don't know if it was the director's fault or the audience. Perhaps you would witness this when you watch the film in the cinemas.The plot takes us from one crises moment to another, in a very entertaining fashion. You will find yourself in certain instances, holding your breath. But when this dramatic device became more affective, especially towards the end, something happened......The audience laughed... collectively.This did ruin the story's climax, but I also understand what had pushed the audience to this unexpected reaction. I know I'm speaking with a sense of ambiguity, however you will know what I mean when you witness the film's resolution. I found myself asking then, did they laugh because the journey was becoming too superficial and contrived? Or was the audience unable to bear the series of bad luck, that tipped them in a domino effect of relief to... laugh it off? In my honest opinion, I think the director should have been more careful with the final hurdle. It ruined the cinematic experience as the film can't be viewed in any other way.Rounding up, watch the movie. Is it worth your money? Absolutely.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Gravity is out of this world. Roger that - over and out,"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, as they star in Alfonso Cuaron's (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) sci-fi spectacular, Gravity. Houston, we have a problem.Tonight's weather forecast – ""clear skies with a chance of satellite debris."" Medical Engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) and NASA Special Commander Matt Kowalski (Clooney) are on a repair mission in outer space, when a Russian satellite shatters and its shrapnel races towards them. Mission Control (voiced by Ed Harris) initiates an emergency abort, just before all telecommunications to Earth crash.When you're suspended in the cosmos and the narrative is thus restricted to a single location, all there is to relish, besides the remarkable views and special effects, is character development. However, this is as far from a bad feat as our troops are from home. Where it is easy for a sci-fi to get carried away with itself, Cuaron's profound characterisations of our spacewalkers, who share extraordinary on-screen chemistry, grounds the spectacle in reality; so much so that science fiction appears to be science-fact.Gravity is predominantly based in one location with one objective, yet the Mexican-born director does extremely well to grip our attention and the mesmerising visual cinematography makes it a pleasure to concentrate.Clooney renders Kowalski with unbelievable strength of character, able to take the responsibility of the interstellar jester, despite the severity of the situation; ""I know you never realised how devastatingly good-looking I am, but you need to stop staring"", he says to Dr. Stone, as they cling together in the abyss.Advised by fellow-director James Cameron, Cuaron delayed production for four and a half years so that the technology could catch up and meet expectations. The wait was certainly not in vain as Tim Webber's visual effects are simply groundbreaking. ""There is no weight in space. There is no sound in space and the only light is what bounces off the Earth"", explains Cuaron during a Gravity masterclass. The dramatic thriller gives testament to these interplanetary conventions to an expert degree.In true Cuaron-fashion, for the first 15 minutes there are no cuts. The long take soaks in the sights at the same time as it lures the spectator into a false sense of tranquillity. Kowalski's wit and charm, as he playfully floats about, sends us further into relaxation; Clooney refuses to shrug off his debonair persona and proficient flirtation even in the face of death 600 kilometres above the Earth's surface.All of a sudden, we get a sharp succession of cuts as danger ensues. The camera becomes very dizzy as it stylishly coils around our troubled astronauts; instead of the actors moving, the camera does all the donkeywork. The debris tears through their shuttle and telescope, leaving the duo adrift.""Although there is no sound in space, there is music in film"", declares Cuaron. The music in Gravity, composed by Steven Price, is harmonious and at times, even terrifying (unless of course we're talking about the Hank Williams Jr. country western jive that plays out of Kowalski's radio, epitomising his breezy persona).Driven by pure heart and the will to survive, this story about letting go toys with symbolism of birth and rebirth, paying unspoken homage to Children of Men in where humankind loses the gift of fertility. As the loss of her daughter plagues her mind, Dr. Stone on several occasions showcases foetal characteristics. When her oxygen supply plummets, Kowalski attaches a tether cable, symbolic of the umbilical cord, to the distressed space-newbie in order to get her to safety. Stone is later seen poised in a zero gravity pod and her behaviour is strikingly symbolic of a foetus, as it curls inside the womb.Gravity is out of this world.

Gravity proves why someone has to go to the theater and experience a film and not just watch it...,"Alfonso Cuarón has done it again... We have seen thrills in water, we have experienced chills in snow and air.. Now you will be at the edge of your seat when you see Sandra Bullock drifting in space.. Gravity is a movie about Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock)... One is an astronaut and the other an engineer working for NASA.. The excitement starts right from the word go where we see Matt spacewalking...Soon the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston confirms that Space debris from a Russian satellite has caused a chain reaction of destruction and they were instructed to abort the mission...The debris struck them before they could take any action killing all the crew members except Matt and Ryan.. Ryan was drifting in the space when Matt rescued her and tethered her to him so that they can move together...While they were moving the oxygen level of Ryan was decreasing..They planned to go the ISS (International Space Station).. In the way we get to know that Ryan's daughter died in an accident and Matt motivating her that they would survive..As they approached ISS they see that the crew has already left it with the Soyuz..Matt suggests that they could use the remaining Soyuz to go to the Chinese space station and use their Soyuz to go back to Earth.. While they were approaching the ISS the debris storm strikes again where Matt had to sacrifice himself to save Ryan... Ryan goes to the Chinese station after a lot of hick ups and manages to survive and return back to Earth.. As the movie progresses the excitement increases.. Brilliantly shot movie with a power packed performance by Sandra Bullock..Great camera work to show incredible pictures of earth at night and the sunrise.. Alfonso Cuarón's direction has proved gold in the past..He has shown the ultimate road trip(Y tu mama tambien), the fantasy world of Harry Potter (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) and a brilliant science fiction (Children of Men)..

It was like watching the ending of a movie,"Title states it all its like watching the ending part of a movie Or a video short. I gave it a one. Both actors were just going thru the motions. The best space movie ever Haha no way in hell. Apollo 13 still not all that realistic character wise but technically very realistic and it was a more complete and coherent movie.Russians detonated their defense satellites or something like that as it was said so fast and so short. It's so very unrealistic and improbable in fact the whole movie was so unrealistic. Trajectory's and pin point re-entry procedures are ludicrous.Pressing buttons by guessing. Escape pods out of star wars. Ridicules. I many not be a astronaut but I am a real life Dr as my hubby is, but I have 2 brothers who are pilots one in the Navy and one in USAF on flies the FA/18 the other the F-15E and they laughed at this dumb so-called movie. This film is an insult to my and everyone's intelligence.Not even worth a rental. And be respectful of my opinion as I respect everyone's opinion like it or not.

special effects / disaster movie,"I expected the movie to be about the psychological tensions of being a female captain in a traditionally male-dominated world. Nope that was not it at all. Sandra Bullock is the only character alive for most of the movie. She has to carry the entire movie. It is a special effects/disaster flick. She moves from one space station to another, escaping by the skin of her teeth, as they are blown to bits by space debris.The special effects are quite believable. I don't know how they were done. People and objects float rotating serenely. There are no crude wires to get in the way of the action.The space stations are incredibly cramped. I can imagine the locker room smell. They look completely plausible. I had waves of claustrophobia just looking an them on the TV screen.The movie ended too soon. I was far from convinced she was home free. I wanted to see something of what happened to her character, Ryan Stone, after she made it back to earth.Some things did not make sense. What was this somewhat clueless woman doing on a space station? Why could she walk immediately after months in space? Why is there so much noise in space especially when dialogue makes the point there isn't? Why is there no way to make radio contact with earth from any of the space stations?For me it was too repetitive. Too much action and not enough psychology. It is a boy flick masquerading as a chick flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity: Will you hold on or let go?,"Since its release last weekend I've seen Gravity described as the masterpiece of Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón. It is. It's a visually astonishing film that cohesively uses all its elements - cinematography, sound, acting, plot, visual effects, etc. - to tell a beautiful, and gripping story. While at face value it's a thrilling portrayal of a perilous struggle for survival, Gravity offers a deeper exploration into how each of us deals with adversity in life.When I first saw the teaser trailer for Gravity I was instantly enthralled and excited. A couple of things stood out to me. First, I was in the theater when I saw it so I got the full audiovisual experience and the film looked beautiful and thrilling. I was instantly gripped, even though I really had no idea what it was about - no more than astronauts in trouble in space. The second thing I noticed were the names attached to it. Alfonso Cuarón is an increasingly recognized director with only a few titles under his belt, but they are diverse and told with style and meaning (He directed the best Harry Potter film, Prisoner of Azkaban, among other things). Seeing something so different with his name on it is good reason to get excited. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are both great actors as well. Expectations were forming and I had a hunch this was going to be great. My ears were perked and I was paying close attention. I was dying to see it. That's what a good trailer does.It met my expectations. Gravity's storytelling is efficient. Everything is tied to the ultimate purpose of the story and the characters. I just have to say thank you to Cuarón for doing that so well. Most great movies do it, but few big budget flicks are among them. It opens with three astronauts during a spacewalk. The shuttle Explorer is attached to the Hubble satellite and Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is installing some hardware to assist in her research. It's her first time in space and Mission Control is getting readings indicating she's feeling a bit queasy. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), on the other hand, is a seasoned veteran astronaut and zooms around with confidence. A third member of the team is enjoying himself as well. He's a nice guy with a family and you know instantly he is not making it out of this alive. The voice of Mission Control (Ed Harris... yes, the guy that was the head of Mission Control in Apollo 13... if you were paying attention) lets them know a Russian satellite was destroyed and has created some debris but no need to worry. Oh wait... yes there is need to worry. They get hit by a field of high velocity space shrapnel. Ryan is flung into space completely detached from the shuttle and her team. She starts to panic. Matt tries to settle her down on the radio but she can barely breathe.This is all in the trailer. From there it's a series of obstacles that must be overcome one by one, each promising a great likelihood of failure and death. This is where we really get to know these characters and learn from their different approaches to dealing with extreme adversity. Because that's what Gravity is all about. It's a beautiful and extensive series of metaphors on life and how to deal with hardship. But that part of it's not pushed in your face and it's great as it is without the reflection. Dr. Stone has some difficult things from her past and has kind of shut out the rest of the world since then. This makes the silence of space appealing to her. Matt is more fun-loving but with a sure will to survive and an unbreakable calm. There's going to be some real anxiety as you watch and consider how you would react in the same situation. You tell yourself these people have been trained for this, but only a true acceptance of the reality of death and life can really allow you to make jokes and listen to twangy country music as you drift in space with your oxygen ticking below 5%.The physical situation in which these astronauts find themselves starts to morph into a good metaphor for Dr. Stone's own situation down on earth as we learn more about her. Isolated. Silent. Hopeless. Peaceful. As you watch you may begin to wonder if it mirrors your own life. Not in a desperate depressing sort of way (perhaps) but in that this mortal life we all wander through, the chance for disaster is upon us at any moment and once it strikes - whatever flavor adversity comes in - it's hard to imagine that most people wouldn't panic too. Maybe it would be easiest to just drift off. To let go. It's a lot of work to stay afloat. Ryan must make a decision that most of us are never confronted with: to hold on to or let go of gravity. By the end of the film we learn that rather than the shared bond between two masses, gravity is also the shared bond between each of us and the rest of the human race (perhaps even a higher power?). The choice we are faced with is to hold on and accept gravity - despite all the weight that comes with that choice - or to let go and drift away.See my expanded review here: http://ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2013/10/film-gravity.html",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

An incredible space journey without wearing the special suits and oxygen cylinders.,"More than a decade before when I first saw Ron Howard's APOLLO 13 (1995) and then Stanley Kubrick's epic masterpiece 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), it simply made me awestruck witnessing the unbelievable kind of execution by its immensely talented makers. Besides I truly regretted the fact that I couldn't see such great films on the big wide screen with an outstanding sound system playing its enjoyable musical silence, providing that out of the world experience to the viewers. Moreover the films also gave me the thoughts, that what if the astronauts have to repair their space shuttles by themselves by moving out manually in the unknown black vacuum and what if they need to ask help from any other country's space shuttle standing at a distance, in a state of crisis and then have to reach it somehow covering the blind gap.Thankfully GRAVITY is here with all the possible answers to my thoughts and the regret of not seeing any such space adventure in the theaters is now taken care of in an outstanding manner. In simple words, if you ever wished to feel the space and its deep silence like the trained professional astronauts, then here is your chance to live those otherwise unachievable moments in the theater, at the cost of only 300 bucks and that too without wearing the heavy space suits and oxygen helmets. The film takes you into that black soundless region like never before and then makes you feel the excitement, tension, loneliness, pain and discomfort of being in the space all alone with just the mechanical gadgets and machines. Capable of transforming you into a different world (space) altogether, GRAVITY is unarguably one of the best space adventure movies made till date, which actually makes you wonder that was that beautiful, absorbing ambiance all digitally created or they really shot those sequences by going into the genuine scary space in a shuttle? Further opening with a ground breaking long shot introducing the theme right away, GRAVITY not only keeps you absorbed with its breathtaking execution but also keeps you guessing through an engaging, original script written around a rare space disaster.Though for many viewers it might have less dosages of entertainment as expected but as a matter of fact, GRAVITY rises much above than any recent spectacular gem such as AVATAR or LIFE OF PI, because it is not really talking about anything fictional or deliberately created by the makers in order to provide a mesmerizing, magical treat to their viewers. It actually talks about the real existing space and the sudden, unexpected catastrophe which possibly can happen with the people up there in the space shuttles, anytime, any moment. Secondly the film gives you an entirely different and much superior experience as a 3D film (comparatively) since the technology is used quite wonderfully here, matching its subtle yet electrifying subject matter, moving ahead than any other 3D film to be precise. Talking about this personally, I have never seen a 3D movie by not taking off the glasses several times in those two hours to get some relief. But here in GRAVITY, I never thought of taking them off even once, other than the intermission and was constantly watching it with the glasses on for the first time ever.Thoughtfully & skillfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron, GRAVITY is a film which gets perfect contribution from every single creative person involved in its making, superbly led by the Sound, Cinematography and CGI departments in particular. Though its silent moments speak for themselves in those tense sequences, but the timely inclusion of many enjoyable dialogues and the well composed musical notes enhance the overall impact of the venture to many folds. Brilliantly performed by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the actors successfully make a solid impact on the viewers, even when you don't see their faces properly in a substantial part of the film till the end. Particularly this is Sandra's another absolutely stunning performance of her career and she reportedly spent six months of physical training, preparing for this role to play it in an authentic manner.Interestingly apart from GRAVITY's technical, artistic and creative attainment, the film has a proud Indian link too wherein you get to hear one of the astronaut singing ""Mera Joota Hai Japani"" and then we have a duly acknowledged contribution in its soundtrack made by Delhi's own famous music producer, Gaurav Dayal.Last but not the least, I would like to write about GRAVITY's less discussed, rare spiritual or meditative feature, which truly gives you an enlightening taste of that supreme invisible power, hidden within this huge, complex but smoothly working universe and its unexplained phenomenon. The film takes you into those never ending, silent, infinite black spaces of the universe, which simply make you realize that how tiny, ineffective and momentary is our very existence on this planet Earth. The Earth, which itself is a very miniscule part of such an enormous universe and its numerous elements.In fact, this humble thought is very well defined in the last scene of the film itself, when Sandra somehow manages to reach back planet Earth safely, landing into the sea after a miraculous escape. And the moment she again touches the solid surface of mother Earth..there are only two words on her lips with eyes looking into the sky.. and those two words are.THANK YOU.GRAVITY ends on this very note giving us a fabulous thought to take back home, indicating that the human race is only capable of saying just these two words in gratitude towards the beautiful existence. And there is simply no other way we can repay back for such precious gifts showered upon ourselves by that Supreme Power since ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A movie (almost) completely (literally) made in space,"Amazing... :) One of the best movies (I should not forget Apollo 13!) about space and spaceships. Mainly two characters but yet a super story. Another excellent point of the movie is the musics and sounds. Of course 3D was nice but I suppose it could be better in some scenes. I am not sure how realistic Sandra Bullock's costume is, but it didn't bother me at all. I missed Clooney for the rest of the movie. Only problem I am having through the movie is loosing George Clooney. Science cannot be true at that point. He should not have any weight in the free space. And fire? Well, I am not writing a spoiler! However, a very good investment! Obviously, I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Wow!  Just, wow!","Wow! Just, wow!Let's deal with the negative aspects of Gravity first, which are few and almost negligible: I was forced into seeing Gravity in 3D. It wouldn't have been my choice but that was the format of the screening. There are one or two cheep shots (bolts flying into the face) that are nothing more than gimmickry but, to counteract my criticism, I haven't seen 3D work this well since Hugo or witnessed the impressive depth of field afforded by 3D since Avatar. Secondly, George Clooney coasts along in a Doug Ross performance that blends sincerity with a jokey bedside manner. However, it works. Gravity isn't a movie of Oscar-winning performances (though watch out for the nominations and the clean up at the technical Oscars) but of spectacle.Astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is commanding his final space shuttle mission, onboard Explorer, accompanied by debutant Doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). During a standard spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, they are struck by debris travelling at great speed, destroying the shuttle and leaving them spinning in space.After watching the trailer, I had two thoughts: 1. The trailer gave away the entire film and 2. How the heck could co-writer/director Alfonso Cuarón fill 91 minutes with two people floating in the great beyond? It took approximately two minutes to forget my fears and marvel at his achievements.Stunning, amazing, fantastic, superb, beautiful. Pick your superlative. All are apt. Gravity is a ridiculously tense film that had me close to tears at one point and frequently pushing my feet hard against the floor in a vain attempt to help the astronauts survive. Grab it, stop, for the love of god grab somethingThe digital work is astounding. It's like climbing into an ever evolving painting and making it one's own world. The sensation of weightlessness is achieved flawlessly through wirework and digital magic. Space has never looked so beautiful nor been so devastatingly destructive. Every wide shot could be frozen, framed and mounted above the fireplace.It's not often I am compelled to mention the camera work but the shots here are at times staggeringly good. There is one particular fluid shot where the camera sweeps slowly before Ryan's terrified face, turning slowly to slide through her helmet and present her point of view before seamlessly retreating along the same arc. For this cineaste, that was a moment!The screenplay is sparse on dialogue, in comparison to most big screen offerings, but not a single word is wasted. Co-written with his son, Jonás, Cuarón's screenplay is at times gently amusing and often taut with clipped utterances. Like oxygen supplies in space, words are not to be squandered. The visual feast before us tells us more than the dialogue and Steven Price's magnificent, atmospheric score completes the experience as strikingly as the elongated silences. With all the ingredients blended, Gravity is ridiculously tense! It almost hurts to watch it but it demands repeated viewings and my second will be tonight.Though there are peripheral characters, notably Ed Harris as the voice of Mission Control (just one of many references to space and sci-fi flicks gone by), Gravity is a film of two actors who are frequently isolated on the screen.Clooney is a natural, formidable presence. If one were lost in space and facing possible death 940,000 miles from home, his Matt Kowalski would be high on the wish list of companions in doom. Largely a vocal performance (it's difficult to see much of him behind the helmet), his performance is a tangible aspect in a situation we could never fully appreciate. He leaves us in no doubt as to the urgency of their predicament while refusing to carry a scythe and read the last rites. Matt is the astronaut equivalent of a surgeon finding the humorous benefit of weight loss via amputation.Sandra Bullock has never been better. Not even when earning her Oscar for The Blind Side. No, she may not strike double gold with Ryan, but what on earth is she doing trudging through bilge like The Heat when she is capable of this? It is very difficult to carry a film as (frequently) the lone performer with no-one to bounce off but Bullock's performance is beautifully controlled and profoundly affecting. Perhaps the backstory is a little contrived but that is not her fault and, more to the point, it makes Ryan human and allows the events to unfold as they do. Watching Bullock in Gravity, one wonders if we have seen the birth of a career butterfly finally emerging after 25 years from a comfortable chrysalis.Maybe I'm going soft, maybe I'm hormonal, or perhaps I've just been lucky this past three weeks and seen three fantastic films (after The Kings of Summer and Captain Phillips), but Gravity is stunning. I emerged from the screening drained and I have to see it again.On a slight tangent, earlier this week a certain BBC presenter referred to Gravity as 'this year's Life of Pi.' My heart sank as I thought he implied that none of it had actually happened and that perhaps Ryan would awake to find herself at peace in another place with it all having been in her mind. For those who heard the same report, fear not. The comparison comes from Matt and Ryan being shipwrecked, albeit in space, and the phenomenal special effects. There is a crash, they are floating in space and Gravity is nothing short of an exquisite film.With all the eloquence I can muster, wow!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Amazing from beginning to end!,"GRAVITYWhen I found out that I managed to get tickets to a preview screening of Gravity, I was so happy. I have been waiting for this film for ages. Ever since I saw the trailer I instantly wanted to see it. I thought the trailer looked amazing. So, there I was sitting in the cinema waiting for the film to start, 3D glasses on and thinking to myself ""I really hope this does not disappoint"". I had the same feeling about Open Water. The trailer for that looked good it had the potential to be a good film, but when I watched it I was so disappointed. I thought it was very boring and felt let down. I didn't want that feeling again, so I tend not to get too excited about a film, but with this I could not help it. Thankfully this film was amazing! Far better than I thought it was going to be.The film is about a group of astronauts that are in space fixing a satellite. All of a sudden there are reports of a missile destroying another satellite and the debris is heading towards the astronauts. Their ship get's hit badly and they have to fight to survive being stranded free floating in space.The story is so gripping. It has been a very long time since a film has had me glued and worried about the characters as much as this. I spent the whole film so tense. I could not relax at all. I even found myself holding my breath a couple of times too. You really find yourself getting into it. You don't really know the characters before everything kicks off, but that doesn't matter. There is no time to introduce the characters as it is pretty much action from the start. You grow to like these characters a lot and all the way through I had no idea if they would survive or not. I like this because it was an original story. Yes, there have been other space disaster movies, but this felt completely different than anything I had seen before.The casting was perfect. Sandra Bullock takes the lead role. She was really good and convincing. I always said she was better in serious roles and this is, in my opinion, the best film she has ever made. There are talks of her getting nominated for an Oscar for this I think she deserves it. It was also really good that Sandra made this film with no make-up on at all. It made it feel more realistic. It is a brave move really for a big Hollywood actress to be seen on screen without anything to make her look made up. George Clooney was the other main character. He did a fantastic job also. You really like his character. He has a laid back more relaxed attitude in space just cruising around with his jet pack on. But he seems to be the character that takes charge. I think he should get some good recognition for this too.The film was shot really well. Space looked amazing. The film was visually beautiful. There were so many shots where I was wishing I was up there. As a photographer I would love to be taking photos of those views. The other thing I really liked about this movie was the soundtrack. The music was very well put together and made the 0065perience even more tense. I also loved the fact that when there was an explosion in space or a crash you heard nothing but the music. In space there are no sounds so it is great that this film kept it real.If I was to say anything negative about this film I would have to say that the 3D could have been better. It was really good in places, but in other places, it was not very good. There were a few places where you could see there were bits that were meant to come out, but didn't really. But this did not ruin the movie too much. I am also thinking that if I watched this in 2D it would be a bit weird because a couple of times you could see it was made for 3D. It might look a bit out of place in 2D. But it shouldn't ruin the film too much. This film is one that has to be seen in the cinema, in 3D watch it in IMAX if you can you will not regret it.I loved this movie and will give it 9 out of 10.""No, no, no, Houston, don't be anxious.

"Technically impressive, but not much more","2001 it is not, but GRAVITY is a tense and, at times, thrilling movie about survival that coasts on its stunning visuals while paying little attention to story and character. The plot is simple: two astronauts who are making modifications to the Hubble Space Telescope have to fight for their lives after debris from a Russian satellite starts to make its way towards them. The cast is quite small, and only Sandra Bullock and George Clooney have any screen time. Everyone else is just a voice on the intercom. George Clooney does his usual ladies' man routine, which he does quite well, and Sandra Bullock does a good job of a woman who never should have been allowed in space in the first place. That aside, they do an admirable job with the script they were given. Where the movie really excels is in the visual department. Alfonso Cuaron spent many years developing this concept and technology to make this movie, not unlike James Cameron did with Avatar, and it shows on screen. These are some of the most impressive space effects that I've seen in a long time, although calling them ground-breaking might be giving it a little too much credit. The score is also worth mentioning, and helps to maintain the tension throughout the film. Still, I felt like the story was lacking enough, and the middle 45-50 minutes of the movie lags quite a bit. I have a feeling that I'd be looking at this movie differently had I saw it in theaters, but I didn't, so this is how I feel about it. The first half-hour, and the last 20 minutes were superb, but the middle dragged a little too much. Overall, it is a movie worth seeing, although to get the full effect of the visuals, it would probably be best to see this on the largest screen possible and with a decent sound system.

First time i have watched a movie of Sandra Bullock and she acted really well. Its a kind of movie to watch on a big screen otherwise you really gonna miss the whole experiences. Alfonso Cuarón is really a great director. He really made it so fascinating. He really tried to take care of all those small things which is pretty much important in such kind of movies. He is really a very good director, there's no doubt in it. I really like to write a lot about this movie but i don't wanna make it boring*************THE ONLY THING I WANT TO SAY IS GO AND WATCH IT YOU REALLY GONNA LIKE IT (GUARANTEED)***********ENJOY",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Essentially average,"Imagine Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's mediocre acting placed into a film that has almost no storyline at all and is held together with fairly poor dialogue and you will wonder why Gravity was watched by anyone at all, never mind enjoyed by audiences and critics alike.The answer is simple: cinematography. It is the amazing camera-work that holds this film together. For the most part, the film only has one character in the form of Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) but dull writing and careless acting means that the audience don't even care about her or anything that happens in the film. However, the film is truly orgasmic to look at and you don't have to know anything about cinematography or special effects to know that this film does both of those things right.Despite the cinematographic porn being displayed on the screen it is difficult to see why this film was so loved because aside from this the film was essentially average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Amazing Visual Effects,"Ever since seeing IMAX Space Hubble 3D I have been fascinated with Space exploration. Seeing the trailers reeled me in for this one. Suspense, explosions and space perfect combination. Sandra Bullock gives a very compelling performance and you are on the edge of your seat from beginning to the very end. You have no idea what's going to happen one moment to the next and I love that. It was unpredictable and full of excitement. The images are amazing and you feel as though you right there with Bullock completely and utterly alone (scary). George Clooney has a minimal role but as usual plays it well. The visual effects are enough to make a night to see this film. I would like to go back and see it in 3D.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
'Gravity' is pretty heavy,"'Gravity' is, if nothing else, a technical marvel. It instantly pulls you into its environment and makes you feel as if you're along for the ride. And what a ride. For ninety harrowing, white-knuckled minutes you're tethered to Sandra Bullock's character as she fights for survival in the cold, black vacuum of space.But the movie is more than just F/X wizardry. The performances by Bullock and co-star George Clooney anchor the story and give it a beating, human heart. It does get a little sentimental and existential in the final act, but I forgave this because it felt earned.Like 'Avatar' before it, 'Gravity' is bound to be one of the seminal sci-fi movies of the early 21st century.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Must Be Watched In 3D,"Wow.Director Alfonso Cuaron's has really made the use of 3D into powerful theatrical tool. This picture will really lose something crucial when viewed in 2D at home.Obviously the film is entirely CGI'd, but from the opening scene Cuaron's use of the camera gives a sense of disorientation to the viewer. The camera pans in and out and around the space station, whizzing past the characters at odd angles. It really gives a sense of being in space, where things float by and dart around with uncontrollable trajectories. The film is a total immersion into the vastness and unpredictability of space.It is a great performance by Sandra Bullock, who is largely the only person on camera throughout the film. Clooney, although billed as a joint lead, is not really in the movie after the half-way point. Bullock gives a very convincing account of the terror, panic, resignation and determination of Dr Stone - which is effectively displayed in various points via a concentration on the character's breathing. The real co star in the film is Cuaron's CGI background which is equally breathtaking.The plot is good but it does leave the viewer with a feeling of ""oh what next?!"" when things continue to go wrong, although this just builds up the intensity. The film is only 90 mins long so the action is really packed into a short timescale which adds to the anxiety it leaves on the audience.This film was all about the spectacle for me. The disorientation of the camera work and the eerie silences really conveyed the solitude of space throughout the movie.Cuaron has raised the bar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Not Since Alien has a film in space been this heart pounding,"Gravity is a heart pumping, claustrophobic scif-fi thriller from maverick director Alfonso Curan. The film's leads, George Clooney and Sandra Bullock give Oscar worthy performance as astronauts on a routine mission that quickly goes haywire. The film is enchanting in its visual effects, giving the audience a first hand view of what space is really like. The sounds are soft and drowned in space, the land vast and open, it is a truly terrifying film, as it uses extremely long takes and masterful camera work to give the audience the most realistic space experience in 3D. The scenes usually are focused on Sandra Bullock's character, Ryan Stone, giving the audience a first hand experience of what it would really be like if someone was lost in space. Bullock's performance is nuanced as she demonstrates fear and panic in the most realistic light, everything from her heavy breathing to her moments of complete hopelessness is portrayed in the most expert of ways. It is truly a fantastic performance.There are many words that can articulate the experience of Gravity, but in all actuality, it will not do this film experience justice. It is truly a fantastic film with layered characters and the best 3D work audiences have ever seen. Once it starts, you are hooked from minute one. Do yourselves a favor and pay the admission price because it is more than worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant Space Survival Film,This is a terrific and unique space survival film for all viewers to watch. The storyline of this film was strong and flowed smoothly throughout the entire film. The crew did a spectacular job in creating this film. The cast selection was fine. They really committed and connected to the storyline. The chemistry between the cast members was alright. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were both fine fits for their respective characters. This survival film reveals to viewers that everyone who is in the world of today has a kind of strength that they do not know about. I do not have any kind of strength. This is a great space survival film for everyone to watch.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

The best space movie ever made!,"I am a Sci-Fi fan and have been watching space movies since my childhood, but never seen anything like it before. Tense, spectacular, outstanding, and amazing visual effects. You will feel like you are in space with Sandra Bullock. This Sci-Fi 3D film with Dolby Atmos will give you one of the most amazing 3D movie experience ever. Before I was reluctant to watch 3D movies, but Gravity changed it all. Two people in the wilderness of space how possibly could both or anyone of them survive? It is a very well put together film and outstanding piece of directing. I would highly recommend seeing it in an IMAX 3D. You may also check out the Dolby website and search for Dolby Atmos theaters near by. Don't miss it. Just go for it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Visually stunning 3d masterpiece,"Don't believe the haters , I went to this based on good press & intrigue & was so pleasantly surprised I had to write a review. When a film doesn't have many characters in it you know that it wont be long , it has to look good & it may not work. Moon with Sam Rockwell works , for me 127 hours doesn't , this sure does. From the opening sequence it takes you on a breathtakingly stunning visual journey . I would strongly strongly recommend seeing in 3d & I am not normally a fan of this , I wish I could have seen on i max I am sure that's even better. Nothing looks CGI although it obviously is , you have a clear idea of what may happen to the central characters but that doesn't stop you being dragged repeatedly to the edge of your seat. Clooney is Clooney , but Sandra Bullock holds the screen effectively throughout , but what surpasses both is the visual impact,give yourself a treat for the eyes go see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Really Good,Gravity was a great movie to experience. It seemed nothing really even happened in the movie. It was just floating from one space station to another. But it was cool. I really enjoyed it.

One of the best movies in the era of digital movie-making,"Gravity is one of the most groundbreaking movies in digital movie-making. There I said it. Not only is it the first movie to really make me feel like I was in space, it used CGI in the best way possible to the point of that for the most part, I'm not sure what was real or wasn't. The movie follows Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) on her first space shuttle mission and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) who is on his final trip to space. They are towards the end of the mission until debris from a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite causes mass destruction to be heading their way. This is where the movie truly begins. It has a slow buildup in the first 20 minutes but then explodes into a thrilling movie. Right from the opening shot, I could tell this movie was going to be special, it was a beautiful wide shot of space as we hear bits of mission control talking to the two characters and it was just great.Bullock carries the film with an emotional performance and surprisingly, the characters don't actually get overly in depth but you still really care about who they are. They don't spend a whole lot of time with exposition with the characters but it almost isn't needed because of just small bits of characterization that help sum up the characters really well. The minimalist aspect of characterization works so perfectly for a film like this as danger just keeps provoking them. Although, the other big star here is the visual effects, cinematography, and space in general. The cinematography is absolutely mind blowing from long, slow, and beautiful shots of space to tense, unnerving close-ups on the actors The movie also uses POV shots frequently and they only add to the immersion and tenseness. The slow shots are hypnotic and spinning and give the perspective of space unlike anything else before it.3D is utilized great from adding depth to the background or using it as actors reach out to grab something. The visual effects of space not only set the bar so high but really, truly make everything feel so real. In addition, the movie seems to call back to other pieces of science fiction such as 2001: A Space Odyssey with a certain shot as well as Bullock being a strong female lead like Sigourney Weaver in Alien which is always fantastic to see. Overall, Gravity sets the bar so high, changing the game for digital movie-making, has unbelievable effects and cinematography, and is without a doubt, the best movie of the year thus far, if not one of the best in years (and absolutely needs to be seen in theaters for the full experience).",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Clear skies with a chance of satellite debris,"Gripping space thriller about two astronauts, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) on her first space shuttle mission and Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) on his last, who have to fight to survive after an accident sets them adrift in space. Visually stunning film that is obviously best seen in 3D. Trust me, I'm not big on 3D and see it for the price gouging gimmick it usually is. However, this is one film where the viewing experience is actually enhanced by it.The story is simple. So simple that it's the type of movie that really depends on its leads more than usual to keep it interesting. But they do deliver. Sandra Bullock is excellent, though admittedly the role does play to her strengths. Clooney plays Clooney, likable and stoic. We're told this is his character's last space flight before retiring. If you've seen any cop movie ever, you know there's not a bigger bullseye to have painted on your back than being on the verge of retirement.It's a good movie. A little over-hyped but these days every moderately good film is over-hyped, unfortunately. Try not to let that prevent you from trying it. You'd be missing out on a solid movie if you did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
An experience of a film unlike any other,"We waited long enough to see what Alfonso Cuaron had in store for us next, but no one expected a visual effects game-changer. ""Gravity"" is an experience, something you might expect to see at a science museum in IMAX but with an intense plot. And even though its minuscule cast and real-time feel expose it to plot holes and improbabilities, it is truly something to behold.Sandra Bullock stars as Dr. Ryan Stone, a genius engineer on a mission to update the Hubble Space Telescope with a crew of veteran astronauts, including Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney), on his late mission before retirement. When a Russian missile strike on a satellite goes awry, it causes a field of debris to come flying at their shuttle, but before they can entirely abort the mission, the shuttle is obliterated and Kowalski and Stone are sent hurtling into space with little chance of survival.""Gravity"" shares qualities with both disaster films and sci-fi space opuses. In the context of outer space, Cuaron's long takes are reminiscent of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but ""Gravity"" is less intellectual and more of a survival tale with poetic aspects. It consists of a range of tones, from intense to reflective, from claustrophobic to vast and empty — all within a 90-minute run time. You'll feel this movie in your bones after you get up.No matter how you feel about ""Gravity,"" taking the time to consider how the film was made will turn any opinions into total admiration. Although none of us can truly relate to the physics of space, creating a movie in which gravity does not exist (notice the poetic irony of the title?) has to be considered a hell of a feat. And Cuaron doesn't just make a movie set in space, he insists on making it feel as though it were filmed in space. He tries just about everything with the camera, from shots inside Stone's helmet to seemingly endless tracking shots. Pulling this off with as much authenticity as he appears to have, is worth nothing short of a high commendation.The lack of characters in ""Gravity"" puts a lot of pressure on Bullock and Clooney to be interesting enough to capture our attention. Bullock's constant panic is painful, but in doing so she maintains the film's adrenaline rush, and her humanity wins enough sympathy to make the quest for survival at the heart of the story work. Without a strong performance here, ""Gravity"" would in fact slowly drift into obscurity; she provides a vested interest in the outcome of the disaster.""Gravity"" contains very few traditional storytelling devices. Only the sequence of events has a Hollywood feel to it in that it's rather contrived; there's no way Stone manages to come out unscathed during various debris showers, for example. Moments of disbelief will crop up all over ""Gravity,"" so when you add in the slower, imagery-driven moments along with some dialogue that's squeezed in so that we get to know Stone a bit, it's a surprise that the reaction to ""Gravity"" has been so universally strong.Without question, ""Gravity"" demonstrates what 3D filmmaking is supposed to look like and be used for, and should set the bar for filmmakers aspiring to use it. Considering Cuaron directs the film to be an immersive experience, the 3D magnifies this effect to a considerable degree. Few films have conveyed the ""experience"" of a movie the way ""Gravity"" has, an accomplishment that makes fretting over the script contrivances feel like a petty waste of time that totally misses the point. ""Gravity"" will long be remembered as a defining example of the history and development of filmmaking in the 3D era.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Clear skies with a chance of satellite debris...,"I must admit at first glance when I saw who was on the cast list, I thought that this couldn't possibly be as good as people said. Yeah, I can't claim to be a fan of neither Bullock nor Clooney.However, with all the great reviews and publicity the movie was getting, I decided to give it a go, and I must admit that I am possibly surprised by it.George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are so far away from their usual roles here that it actually works out quite well, and especially Bullock was carrying the movie so amazingly well with her performance here.The story was greatly paced and there was never really a dull moment throughout the movie. And those quiet moments here and there throughout the course of the movie just helped to add to the believability of the movie and it was like the audience was right there in space with them.I will say that a lot of credit for this movie really goes out to the camera crew. Wow, the cinematography and the angles here were just great, it was very dynamic, vibrant and so full of adrenaline. The way that the movie was shot was so helpful to adding to the atmosphere and the believability of the movie.Now, don't expect to see any aliens or foreign lifeforms. No, this is solely a movie about having all odds against you and rising to the occasion and relying on your instincts and putting your training to use. If you want to survive you will survive, as where there is a will, there is a way.""Gravity"" is great entertainment and is a captivating story and you get thrown into the action right away. The movie has a good amount of suspense and thrills, and you really root for Ryan Stone (played by Sandra Bullock) as she struggles through the obstacles.Even with a cast list of that few people, director Alfonso Cuarón did an amazing job with ""Gravity"".And also it should be pointed out that the musical score for ""Gravity"" was off the charts. The music was so nicely performed and really brought so much to each scene.Well worth a watch, be it 3D or not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Because the de rigueur position of IMDb reviewers is to hate Gravity...,"...I'm going to swim against the tide. Not only do I find the film an incredible technical achievement, but the symbolism and allegory built into what is essentially a simple story about survival is so intense, I've watched the film unapologetically five times, and I doubt I'm finished. For those watching just for the surface story, you'll be disappointed in the lack of scary aliens and other adrenaline fixes. (And you'll probably nitpick every minor technical goof.) That's your prerogative. But if you want to feel like you're experiencing a film that is not just about space, but about life at it's most primal, watching Gravity will be as profound for you as it has been for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Gravity's charm is in it's bare simplicity, but it brings along flaws","This is how I would explain Gravity to someone who has not seen the movie, without spoilers, but explaining exactly what they will see:First, take a regular, Michal Bay-ish screenplay about a space disaster. Got it? OK, so now, you take the first 20 pages off (usually the first act), and throw them out. Now, rip off the last 10 pages (the conclusion of act 3), and also throw them out. Now, you get a black marker pen and cross out every single reference or dialog involving:* Any character except George Clooney's or Sandra Bullock's. * Any scenes set in Houston or at other space stations. * Any references to explosions, any references to how things should sound.Now, you get what is left and rewrite it to make it 3 times simpler, but keeping any actions scenes you had.OK? Now, it's time to shoot this baby. So first, you gotta have Cuaron (the director) watch 4 movies over and over again in order to get the feel and the references:1- Pixar's WALL-E. 2- Alfred Hitchcock's Rope 3- Any space walk scene from Brian de Palma's Mission 2 Mars 4- His own Children of Men one shot car sequenceOK, now, make sure you get the best technical crew in Hollywood - because this movie needs to look GREAT.When it's time to mix the audio, all the audio channels with noise, mute them. If the audio guys complain, threat to fire them.Jokes aside...This is exactly how this movie feels. A bare basic second act of a great action film. Yeah, there are technical inconsistencies and plot holes. Yeah, George Clooney is playing himself again... But the charm of this movie is how Cuaron kept the good parts, and only the good parts, and made it work. It's half of an action script with scenes that reminded me of (the awful) Mission 2 Mars, but done in a good way. However, it's simplicity and stripped elements bring the feel that ""something is missing"". Movies have a structure that takes decades to change, and although I am all in favor to change, this is a bit too much in a single direction. As for the long shots, it feels gimmicky sometimes.All in all, a great theater experience, but not something generally amusing to see on a TV or, heaven's forbid, your cell phone.

In a Word:  Beautiful.,"I have two major cinematic regrets from 2013. The first is that I believed that A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD couldn't possibly be as bad as the reviews were claiming. I was wrong to trust that the series might regain it's footing. Thanks, Bruce Willis. Now I have trust issues. My second regret is that I foolishly failed to catch GRAVITY in theaters. This movie is probably one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. The plot is fairly simple but the massively impressive production value more than compensates. Director Alfonso Cuarón has crafted a thrilling survival film set in the harshest environment humans (well, a select few anyway) have endured: space. It follows the tribulations of Dr. Ryan Stone. Stone is a mission specialist with NASA that has been sent into orbit to perform upgrades to the Hubble telescope in her first assignment. Disaster strikes on her first spacewalk when the Russians destroy one of their satellites and the debris cloud rockets around in orbit, detonating other satellites and creating a lethal wave of shredded metal careening around the Earth at 20,000 MPH. The space shuttle is destroyed and most of the crew is killed, leaving Stone and mission commander Matt Kowalski as the sole survivors left drifting above the Earth and counting the minutes until the debris' next deadly pass. Stone will need to face her fears if she hopes to survive as she and Kowalski must find a means of returning to Earth alive.I'm a space geek and have been for as long as I can remember. As much as I love science fiction, and I do quite a bit, there have been few films that have ever given much effort to portray space as it actually is. There's always some sort of convenient technology to prevent the filmmakers from having to deal with the harsh realities of space travel. GRAVITY isn't science fiction but is instead a survival drama set in the environment of space, and Cuarón uses the full gamut of hazards that come with leaving the Earth's atmosphere. There are no rocket boots to make maneuvering in space a simple task here. Well, there's a sort of jet pack unit used in limited capacity but the danger still remains that if Stone or Kowalski make one wrong move, they will find themselves slowly drifting off for a lonely, horrifying death as they wait for their air supply to run out. GRAVITY isn't 100% accurate to the trials and tribulations of surviving in space and some liberties were taken for the sake of telling a story, but it's so much more realistic than has been portrayed in pretty much any movie that's come before. Cuarón and his team have found a way of realistically portraying total weightlessness so well that I couldn't wait to watch the behind-the-scenes footage to find out how it was done. I loved that there were no sleek, fancy spaceships and we get legitimate recreations of existing space structures such as the International Space Station.And the visuals are just incredible. This is a movie that, for the utmost effect, should be viewed in IMAX 3D. I missed out and watched the movie in high definition when it was released on home video, but I saw enough (and was wowed enough) to know that I had missed out on something incredible. The Earth, as seen from orbit, is an amazing backdrop for a film and there was not a single moment of this film that I didn't find absolutely gorgeous. I realize I've spent most of this comment ranting about my love for the film's visuals but that's because it's the best reason to see this film. The story is very simple: Stone, eventually left to her own devices, must confront her fear of death and find a means of escaping her fate. It's primarily just Stone (Sandra Bullock) traversing from one hope to another as she goes from station to station searching for a functional escape capsule while dodging the debris/blender. I hate to undermine it because it's still an exciting story and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning. Stone is a sympathetic character and we learn bits about her as the story progresses and watch as she eventually buckles under the pressure of her situation. At this point, we know that Bullock is a talented actress and she does well in this movie where she's pretty much the entirety of the cast for most of the film. Cuarón and Bullock manipulate your emotions and keep you invested until the final frame, and it all combines with the director's amazing vision to create one of the coolest movies I've seen in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A sublime Sandra Bullock is lost in space.,"A force, such as gravity, pulls the object into a curved path as it attempts to fly off in a straight line.Thus a small object in space will orbit a large one.This 91 minute, Warner Brothers film, rated 12A in the UK, tells the story of a small object, like a space-station, or to be more precise, a very small speck of an astronaut, played by Sandra Bullock, in orbit around the relatively very large Earth.Space is big, and in this vast Universe there are planets and stars, with a lot of space in between. This space is a void, a vast nothing.Film opens in space above Earth. At first we hear nothing and see nothing. Then a faint communication is heard which gradually gets louder. We see a small speck get gradually larger. It is a spacecraft and astronauts are working on it as it orbits high up above the Earth.Sandra Bullock plays one astronaut, George Clooney plays another. Mr Clooney's astronaut is an experienced veteran. Miss Bullock's astronaut, by contrast is a rookie. Both are engaged in a spacewalk. Mr Clooney is enjoying his time in space however mission-control are worried about Miss Bullock performing her allotted task without getting sick.Those viewers who experienced the shaky camera of the recent 'Captain Phillips', will be glad to know that this film is completely different from that. You, and I, and Sandra Bullock, may have no idea of what is up, and down, but only mission-control will worry about sickness in this film. Viewers while experiencing a realistic representation of weightlessness in space, in this film, will not find it filmed in such a way as to make them queasy.In the vastness of space around Earth, mission-control detects a collision between two other space-craft. This sets off some sort of localized intergalactic bar-billiards game. Broken bits of spacecraft are now heading towards our astronauts who are now in deadly danger. Film shows realistically the danger presented by these fast travelling objects. All are in orbit, and in the void of space, there is no gravity or atmosphere between the objects and anything they may hit. Collisions in space, in Star Trek, or similar films, have been done before, but this film shows the danger in a realistic way, that other films have failed to capture before.When the collisions occur, they are catastrophic. Astronaut Bullock loses her tether and floats off, spinning out of control, into space, alone, and with a finite amount of oxygen.It has been said that Miss Bullock spent a lot of time preparing for this role. She certainly conveys to us viewers the problems of weightlessness in space. As well as objects hurtling through the void of space, we also get a good representation of the problems of inertia. Propulsion gets you moving in relation to other objects, but how do you stop? There are lots of bone-crunching collisions, attempts to catch and get a hold of objects are all well portrayed. All of this while hurtling through the void of space, orbiting above Earth.George Clooney is perfect in the supporting role but Sandra Bullock is the real star of this film. The film is clearly a Bullock vehicle but this space vehicle had to be very good. It is. Actress Bullock has been given a tremendous space vehicle. Astronaut Bullock could only wish she had such a space vehicle.Great as this film is, Sandra Bullock has to carry it, for it to succeed, and carries it, she does, with a truly sublime performance. Miss Bullock has graced the silver-screen for many years now with great performances in rom-coms. Her everyday girlish charms have contributed to some of the greatest examples of the rom-com genre. There has never been any doubt that she can do light, but what about the meatier, more serious, stuff? Earlier this year, Miss Bullock appeared in the surprisingly gritty 'The Heat' female buddy-cop action-comedy. Here though she goes much further, this is her film, a true action film that is exciting, scary and tense. It is a tour-de-force.Film has some shocks, surprises and twists. It is also tense and emotional. You may find it useful to carry a hanky.This 91 minute film reminds us of the earlier Warner Brother films of yester-year. From start to finish there is not a single wasted scene.The harshest of critics of 3D films has said that this film should be viewed in the 3D format. This reviewer followed that advice and was richly rewarded for paying the extra. Some cinemas give out, and collect back in, the 3D glasses. Mine did not. Instead of paying my usual UK£7.50p, I paid £9.60p plus another 80p for the glasses. I saw a great film and get to keep my Sandra Bullock 3D glasses for ever! Before the film I endured some poor 3D film previews. They did not look good but rather unreal. No problem with this film though. The 3D effect really helped in immersing into the film. However it was all the little details that made this film. Watch as the smallest of things float about into your vision and grow bigger and bigger as they approach you. Again it is the details of these smallest of things that complete the effect of putting you in space with Miss Bullock. Weightlessness makes everything float about, and boy does it! Knowing that we are not in space, we are so immersed in this film that we feel that we are. Even get into the head of Miss Bullock as the camera gives a POV from inside her helmet!Be it breathless, or breath-taking, Sandra Bullock delivers a truly, truly, sublime performance. This is film-making at it's very, very, best. This really is a must see 3D, and must see, film. 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie but Good God Sandra Bullock is Annoying,"A fantastic movie, riveting from start to finish; this film has a great story, is intensely realistic, and the acting is... hard to put one's finger on. George Clooney kills it as usual playing the confident, charismatic alpha male role and fills his role well. Sandra Bullock on the other hand, grated on my nerves throughout, though I'm unsure if I should blame her or blame the writer for the portrayal of the surviving female astronaut as a clueless, whining, and petulant child. The absolute inability of her character to deal with reality as it arrives wave after wave is hard to watch at points.That being said, this is a family-friendly film that is terrifying solely through the realistic portrayal of the harrowing situations a modern astronaut could still reasonably face while in orbit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Visual experience and should be viewed and rated as such,"I suspect that the majority of the people who dislike this movie have only seen it on small screen and/or in 2d.Like Avatar, this movie was made to be a visual 3d experience, and that's exactly what it is and how it should be rated (and this is coming from someone who is usually a 3d cynic).Yes, in 2d and on small screen it loses much of it's impressiveness. But you can't fully judge this movie if you have only seen it like that as that was never the way it was intended to be watched. So I can't really blame you for disliking the movie if you've never seen it as intended.So please just take my advice: Watch it in 3d and it's a great experience. Watch it in 3d on the big screen and you'll be blown away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Missing Gravitas,"This film was not what I expected - I was actually pleasantly surprised! That doesn't, however, mean it was the brilliant film most have been raving about. The cinematography / cgi work was breathtaking and stood out for most of the film. There was action. Really! And a lot of it! I caught myself on a few occasions glued to the screen, apprehension drawn all over my face. Sadly, my face appeared to have more emotion that that of Sandra Bullock's Dr Ryan. Both she and Clooney (playing the somewhat garrulous astronaut Kowalski) appeared to be going through the motions giving underwhelming performances. As the film progressed the situations Dr Ryan found herself in became increasingly more ridiculous. It all begins with the Russians bombing their own satellite by accident (already, facepalm) creating debris and initiating a chain-reaction of events. And yes, the physics of it all was not as accurate as some might want you to believe. Clichés galore, let's also chuck in a side-story about the protagonist's massive personal loss from her recent past - to make her more approachable? Likable? Believable? Oh, wait, to add the existential dilemma needed for added emotional gravitas to the film! Right.. Yet one would be able to suspend their belief if the dialogue supported it. In this film, it didn't. It was, frankly, quite juvenile at times. This could of been for me the masterpiece others saw had more effort been put in parts of the plot and most of the dialogue (the later being what I'm holding responsible for both Bullock and Clooney's subpar performances). In summary, NOT the innovative masterpiece expected, however a watchable pop-corn movie nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Visually stunning - but little else to talk about,"Enjoyed the movie - great to look at, but there is so little to talk about afterwards. You can only say 'wow, that looked incredible' so many times. There is no character driven plot or development - other than two rather obvious clichés. Cynical astronaut who has been there, done that. Timid space newbie who has to wise up pronto to survive. There is also plenty of cheese here. In fact our journey home had us picking over the physics and continuity errors - of which there are a few. Never a good sign I think.Acting wise - Clooney has been a lot better than this - and has been given the job of perking the thing up. Bullock is OK - but nothing out of the ordinary. The picture will win possibly 4 Oscars - but none of the big prizes. Over -rated at 8 something.....will find its place among the late 6s in time....",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Way 3D Should Be Done.,"This has to be the best exhibition around in showing what the usually pointless 3D filming can actually produce.If you are fed up of paying extra to go and watch a 3D film only to find that at one point through out the 90 minuet picture a fist might come out of the screen, Gravity may be the film to restore your faith in the medium of 3D cinema.I have avidly avoided any 3D screening of any film as it is usually just a way for money grabbing cinema companies to get an extra two pounds off you for some poorly made glasses. However in gravity the visuals are truly breathtaking, in fact some of the best parts of the film are the establishing shots of the earth which are truly stunning. The visuals are clearly at the forefront of this film from the outset with the acting and plot taking a back seat, however if you had worries that the plot simply consisted of Sandra Bullock floating around in space for an hour and a half it is far from that with some truly epic space disaster scenes, in which the 3D is used yet even more effectively.A must watch if only to see how 3D should be done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

I given up my dream of becoming a NASA scientist after watching this movie, this was the impact on me. I felt everything even nausea in zero gravity scene i was literally feeling no gravity & in scenes where object comes towards screen i really tried to save myself from those more then 3 times. Sandra did a fantastic job, without her acting this impact was impossible to create, with only 2 character gravity bounds you till the end.

A Flawed Visual Extravaganza,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 2.5/5 starsAll hoopla and no real steam. Don't care who found it astounding, or spellbinding, or whatever superlatives are being used to describe this over-indulgent soporific mess of a sci-fi drama. Now the film isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, It's just not as great as it's being made out to be, and that's what peeves me.In fact, after ages I actually felt like walking out of the cinema hall midway, and I usually don't do that for even worse movies than this. The reason being, that this movie is, plain and simple, boooooorrrrring as hell. The biggest drawback of this film is that it becomes all to predictable and static after a certain point, and that point arrives all too soon.If it wasn't for Sandra Bullock and her amazing performance, which somehow managed to salvage the disintegrating remains of ""Gravity"", I actually might have walked out on the movie. Sandra Bullock is the life and soul of ""Gravity"", and along with the stunning visuals, the only good thing in the entire movie. George Clooney also manages to get your attention in his surprisingly brief appearance.The visuals, while exemplary, are not worth your time and effort to sit through the lethargic proceedings. So if you do wish to catch ""Gravity"" just because it's being pushed down our throats as something so cool, and contemporary, and the biggest spectacle since ""Avatar"" (an infinitely superior film), then watch it for Bullock's performance and her performance alone. Sadly, even her mesmerizing and captivating act cannot make us care in the end if her character actually manages to survive the ordeal or not, only because of the painful ordeal the film itself inflicts upon us.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A space film with human emotion!!,"I don't want to give any spoilers so I am not going to mention scenes here.I heard and read a lot about Gravity from my film fraternity friends and colleagues. Everyone said "" Don't miss it"". I am a George Clooney fan but never was one of Sandra Bullock. I entered the theater hoping to see George Clooney in space suit and having wise cracks at every other character.By God, I was surprised to see Sandra Bullock giving such a matured and nuance performance. There were a few plot holes but the effort of the director and screenplay writer to keep audience engaged through out the 90 minutes with no major geographical changes is commendable.In space or even in life you never know which can trigger a disaster. In such case losing yourself is pretty easy compared to fighting for survival. You can lose your hope in a minute and give up for all good but to sustain the hunger to live and prosper gets even difficult with every passing moment.This film shows you the way to keep the belief going and survive this momentary loneliness. The camera work and Vfx are breathtaking. Recommend you to watch it with an open mind even if you do have expectations film can live up to them.This film is a classic case of either you love it completely or hate it. Hope you find and experience the former emotion. Space is too big to hate!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"

Lost In Space was better than this. I should have know with Clooney in another space movie. Solaris was as rotten as this. But this stunk even more.

Even George Clooney was exceptional. This was a story of survival plain and simple but done with such mastery that it draws you in and you are there with Ryan Stone throughout the whole movie.

I haven't seen a more engaging film all year.,"The essence of a film lies in its ability to astonish us beyond what we imagine to be possible (or impossible). Every year just a handful of films manage to do this by leaving us in a state of awe and euphoria. For 2013, this is it - GRAVITY is a state-of-the-art film that you experience, rather than just watch on a big screen. And years from now, it will be remembered for setting new benchmarks in the filmmaking industry.Cinematically speaking, this is not just my best movie of the year by the manner in which it is made or narrated, but because of the way it will change the world of motion pictures as we know it. Last year it was Ang Lee's LIFE OF PI and few years ago it was James Cameron's AVATAR. While the common thread running through these films are generous eye-popping visual effects, GRAVITY is far more superior in style, soul, effects and showmanship. That being said, there isn't much of a story here, and like LIFE OF PI before, the central theme is a white-knuckle do or die survival story. But that's where the comparison ends. The opening scene is an unbroken 15 minute long-take that introduces us to veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) and Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) as they repair the Hubble telescope 600 kilometers above Earth. Matt is commanding his final space mission while Ryan is on her first. They joke around a bit, converse with mission control in Houston (voiced by Ed Harris) and a third astronaut working in the background. Then comes the dreaded ""abort"" after Houston warns that debris from a missile hit Russian satellite is headed their way. At speeds nearing 20,000 kilometers an hour, this debris becomes shrapnel that rips through their space shuttle, simultaneously killing the crew and severing communications with Houston. Barely surviving the hit, Matt and Ryan are now tiny white dots against the black expanse of outer space. And that's not even the bad news. Low on oxygen and tumbling through hostile conditions of space, their only hope of survival is reaching the International Space Station before the aforementioned debris returns within orbital striking distance.Matt estimates they have 90 minutes to get to the space station. Incidentally, this is also the runtime of the film where everything happens in real-time proximity. All through this runtime, Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón maintains a visceral deadlock between the viewer's state of awe and the terrifying ordeal playing out on screen. But even against increasing panic, shortness of breath and imminent death, the narrative switches to a frantic fight for survival by clinging on to mankind's most innate virtues – hope. Bullock embodies this in the role of a lifetime by constantly allowing her character to evolve. At first she is a rookie medical engineer on her first space mission, then a terrified individual with a tragic past, before learning to tap into the essence of the human spirit. Bullock has come a long way from driving a bus in SPEED to sidelining (excuse the pun) the competition in her Oscar winning THE BLIND SIDE, to flying an entire space station in this film. THIS is Sandra Bullock at her finest and every iota of her portrayal demands another Academy Award nomination. Close behind but with less screen time is Clooney. Equipped with witticisms and pep, Clooney is exactly what you would expect from and actor-director with a thoroughbred resume.For most of us, GRAVITY is the closest we will ever get to feeling what it must be like in space. This is Cuarón's gift to the cinema industry and the discerning audience alike. Having co-scripted the film with his son, Cuarón's greatest achievement in this film is the technical nuance that has gone into its making. Cinematography is literally out of this world with some of the most spectacular vistas of Earth. There are scenes where the lens shifts from infinite space to within an inch of Ryan's face - a seamless juxtaposition of the vastness of space with claustrophobia. Sound design accentuated by Steven Price's original score is another contrast between surreal imagery and the eerie loneliness of space. These are not just effects in the conventional sense but a profound manner of grafting special effects with the character's emotions and the darkening atmosphere of the narrative; all in 3D that is not only immersive but in a way that becomes the skeletal binding of the story. Phenomenal!As an only perceivable flaw, GRAVITY can seem preachy at times, underscored by slim propaganda that says something about the selfless courage of the elite – men and women who risk life and limb for the greater good of humanity. Then again, such was the message in last year's Academy Award Best Picture ARGO. At the time of writing this review, awards season 2014 is still a few months away. But from where I was seated, I am looking at no less than nominations for sound design, visual effects, cinematography, best leading actress, directing and quite possibly, Best Motion Picture. And then some.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not impressed,"I've watched it, and I'll never watch it again. Perhaps if I watched it in 3D I'd be impressed like most people but I find this movie shallow, two dimensional, even a little trashy. Believe if it weren't for A listers and big budget and special effects this movie would be just a blip. Acting is actually great, but story, dialogue, message of the whole movie is really weak. Also there are a lot of unconvincible, trashy things that I'd rate this movie watchable and 7 only if real astronaut explained it to me as believable. Strictly subjective, everything but acting was weak, story is shallow and quite stupid, survival, getting over lost. It's just a big fancy shiny wrap with two great actors doing their best and bow on it. Nothing more to it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Possibly a little over hyped, but a very good film.","Has to be the most realistic screen portrayal of life in zero-g. Ever. But even so, it is not totally realistic, as the director occasionally claims artistic license with the laws of physics.The story could be accused of lacking depth, but it is a story well executed. By the standards of most science fiction films, it's practically War And Peace. I take the general theme of the film to be about walking through the fire, taking strength from adversity.Some of the dialogue is corny. But that's not why you watch this film. It is an extremely visual piece, with everything in it (the special effects, the sets, the models, and Sandra Bullock) being extremely beautiful.As such, do not bother watching it on a phone, or a dodgy TV set.

Watch on 3D only,"If you rented, downloaded, copied this movie, you've wasted your time as this film can ONLY be enjoyed on the big screen with 3D glasses on. Thumbs up to the graphics editor that was most likely the best part of the film. Other than that the movie lacks a proper plot, and it surprised me that such a good actress like Sandra Bullock was given a script that hears her breathing in and out, more than talking. Her hair was cut short which was a bit of a let down. Would have liked to see her long hair swaying in the Zero gravity (with added 3D effects)Also, when you look through the cast all you see next to the names is (Voice). That brings you to wonder, couldn't the producers afford more actors?I'm not an astronaut myself but it really seemed to me like it was a tad unrealistic but hey, aren't all movies?

A grand space walk of a film,"Films like this have the ability to convert anyone to a new medium. 3D movies have been having a tough time of late, but this film deserves your attention and turns the tables.There is no tsunami wave of special effects, or clichéd pointing at the screen. Instead the 3D is used incredibly well to illustrate depth and space in a way that is seminal. Seriously, no other film has ever made you appreciate or experience space like this as well for so long, it kind of harks back to the impact that 2001 must have had on its release.It is very much a lesson in how to use 3D properly, and some of the views are beautifully done. 3D really needed a shot in the arm, and this film has even led to arch critics of 3D (such as Mark Kermode of the BBC) to accept that this film is a game-changer.The story is almost theatre, as it really only involves two people. Yet it works perfectly. The acting is exceptional in this 'disaster' movie as our leads try to get to safety after their space walk all goes terribly wrong. The story is good and the action wonderful and believable, a lot of tension in this and you'll be on th edge of your seat.I can see this film leading the charges for awards in time.I can't recommend this highly enough, easily for me the best film of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Cuarón has created a masterpiece !,"Before coming to Albanian cinemas, I heard and read that this was one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.

Gravity has a simple story, one of the simplest, but it catches your heart and opens your imagination like none before. The visuals in 3D were amazing and the acting was very good. I really liked Sandra Bullock and I'm sure she will be nominated for an Oscar. 'Gravity' was like a short, totally filled with knowledge, space encyclopedia.

Enjoyed it... again.,"It's been a while since I watched this, but it's a nice brief (by today's standards) 90 minutes that fit well into the afternoon. I first watched this in a cinema in 3D with one of those chairs that shakes you around. I'm not a fan of gimmicks, or 3D which is largely a gimmick, but I have to admit it worked wonderfully for this film. It is after all a film about floating around in space with several occasions to shake the hell out of you. That's not all there is to it though. Yes it's sentimental at its core and follows are fairly predictable story arc, but it's still looks fantastic, rattles along at an engaging pace, sounds incredible and sets your teeth on edge. There's some nice shots and tricks, making full use of the fact that very little is real in camera, pulling in through the helmet glass in the opening act. It's also nice to see a strong female lead, I'm not a big Bullock fan, but she seems to fit this role perfectly. Clooney does his roguish clown thing well, adding that counter humour to the ramping tension. Yes it has an air of 'Really, what the hell is gonna go wrong next', but it's a disaster movie, plain, simple and I really enjoyed it... again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
looks awesome,"Saw this at the Leeds Film Festival at the Everyman Theatre . Wonderful comfort...but the tension was such that I couldn't relax into my cushioned sofa...instead my body was in the main knotted...gripping hand rests etc as the film progressed . I would guess this is a must watch in 3D....visually I think it would be much poorer without the glasses ! Some of the shots of Outer Space were simply breath-taking , and it was easy to live the drama alongside the two Actors . Bullock is fantastic . You can really believe in her character . Clooney has a few of the best lines , and basically plays himself...but gives a decent supporting performance . No doubt there were a few holes in the plot...but nonetheless...surely one of the top films this year . Im not sure its quite up there alongside 2001 , as it isn't the sort of film where you need to ""think"" . Its more pure escapism , where the increasing tension is more important than the actual story .",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Alfonso Cuaron finds life in space,"Space draws ours interest because most of us will never get to experience of the wonders that lurk there. Director, Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is the best alternative to a trip to space. There's no hyperbole that comes with describing Gravity because it is in fact magnificent.Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer sent to space with experienced astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) to service a Hubble Space Telescope. Before completing their work on the Telescope, they are hit with debris from another Satellite when the two individuals are separated and communication is lost. Dr. Stone, not a trained astronaut, must find her way to return safely to Earth.In 2009's Avatar, James Cameron advanced visual effects to new heights in order to fit his image of the fictional world, Pandora. Like Cameron, Cuaron's vision required him to invent new technology in order for the film to have the intimacy he desired for his audience. The visuals are essential to the enjoyment of Gravity. This isn't a film that could hold its weight with the screenplay alone.Gravity is the best use of 3D ever in film. I'm not a supporter of 3D, I never have been, but Gravity gives me hope that the future will properly suit each film that uses 3D to enhance the experience, not just a means to boost the box office sales. Cuaron makes us feel that we are taken off of Earth and shuttled into space with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. We feel like we have become a part of the story, like a miscellaneous object floating with the characters. If Gravity lacked 3D, Cuaron would have had a more difficult time transporting us like he does.Children of Men, one of Cuaron's most praised films, became famous for scenes that consisted of the long, uninterrupted takes. Instead of three or four minute scenes of that nature, he pushes us even further with ten minutes without a single editing cut in Gravity. This flow allows the audience to funnel its focus into the film and think about nothing else. Cuaron only cuts when it is necessary to give us the perspective of his heroine.How hard would that be? Plays go uninterrupted for hours at times, why is it so special here? Because the camera-work must follow the characters, who succumb to gravity while they try to solve their predicaments. The camera zooms in on the two actors as they float frontwards and backwards, upside down, right-side up to make us empathize with the characters, as well as establishing and tracking shots to show the magnitude of the action and scope out outer space.The special effects are so realistic that a naive man would believe Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were trained as astronauts to shoot the film in outer space. Visual effects are hardly ever a sole reason to see a film, but Gravity is now the exception to that rule. Film critics and analysts have been left baffled to understand how Cuaron conducted the thorough realism of outer space.When an actor is offered a role that is a one-woman show for two-thirds of an entire film, it can be daunting decision to sign on. Sandra Bullock doesn't let the pressure affect her portrayal, in fact she pulls something out of her that we have waited for her entire career. Bullock doesn't challenge herself in the romantic comedies and the ""Feel Good"" Lifetime-style dramas she often selects, but in Gravity she delivers a strong performance that makes me proud of her acting ability.Creating movies is like a balancing act. Screenplays that are intricately written with great details and higher meanings typically won't fare well if the director's mind is on spectacle. Gravity has spectacle at the top of its list. The film has so much to show us, therefore it makes sense for not having as much to tell. But, Gravity manifests that thinly plotted script can have as much meaning and life value as any novel adaptation.Gravity is about life. Not just life in space, but it questions how every one of us view life. Are we prepared to give up on everything because we've faced obstacles that have knocked us down, or is there beauty in fighting and climbing the ladder of life? Alfonso Cuaron finds life in space.Gravity proves stereotypes wrong. Who ever made it a rule that movies in space or containing action had to be unrealistic? Like me, you may have seen the trailer and posters for Gravity and may think ""I'm not in the mood for Science Fiction."" I'm sure there are some inaccuracies, but there's nothing predominantly unrealistic about it, the setting just happens to be in outer space. Don't wait for the DVD/BluRay, it won't be the same as the smashing experience in the 3D cinema.Grade: ARating: 9",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
GRAVITY  - Castaway in space,"The technicality is terrific. A visual treat from space with a sound department deserving an Oscar. Awesome cinematography that could take viewing to a new level with absolutely no cuts. Nice direction with just two lead characters throughout the entire film.Seriously was shocked to be listed among the top Oscar nominees and could possibly bag many. It was because the movie story was a direct-lift from Castaway except for the fact that the protagonist is lost in space instead of an island. A very shallow script that no one could possibly discuss after viewing. Also the movie has too many sci errors like the oxygen levels in a suite (see it you'll understand).Pros - Special Effects, sound, Camera-work.

Best movie of 2013 : Only watch in 3D,"Yes definitely its the best movie of 2013. Best thing about this movie is that it well defined use of 3D technology and this technology in its original spirit. And also gave shut-up call to its critics. In my opinion 3D technology is wonderful for visualization but if used properly.Plot is very simple and straight forward, nothing complex. Its a simple survival story. Director has done great job. Placed each piece at its right place. Theme is very well chosen. Like space which is lonely place, movie also has no crowd at all. Movie is well edited. Background score was great and well appreciated as well.Sandra and George has done great job specially Sandra put life to her character. There is no one else to discuss :) Final words are that, if you really want to enjoy this film truly, watch it in 3D. It will be a life time experience for you. Thats my guarantee.

I would only say that this film is not for anyone with a heart condition or a nervous disposition. I found this film as visually beautiful as it was jaw-grindingly intense. In the theater, people were so intensely invested in this film that every intended reaction was felt throughout. Make no mistake- this film was the filmmaker's great achievement- absolutely the perfect presentation, absolutely the work of an artist.Again, I don't shed these words for many. This was nothing I'd ever seen before.The closest comparison for me is ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" but not quite. It's not as deep and intelligent a movie; not as original a premise and not as groundbreaking. But these are two different movies, and this story couldn't have been presented better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent for it's genre,"If you expect to watch a 2012 end of the world or some zombie attack movie , save your few bucks and stay at home.For those who enjoys sci-fi scenarios simulations closer to home however (the 'farther end' was ""Prometheus"" the equally exciting movie), this is a must-watch this year. The depth of feel was pretty good in 3D, without making the ""oooh 3...D...."" cliché of focusing too much on trying to impress using the 3D elements like many early 3D movies choreography.My only peeve was the rushed ending sequence and the twist of good fortune that made Shenzou capsule re-entry appear almost incident free, in stark comparison to the rest of Tiangong. The end was too bland, which could have benefited from short educational sequence for younger viewers on what would have happened to the astronaut (Clooney) drifted in space without the EVA/life-support --- but that's merely from an educational perspective of course.Nonetheless, well done, Alfonso and Jonas Cuarón. Will be on the lookout for your upcoming movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Magnificent,"So the hype for Gravity is at an insane high right now. It's gotten some of the best reviews in years, and that hype has crossed over to the mainstream audience as well as hardcore film buffs. I don't think this is a perfect film, and it's not entirely original, but man does it work. The cinematography is outstanding, as are the sound and visual effects. The two leads are also pretty strong, Bullock in particular giving a performance I'm sure most people weren't aware she could give. This is a truly movie-star performance, one that will be associated with Bullock as a pea for the rest of her career. This is strongly recommended, definitely to be seen on the big screen.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
I ended up liking this movie,"I went to the movie expecting to be board, for the first little bit i was quite board but once it got into it i was more and more into it, to the point were i was thinking come on you can get it go go go grab it :) so yes it ended up being a good movie. it was like no other movie in the respect it was an actual lost in space movie which would be anybody's worst nightmare just floating around yuck. you could feel the fair and anxiety with Sandra Bullock, the trailers i feel make it seem boring my thoughts from the trailer was oh man this is going to be so boring a couple of people floating in space how could this be a thriller but was impressed with what they didIt is defiantly worth the watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity Review,"It was a great film, Loved the way it was shot. I take my hat off to both George Clooney & Sandra Bullock. A+ performance.. The only thing that was an upset was the fact that George Clooney was not present for the entire film. I would guess thats why the movie trailer was so short and did not really show much.. because had they showed you the film was more based on Sandra Bullock it might not have pulled what it did in box office. But none the less still a great film and I would recommend it to viewers who have not yet watched it. (Y) Its also interesting due to the fact this film had such a small cast. Literally you could count the amount of cast members on 2 hands. Very interesting stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great visuals lacking great story,"Gravity starts with some great visual experiences, especially in 3D, and the first half of the film maintains interest and excitement in what is basically a very simple story involving the two main characters. The second half of this tale is neither believable, interesting nor realistic in any shape or form. Veteran astronaut, George Clooney appears far too cool during a major catastrophe in his attempt to save the damsel in distress, a medical engineer but inexperienced astronaut played by Sandra Bullock. Early on, local critical reviews rated very highly, some referring to a modern day classic of 2001: A Space Odyssey status. I don't think so. An enjoyable film at 90 minutes in length, but very average in its entire context. Somewhat of a disappointment after all the early hype and expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
The closest that most of us ever get to experiencing space for ourselves,"Gravity is a strange mixture of the ridiculous and the sublime. For me, the latter eclipsed the former almost all the way along: the beauty, wonder, and grandeur of the film let me quickly forgive the few truly facepalmy moments.Let's start with the bad and get it out of the way. What little story there is here is completely linear, paper-thin, and relies on howlingly bad science to create a crisis and then howlingly bad science to resolve it. The few characters are presented as professional astronauts yet, as introduced, two of the three behave more like twenty-somethings on a package holiday. Did I mention how oh God the science is really bad? It's the astrodynamics that suffers the worst: all kinds of ludicrous orbital impossibilities are depicted. I know it's only a movie and supposed to be a fun way to spend 90-odd minutes, but I found this stuff as jarring as a movie set on terra firma where a hoodlum on a skateboard in New York snatches a handbag, darts off down the street, and in the next scene is swapping the skateboard for a bicycle in Beijing. It really is that bad (indeed, it's actually worse than that!)......except when the science is really good! The title ""Gravity"" is perhaps a little misleading because gravity doesn't (directly) play much part in the film. Rather, it's ""Conservation of Angular Momentum"" that's a recurring theme. For the most part, aside of one very very obvious and annoying gaffe, Newtonian mechanics are well respected, and I found the terror and desperation of characters in the grips of ""the cold equations"" palpable at times.So what else does this movie do right? Well, for a start, I think it's the most beautiful cinematic depiction of space since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"": the cinematography is stunning in an ""enlarge any frame and hang it on your wall"" kind of way. It really has been 40 years since space has looked this good. The vistas of Earth from orbit are really breathtaking; in particular, a gorgeous panorama of Egypt sticks in my mind. As I was watching that sequence, I was wishing a little that all attempts at a story had just been excised from the finished film. Set to a mellow jazz or classical score, I think I could watch those spacescapes for hours and hours.Finally, I found its depictions of real (or close to real) space hardware and working in microgravity really, really convincing and immersive. When a character loses a tool at a crucial moment, I (like they) had a very strong sense of panic about not ever ever getting it back. And it's the spacecraft of the film—a space shuttle, a Soyuz TMA, and a Shenzhou. all lovingly rendered and presented—that to me were perhaps the real stars of the show. To me, these felt like real spacecraft, and I felt like I was there aboard them.I highly, highly recommend this movie. You might get into the survival story—I could take it or leave it, but I think it was credibly done—but watching this on the big screen in 3D is likely to be the closest that most of us ever get to experiencing space for ourselves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
An overrated but still a Good movie,"Rating-7/10Gravity is a film that although I feel was and is overrated, still manages to put together a good drama and with some breathtaking effects, I would still recommend this to everyone. From a fine director who has only really come from the shadows with this film to a duo that share this film and well Ii must also mention they are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood. With it's massive effects come massive affects to the characters and with some speedy space junk to and escape pods everywhere this film guarantees thrilling stuff. I felt this film was strongly good, and here is why.The story is a good one, not the finest I could think of but with some great thrills and also spills, you are never not gripped to it. I felt that the story at times did rely on it's effects and soppy stories of home to fill in the gaps but nevertheless it is a solid story and even if it is kind of simple still makes for pleasant viewing. The pace is fast and big and you really don't know what will happen next, this one reason rated this slightly higher as predicting what happens around her is near impossible and all down to writing of a great writer and director.Sandra Bullock in the main role does a good job if not slightly over dramatic one at times but manages to be great by the end. George Clooney as back up seemed nearly too chilled to execute his role well enough and just seemed to float around the entire film without trying to do anything. With this there are only ever the two in it which makes for cool viewing as you do in the end get to know quite a bit about them even if the movie is only 91 minutes long, good stuff yet again from Cuaron.Alfonso Cuaron has to be one of the most underrate directors of our time and I swear he can make any film better than it seems or just generally better. His skill with the word is good too and some dialogues I this although not always executed perfectly by the cast, is great stuff and his choice of dialogue is intriguing at best. I can't not mention the effects which are just massively and crazily big with some sublime work done by the studio behind this, the entire thing looks real and on such a scale too just wow, one of the best film for effects I have ever seen seriously.I do feel this film is overrated like I said, although Cuaron is perfect and did deserve his Oscar for his work, I got annoyed with Bullocks character and wasn't sure if that was just how Cuaron wanted her to be or Bullock wasn't playing her right. I also will add that although the drama is good and thrilling, this film offers very little more in terms of anything and I cannot see why it is so highly reviewed as it seriously is nothing special(well maybe the effects are but effects don't make an entire movie flawless).Those who enjoy space adventures will like it as Gravity is basically what it says on the tin, she spins around in the earth's gravity a lot, but it makes for good viewing though. I think Clooney fans may be disappointed as we don't see loads of him and his screen time is just not enough for him to save himself from his stale performance. I know I sound like I hate it but it is actually worth a watch from anyone, no matter what type of film you think you like, this can be enjoyed.Overall I give this a 7/10 meaning it is Strongly a Good film, it is very near to being very good but certain factors don't allow it to move upwards to there. Don't watch this and say you like it because all critics say they do and because it won Oscars, see for yourself, I didn't find it great but it was good and personal opinion is everything here. One more thing is the score by Steven Price which I am not kidding can make you heart beat faster in the more thrilling parts, and also go see this in 3D if you want even more thrills than it already gives.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Don't understand the hype!,"A friend described Sandra Bullock's moaning and gasping in a good portion of the film as sounding like ""bad sex."" This was just a bad movie with no realism and, really, no suspense...the whole thing just wasn't believable. How Sandra Bullock's character was not screened out of the space program due to her emotional problems caused by the sudden death of her four year old child cannot be explained. George Clooney's character was a modern day Don Juan (apparently the only role Clooney is comfortable portraying) and is about as realistic as Johnny Depp's role as Tonto in ""The Lone Ranger."" Putting ""the make"" on a fellow astronaut during a life threatening situation is only credible to Hollywood. Sadly, this kind of fluff in now de rigueur in today's world of film production!",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
It could not get any better than this...!!!,"After hearing so much about this movie, I decided to check it out. I was not disappointed! In fact, this was way beyond my expectations. My wife isn't a great fan of sci-fi per say, but this blew her mind too! I watched this 3 times already. What I liked most about this movie, is it's whole setup. Almost shot entirely out of space, this gripping thriller keeps you on the edge. Sandra Bullock is fantastic actress, this proves so yet again. Clooney's sense of humor gives you a good laugh or two. Visualizations are fantastic, and gives you feel of actual space. I honestly don't know what could have made this any better.So, go on, watch it, if you haven't already!

A turning point in film history,"Gravity is one of those movies that one has to watch to be part of film history, it's a turning point in the film history time line. A new film narrative is born, the movement of the camera takes the audience into a different way of understanding the beautiful weirdness of space. It made me believe that I was there in space; what an achievement! It is the director's job to make us feel the emotion, to be part of the story, to experience what the characters are going through, and Cuarón just nailed that part. Frame by frame it is perfect, I can't easily say ""My favorite scene is when"" because it has so many awesome moments and it is a movie shot and edited so carefully, with such detail; that each frame can be analyzed and be semiotically interesting. It is indeed a very smart use of 3D technology and this movie's success also proves that audiences love good surprises, people need to be thrilled. This movie is a ""must watch"" now and in the years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
An amazing Realist Epic Thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat,"Gravity was probably one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It was very REAL every single thing that happened in the movie, could have happened in real life and could have played out quite similarly. The Realistic approach combined with the spectacular acting with the story was very intriguing, thrilling, and kept my eyes glued to the screen the whole time. Sometimes when a Realism theatrical show is released, they cinematography falls to the basic Naturalistic almost, 'stock' state. This Epic kept its realism approach across the whole spectrum bringing me into the real void of space above the earth through its picture, sound, music, and special effects. This story Follows that of Ryan Stone as she is trying to fix the Hubble Telescope and things go drastically wrong with another satellite. As her story is followed, the developments leave you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. The story also follows the realism concept and is in true-to-life setting that still has the amazing cinematic thrill that I seek in a movie. One thing I MUST recommend is that if you go to see it, you see it in 3D. There is no other way to see it, the 3D did not hurt my eyes at all, and it was so good that I jumped 3 or 4 times in fear of something hitting me! And although I did love the 3D, my mother, who was with me, said that she did get a bit motion sick, but not from the 3D, it was just the fact that the camera was spinning. Overall, this story and movie was one of the best I have ever seen, It comes highly rated, and deserves just as much! Its portrayal from Actor, to cameraman, and from Grip, to concept designer, was absolutely perfect! I will watch it again and again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A pleasant surprise!,"On the face of it, Gravity doesn't sound like a bunch of fun. The film is pretty much entirely based on a monologue from Sandra Bullock with occasional support from George Clooney. Bullock plays Ryan Stone who is a medical engineer on a space flight. Things go wrong and she is supported by Matt Kowalsky a veteran astronaut.Amazingly the movie is a lot better than you imagine beforehand. The acting of Bullock and Clooney is fine and the visuals are amazing. It's very hard to believe that the movie wasn't actually shot in space or a gravity free environment. It's also in 3d and a rare example where the format really works well. Very enjoyable!",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Great musical score, CGI and acting--particularly Clooney","Is George Clooney the most underrated actor out there?While this is obviously Sandra Bullock's movie (and she's great in the role), I'm not so sure you would have cared as much, had Clooney (and his character) not been present. His calm and selfless demeanor was the counterpoint to Bullock's natural overwhelming fear when things began to go bad. I can't think of another actor in that age range who could have pulled off Matt Kowalski's role--maybe Brad Pitt on a good day?Just a nit: Bullock's character referred to Matt Kowalski as ""Lieutenant"" twice. I have to believe an officer of Kowalski's age and experience (shuttles since 1995) would be higher up the food chain (minimum Commander, most likely (Navy) Captain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Intense atmosphere,"This is one of the best movies of this year (2013). I think that Cuaron has to be nominated to the Oscars, at least. In this movie Cuaron take to the guest and bring in to the whole space. You feel like you are there, alone in the dark. Sandra Bullock is not of the better actresses but she gets to share his lone less. I recommend this movie if you are prepare to don't see guns, punches, sex, and all Michael Bay's ingredients. Go to the cinema or Imax. George Cloney make a good character, but he is on his own, I mean he shows how to act being on your back garden. The sounds, music and sounds effect are terrify! You can feel the lack of air in some moments.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Boring?,"Well, I know a lot of people liked this movie and I don't mind, I just hoped I'd like it as well..The visuals are great. What I liked most about it was that it felt very real, there are no super technologized fiction-machines so you get to fully enjoy the ""out in the space"" experience and in this it excels. Don't think any other movie provides same level of atmospheric mood that is gently contained within ""believable"" limits.However, with all that appreciated, I was constantly bugged by the ""simplicity"" of where things were going, and how it all turned out.First, the movie starts with three astronauts fixing a machine part in the space - two man, one woman. The woman is the one fixing stuff, one of the guys is the ""commander"". They receive an alarm to abort, but the woman keeps fixing it with ""just a moment"" cliché. Then things go wrong. So, if up until this I was genuinely enjoying the realness of it all, now I am watching somebody who was actually allowed into outer space to fix a machine ""postponing orders"". Okey, she is trained for just 6 months, but following orders should take about a minute to memorize.Skipping it. At some point the movie starts to shift from ""this is about space"" to ""this is about me"". And the rest of it feels more like watching a person's journey to self-development more than anything else. The other characters are thrown off very easily. The spiritual aspect of the movie is OK, I mean facing your own demons, overcoming something and learning to move on is indeed important but not in any way original, new or brilliant for a movie. Even if it happens in the outer space.So to wrap it up, I'm not sure how I felt about the change in the movie. I know I was supposed to care for the main character, but I was more annoyed at her for putting everyone's lives at risk. I just didn't find anything in particular amazing about the movie. Atmospheric movies require some patience in general, but with the plot very predictable the only thing I was left with were the visuals, and for that 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A movie to see on big screens, for sure.","Gravity is the masterpiece everybody promised me. We're immersed in space after the first minutes, through incredible technological qualities. We discover at first some friendly characters, whom gradually become more and more human, to slowly get into the skin of the character of Sandra Bullock. We're receiving her feelings, her fears, we understand her reactions. The fact that there is no pause or flash-back in the movie is revolutionary. Some scenes are extremely long... that's what Cuaròn wanted. It gives more realism to the situations and let us time to understand the psychological aspects.And finally a movie reconciling me with 3D ! Without doing too much with unnecessary effects, there is just what we need to fulfill the function that 3D should fulfill in every movie : feel ourselves further into a movie.That being said, I can't wait to see Gravity at home, and feel a little bit nervous about what it'll be on a small screen...",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
It's like nothing I've ever watched,"I walked into this picture not knowing what to expect. On the one hand I'd seen the trailer which truly whet my appetite. On the other I'd heard various critiques from people saying the film was boring/unrealistic.Well let's just say it leaned towards the first hand for me. From the opening scene you realise how beautiful this film is going to be as the camera pans round Earth in the background. I hate the use of 3D in films, the glasses annoy me, it's more expensive, and most of the time its completely unnecessary. Not in this film. The 3D is used in a way which literally means you feel like part of the film.In the main I'd say the majority of the attraction to this film would be for the way it's shot and the excellent use of 3D. That's not to discount the story though.I've heard/read a lot of people doubting the believability of what happens, well don't listen to them. Don't get me wrong most of the time I'm a stickler for believability but not here. I don't profess to know anything about the physics of space, the general layout of space, or if what Ryan does up there is truly possible. Neither do I have any idea about the inside of a spacecraft or whether there are similarities between say, the Russian and Chinese(which doesn't yet exist) escape pods. So why question it? Miracles happen on Earth every now and again comparable to her feat. In any case I'd rather watch what was set out before me than for instance, Ryan and the rest of the crew being killed in the initial debris hit. Boom, ten minutes, film over.On to the story. From the very opening scene the tension starts to build and doesn't cease until the final minutes of the film. I don't want to give anything away so I won't go into it but every time you begin to feel comfortable this film throws another curve ball at you. It's also emotionally powerful, in one scene Ryan breaks down and begins to hallucinate. Then using her vision as motivation to continue and fight on. You've got the whole package here, action, drama and something for everybody in general. In fact there is only one criticism I'd direct at the film and that is the comparatively thin storyline, why the hell is she actually up there!!!!If I put the experience into one sentence that sentence would be, 'It's like nothing I've ever watched'. In my eyes a very apt title for this review. All in all it's a unique cinematic experience I'd recommend to anybody.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Simplicity and monumentality rarely seen in today's CG movies,"Amid the piles of kitsch and cramming, Gravity brings some fresh air in Hollywood through its simplicity. One of the best representations of Space in the history of cinematography further enriched with long uninterrupted shots (the opening shot lasts some 20 minutes!), complementary ''auditive landscapes'' and monumental pictures which create an outstanding experience. Despite some clichéd situations in the scenario, the bare fact that the actress is the central figure for the most part of the film, that there is no a forcibly imposed love story, without an excess of pathos, additional characters and explosions..., we can conclude that it's a miracle that such a CG film has happened in nowadays Hollywood.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular!,"This is possibly one of the most amazing movies of this decade. Not only does it have a compelling story line (and no, I didn't think it was slow), but from a technology point of view, the most amazing use of IMAX and 3-D technologies ever. And if Sandra Bullock doesn't get an Acadamy nod for her performance, I'll be even more surprised than when Barbara Streisand didn't get a nod for ""The Mirror Has Two Faces"".The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars is that there were a couple of technical goofs, but really, that is a mere quibble. Even knowing they existed didn't affect my suspension of disbelief one iota. It is the closest most of us will ever come to experiencing space.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Thoughtful, breathtaking, ground breaking and a thrilling adventure ride.","Like ""Avatar"" this is a movie unlike anything you may have see before.Following an extensive tracking shot in space, we meet Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). Dr Stone is a medical engineer completing repairs, on a mechanical arm attached to the space shuttle, in orbit hundreds of miles above the earth.Jet packing around like a middle aged Buzz Lightyear is Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). Whilst defiantly attempting to break the space walk record, Matt still finds time to trash talk and listen to music whilst floating free above the earth.We get to hear mission control and all is well until suddenly, not so much any more. Debris from a ricocheting satellite is heading the astronauts way and it's travelling fast.Houston we most definitely have a problem, events then start to escalate fast with some spectacular destruction. If the debris does not get you on the first pass, it will be back after a ninety minute orbit, perfect movie suspense material.We then follow the only two characters we really get to meet, as they struggle against adversity and an unforgiving environment as they attempt to survive.After a while you realise you are witnessing two actors to all intents and purposes acting within a zero gravity setting, even though you know that cannot be true. Once you accept this as the reality you are presented with, it is easy to jump aboard the roller-coaster ride the film then becomes.Despite being action packed and edge of the seat tense, all within a relatively short running time of 91 minutes, director Alfonso Cuaron finds time to innovate with some classic scenes. Dr Stone slowly rotating in a foetal position, tears floating away in zero gravity and globules of fire suspended in mid air, a few notable examples.The director makes good use of sound or lack thereof and on occasion, includes vertigo inducing, claustrophobic sequences that may have you staring at the floor in relief, as characters spin out of control into the infinite void of space.The story is simple but largely effective, how far would you go to survive when every natural element is attempting to kill you.The effects are unlike anything you may have seen before, the acting from Bullock is first rate, she may never have been better. It is good to see her back on the big screen and in such trim form.Negatives, Clooney does his usual shtick and is more casual than you might imagine the character would be. One also wonders why Stone is up there wielding a spanner in space, with the emotional baggage she is carrying.Ultimately whatever the ending, this is a life affirming film and most defiantly not science fiction, with alien monsters notably absent.How the film was achieved can be found elsewhere but within the acting constraints imposed, Cuaron has extracted an impressive performance from Bullock, who may yet trouble Oscar when the time comes around again.One of the years best and likely to prove a big box office hit if the early reception is anything to go, this may also be the closest most audiences get to experiencing real space in their life time.SummaryThoughtful, breathtaking, ground breaking and a thrilling adventure ride.Like it or hate it, you will not have seen anything like it before, this comes highly recommended especially on a big screen",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Edge of your seat from start to finish!,"There was actually one reveiwer that gave this film 1 star based on it being intellectually challenged and went on to write a book about how smart they were and how no one with an above average IQ would enjoy this film.

As an individual with above average IQ I can honestly say that I enjoyed this film immensely. The film did exactly what it was intended to do, keep me at the edge of my seat with intensified suspense! Only an egotistical mentality will cause one to overthink a sci-fi movie. Movies are for the purpose of entertainment, and I was thoroughly entertained by this film. High IQ or not, when someone gives a film of this quality a one star, it's not the problem of the film but the problem of the viewer. Plain and simple.

A different film!,"GRAVITY is a different film. At least it's not similar to any other movie I've ever seen and it clearly has some particular issues which turn it into a different and unusual film. Some of them are good, I would say even excellent, some of them are not so goodThe good things: GRAVITY setting is beautiful! The views of the Earth from outer space, the sunrise scene, the cosmonauts floating on space, all of this is done with beautiful images and scenes and with incredible CGI. The special effects are just amazing, superb, I would say! And I also did watch it in 3D and it was wonderful! A magnificent 3D experience, the best one I've had so far (I didn't watch too many films in 3D though). The acting by Sandra Bullock is great; she does an excellent job, but she's alone The soundtrack, it's also very good and every single track fits very well in the film.Now the bad issues: The plot! It's so tiny so little that it almost doesn't exist There's one plot in this film of course but it's so simple and short that I think that a movie with all this visual greatness and excellent CGI would deserve a better and more elaborated plot, even if it was around the same thematic! It could have been done with more characters, more subplots, etc I think it fell a bit too short that way (One example that this movie is too centred in the character performed by Sandra Bullock is when she arrives either on the ISS and the Chinese stations and there were nobody there, dead or alive! Why weren't there any cosmonauts? Did they were taking a walk on space? I don't think so :)So, together with some usual and typical Hollywood clichés, this lack of plot and the absence of other characters are the most let-downs in this movie to me.

A sci-fi thriller that doubles as film art,"I didn't know how to start this review. I thought I hate Sandra Bullock was a bit too harsh. Even though it's not far from the truth. Then I came up with I'm a movie hipster sometimes. But I've done that before. What could entice some to read this? I think I have your attention now with my honesty. I could go into my hearing about Gravity and then the trailers not doing it for me. Which is also true. But I haven't seen an Alfonso Cuaron film I didn't love. I'm not saying I loved Gravity. It was better than I expect. And a side note that come to play later, the ending was spoiled for me.The film follows an American crew in space as they do what astronauts do, do experiments and fix equipment. Chaos ensues when debris from a Russian satellite shoots their way. The crew scramble to find a way back to earth before the debris comes in contact with their ship. No spoilers, that is the plot of the entire film.These astronauts are dealing with a catastrophe in space. A movie like this in just about anyone else's hands would have a slow burn bore. Alfonso Cuaron doesn't make boring films. The man is an artist behind the lens. The first shot of the film last fifteen minutes long. It goes places I've never seen done in a sci-fi film. He comes up some ingenious angles and trickery.This is the first time that I can fully say the general movie going audience got it right. This is a movie that should make $200 million dollars or more. It's art at it's core. A small story about two people deal with adverse conditions trying not to die. The way the film is shot is unreal. The only sounds are voice and music. There is no sound in space. And I love sci-fi films in space shot that way.Cuaron puts the audience in space for 90 minutes. And I would happily go back. He pulls out great performances from Clooney and Bullock. Clooney is a bona fide movie star. He brings charisma and gravitas to nearly every role he takes. He plays the grizzled veteran so well. The story he tells at the start of the film makes me feel like I was there in space with them. It sucked me into his character and placed the tension high.I could watch a whole film with his character just telling stories. Bullock plays the rookie medical examiner on her first mission. Even not being a fan of hers you get why she's an Oscar winning actress. She goes through a range of emotions throughout the film that any less of an actress would haves failed early. But Cuaron makes sure we are on board with these characters before it hits the fan.What makes the film standout for me is the tension. I had the ending spoiled for me two weeks before I got to the sit down with the film. By the end of the film my nerves were shot and my hands clammy. That's what I call captivating your audience. The film looks so vivid and smooth. Cuaron is auteur and we should all celebrate his being on this planet. I can't wait for this man to take over the world with his film. I could only imagine what he could do with the horror drama or a superhero film. I'm still blown away about what a fantastic piece of art this film was.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding,"I watched this movie in 3D with very open mind as i haven't seen its trailer before watching it.This movie is best cinematic experience i have had after Avatar, seriously i don't prefer to watch movies in 3d but this movie have some serious 3d effect.During the whole movie I was sitting on the edge on my seat, definitely worth every penny watching it in cinema.Loved it. The music the cinematography, the effects all were just out of this world.This movie easily tops in to one of my favourite top 10 movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good Film, awesome effects, less talking please!","This was an incredible film visually, it kept you on the seat of your pants throughout. Sandra Bullock was a good fit to her part, George Clooney however was in no way believable as an Astronaut. Where the film was confident visually, the dialogue really did not help. I felt at the end as did my friend that it would have benefited from a lot less dialogue and back story which was not necessary at all and felt like a filler required for the majority audience. If the film had been filmed in a foreign language and I had not understood a word it would have had more impact. Great films that are suspenseful do not need dialogue to assist, it is in the quiet and with the music and sound and visual views that one really gains a sense of Space. The music was absolutely fantastic. A good film but perhaps could have benefited with a little less Hollywood style influences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"The most realistic space movie, ever!","Gravity is a thriller set in space. An astronaut named Matt Kowalski(George Clooney) & a doctor named Ryan Stone(Sandra Bullock) are stranded in space after their shuttle gets destroyed. Now, they have to survive at any cost in the harsh conditions of space.Gravity is the most visually stunning film, set in space. The events that take place in the film are believable & accurately depict what might happen if a person is drifting through space, without a shuttle or a space station, to go back to. The dangers that the two characters face, get repetitive after a point but, I was on the edge of my seat throughout. The 3D has been put to good use unlike some movies, that are converted to 3D just for the heck of it. The CGI is the highlight of the film. To create the entire Milky Way galaxy from a computer is just awe inspiring. A note on the performances. Sandra Bullock is outstanding as Ryan Stone. George Clooney is brilliant as Matt Kowalski.

Feeling sorry for those who missed the entire point of the film,"All the 1-star reviews from people massacring this for scientific inaccuracies and genius physics students crying about space not being represented ""correctly"" - I feel sorry for you.Did it ever cross your mind that this is actually a FICTION MOVIE, and not a documentary? do you look for ""inaccuracies"" when looking at a painting in a gallery?would it be such a betrayal to your intelligence to watch a movie that, yes, takes place in space, letting go of your expectations, science education, representation of the ""Genre"" (which? it's a drama film) and everything you have pre-determined to be the ""correct"" way this movie should be, and actually try to be open to the experience?if you give it a shot - you might change your mind.Cuarón is brave enough NOT to be scientifically accurate. he is an ARTIST.It's a visually stunning cinematic experience that keeps you on the edge for the entire duration of the film.It is directed to invoke the feeling of loneliness and helplessness in an unprecedented way.It brings out a surprising range of emotions all along the way.It's not a ""space movie"".It is a piece of art. and as such, it is stunningly executed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Lost potential,"Stunning visual effects and sound engineering. That alone would justify my vote of 7. However, this movie is a disgrace to the efforts of countless people who dedicate their bodies and intellect to make space flight possible.I will just point two things that made me feel uncomfortable, except from the occasional violations of the laws of physics.The character portrayed by Sandra Bullock has obvious psychological issues. She is clearly not fit for space flight and she never would have made it in the first place. That gives the impression that e.g. NASA is sending anyone on space, without scrutinizing physical and psychological tests.Reentry is NOT a piece of cake. Especially if you have an exploding space station and you rush to get to the escape pod without communication with the ground station. There are many variables to be calculated and there is definitely no AUTO PILOT button under these circumstances. What we see is a rotating flaming reentry pod --stops rotating after a while-- that manages to reach the ground --on it's feet-- without exploding.Stories don't NEED to have a happy ending. It would pay homage to logic and to the people that dedicated their lives for the sake of space exploration, if her attempt to reenter the atmosphere and land successfully was in her imagination.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rent-A-Review strikes again!,"I wonder what percentage of the budget was spent on reviews? Going off the glowing reviews I see here, my guess is that Rent-A-Review have been working overtime again.

I had even considered giving it 3 or maybe 4 out of 10 (based on the effects) but special effects don't make a movie, at least not for me, and all the special effects in the world won't change the fact that this movie is crap!I recently watched a time-lapse video of the earth, taken from the International Space Station, and I can categorically state, hand on heart, that the video from the ISS was far more entertaining than this pathetic offering.It's a sad day when this sorry excuse for a movie ranks higher than Blade Runner, which is arguably the best sci-fi movie of all time!

A breathtaking thrill ride that will renew your love of going to the movies.,"This year, there's yet to be a wide-released popcorn movie that succeeds in both complete originality and sheer mass enjoyment (excluding maybe ""This is the End""). With ""Gravity"", Cuaron has given movie-goers a reason to get excited, creating possibly the best space movie since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""Gravity"" is a breathtaking sci-fi thrill ride that will renew even the most cynical critic's faith in going to the movies. It follows two astronauts struggling to survive a disaster that occurs while working on the international space station. Outside of that, it's difficult to discuss the plot without spoiling the many turns the film takes. What can be revealed is that this is genuinely brilliant and brave filmmaking. In lesser hands, the awe-inspiring spectacle of the long uncut takes and the groundbreaking CGI would be an excuse to slack in other areas. Fortunately, Cuaron pulls zero punches with the butt-clenching tension and still manages to create a supremely personal film through the guise of an epic dilemma, with help from a particularly heart-wrenching performance from Bullock. There are some clichés I would like to apply here that, while overused, are totally applicable. ""Gravity"" is like riding a ride. ""Gravity"" is like no experience I've had at the movies. ""Gravity"" reminds us of why we go to the movies. Hackneyed as these statements may be, they are apt in describing ""Gravity"", the best film of the year.so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Everything you heard about this space thriller is true – it is a great piece of cinematic work,"If you have been reading movie new and reviews online, you'd probably know by now how everyone is raving about the greatness of Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's latest work. This review will tell you the same thing, but instead of gushing about visually stunning it is from the on start, let's begin by discussing how this writer is actually impressed with female lead Sandra Bullock's performance – for once.Don't get him wrong, this columnist has nothing against the Academy Award winner. His first encounter with the 49 year old actress was in 1994's Speed, but as anyone would kindly remind you, the attention was on a certain Keanu Reeves. The actress then went on to make a name in movies like Miss Congeniality (2000), Crash (2004) and The Lake House (2006). She finally won an Oscar for her role in The Blind Side (2009), which, with no offence intended, isn't a particularly outstanding performance, at least in this humble writer's opinion.It is with this space thriller that this reviewer is convinced that Bullock is a credible actress. She plays a medical engineer on her first outer space mission with a veteran astronaut. The first shuttle mission goes amok when a seemingly routine spacewalk becomes a disaster, leaving the shuttle destroyed and the two of them completely stranded and alone in outer space.You'd wonder, how much acting can Bullock showcase when she's in a space suit most of the time? Some clever scriptwriting will actually have her character out of the suit (in a body fitting tank top, no less) and impressing with her personable and surprisingly poignant performance as a grieving mother whose life is on a brink. We will not be surprised if she picks up acting nominations during the upcoming award season. There's nothing like giving recognition to the actress who has been working hard in showbiz starring in a hyped up film like this.Enough about Bullock for now, so what's in it for viewers who are interested in, to put simply, a good movie? Lots, apparently. You may have heard how this is the best space movie ever made, how this will leave you terrified and awed at the same time, and how it immerses you in an unforgettable viewing experience. Truth is, the statements are all spot on. Without sounding like a fan boy, we'll encourage you to experience this movie yourself. Although we didn't watch the film in IMAX3D format, we can assume it will be one memorable 91 minute movie you actually won't mind spending a few extra bucks on.Does Cuaron's (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men) cinematic masterpiece have emotionally affecting moments? While movies with characters reflecting on life whilst staring at death in the face are aplenty, this one works, probably due to the commendable performance by the leads.Yup, there is another cast member acting alongside Bullock, and he comes in the form of the irresistible George Clooney. While he plays a supporting character, you cannot deny the actor's screen presence. His every line in the movie will leave you assured that he is one dude you'd want at your party.And oh, do watch out for the sequence with floating tear drops. Trust us, they are even more awesome in 3D.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Cinematic Brilliance,"When I see a truly great movie it leaves me speechless. There's so much going through my mind. Because a great film is one that can't be taken at face value it inspires thought and leaves an imprint on you. At it's surface Gravity is a Hollywood popcorn movie about survival in space during a horrific accident but underneath it and most importantly it is a film about the human experience. From it's wonderfully entrancing opening shot Director Alfonso Cuaron immerses you in the environment of space. It's the closest experience many of us will get to actual space travel. We meet our central characters executing their assigned tasks and goofing off a bit, and than they get an emergency message that debris from a damaged satellite is heading towards them. It strikes with no sound, because there is no sound in space. it's a truly nightmarish sequence that leads to some of the most horrifying moments you've ever seen on screen. The film is a tour de force from beginning to end. A monumental technical achievement, terrifyingly beautiful but what makes this film so successful is in the way the heavy effects that drive the film blend with it's emotional core making for a truly engaging experience. When Sandra Bullock sheds her suit and floats in a fetal position you can feel the subtext of rebirth as well as finding the will to survive and echoes of that in the films conclusion. Gravity is a film about death but it's also a film about life and loss and the will to survive not just in the events that are happening on screen but everything that happens to us on a day to day basis. Director Alfonso Cuaron a master film maker directs the film with an eerie simplicity challenging us with nearly unbearable tension and delving deeper into something truly spiritual. George Clooney leaves a charismatic imprint in a small but important role and the central performance by Sandra Bullock is truly remarkable and quite possibly the best of her dramatic career. She's a definite shoe in for a best performance nod and anyone going against her will have a hard run of it. The movie flows like liquid cinematic poetry covering every inch with cinematic brilliance. Gravity isn't just one of the best films I've ever seen it's an amazing experience. *****/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Floating Home,"Right out of the gate, let me say that there's really not much you can do with a story like this.Script? Unless you want your audience to ignore the zillion dollar effects, don't worry too much about it. Stranded in space? Find a way to get home, however you can. It's supposed to be one of the ""great"" film premises and it always works.It works here. Bullock and Clooney do just what's needed, and Bullock's character takes center stage for most of the film. It was definitely worth watching, and yes a lot of it was definitely suspension of disbelief, but what is a film like this without those nick-of-the-moment scenes where disaster is averted.Bullock's desperation to get home definitely drives these moments nicely. The whole struggle of moving around properly with zero gravity is displayed nicely too. Clooney's devil-may-care fighter pilot attitude works well here.Twelve Years a Slave won best picture that year and this film is no competition for that masterpiece. The effects and cinematography were so superb that it really took the project to the top. It held my interest even if I had to wait through the slow parts.This film is not as bad as some say, and not spectacular either as some others say.

The new peak of filmmaking as a visual art-form.,"As a long-time follower of the human spaceflight programs I was looking forward to Gravity insanely much. My expectations were sky-high ;) and I was not disappointed. It is quite likely the most beautiful film I have ever seen.This is not a futuristic film. Unlike most space films it is based on real spacecraft and the chronology is just a little bit off with the mix of a Space Shuttle (retired), the Hubble Telescope (current), the International Space Station (current), and the Chinese space station Tiangong (projected). This is a portrayal of the work and risks that face actual astronauts right now. Sure, there are plenty of scientific inaccuracies to count, but all of them are rather minor and are there too provide creative freedom for the story to be a real tour-de-force. I'm willing to accept all of them except the one crucial plot point that is based on an annoying inaccuracy, but I will not spoil it for the reader, nor did it spoil my full appreciation of the film. After decades of seeing actors walk around in their spacecraft (with the small-scale exception of Apollo 13), here we have them floating around freely in a marvelous simulation of microgravity. Finally! Also, sound is not transferred through empty space. The only sounds heard in Gravity are the ones transmitted through matter or radio communication, so you get the strange new experience of silent explosions. The score does however break the illusion a bit, but it's a damn good score.Alfonso Cuarón shows that he is one of the few directors who knows how to use 3D technology to its full potential. I have repeatedly been disappointed to see that most Hollywood directors stick to their traditional formula of fast-paced cuts, not seeming to care how annoying this is to the viewers who constantly have to re-focus their eyes and lose the sensation of floating along with the action. Cuarón however knows that long takes is the stuff that dreams are made of. He got plenty of practice in his 2D masterpiece Children of Men (on which Emmanuel Lubezki also was the cinematographer), and even though Gravity is more reliant on CGI we are still treated to a number of astonishing long takes that sends us on a crazy roller-coaster ride that might just get you space-sick. This is how 3D should be used!The story has its flaws, but even they are minor. The plot is almost non-stop excitement and it manages to toy with my emotions on several occasions. The prospect of dying alone in the dark void sure comes through in all its scariness. George Clooney is steady as a rock and gives a great performance, but the big star is Sandra Bullock. As a rookie astronaut who struggles with all her strength, she uses her entire array of abilities and is just amazing. The backdrop of the Earth below is portrayed in its full breath-taking beauty, as is the starry sky above, and the detailed spacecraft in between. The motion of objects in microgravity and near-vacuum give us the rules of the game, and even people who aren't too well read on rocket science should be able to follow.This film is a visual delight and a pure show of state-of-the-art film making. It takes the audience on a wild ride just over the life-giving Earth which looks so close but is so far away for the poor space travelers who desperately struggle to survive. I highly recommend seeing Gravity at the cinema in 3D. It just won't be the same on your home screen. I've seen it twice so far and I just want to come back for more. I want Gravity to win a bunch of Oscars. Definitely for cinematography and visual effects. Hopefully also for acting, directing and best picture.

Gravity flies above and beyond,"Gravity is a perfect theatrical experience. The visual effects are incredible and Sandra Bullock's performance is impeccable.

The visuals are highly enthralling, making the audience feel the peril of drifting through space. The technical aspects are brilliantly accurate as a representation of survival in outer space. The cast and crew did a superb job crafting this movie, which will undoubtedly be recognized as a classic space film in years to come.

"Thrilling and accomplished, but not much else","So: GRAVITY. Acclaimed at Venice and TIFF; praised by critics everywhere; brought to us by visionary director Alfonso Cuarón; and starring two A-Listers who, bizarrely, have never worked together before. Also, while not all that science fiction-y, since most of this is pretty much possible within the bounds of humanity's current level of tech—which is, in itself, pretty amazing—the fact that this serendipitous confluence of filmmaker, film royalty and film festival fanfare should fall even remotely within our purview has made this movie, and its probable awesome, a hot topic around Geek Speak headquarters for months.Which is why I am sorry to report that it's just... it's just not that good.Oh, it is replete with simply breathtaking special effects, and the cinematography (or whatever passes for cinematography when most of your action takes place on a green screen) is top notch. GRAVITY is also a thrill-ride of fear and dread as our plucky, if annoyingly shrill, heroine (Sandra Bullock) and her only surviving astronaut colleague (George Clooney) are left adrift in space after satellite debris attacks their orbital position and kills anyone who has not won an Oscar. But if you've seen the movie BURIED, the one with Ryan Reynolds trapped in a cave-in on the phone to a calm-voiced company rep (and if you haven't, you should, it's great) then you will get the general gist here, except that BURIED doesn't burden us with pointless and torturously sentimental third act exposition about character backstory for no good reason at all. Everyone hated AFTER EARTH (and hey, I get it; those accents were awful), but it relied a lot on the same conceit. I'm not saying GRAVITY doesn't do it better. I'm just saying, GRAVITY is kind of like AFTER EARTH—which is, I'm guessing, something no one wanted to hear.The plot is a super simple one; so simple, in fact, that I already gave it to you in less than a sentence in the above paragraph. What remains is pretty much silence, and while that silence can be pulse-thumpingly terrifying and is used to good effect – because in space, no one can hear you scream... unless they're on the com – its cynical employment throughout is symptomatic of the film as a whole. It is all very effective, but it is not very affective. You will probably be entranced, immersed and enthralled from pretty much the outset (I'll concede, I certainly was), but when all is said and done, GRAVITY is as unrealistic, as cliché and as forgettable as any other popcorn action- horror flick – perhaps even more so. It's basically the cinematic equivalent of a carnival ride; Space Mountain, if it lasted for 90 minutes and got really boring towards the end. I think it's trying to be all metaphorical at its denouement, but honestly, when your subtext is written in such a large font, it goes from pointed allegory to outright laughable stupidity quicker than you can say ""No one ever taught me to pray."" (Not, by the way, the movie's cringe-iest line. There are a lot of contenders for that title – maybe it's a lost in translation thing? Like when hit Asian rom coms get Hollywood remakes and all the over-the- top humor is rendered bizarre? Because the overwrought periods of Cuarón Sr. and Jr. might not be out of place in a favorite ¡telenovela!, but they fit very uncomfortably here.) (Wait. Is that racist?)If you are planning to see GRAVITY – and I still think you should, if for no other reason than that everyone else will – then I suggest you do it while it is still in theaters, unless your home is equipped with a 3D projector and at least a twelve foot blank wall. Because this is a movie that is pretty much built for IMAX 3D, and without the additional element of visceral terror that comes from feeling like you, too, are hurtling through the inky black night accompanied only by the panicked (irritating) breathing of a stranded human rapidly losing hope of rescue, then this movie doesn't really have a lot to offer. It's rewatch quotient is pretty much zero, as well, so purchasing it on Blu-ray is simply out of the question, even if you do decide to watch it in your hypothetical kickass home entertainment room that I now totally want.You know what it is? George Clooney, as genial and handsome and charming as he is (and oh, he is; Bullock is excellent here, too, with way more screen time), should just stay the hell out of space. I won't say he should stay out of our genre, because THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS! FROM DUSK TILL DAWN! Hell, even SPY KIDS! But considering SOLARIS and now this, I think it is time to revoke his off-world privileges, much as his superhero license was surely incinerated after his ill-fated stint as Batman.And as for Alfonso Cuarón – he's a truly great director who should stick to putting other people's big ideas up on the big screen. CHILDREN OF MEN was a triumph of adaptation, a movie that not only had something to say but said it beautifully. Here, the message, if such there be, is lost in the CGI, and all the while the Laws of Physics are treated like they are made of Play-Doh, which is especially ironic, given the title. GRAVITY is lots and lots of style, but not much substance, and once you leave the theater and your pulse rate returns to normal, it's difficult to recall exactly what had you so excited to begin with.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Pure Cinema,"Fledgling astronaut Dr Ryan Stone (Bullock) ventures to the stars to upgrade the Hubble Telescope, she is accompanied by an experienced team of astronauts including veteran space-jockey Matt Kowalski (Clooney) . Suddenly a freak accident leads to Earth's entire orbit being littered with deadly debris . As events unfold an otherwise everyday mission becomes something quite out of the ordinary, a desperate journey of survival across the vacuum of space.From the opening moment of Gravity, it becomes abundantly clear that it is an exceptional film. There will be an awful lot said about the technical brilliance of the sound, effects and cinematography of this film because all are quite unfathomable and enthralling. Camera movements are artfully seamless, graceful and sweeping, the viewer is effortlessly transported between the third person view where weightless objects career towards them, seconds later only to find themselves in the first person seeing though Ryan's panicking eyes her hyperventilating breath clouding her visor.The technical wonder involved here is not what makes Gravity a truly great film however, it is simply a tool that allows the viewer to very quickly and effectively build empathy with the characters, and their plight. Ryan and Matt are likable characters, they are very human, genuine and flawed. They are believable to the extent that any technical mastery involved takes a back seat to the narrative and characterisation. For this is a film with a lot of heart and soul the themes are big, metaphysical and distinctly attached to the concept of what it means to be human.Gravity is a film made for cinema and 3D, and this is the way it should be seen if you wish to see it at it's best, for no reason more complicated than because it is quite simply beautiful. Because of the themes involved here, Gravity will probably not be suitable for younger children. Anybody else though is sure to take something positive from the experience of watching it and I suggest that you all do just that at your earliest convenience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good but not great, like I hoped","Gravity attempts to portray what astronauts would actually encounter on space missions, how space walks would actually unfold, and the hostility of the environment of space towards anything resembling Earthling life.The ninety or so minutes of Gravity are the linear unfolding of a series of destructive events in the lives of Astronauts Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Kowalski (George Clooney). Director's Alfonso Cuarón's hones in on these destructive events, treating them as a single, passing moment in time. A moment of crisis.As far as doing anything in space is ever considered routine, Gravity opens with a group of astronauts undertaking what seem to be standard, routine repairs to the outside of their ship. The tone is jovial, if not a little tense as Clooney zips around the ship's vicinity with a jet pack jokingly. He wants to break the current space walk record of seventy-five minutes. But Mission Control suddenly issues a warning. A massive field of space debris is headed straight for them.From here on, only chaos reigns as Cuarón begins to eliminate all probable positive outcomes, one by one. After the astronaut's ship is destroyed beyond repair Ryan and Kowalski attempt to propel themselves a floatable distance to a space station. As they push forward through space's vacuum, towards their beacon of hope, space's vastness and hostility are emphasized, along with their minisculity; ""I hate space,"" says Ryan somewhat lightheartedly. This comes after she has just been precariously saved from a perpetual spinning away into deep space, a particularly claustrophobic moment of the film,or rather, a moment in the extreme of claustrophobia's exact opposite.Gravity has all the individual parts of a film rated high, near a 10, but once the parts are assembled, the whole is not equal to the parts. Even though the film is shot in space, and is set to depict a realistic portrayal of how events like these could take place, the film is really just about Ryan, a single human's struggle to survive, and then with this revelation the epic space setting becomes incidental.Problem: Ryan is not an interesting character. She seems ill prepared for such a dangerous space mission, and when she talks about her daughter, in a moment that I assume is used to attempt to ground the film in reality by showing us the why, we don't care about her daughter. The current situation at hand is much more interesting. Including this talk about life back home was a mistake that took me out of the moment. I don't care about Earth here; I care about this amazing crisis taking place just above Earth. A space movie should emphasize themes bigger than the individual. The mission should be more important than the life of the astronaut. Simply making it back to Earth alive is not an exciting enough conclusion.Although maybe the best of her career, Bullock still delivers a subpar portrayal of a character that is herself subpar. I loved Cuarón's Children of Men and I feel here Cuarón's work is great. From a technical perspective, Cuarón's filmmaking is incredible, the cinematography stunning, the portrayal of space amazing, so what went wrong? Besides a storyline that fails to transcend human matters, a factor that Cuarón may have been able to gloss over under different circumstances, when a film centers on a single actor, and that actor is Sandra Bullock, to quote Yeats, ""Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.""

Stone is pulled away from the space shuttle by gravity. Her radio, the only source of communication, cuts in and out throwing Stone into a panic attack which gobbles up her oxygen. Just when we think gravity might take over, Kowalski finds her afloat and brings her back to base.There's no such thing as ""home base"" in space, especially when the space shuttle and the handful of extras are found dead. With limited oxygen, Kowalski and Stone make it to another air craft. A cord wraps around Stone's foot causing a major catastrophe. As the plot progresses in this Science Fiction thriller, the same rope that once saves Stone's life threatens it. Trying to escape a catastrophic fire, Stone cleverly rides a fire extinguisher like a heat-seeking-missile from one space craft to another. Just when you think she might be safe to return to earth, another crisis erupts. And, the climatic approach throughout Gravity lasts until the very end, when you as the viewer, realize that after watching Gravity, a vacation from life is in order.Gravity is an epic force of nature. It's much like Danny Boyle's (2010) 127 Hours. James Franco's character, Aron Rolston, is biking through a canyon and falls victim to a boulder in the smallest possible crack in the earth. Rolston resorts to desperate measures in order to survive. Both, Gravity and 127 Hours have simplistic story lines, but are filled with action/adventure scenarios in which the audience is left with the Oh. My. God. expression. I watch with such intensity, only to be left with an exasperation of relief at the very end. When a plot is centered around a person as the protagonist and mother nature as the antagonist, 99 percent of the time mother nature wins. What happens to those who are clumped in the one percent tile?I'll tell you...It drives an original masterpiece into the stratosphere begging in $55.8 million opening weekend, and ranking Gravity as the number one film in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
I think it's overrated,"I really didn't like this movie THAT much. It's good but as 7.0/10, not much more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Are you freaks joking?,"If you have a logical intelligence quote over 75 then you will most likely find this movie to be totally rubbish.The movie is almost from start to end filled with things that not in a million light years ever would occur, but if such things disturb you, then perhaps you can find something good out of this movie.. but then i ask myself what should that be? since nothing else but just that. how this movie got 8.5 here is to me a huge mystery. I really don't find the characters even close to be somewhat trustworthy either, what normal person would trapped in space crack jokes and laugh like they were having a drink on the french coast? I want my money back Br Thomas",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
An artistic triumph,"It is my prediction that this film will go down not as one of the best films of this year, but of any year. This film sets out and achieves the remarkable task of riding along with Dr. Ryan and looking out through her eyes as she works through external and internal challenges. Direct, spare, intelligent and triumphant. Movies have, in my humble opinion, been relegated to the exploitive and/or nakedly commercial. Stallone and De Niro star in predictable vehicles that look like excuses to pay off their vacation homes. Gravity, on the other hand, is a tight, tense, work of beauty and power. Tension and release - the elements of music, and humor and all great art. I cannot recall a film that created such a powerful experience for the viewer. There should have been seat belts in the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Didn't deserve the Oscars???,"I am reading some reviewers that say it didn't deserve the Oscars (SEVEN of them), have you ever said ""he didn't deserve the touchdown"", he just got it PERIOD, the movie IS A JEWEL, no more no less, an extraordinary achievement in many levels, the story is minimalistic (not thin, not simplistic), the acting is top notch, the visual effects are incredible, the music and the sound are excellent, I was on the edge of my seat the whole 90 minutes, I have seen more than 2,000 movies in my life, this movie is at my top three, that is how good it is, Alfonso Cuaron films include Little Princess, Y Tu Mama Tambien, Great Expectations, Children of Men, Solo Con Tu Pareja, he has grown over this years to become one of the Greatest Directors of our time, I strongly recommend you to see this film, preferably in 3D at a theater, sadly Im not sure if you are going to like it, it depends on your movie preferences.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
Gravity will pull you up!,"Have you ever been to space? I don't think so, but Gravity will give you the opportunity to get the same experience like you do in space! This space drama is one of the best space movies ever done! With outstanding visual effects and awesome 3D effects, this movie will let you see the beauty of our very Earth. Not only the visual effects are extraordinary, also the acting done by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are done perfectly. Bullock portrays Dr. Ryan Stone and Clooney portrays Astronaut Matt Kowalski, both trying to get back to Earth when their space-shuttle is destroyed by debris from a destroy satellite. The tense that is created during the movie is indescribable. You are being pulled into the story and set to get sweaty hands when the debris hits the space shuttle and comes back every 90 minutes. Director, writer and producer Alfonso Cuarón has created a spectacle which can be written in the history books as epic!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Masala Story is nothing to write home about, still go and watch in 3D if you want to experience outer space","The 3D and experience of outer space is quite realistic and this is the reason I had gone to the movie.The story is not great and there are a lot of instances of forced co- incidence and contrived situations. Reality is boring - I know - but this was a bit on the high side. However the movie does show that space is not as glamorous as it is made out to be, and it can be a dangerous and lonely place.Being from a science background, I could not help but remember Newtons 3 laws of motion, especially how the 1st one is illustrated quite well - objects keep moving in perpetual motion merrily in a constant perpetual merry-go-round.Bottomline: Go if you want to experience space in 3D with a little bit of story to it, however do not go for the story alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A Chilling, Heart-Pounding, and Unbelievable ride","Score Disclaimer: I want to give this film a 10, but I will wait until I see it again for a second opinion.Gravity is an incredible film. Absolutely incredible. Peerless in direction, Gravity features career defining performances from Bullock and Clooney, absolutely stunning, top-notch special effects and incredibly effective drama that brings this seemingly simplistic idea and narrative to life. But above all, Gravity is the most fantastic space movie ever made.Gravity is filled with visual splendor, and packed with layers of metaphor and meaning (much of which I am still debating with colleagues on)! I haven't come out of a film for a long while equally blown away and perplexed, in a good way of course. I love films that are appreciable by both audiences: those looking for entertainment (Which they will receive in spades), and those looking for a film that transcends being a film in the sleekest of ways. Other elements of the film are peerless; the cinematography is beautiful, the minimalist score is effective, and the sound design is perfected.It's hard to describe my feelings towards Gravity without abusing my ""positive adjective"" collection, but I'll just say the Gravity is pretty darned close to perfect. It's original, intense and very entertaining. It's also highly re-watchable with a purpose; it's packed with genius and beauty.This is one perilous journey I personally want to experience over and over, deciphering it's layers and themes. It will forever stick in my memory. A one of a kind, incredibly exceptional experience.Side note: 3D usage transcends Avatar and my personal favorite of the summer Pacific Rim. It's essential to the experience, and proves to be one of the finest in-theater experiences ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
A passionless review.,"There are too many reviews on this film that either hate it or love it. I don't agree with either.Direction and Cinematography: Very good.Music and sound effects: Very good.Story and plot: Good, suspenseful but with flaws. This type of film could have gone for 100% realistic and strive for perfection, rather than try and be 50% realistic and 50% Hollywood-fun-but-fake, so as to try to allure audiences from both sides.Acting: I have to say mediocre. I can't but compare Sandra Bullock to Sigourney Weaver in Alien. A strong female battles for survival. Well let's just say I wish this film was made back in the 80's.To be fair Bullock is very good in the movement part of her role.P.S. No way is this the best film made in space Mr Cameron!",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
What am I not getting here?,"I cannot figure out what all the hype is about this movie. My husband and I took in a double feature today, Gravity being one of them, and we both agreed that it left much to be desired.Aside from the beautiful visual effects, the acting was mundane, the writing was insipid, the story was predictable. It was not 'edge of my seat' in the least.I don't mean to insult people who 'loved' the movie or who think it was 'one of the best made' but really?!? And I don't think it's right to be condescending by asking if people who didn't like Gravity were ones who liked Transformers or Avatar. (never saw Transformers and Avatar was not much better than Gravity)In my opinion, I don't think Gravity even compares to great movies such as Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Slumdog Millionaire, The Usual Suspects, The Departed, ... just to name a few.I should have gone with my gut, saved $30 and waited for the DVD release.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Citizen Kane"" for a new-age","Citizen Kane was groundbreaking for many reasons. and is still considered one of (if not the best) films ever made, simply for it's use of camera work, cinematography and style. Gravity pulls you down to it's point of view from the very beginning. Alfonso Cuaron uses his style of camera work that makes the entire film seem like it was made in one long shot, never giving the viewer a second to catch their breath. I have never left a film before wondering ""How did they film that?"" The writing and special effects were also incredible. This is one of the rare films that MUST be seen in 3D, otherwise you just wont get the effect of the film in it's entirety. One of the best films I have ever seen. *10/10*",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
One Word: Breathtaking,"I had the pleasure of seeing this movie on opening night. It was absolutely astonishing from start to finish. Visually stunning, mind-bendingly realistic, and an all around adrenaline rush. My only complaint is that it seemed to be over too quickly. Which can be both good and bad. Good, because it was the perfect length. Bad, because I didn't want it to be over. Seriously, all in all, this is probably the best space movie I have ever seen.If you haven't gathered it by now, I HIGHLY recommend this film. One of the best films I've seen all year. But, be warned, this film will suck you in the second the opening title leaves the screen. If it's not the incredible acting that does it, it's the jaw-dropping and stunning visuals.If you do go see 'Gravity' (you really should), I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films of the year....,"Me and 3D have never really got along. There isn't a lot of love there. When choosing between watching a film in 2D and 3D, I've always chosen the former, and always will do. But, sometimes, films come along that force you to choose 3D. Avatar for one – I fell asleep halfway through. Life Of Pi – pretty but needless. In short, I've never been blown away by it. IMAX is the future, in my opinion, but bloody expensive. 3D? it's a fad that will go away, just give it a few years.But, I implore you. Go and watch Gravity. And make sure you watch it in glorious 3D.Gravity, for those that don't know, is the new film from Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron. Truth be told, I wasn't too aware of the name, but he has made some fantastic films in the past (Y Tu Mama Tambien; Children Of Men; Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban, to name a few). All of his best films have the same thing in common – visually, they're a treat to watch. One of the most powerful moments of Children Of Men, for example, is when blood splatters across the screen and just stays there on the lens. With this new film, though, Cuaron takes that talent to a whole new level.The film is unlike any other I have ever seen. Visually and viscerally, from the very first scene, it's a stunning watch. Very many excellent films have been made in the past about space, but Gravity is the first time that a movie actually takes advantage of the sheer distance and nothingness that space provides. It's full of beautiful long-shots, moving over the Earth, the stars, the space stations and debris around the place, and the people themselves. It's jawdropping; but as beautiful as it is, it's amazing just how terrifying it also becomes. As Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) hurtles helplessly through space, spinning uncontrollably and screaming for help, I was frightened. That fright was heightened by the use of 3D; this wasn't just objects needlessly flying off the screen at me; the 3D tricks were in context and meant something.Thankfully, what Cuaron manages to do very well is supplement the visuals with a very solid and emotional story. Bullock's character has gotten literally lost in space and is desperate to get home. But this is not just your usual sci-fi adventure flick – this is an emotional tale about hope, faith and (beyond all) the idea of letting go. Whether it's letting go of a traumatic experience, or simply letting go of a wire, it's a theme that runs throughout the movie and eventually sets us up for the exciting final third.At the heart of it is Sandra Bullock herself – as Ryan Stone, the veteran actress provides yet another excellent performance. You quickly forget that it's Bullock, so immersed she becomes in the role. Once again, the 3D plays a big part here; as she floats through space, we become her eyes, therefore creating a bigger bond between actor and audience.But while one actor enhances the film, the other one did a helluva job trying to bring it down. That's right – George Clooney. Now, I love Clooney, I think he's a wonderful actor and you can't help loving that Hollywood charm. Gravity, however, was not the vehicle for this charm. I found the character irritating and completely out of place. I understood the need for the role of Matt Kowalski, but perhaps with a different personality.The one-dimensional supporting character was made even more irritable because of the unintelligent script. A lot of the dialogue here was hokey and full of cliché, which was a little bit annoying. It wouldn't have been so annoying, had the other facets of the film not been so brilliant. They were, though, and I wish the script had been too.However, overall, Gravity is still a fantastic film. Clooney's performance really isn't that important in the grand scheme of things, and you're not going to watch this film for the great script. You should be watching Gravity for its ground-breaking use of special effects, it's changing of the way science fiction and 3D will be viewed in the future, and it's engaging story and strong central performance.Gravity is one of the best films of the year, and one of the best sci-fi movies in the last five years. Watch it. In 3D.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
best movie a must watch,"Two astronauts floating in space - how could that possibly be a concept for one of the most riveting films I have ever seen, and be deserving of the adjectives mentioned in this review's title? And yet Gravity is without doubt one of the most absorbing, don't-look-away-can't-look-away films I've seen for a long time. There are some films (good, entertaining films) that you just watch. Then there are those rare films which have the power to draw you in and make you forget you are WATCHING. Instead, you are EXPERIENCING. That's Gravity. Apart from the astonishing, beautiful and epic scale of the film, with directorial and photographic moments reminiscent of David Lean and Stanley Kubrick, the original script will keep you guessing all the way to the final frame of film. Both actors give solid, convincing performances, but Sandra Bullock has finally been given a part capable of revealing her real talent. Her character has real depth, and (by some truly brilliant directorial techniques), you become completely empathic with her. Finally, one hopes, she may get that Best Actress Oscar that's missing from her award cabinet. ... and when a space film gets the seal of authenticity from ISS astronauts and NASA, it can't be THAT bad!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Sci-Fi"
