dank you veddy much,"I've been an Andy Kaufman fan for quite a while now. True, I was around six when Andy died. But somehow this strange man was able to affect both my work and outlook. So needless to say I was looking forward to this film. And I was not disappointed.Critics complain that while engaging, this film does not let the viewer in on who exactly Kaufman was. It's simple: there was no real Andy Kaufman. He was socially inept, utterly brilliant, and a strange and distant individual. His sense of humor (if he even had one) was not for everyone to understand. THAT WAS THE POINT. So why should a film spoil the mystery? MAN ON THE MOON was as an homage to Andy, NOT an explanation, and far better than those dull, lifeless documentaries on E! or comedy central in which uninteresting comedians try to explain why Andy was brilliant. It's common knowledge that explaining a joke renders it humorous (a notion that Andy toyed with in his Foreign Man routine, remember?)True, some facts were altered for dramatic purposes (though the truth is just as interesting), or maybe just necessity, but the base story is still pretty accurate. Some of the more humorous moments in Kaufman's career were not mentioned (i.e. his stints on Johnny Carson and David Letterman, his work with performance artist Laurie Anderson, his street corner preaching). But lets face it, everything couldn't and didn't need to be included. The film is capable of capturing the essence of Kaufman's world. If you want to see everything Kaufman did, find a recording of it and watch that.Carrey is brilliant as Kaufman. Some call it an imitation, though that seems overly simplified and absurd. That was an imitation along the lines of Geoffrey Rush in SHINE, or Hilary Swank in BOYS DON'T CRY, or Richard Farnsworth in THE STRAIGHT STORY. Sure, Carrey observes and uses the many Kaufman quirks without a fault, but his observation goes far beyond what any other actor seems capable of. Carrey is Andy Kaufman. So many seem unwilling to admit that Carrey can act.Taken on it's own, MAN ON THE MOON is a magical, funny, and wonderful film. Taken with the rest of the sources currently available on Andy Kaufman, this is just another facet to a complex career and an homage to a brilliant man.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Man on The Moon, indeed.","""Man on The Moon"", indeed. I remember seeing Andy Kaufman's act on TV as a teenager, and I admit, I wrote him off as another comedian, with an incredibly expressive face and a flair for silliness. Years later, I'm watching him on ""Taxi"" reruns. I admired the easiness where he could go from loving Latka to malicious Vic with ease, and I thought, ""Wow, this guy really loves what he does"". And then I watch ""Man on The Moon"". Reality check.This picture, I believe, redeems Andy Kaufman. He endured five grueling years in ""Taxi"" just so he could get some laughs out of people. He did wrestling stints just for the heck of it. He came real close of hitting rock bottom just to save himself at the end. He died of cancer at the age of 35, ridiculously young, and even then his own family didn't buy it. He lived misunderstood, and died misunderstood. And years later, he gets a biopic. Just what he deserves. It is sad that many people will know Andy's talent and understand him only after watching this film. But still, let's face it, at the end he did get the last laugh.The true cornerstone in this film is Jim Carrey. Yes, you've heard endless reviews about him immersing himself into Andy, not just playing him. But this is acting beyond your dreams, trust me. Especially when he plays Andy's foreign character, Carrey lived and breathed Kaufman air. This is the movie where his silly-putty face comes handy, as it seems to help Jim turn into Andy. (If only we could do something about those teeth...) NEWSFLASH FOR THE ACADEMY: Jim Carrey can act!!! I remember Tom Hanks beginning with the same kind of movies that Jim did: loud, colorful, goofy and silly (films like ""Bachelor Party"" come to mind). Then he did ""Big"", then came ""Philadelphia"". When is Carrey's ""Philadelphia"" coming along? I can't wait to see him at the Academy Awards this year.Man on the moon, indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fascinating Bio Of A Strange, Strange Man","Biographies of strange people have always fascinated me, and this is no exception. And ""strange"" doesn't really seem to adequately describe real-life comedian Andy Kauffman. He was REALLY different, many times very offensive, sometimes very unfunny....but always extremely interesting and certainly unique.Jim Carrey shows us once again how comedians can be such good dramatic actors. Carrey is outstanding in this role, and perfect for it. The rest of the cast is good, too, from Danny DeVito to Paul Giamatti to Courtney Love.Right from the beginning of this movie one sees how original it is, and how original Kaufman was as a comedian. His routines, antics and put-ons are so realistically done that no thinks they are just that. Unfortunately, his ""jokes"" don't always go over so well, aren't appreciated by most audiences and he is not always the most likable entertainer you will ever see. That means - be forewarned - that there are a number of unpleasant scenes in this film. You have to really appreciate Kauffman's absurd humor and to appreciate Carrey's great portrait of this man.On multiple viewings (I've seen it four times) I liked this film even more than the first time, even though I knew the surprises. I don't know of any comedian - to this day - who deliberately tried to annoy his audience or truly liked it when his audience hated him. I cannot believe he had the nerve to do the things he did. In summary, this is a fascinating biography, to say the least.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is a story about a man who lived and died without being understood.,"It is truly sad that we have to wait until a person is dead and gone to give him or her the honor they should have received while alive.  Andy Kaufman was a man of many talents, and I saw him only as this funny little man on a TV show called, ""Taxi"" with a cute accent.  Who could not fall in love with that person he was on ""Taxi""?  He was cute, honest, kind, and funny!  Who knew that while we were all at home laughing, he was crying on the inside because that wasn't who he was, nor wanted to be.  I went to see this movie about a person who was famous for his ""Elvis"" personation, and his little record player, doing the ""Mighty Mouse"" skit on Saturday Night Live, never to forget ""Latka"" on ""Taxi.""  He was a man of many talents, so many that the world never knew about, so many that only Andy knew who he really was.  Jim Carrey allowed us to come into Andy Kaufman's mind, and realize that this grown man lived in another place, another time, an entire other world where Andy was free, and there was peace, and where everyone never grew up, they stayed children playing ""pretend"" forever.Jim Carrey put himself into this part, he lived this role...  He was Andy Kaufman.  Carrey was able to show me a whole new light on this man I thought I knew.  This funny man who could make you laugh just by walking on stage.  Jim Carrey showed us that who we saw, was not the man we thought we knew.  And it took his death to show the world that Andy Kaufman was in fact a human being, who just needed a hug, and a chance at what he did best.This sadness me to realize that our joy brought this man pain, who we wanted was not who he wanted to be, and I think everyone should be able to live the dream they choose. I never cry at movies, because I am able to pull myself back and remind myself that it is just a movie, and those are just actors.  Jim was Andy, and what I saw was too true for me to tell myself, ""It's only a movie.""This is a story about a man who lived and died without being understood.  I cry for the person Carrey brought us into, the life he showed us that was hidden for too long.  No one could have given Andy such a life as Carrey did.  This movie is not a normal movie, it is art in the most beautiful form imaginable.  To sit in a theater and be at aw... for two hours is amazing! I only wish we had known Andy Kaufman when he was truly alive.  Now it is too late, the curtain has gone down...",,Anonymous,Biography
Just great,"Jim Carrey delivers on of the greatest acting achievements of the nineties in this stunning biopic about the legendary comedian Andy Kaufman (the man on the moon, according to REM). For me as a European citizen, Andy Kaufman is a complete mystery. I've never seen any of his performances in Saturday Night Live nor have I ever seen any of his live shows. After seeing the movie five times, I as a Dutch not-knowing citizen who had never heard of Kaufman before, can make an image of the man and his brilliance. This is all thanks to Milos Forman and a stunning Jim Carrey, who really becomes Andy Kaufman. According to me, this movie is where Jim Carrey proves that he is just more than a funny guy, and after seeing him in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) Carrey has really proved that he is in fact a character actor.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fair movie, but poor biography","I watched this movie already knowing quite a bit about Andy Kaufman and the things that he has done in the past. I was hoping to learn more about him after watching this movie. Unfortunately, I knew more about Andy Kaufman than this movie told me. As a biography, this movie wasn't so great. It didn't go into much about Andy's childhood or what he was like outside of work. Rather, it showed most of the skits and performances that Andy has done throughout his life, most of which you could learn about on MTV specials.The acting was well done, especially by the star Jim Carrey. Carrey played Andy Kaufman. This was by far the best acting job I have ever seen Jim Carrey perform. One could argue he did a better job at Andy Kaufman's skits than Andy Kaufman himself did.The plot and storyline, if not looking from a biography point of view, was very interesting. The best thing, in my opinion about the movie is learning more about how Andy Kaufman met his girlfriend, the scenes from Taxi and his wrestling career. I didn't care much for Tony Clifton but, as the movie states, he is a different person from Andy Kaufman all together.I'd say this movie is worth a rent, don't go to theaters to see it. Jim Carrey deserves an Academy Award for his performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A stunning film, with an equally stunning performance by Jim Carrey","I saw a special sneak preview of ""Man on the Moon"" last week in Boston. Quite simply, the film is magnificent, and truly provides the audience with a glimpse into the genius of Andy Kaufman.  There are moments of true hilarity, and moments that will break your heart.Of course, this film would be nothing without the inspired performance by Jim Carrey.  Within the first moments of the film, you completely forget that it is Jim Carrey on screen.  Rarely have I seen an actor truly transform into the persona that he is portraying.  Jim Carrey was Andy Kaufman.At the very least, Mr. Carrey is deserving of every honor that is given in acting. No other performance this year comes even close to this.  Without question, this is a film for the ages, and gives everyone a look into the mind of a genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Decent,"I'd consider myself a Kaufman fan. I always admired the guts he had to live his life the way he did. Watched Latka on Taxi, watched some of his performances, and even read his biography along with Bob Zmuda's best friend tells all book. The Zmuda book I took with a grain of salt but it was entertaining.I thought Carrey did well enough trying to portray Andy. But what always struck me most about Andy were his big blue eyes. Jim's are dark brown. He had some of Andy's mannerisms down but seemed a little too effeminate for Andy. I don't know if that's the right word?It's a decent watch not outstanding. I might add though the film took some liberties in the time line of events in Andy's career. The Carnegie Hall concert didn't take place right after his cancer diagnosis. I'll leave it there",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Man on the Moon is a strong film with an excellent performance by Jim Carrey,"Man on the Moon is one of the most heart-felt endeavors I've ever seen on film.  With each frame, you can feel how much the project means personally to all involved, especially to star Jim Carrey and producer Bob Zmuda. Although personal adoration for the subject of one's movie does not always translate into a film that audience members will identify with, Man on the Moon succeeds brilliantly.  Between Milos Forman's unique directing style, the actors' performances, and Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski's writing, the film is able to simultaneously make you a member in one of Andy Kaufman's audiences, experiencing both joy and frustration at his antics, and a close friend who sees, or thinks they see, the Andy Kaufman behind the masks. Just as Karaszewski and Alexander did with the Ed Wood or Larry Flint biopicks, they challenge our concept of what it means to be successful by giving dignity to to the seeming misfits of our society.  However, a biopick like Man on the Moon succeeds or fails mainly on the grounds of the lead performance.  Jim Carrey proved his dramatic talent last year with a performance in The Truman Show that should have translated into an Oscar, and this year he again gives what will likely be the best performance of the year.  Carrey approaches the role of Kaufman with a level of professionalism and enthusiasm far greater than that displayed by many of today's acclaimed actors.  Carrey adopts Kaufman's mannerisms flawlessly and becomes Kaufman so convincingly that you forget Carrey is acting.  The film's other stars, in particular Paul Giamatti, Courtney Love, and Danny DeVito, all turn in excellent performances as well.Man on the Moon is both inspiring and thought provoking - a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, but not deserving of the hype.","This was basically a summary of what Kaufman was famous for.  It didn't dig that deep into Kaufman's life - and completely glossed over some points (but that's understandable).  Unfortunately, it wasn't particularly funny, nor was it particularly introspective or touching.  The cast was good - although Courtney Love's character was never developed to any degree.  Devito was impressive as usual.As for Jim Carey - he had Kaufman's mannerisms down pat.  But whenever they went for a closeup, I never thought I was watching Andy Kaufman... Carey's face is just too well known - especially during the ""Mighty Mouse"" bit... very Carey-esque expressions.  Part of what made Andy so recognizable was his cherubic quality - something Carey does not have.  Tony Clifton was dead on, however... It wouldn't surprise me if that was really the actual Bob Zmuda playing that part.Carey is a good actor, no doubt.  But nothing he has done (including The Truman Show and Man on the Moon) has justified his $20 million paycheck, IMO.Overall a good movie, but falls flat on too many fronts.  I give it a 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Andy Kaufman was the P.T. Barnum of our time,"I was in high school during the Taxi years & heyday of Andy Kaufman, and all I remember are the sensational rumors about how he developed a split personality, became obsessed with wrestling women (jello wrestling, as I heard it), and publicly self-destructed before disappearing into obscurity (I never even knew he died). Of course, that's not how it happened, but that was the chatter you'd hear in the hallways between classes.This film is like the quintessential dispelling of a myth. Santa Claus is revealed, the Easter Bunny unmasked. Oddly enough, what we find beneath the shticky exterior is even more shticky than before. And we learn that the man was successful at what he did because he truly lived it.Doubtlessly, you've heard Kaufman admirers refer to him as a genius, ahead of his time, and all the other obligatory accolades that are heaped on a misunderstood artist. But for the first time, I now understand why all these things are true, and if you watch this movie--whether you love him or hate him--you too will understand why he the outrageous things that he did.Furthermore, this film may help give you an understanding of other bizarre artists. I'm beginning to appreciate what drives other avant-garde artists like Picasso, Godard & the Sex Pistols. But this is a lesson you'll never get in any documentary or art appreciation class. Here through comedy--the most un-pretentious art form--we can truly enjoy the madness without all the highbrow beard-stroking that often clouds the subject. Here we have it plain & simple, the cartoon version: the story of an artist who led a revolution.Watch this movie. Then go to YouTube and watch the original clips of Andy Kaufman ...his wrestling exploits, his bizarre appearances on Letterman, his strange but true reading of The Great Gatsby before a confused and peevish crowd. This movie is the long-awaited explanation of all the madness.I was expecting to see a depressing, tragic film about a young man's spiral into insanity and oblivion. Instead, I found the story of Andy Kaufman to be the ultimate victory, and I find myself strangely energized by the whole experience. The whole thing comes down to one laugh (in that powerful scene in the Philippines near the end). Laugh and the world laughs with you; cry ...and the world laughs with you :D",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"funny, sad, and everything in between","...in other words, everything a biopic about Andy Kaufman should be.While it has plenty of faults, Milos Forman's heartbreaking and humorous tribute to the great comedic performance artist Andy Kaufman is simply astounding. Jim Carrey's performance is no less than astonishing and may be the best among his widely varying comedy career. He impersonates Kaufman in a way that captures both the legend and fantasy of Kaufman's character, as well as the soul that hid behind the act. The rest of the cast is jam packed with recognizable faces and they all perform splendidly.As a fan of the pioneering Kaufman, I found this film to be thoroughly entertaining, and those who have never heard of the man will likely also find much to be astonished here. The film is not flawless, and some sequences were over exaggerated pointlessly, although the film itself is quite faithful to the true story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why?,"For all the attention he got, Andy Kaufman didn't leave much of a comic legacy. Mostly just his part on Taxi, where his Latka character could be amusing in small doses. So why make a movie about a secondary sitcom actor? Unfortunately, you'll still be asking that question when the movie is over.What Kaufman was famous for is stunts involving feigned anger or outright verbal abuse that were designed to entertain only himself. People who watched him hoping to see something funny often just saw shouting and threats. He was called a comedian but he preferred being unfunny.Man on the Moon carefully recreates these episodes. Makeup artists make Jim Carrey look exactly like Kaufman, and Carrey meticulously reenacts all of Kaufman's mannerisms. The producers even cast many of Kaufman's actual accomplices, like wrestler Jerry Lawler. The problem is, when you carefully, painstakingly recreate an unfunny event, you get a careful, painstaking unfunny event. This isn't a failed movie in the sense it doesn't achieve its goal; it's a failed movie in the sense that the goal was never worth achieving.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hmmm...,"Having liked the contrived Latka Gravas, but never really knowing much more about Andy Kaufman than the Headlines, Man on the Moon offered some incredible depictions of this one of a kind enigma.I was never a big fan of his off-Taxi antics, but then again, Man on the Moon made it clear that I simply did not understand them.  I'm not any more of a Kaufman fan than I've been, but Man on the Moon has left me with an incredible appreciation for his genius.Jim Carrey's performance is chilling.  His normal on-screen presence has often made it hard for me to see him as the characters he's played.  This time, I forgot that I was watching an actor portraying Andy Kaufman.  It was frighteningly good.  The entire supporting cast was just as stellar.Though interesting throughout, mostly because it explained so much that I never knew about events that were so highly publicized, Man on the Moon's amazing insight into the ""why"" behind the ""what"" of his antics completely left out the ""why"" behind the ""what"" of the person.  I now know a lot about what he did, but I still know very little about who he was.If the creators' intent was to let the world get to know Andy Kaufman the man, then I think the film missed its mark.  However, that has nothing to do with the fact that it was an outstanding film in every way.  It would be as unfair to detract from the film for this as it would be to call a hammer useless because it doesn't drill holes.  A film isn't about what I expect, it's about what it is.  In this case, it's astounding from beginning to end.",,Anonymous,Biography
"A Delightful Film that's just as Ridiculous and Absurd as Andy Kaufman was,","Man on the Moon is a terrific film with a very well developed plot and a spectacular cast. It is a truly interesting, unconventional biography film that follows the life of complicated, eccentric comedian Andy Kaufman. It does not hold back on showcasing who this man truly was as both a performer and in real life, the film matches up the tone to who he was as a person in a way that I think would have made Kaufman proud had he been around to see this.The only real gripe I had with this movie is that it did not really manage to pull me in at the more emotional moments because of how absurd and over the top it is, for the most part. When they tried to showcase real humanity for Kaufman, it just felt a little too forced and on the nose.The performances are magnificent, Danny DeVito, Paul Giamatti and Courtney Love all truly embody their characters in larger than life performances, but it is without a doubt the remarkable Carrey who really takes us away from beginning to end. He is mesmerizing as Kaufman, funny and emphatic, you will forget you are watching him and just get absorbed in to his portrayal.A great watch. Funny and fascinating, Man on the Moon is a truly unique movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good biography or comedy.Follows the life and career of eccentric comedian Andy Kaufman.Best Performance: Jim Carrey",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Jim Carrey goes off,"Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is a misunderstood child and a misunderstood comic. He loves to play WITH the audience more than play TO the audience. Talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) signs him up despite thinking that he's a foreigner who speaks broken English. He gets the role on Taxi and develops the character Tony Clifton with his writing partner Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti). Andy starts wrestling women planting actresses like Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love) who ends up being his girlfriend. He gets into a fight with professional wrestler Jerry Lawler. Then he gets cancer but people aren't sure if it's actually a joke.Firstly, there is a surreal quality to this starting with Andy Kaufman at the beginning of the movie stating that things have been changed up. The other thing is that so many people are playing themselves in the movie. It's like an alternate universe. There's also the fact that Jim Carrey does a lot of crazy stuff on stage. Carrey puts it all on the line in this movie and it shows. I wouldn't put too much stock in the accuracy debate. I don't usual care that much about that and this movie can be seen as another Tony Clifton production anyways.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Andy, did you hear about this one?","Andy Kaufman was definitely a famous actor in the United States. However, in France, he still remains unrecognized. It was nearly normal that American cinema devotes him a movie. This is Milos Forman who took care of relating Andy's life and the result is a fair success. Forman had the good idea by hiring Scott Alexander and Larry Karasweski to write the screenplay. They wrote the screenplay of ""Ed Wood"" by Tim Burton and to write Andy Kaufman's story, they used the same methods as in Tim Burton's movie: they tried to relate Andy's life as precisely as possible and the result works. Besides, you could say that Ed Wood and Andy Kaufman were two characters who had similar points: they wished to impose their talent so as to go down in history, they had weird habits and unfortunately they had an unhappy end of life: they fell badly sick and died.The less we can say is that Andy Kaufman was an uncommon and unpredictable character which shows had surprises in store. They were great ""trompe l'oeil"" and used to lead the public astray. Behind the dramatic side of the situations, Kaufman's shows turned out to be loaded and completely made-up. But in spite of his absurd performances, Kaufman used generally to reach his goal: make the public laugh and it showed his original talent. Moreover, Forman introduced a lot of liberty and movements during the shows that sometimes are close to the surrealism.Jim Carrey is rather convincing in his performance and restitutes quite well Andy's personality. He skilfully avoids the third-rate acting. It shows that he's into the hands of a conscientious and serious film-maker who masters his movie. As a conclusion: a fair movie and a quite harsh biography.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
About as unexplainable as Kaufman was.,"""They say, 'Oh wow, Andy Kaufman, he's a really funny guy.' But I'm not trying to be funny. I just want to play with their heads.""- Andy KaufmanWas Andy Kaufman a brilliant comedian far ahead of his time, or a disgraceful, unfunny, mentally unbalanced individual who had a sick desire to confuse people? This is the topic at the center of Milos Forman's screen biopic, but the movie never really reveals anything remotely interesting - or enlightening - about Kaufman. He's more of an implacable human being after the movie ends than he was before.To be fair, Carrey does a commendable job of portraying Kaufman, the man who was present for the launch of ""SNL"" on October 11th, 1975, and was later voted off of the show by callers, after producer Lorne Michaels asked his audience to decide for themselves. What's most bizarre about Kaufman, however, is that he admittedly never actually revealed himself to anyone. He was never in touch with himself, and relied on multiple personalities for amusement. Back then, he was regarded as a different sort of comedic talent, but to be blunt and honest, as much as I love the television show ""Taxi,"" I think Kaufman really did have mental problems. As a child he used to stare at his wall, pretend there were cameras and put on shows.This is where the film opens. Then it skips ahead. If there's one movie that needs more flashbacks of childhood, it is ""Man on the Moon,"" a film that should have revealed Kaufman's past, rather then present us with a fairly mediocre timeline of events that we're already aware of. What has never been explained is Kaufman's past. Which leads to a startling conclusion, and one that the filmmakers may have stumbled upon (and which may explain the reason some twenty years are cut out of the movie): Kaufman has no past.He's a man who left behind a legacy of mysteries and loose ends that were never settled. After the release of ""Man on the Moon,"" there were rumors that perhaps Jim Carrey really was Kaufman, who he bore a startling resemblance to, and one that could have easily been altered with facial surgery. Yes, Carrey was born on the same day as Kaufman (January 17th), was almost as tall, had the same distinctive features, same lanky body, same sort of wacky, bizarre humor. And many of Carrey's films contain references to things Kaufman loved. But I'm not sure I buy this. The real question:Did Kaufman stage his death?To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if he did. It sounds far-fetched, but everything Kaufman did was a hoax, from the David Letterman sequence to the ""Fridays"" disaster to showing up on the set of ""Taxi"" dressed as Tony Clifton.Lots of people mimic his style, but after a while they usually let up and break character. Andy never broke character. When he was in character, he was in character, and that leads to another interesting possibility that has been oft discussed by his fans: Was Andy Kaufman actually a valid persona? Where did this man come from? One day he was a nobody, then he was famous, then soon infamous for his awkward behavior on and off the screen. (During filming of ""Taxi,"" his manager found him in the kitchen of a restaurant, cooking fries for people and telling them he was not Andy Kaufman, despite the similarities he was always noted for.) Andy unarguably received pleasure from confusing his audience. He fit into personalities and never let go. Is it too unreasonable to suggest that Andy Kaufman was another persona he created one day? And one he eventually grew tired of and abandoned like he had with so many others? If so, then why would he do this to his family? Why would he not resurface after his adopted daughter traced her origins to Kaufman?We don't know much about Kaufman's parents, and he introduced them only once on David Letterman's shows. To be fair, they could have been paid to pose as parents, and this is exactly the type of bizarre stunt that Kaufman would be capable of pulling. Also, as a child, he reportedly liked to run away and hide and scare his parents into thinking he had gone missing.""Man on the Moon"" tackles none of these subjects. It's a straightforward timeline of Kaufman's life, sloppily constructed and quite poorly directed on the whole. This could have been a controversial, epic biopic, and it also could have been a lot funnier and insightful. Even if Forman and Carrey decided not to delve into any ""conspiracy theories"" regarding Kaufman and his origins and his ""death,"" it still would have been nice to explore his background more.Was Kaufman an utter nut case or an under appreciated comic genius? We'll probably never truly know. And that's the primary fault of ""Man on the Moon."" By the end of the movie, Kaufman is completely unexplained. We're not able to truly sympathize with him, because the movie portrays him a freak of nature. Kaufman told the press once that he never cracked a single joke. It's true. So was he funny or just a sick, demented human being who liked pulling tricks on people, and possibly pulled a final one before disappearing into the middle of nowhere, leaving behind little traces? ""Man on the Moon"" doesn't know, and it doesn't try to offer any clearer resolutions. It's about as muddled and confusing as Kaufman was. And like Kaufman, it doesn't tell us a single joke, which is really a shame.2.5/5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Acting, Terrible Movie","A tremendous accomplishment by Jim Carrey, but a useless and frustrating movie.  The film does nothing to explain why Kaufman was so troubled, deluded, and self-destructive.  It doesn't explain why he was fascinated with wrestling women and how on earth the Courtney Love character could have ever fallen for him.  Lastly, it doesn't entertain the audience (a common shortcoming with the subject himself).  Only Carrey's performance spares this film a ""1.""  Terrible!  Not worth two hours of anyone else's time!",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
great Carrey performance in an uneven film,"Your fondness for `Man on the Moon' may well be predicated on your feelings for Andy Kaufman, both as comic performer and offstage human being.  And, as this film suggests, there was not, ultimately, a very wide gap between the two.  Indeed, the point of the film seems to be that, with Kaufman, the many characters he showed to us on stage and T.V. pretty much reflected the man who existed in real life.This may be both the strength and the weakness of the movie itself. Kaufman's purported genius has always eluded me.  Ostensibly, it lay, I imagine, in his metaphorically giving the finger to his audience while entertaining them at the same time.  That audience, ultimately discovering that it was the butt of the joke, then was able to go a step further and become a willing part of the act, allowing them all to feel superior to the uninitiated masses still deluded enough to be on the outside looking in. Kaufman's act became, then, a kind of exclusive comic club, a collective act of defiance against the social norms of theatrical convention and good taste.  Thus, we see him in the film reading the entire novel `The Great Gatsby' verbatim to a stunned and ultimately hostile college audience; we see him wrestling women while spouting inflammatory chauvinistic rhetoric and deliberately muffing his lines on live national television in a brilliant blurring of the line between reality and theatricality.  The problem, however, is that iconoclasm has never been a source of humor in itself, and much of Kaufman's act and persona came across as heavy-handed, smug and self-conscious, particularly in his grating Lithuanian `Taxi' character.  In short, Kaufman always seemed too full of himself and so dazzled by his own cleverness and cuteness to ever be truly funny.  It was like he was always pointing his thumbs back at himself saying, `Look how funny I am.'  Such unctiousness inspires us not to laugh.The film itself is an uneven study of the man.   The first half is particularly shaky.  After a clever 5-minute view of Kaufman as a performance-obsessed child, we move to his young adulthood where we see him bombing in a local nightclub with an act so aggressively unfunny that we cannot even imagine that it could possibly be real.  Then, virtually in the blink of an eye, he is discovered by his future manager, again, in a scene of staggering incredibility, in which Kaufman somehow manages to reduce his audience to helpless laughter with material that couldn't possibly evoke even titters let alone room-shaking guffaws.  Before we know it, Kaufman has somehow landed a hosting job on `Saturday Night Live' (yet another bad performance) and has become so much in demand that he not only secures a role in a new sitcom, `Taxi,' but is allowed to make all sorts of demands from the producers in exchange for his services.  The chronicle of his meteoric rise to fame simply lacks the detail necessary to make it credible.The movie finds surer footing as it moves ahead in time.  If anything, the gross lack of humor of many of his performances recreated for the film simply underlines the overrated comic gifts of Kaufman himself.  Although the writers, Scott Alexander and Larry Karasczewski, and director, Milos Forman, convey an obvious attitude of affection towards Kaufman, they do not shy away from portraying the self-centered petulance that governed many of his actions both in his professional and personal life.   The most poignant moments come when he discovers he has lung cancer, yet cannot convince many of the people who are closest to him that he is really sick, so skeptical has his life of duplicity made them.  Though Courtney Love is very good indeed as the woman who learns to love Kauffman, the portrayals of her character and their relationship as a whole remain sketchy and superficial throughout.  We never really sense much chemistry between them since they never seem to experience much in the way of revelatory conflict.  She simply loves him unconditionally, and she is given little to do but beam pleasantly at him or look perpetually concerned for his health and well being.`Man on the Moon's one element of undeniable brilliance lies in the triumphant performance of Jim Carrey in the starring role.  In physical appearance, in mannerisms, in comic stylings, he, quite literally, becomes Andy Kaufman!  Whether on stage or behind-the-scenes, Carrey never hits a false note, displaying his uncanny ability to bring out the humanity that might easily have been lost in a portrayal of a very eccentric comic artist. Indeed, Carrey lends some much needed depth to a screenplay that, in its bare-bone plotting, often seems undernourished and underfed.  `Man on the Moon' becomes, ultimately then, more compelling as a steppingstone in Carrey's development as an artist than as an elegy for the artist who once was.",,Anonymous,Biography
Superb,"Superb movie, showing the life of famed comedian Andy Kaufman. Kaufman was the master of blending staged events with reality, to the point that nobody, not even his closest friends or confidants, could tell what he was doing was an act or something serious. Where this film succeeds so well is that it captures that intrigue and leaves you guessing to the end. What is real and what is fake?Another massively positive contributor is the performance of Jim Carrey as Kaufman. You might think, ""Well, he's a comedian, playing a comedian, so how hard can it be?"" but the role is far more nuanced than that. Not only does he have to capture the comedic, character-playing side of Kaufman (which is difficult in itself: he truly was one of a kind) but also the real life side and with Kaufman the line between those two sides was blurred. His performance contributes greatly to the intrigue mentioned previously.Excellent film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best if seen by those entertained by Andy,"I first saw this movie when it came out, and have just watched it again. Admittedly, I marveled at the unique comic genius of Andy Kaufman, and sadly we have seen no one like him since he left us. Andy was the absolute king of the put-on -- no entertainer has has ever done it better. And this movie says it in the comedic, sometimes raw and unnerving, manner in which it took place and as performed. Jim Carrey, an actor who delivers inconsistent performances, is simply outstanding in his dead-on portrayal of the physical and mental comedic genius Andy Kaufman. This movie beautifully exemplifies the two classic masks of good drama, which are Comedy and Tragedy. The fact that many actors in this movie depiction actually did know and work with Andy is also a testament to a unique comedic talent who left us too early. And thanks do Danny DeVito who worked with and knew Andy, for not only appearing in the movie but producing it as well. For those who never had the experience of seeing, when it was first aired, or who didn't appreciate his SNL performance of 'Mighty Mouse', for those who never saw or who didn't appreciate Kaufman's Elvis, for those who never saw or didn't appreciate Kaufman and Michael Richards on ""Fridays"", and for those who cannot appreciate the show biz put-on that professional wresting is, you probably need not see this movie as you may never be able to comprehend all of it or appreciate it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A really colorful movie with very colorful Actor and actress,A really colorful movie with very colorful Actors and actress I do believe the best actor to acting the role of legendary comedian Andy Kaufman was absolutely Jim Carry and it was a right decision from Milos Forman to give him the role.I'm pretty sure Jim did his best to acting this role which is why I admire him and give him credit.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thank you very much,"The first time I saw Andy Kaufman was on the Saturday Night Live 15th anniversary show.  In the clips from the first 5 years, they showed a few seconds of his Mighty Mouse thing, and I found it strange and funny.  Since then, I've seen him on old Saturday Night Live shows, and comedian specials, and seen a few old Taxi episodes(though I was never a big fan), and found him to be quite strange, but also quite funny.  So I was really looking forward to this movie, and I was not disappointed.I agree with the person who said to try and find out the mystery behind Kaufman would have undoubtedly gotten it wrong.  Instead, we get a look inside his art, and if you don't find him funny, you're not going to like this movie(and I have no problem with those who don't like the movie for that reason).  Viewers may also be thrown by the fact that the movie, as demonstrated in the opening scene, is a series of ""is that real or just a put on?"" episodes(in a way, this reminded me of PENN AND TELLER GET KILLED, which is similarly constructed).  But it stays true to Kaufman and his performance style, and I found it offbeat and, yes, funny.I do have a couple of minor quibbles.  I don't know the entire story, but there are a couple of facts fudged.  For example, the way Kaufman left Saturday Night Live is not quite true(if they had done the true story, it would have been even funnier).  Also, Courtney Love is not as good as she was in THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, though she does have moments.  But, as I said, those are minor quibbles.  Particularly high among the virtues is, of course, Jim Carrey as Kaufman.  It took me awhile for him to ""disappear"" into the role, as so many people said he did, but he is amazing and constantly keeps us off balance and laughing, as does the entire movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Much more than just Jim Carrey,"What delights me in the works of Milos Forman is his repeated usage of same actors. In this case positive ""surprise"" was Danny De Vito, who appeared also in ""One flew over cuckoo's nest"", and Vincent Schiavelli who appeared also in ""Taking off"",""...cuckoo's nest"" and ""Amadeus"". Spectator can hence follow the aging processess of those actors and that is why Forman-movies have that peculiar feeling of ""formanian"".
Hitchcock, Tarantino and Lynch have used same method with great success.Secondly, the name of the movie can be interpreted as a comment to Stanley Kubrick's faked moon landing conspiracy theory. Did US had technology to send a man on the moon? The event was a complete joke, directed by Kubrick. That explains why Forman chose Courtney Love to this movie, because Courtney allegedly whacked his husband Kurt Cobain and never got caught. In the Milos Forman's ""Larry Flynt vs People"", the film after this, Courtney Love appears again in a role of sex club dancer without moral principle.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An Admirable Biography,"Andy Kaufman was a very funny man. Many would consider him to be a genius, and I would agree. His genius was in his brilliant originality. Jim Carrey captures some of that about as well as any actor could, I suppose, although there is just no substitute for the real thing in this case.Carrey gets Andy's voice and mannerisms down pretty well, but of course he's just acting. It doesn't quite come across the same, as is so often the case with biographical films. However, there is still a wonderful and engaging story here about a rare comedic genius, and taken as a whole it is worth watching. Recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't hesitate and watch it!!,"I have always appreciated Andy Kaufman for his dadaisticly irrational performances and that's why I had been looking forward to this movie long time before its release. I will give two main reasons why it is desirable to see it.First is very simple - life of Andy Kaufman is full of absurdity (which was exactly what he wanted). In a totally serious way he shows us that it is not always needed to take life too seriously. His shows still make people think about the border between irrationality, imagination and reality and also about what makes the joke to be funny.Second main reason is Jim Carrey. I must admit I was shocked when I first heard about Jim Carrey being the one to represent Andy Kaufman. I knew Carrey was a great comedian acceptable for movies such as Ace Ventura, but how could he cope with role of man, whose performances stunned many people all over the world, but who never considered himself to be a real comedian. Would he not turn it into another crazy comedy? Fortunatly he did not, contrary - his performance was absolutely brilliant and in cooperation with the director Milos Forman he created deathly authentic picture of Andy Kaufman. I know there has been written countless number of pages about Jim Carreys act, but in this case it is always worth it to emphasize Carrey's superiority - despite my initiatory doubts it might have been the best performance I have ever seen. Not getting an Oscar for an actor in main role is totally beyond all understanding for me. Some might find it as an audacious statement, but in comparison with actors in different biographical movies as ""Ray"" or ""Walk the line"" (Jamie Foxx and Joaquin Phoenix) Carrey's part was much more complicated and the result was even better than in two above mentioned Oscar awarded movies (however i do not mean to down performances of Foxx or Phoenix).To me this movie is a real masterpiece...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting...,"""Man on the Moon"" is a Biography - Comedy movie in which we follow the life of Andy Kaufman from his beginning until his end. We follow him from his first steps in the stand up comedy, his television performances and his life in general.I liked this movie because I found it interesting and I learnt more about Andy Kaufman and how important he was. I have to say that I would prefer to learn more information about his last moments too but something like that did not present it. The direction which was made by Milos Forman was good but I expected more because I believe that he did not reach his potential or even the potential he was given by his cast or even the whole story behind Andy Kaufman. The interpretation of Jim Carrey who played as Andy Kaufman was very good but it was not enough for this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A two hour impression that essentially has no point.,"I'm a big fan of Andy Kaufman and this movie disappointed me in a big way. Jim Carey was excellent as Andy, but the movie is all surface-- simple imitation without order, purpose, or impact.  This movie only raised questions like: why were Danny DeVito and Courtney Love's characters even included?  Why did the screenwriters take credit for simply copying down Andy Kaufman's routines and passing it off as an original screenplay?  What will Milos Forman's next film be (because I'm sure it will be much better than this one)?",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
HE WASN'T FUNNY THEN AND HE STILL ISN'T.,"I saw Andy Kaufman open for a long forgotten rock band in the late 70's and he was absolutely horrible. Of course 15,000 heavy metal fans didn't wan't to sit through an opening act let alone a comedian but this guy was awful and was booed for thirty minutes. I admire Foreman and Carrey so I thought I'd learn something in ""Man on the Moon"", find out why some people thought Kaufman a genius. I learned nothing from this film - especially why all these talented people found this story worth telling. Celebrities have always been quick to drop the label ""genius"" on each other rendering the word meaningless in America today. I'm so sick of hearing what a ""genius"" Kaufman was and how people like me just didn't ""get"" him, tired of hearing how he ""bombed on purpose"". Kaufman died too early and that is the only compelling part of his story. He wasn't a genius. He wasn't funny. This movie didn't convince me nor explain the reverence. 20 years later I feel exactly the same way I did at that concert - ""get off the stage.""",,Anonymous,Biography

"Starts off a tad disjointed and rather rushed, but very entertaining on the whole","I know there are those who say that this movie offers little insight into the off-stage life of comedian Andy Kaufman. Maybe so, but looking back, that may have been the point of the movie. As far as I know I never knew when he stopped performing. While Man on the Moon is slightly hampered by a disjointed beginning and rather rushed pacing, it does pick up and overall it is very entertaining.The film is very well made, with beautiful cinematography, detail and scenery, while REM's music is quite fitting too. The story is interesting and Milos Forman cleverly and I think wisely too keeps the audience unsure of how to perceive Kaufman, and the script is funny and very well written. Forman's(also of Amadeus and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, both of which in my opinion are better movies, fame) direction is excellent, and the acting especially from Jim Carrey and Danny DeVito is first-rate.All in all, interesting film and an entertaining one. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
unsuccessful and questionable,"Man on the Moon leaves the viewers with two questions.  (1) What possessed anyone to make this movie?  (2) Why did anyone who knew Andy Kaufman care about him?  Andy Kaufman may have been brilliant and eccentric (and other than the Mighty Mouse and Latka, nothing was very funny so the brilliance is questionable), but there's no attempt to explain to an audience what made him tick - and showing what made him tick MIGHT have made an audience care for two seconds.  It's difficult to watch a film when you hate the main character. Carrey is a fantastic actor and certainly capable of going deeper into the character of a complicated man.  The film picked up toward the end but there's never an explanation of why people he totally abused, such as the Taxi cast, were shown seemingly to have loving feelings toward him.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Loved it!,"I'd watched the 'making of documentary' which provided a fascinating insight into a man, who frankly, when I was growing up, wasn't taken seriously, at least not in rural Ontario, or to working class parents. Following this and the aforementioned movie, I think Andy Kaufman was a genius. This was a good movie if your interested in Andy Kaufman and why (if we can ever truly know) he did what he did. Watch the documentar of the film which largely centres around another comic genius, Jim Carrey.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Overrated, Shallow Film","It's interesting to see that Jim Carrey has returned to doing impressions. This film seems more like a big impression rather than an interpretation of the life and times of Kaufman.  No particular insight is brought to the fore, and various parts of the movie - the recreations of various episodes of ""Taxi"" or ""Late Night"", to name two - just seem awkward.  The Kaufman episode of ""Biography"" is far, far better and more insightful.PS I had no idea how bad an actor David Letterman is.  Here, he shows an inability to play himself.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Proof that sometimes truth is stranger than fiction,"Milos Forman's ""Man on the Moon"" is a biopic of famed entertainer Andy Kaufman, who was a unique individual to say the least. Usually classified as a comedian, Kaufman's antics were the sort that defy easy categorization. He pushed the boundaries of comedy, often challenging audiences with material that was just as likely to result in jeers, boredom and/or discomfort rather than laughter.In the movie, Jim Carrey plays Andy with total commitment, which is amply demonstrated in this year's feature length documentary ""Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond"". He was denied an Oscar nomination for his efforts but he did snag his second consecutive Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy (having won the previous year for ""The Truman Show""). Leaving aside awards recognition, Carrey seemed to capture the spirit of Kaufman's inspired lunacy in what is probably one of his best (semi-) dramatic performances. The supporting cast is also quite intriguing, not the least for including several individuals playing themselves, such as wrestler Jerry Lawler, talk show host David Letterman, ""Saturday Night Live"" creator Lorne Michaels and most of the cast of ""Taxi"". Other notables (not playing themselves) include Danny DeVito, Paul Giamatti and Courtney Love. Overall, it's a nicely assembled cast that did Andy proud.Being based on a true story, the movie's plot probably won't hold too many surprises for die-hard Kaufman fans but others should find it quite interesting. Some of it seems hard to believe but from what I've read it seems that the movie hewed fairly close to the actual events. In fact, even the staging of some scenes closely matches the original television broadcasts. Credit is undoubtedly due to Milos Forman and his crew for bringing the movie to life with keen attention to detail in its period setting. Naturally, with two-time Oscar-winner Forman at the helm, the movie is in good hands from a visual standpoint but the audio department also benefits from a soundtrack that was largely composed by Rock and Roll Hall of Famers R.E.M. This of course includes their classic song that supplied the film with its title.Ultimately, though, ""Man in the Moon"" is, like its subject, unlikely to appeal to everyone. Kaufman's antics could sometimes stretch the definition of 'entertainment' but that's what made him so unique. I can see why he didn't consider himself a comedian, which might be a bit of a problem for viewers checking out this movie with an expectation of something resembling mainstream comedy. Personally, I find the movie to be entertaining and memorable both because of and despite its eccentricities.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kaufman's Career in One Movie,"The life and career of a legendary comedian, Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey).If you never had the chance to see Andy Kaufman in his lifetime, this more or less sums up all his characters and his best skits. The Tony Clifton character is best, at least as portrayed in this film, but all have become a part of popular culture. Jim Carrey may or may not exactly look the part, but he was the only man who could have done this and knocks it out of the park.Much like Kaufman himself, this film is hilarious at times and grating at others. Sometimes the laughs came from the audience and sometimes the audiences suffered at Andy's expense. But, of course, this is because he was not so much a comedian as a performance artist. When we expect something else, we only open ourselves to disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wicked Mediocre,"I was really pretty disappointed. I absolutely adore Andy Kaufman. I think that he was a genius and undoubtedly one of the greatest comedians of the century. The problem with this movie was that it didn't show me anything that I didn't see on the ""Tribute to Andy Kaufman"" 1-hour special on Comedy Central. This movie left me with the feeling that Kaufman was a two-dimensional character with no feelings when he was off-stage. I don't know THAT much about the sequence of events that took place in Kaufman's life, but I do know that Forman manipulated the events to tell a much different story than actually occurred. I was disappointed because it just seemed like an hour and a half of Jim Carrey doing an imitation of the stunts that the real Kaufman pulled in real life. It left me with the feeling the Kaufman was just some freak that was impossible to REALLY KNOW, which I don't believe. Yes, Kaufman was a practical joker and mastered the art of tricking us into who he really was and what he really wanted from us. I saw no passion in this direction. When I see a biographical film, I like to at least think that the director is passionate about the main character's life. I just saw this film as a shallow reflection of the stunts that Kaufman pulled, as opposed to a thoughtful exploration of this brilliant man's life.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lacks insight but is still very entertaining thanks to a great Carrey,"Andy Kaufman is a song and dance man who struggles to really be successful as a stand up in nightclubs as the audience are never really sure what the joke actually is.  When he is spotted by agent George Shapio, it allows him to get one of his characters onto a new sitcom.  With the success of the show he is given a stage to try different things - an opportunity that the studio regrets giving him when he varies wildly from a lounge lizard alter ego to a major show where he wrestles female audience members to the ground.As with many within the UK audience for this film, I only know Kaufman from his character in Taxi.  One thing I do know is that he was clearly a mystery with no-one, maybe not even himself, really knowing who he was or when he was being serious.  And that is what the film remembers - an enigma.  This is not the place to come for understanding, explanation or background; in fact the film skips from a brief flashback of Andy's childhood to 20 years later as a stand-up! In that regard, the film is a success because it nicely captures a man who it must have been hard to laugh at simply because he appeared to be more about having a laugh on his audience rather than at his audience.  On the strength of this film I quite like his style but am surprised he became so famous when it must have been quite hard to actually laugh at his work.The film may not do enough for those who know a lot about Kaufman's career simply because it doesn't cast light on anything - it only records some key events.  As I said, the film seems to be holding it's hands up and saying `look - we know about as much as you do' - it isn't even sure if Kaufman died for real or not.  I found it very funny though and it was an entertaining way of informing me about his career.Despite the lack of an Oscar nomination, it is Carrey who makes this film work so well - his performance is great, capturing Kaufman's routines as well as providing us with some tender moments.  DeVito is good in support even though it confused me as to who he was playing at first (Shapio or himself).  Love is not as bad as I feared she might be, although she has no character and she is still one of the weakest aspects of the film. Giamatti is as reliable as ever and is sterling in support.  Appearances from others as themselves are great and add class to the film - particularly Lawler, the cast of Taxi and several others.Overall I enjoyed this film but it engaged me because I knew so little about him.  For those who are familiar with him this film may not bring enough for them to justify seeing but even then it is lively, funny and centred on a great performance from Carrey.",,Anonymous,Biography
Andy Kaufman's gift is rediscovered for a new generation,"Many moviegoers today would not have seen Andy Kaufman's first startling appearances on Saturday Night Live, where he would do the shy, awkward European immigrant and then go into an amazing Elvis impression. When he burst on the scene there was no one like him and the world wasn't sure how to react to his humour sometimes. We would get used to the cute immigrant character, and then he'd be someone else.He never wanted to stand still in his career, going from one stunt to the next, and like Rick Nelson's lament in ""Garden Party"", irritated at those who only wanted him to be Latka. He didn't want to do the show Taxi and agreed to do it only to get his own special - which the network balked at even airing as it wasn't mainstream enough. Now his kind of originality is more appreciated and so the time was right for making a movie celebrating this misunderstood and previously almost forgotten comic.Andy's later stage act of wrestling women, and the limited role in ""Taxi"", did not make him into a superstar like Jim Carrey is now. He did not play by the rules and so showbiz did not reward him, nor was his range as broad or appealing as Carrey's, but he had a gentle and quirky vision of wanting to affect his audiences. It is fitting that Carrey recognized Andy's genius and chose to play this role, as they both started out with dreams of being famous entertainers, and one of them didn't quite reach the heights, but left a puzzling body of work that this film attempts to explore.As a true homage to Andy, Jim Carrey brings him to life for a whole new generation. And those who did follow Andy Kaufman during his career will shed a tear at the behind-the-scenes look at how hard it was for him to maintain artistic integrity in a business that wanted him to be like everyone else.Because this movie just came out today, I will not discuss anything that might spoil the experience for moviegoers. Thus my remarks must remain incomplete and I am chiefly here to say: please see this movie if you like biographies of strong-willed but misunderstood people, or if you love Jim Carrey, or are at all interested, even mildly, in Andy Kaufman and what he was all about. You will laugh and cry, and be uncomfortable. It will not leave you unmoved.I also want to call your attention to director Milos Forman's other movie ""Hair""; if you loved it you will appreciate Man on the Moon . Hair was a very personal retelling of the famous stage play, and Forman brought his own grace and style to it.Man on the Moon makes sparing but careful use of REM's beautiful song, which is featured in the TV ads. It is touching to reflect that this song was written about Andy years ago by someone who wanted to keep his name alive, and only now on seeing the movie will the song take on its full meaning to listeners who didn't know who Andy was.Like Hair, It is an amazingly executed movie. I fear that Jim Carrey's performance may not win an Oscar nod because they generally turn up their noses at impersonations (although Ben Kingsley was rewarded for his impression of Gandhi). But Carrey deserves a nomination because he truly captures Andy Kaufman, the driven man in motion. The material never drags; rather it is a tale respectfully told of a life lived like a meteorite. It might have been filmed in a number of ways - more comic, more tragic, but Forman shows all the complexities of the human being behind the public persona.A beauty, well worth seeing, and if there are flaws in the telling, as in Titanic, they don't matter because it's a real charmer.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Between Genius and Madness,"Andy Kaufman was a controversial figure in the few years he enjoyed notoriety, because he was probably as much a genius as he was a madman.His boldness had no limits and at times it was scathing, at others it was shocking, because Andy (and Bob Zmuda and several other accomplices in his mystifications) loved to provoke the public, to the limit, pushing that limit further and further.Even his premature death, at the age of 35, from a rare lung cancer, served as a pretext to provoke the public, leading many to believe that it was a hoax and that Kaufman was still alive, with posthumous appearances by his character Tony Clifton.This film, produced by a team led by Danny de Vito, Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher (and which included Kaufman's eternal accomplice, Bob Zmuda) is a fitting tribute to this genius and madman, who shocked and amused America for less than a decade, but which was enough to elevate him to the restricted group of visionaries, of myths, that endure over time, for the originality and boldness with which they faced life and spectacle.Well directed by Milos Forman, a multi-academy award-winning veteran, the film features many of Kaufman's real partners in his artistic life, the cast of Taxi, Budd Friedman, Richard Belzer, Lorne Michaels, fighter Jerry Lawler, Bob Zmuda in a secondary role (his character is played by Paul Giamatti), David Letterman, among others, as well as recreates many of the key moments of Kaufmann's career, with the real actors, recreating for the film, the programs and shows shared with Kaufman.All that remains is to talk about the protagonist, Jim Carrey, himself a phenomenon that often oscillates between genius and madness, therefore an apparently perfect choice to bring Kaufmann's myth to life.There is no doubt that Carrey does a remarkable job, especially with restraint, being a hyperactive actor, as he is known. The only drawback is that Carrey is too iconic to pass off as someone else. It's like having Elvis imitate Johnny Cash. No matter how good the imitation is, the public can never forget that it is Jim Carrey, just as they would never be convinced that Elvis was Cash. Magnificent as Carrey, but without ever truly convincing that he is Kaufman.Tony Clifton, full of attitude and makeup, is however, always perfect, whether played by Carrey, Giamatti, or a possible and unknown third party, in the posthumous show.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very strong Biography starring Jim Carrey,"As the title of this review says. This is a very strongly written and directed biography about the life of Andy Kaufman, a very, very, VERY strange comedian who had the most unique sense of humor, and as you can judge yourselves by looking up some of his real life sketches online, was at very least part genius, if I can say so. Jim Carrey comes in. Possibly the best human being, if not 'the only', on the planet to play this role. It's one of these roles that are just tailor-made for a very specific individual. The film, up until the very last scene, is a tribute to Kaufman for how incredibly ahead of his time he was and the utterly unique sense of humor and creativity he possessed, completely detached from anything else that existed at the time and even for now. The film is very direct, vivid. It somewhat feels like a sequence of newspaper articles depicting Kaufman's life events put together in a coherent way. Jim Carrey is an amazing human being, and this film matches that special, unique quality he's always Carried with him (get it ? 'Carried' ?.. eh, awful...). A very nice film, and eye-opening for many who may've never heard of this contemporary genius portrayed here by another contemporary genius.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Decent Movie About an Unworthy Subject,"While Jim Carrey does a remarkable job of imitating Andy Kaufman, and the movie is somewhat enjoyable (in a formulaic, hero-worshiping manner), it is majorly affected by the facts about the person it concerns. In the end, the biggest flaw of ""Man on the Moon"" is its subject matter.The fact is, Andy Kaufman was not funny or particularly talented. His entire repertoire consisted of insulting his audience, making fun of people who don't speak English, and being rude. Mr. Kaufman professed that he was an ""alternative entertainer"" - as Andy Dick observed, that means he didn't entertain.The best quote in the movie is when the Kaufman character says, ""I'm not going to get up on stage and tell jokes!"" Well, guess what, Mr. Kaufman - that's what a comedian does. That's rather like a doctor saying, ""I'm not going to go in there and practice medicine! I think they'd much prefer it if I insulted them and tried to get them in a headlock!""Mr. Kaufman's lack of talent led to his expulsion from the normal haven for the talent-challenged: Saturday Night Live. Mr. Kaufman's lack of talent kept him from being able to get lucrative gigs after the novelty of his particular form of inanity had worn off. There are those who say, ""He made me laugh with the Mighty Mouse bit"", or ""I chuckled at his performances on Taxi"". Well, Uncle Fred might make you giggle by making noises with his hand and armpit, but that doesn't mean he's a great entertainer.As a biopic, this movie is extremely slanted - it takes the few moments where Mr. Kaufman actually made an audience laugh (generally out of nervous confusion rather than actual enjoyment), inflates them to gross proportions as sappy music swells in the background, and the viewer is left with the belief that Mr. Kaufman was a great entertainer. But if you watch any of the many tapes of his ""performances"", or listen to any of the people who worked with him or saw him perform, you'll get the true picture of what this man was - a hack.Jim Carrey said he took the role because Kaufman was an ""inspiration"" to him. As entertainment-seekers, we can only hope that's not true.",,Anonymous,Biography
B-e-a-utiful,"My all time absolute favorite film for a million reasons. First off, I'm a huge fan of Jim Carrey, and nobody could've nailed the role of comedian Andy Kaufman better than him. Andy was very interesting and nobody ever knew what was truly going on and what is going to happen next in his life. He could make a crowd laugh without saying a word. And who else can do that? Jim Carrey. They both started out as impressionists, and they were creative and forever entertaining to watch. Better yet, Jim was a big fan of Andy, in fact, he made everybody on set call him Andy Kaufman so he could stay in character all through filming.The best quality of this film is it's ability to surprise you. Comedy can easily be predictable, but this one is different. Just like Andy Kaufman, it surprises you in such creative ways you're still scratching your head to the last joke when a new one appears. It also maintains it's comical humor while you cry and cradle your pet pug. I can't explain how beautiful it is while you still say ""haha"" and ""wow omg"".Especially fun to watch as a Jim fan because it highlights all of Jim's best acting qualities. Absolutely touching and b-e-a-utiful, have a huge box of tissues ready and get ready to laugh. There is action, drama, comedy, and more. Every turn is full of surprises and Jim Carrey knows how to cover every side of Andy's confusing life. He truly deserved his golden globe for this film, it is a work of art and definitely his best performance.It's very hard to explain how amazing and special this film is, but it is absolutely worth the watch because it is absolutely amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful, best performance from Jim Carrey","Rented the DVD, which also included great behind-the-scene interviews and amazing soundtracks by R.E.M. group. Watched it five times again and again in one week and enjoyed it every time.The movie depicts the life of Andy Kaufman, the unconventional comedian who achieved fame in late 70s and early 80s. Avid Kaufman fans who know every details of his life, complain about inaccuracies and lack of details in this movie. But for the rest of us who have barely heard of Kaufman, the movie is powerful, entertaining and touching.Jim Carrey presents a magnificent performance as Andy Kaufman, proving again that he acts better in dramatic movies than comedy. His portrayal of Kaufman is close to heart, and in words of his colleagues, it appeared as if Andy Kaufman had invaded his soul.Few people mentioned it here, but both Danny DeVito (as George Shapiro, Andy's manager) and Courtney Love (as Lynn Margulies, Andy's girlfriend) do a great job. The audience relate to them easily, admire their loyalty to Andy Kaufman and follow their emotional up and downs. Paul Giamatti does a decent job in portraying Bob Zmuda, Andy's writer and best friend.I was particularly touched by the last fifteen minutes of the movie, especially the funeral scene; laughed and cried with Shapiro, Margulies and Zmuda through the whole time. And if a movie could stir up emotions in the right way, who cares if a few historical details are inaccurate?Rated R for brief nudity, brief scenes of wrestling, and one scene with obscene language.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jim Carrey is the best thing in this real-life/re-creation of a film.,"Jim Carrey is great -- no argument there. But Andy Kaufman was huge because of ""Taxi."" Not because of Tony Clifton. Not because of his Elvis Impersonation. Not because of his wrestling. The film devotes about 10 minutes tops to his stint on ""Taxi"" and recreates a whole bunch of events that Jim Carrey as Andy recreates for us to a tee. By the time we start to see a little bit about Andy Kaufman and what people thought about him, he's already dead and buried. I always liked him, on and off ""Taxi."" I recommend this flick only to those who have no idea what Andy Kaufman did while he was here. He wasn't a HUGE star, but he was an entertaining man. I'd be more interested in a film showing why a lot of stars who worked with him did not want any part of the film. Where was Tony Danza? I wish they explored his ""shock comic"" personality a little further. All in all, a bit of a disappointment, but a well done recreation of a lost comic. I hope Jim Carrey gets the respect he deserves this year. Milos can watch reruns of ""Taxi"" and think about how neat it would be to recreate Andy's scenes with a Tony Danza stand-in. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Andy, We Hardly Knew Ye...","Andy Kaufman was an original, no doubt about it.  His biting, often strange humor infuriated people to the point of hating him.  Those who got the joke saw through it all and chuckled at how the butt of his antics (the audience) became annoyed and distraught .  Ultimately and sadly, the joke was on Kaufman himself.  MAN ON THE MOON arrives at this conclusion after a series of episodic Andy moments, most of which fans have seen over and over again throughout the years.You sure wish you could get to know this flawed man and what made his outlandish mind work.  As David Letterman once said, ""sometimes, you look at Andy, and you are not sure who is behind the wheel.""  You never do get a real sense of who he was in Milos Forman's strong, but nearsighted film.There are fabulous moments sprinkled throughout, however.  The first 5 minutes of the picture may have some of those same Andy haters leaving the theater, a further testament to his misunderstood humor.  Forman and his screenwriters have created a brilliant and ingenious method of beginning a Kaufman biopic.  Jim Carrey plays the erratic comedian masterfully in what is by far his best performance to date.  There are times when we see Carrey playing him as a goof off-stage, lying, demanding, and acting just flat out bizarre.  I ask myself whether or not this is the real thing.  Certainly, the many people involved in the production of the film (in particular Bob Zmuda and Danny DeVito) knew Kaufman well as a pro and a friend, but the joke may still be on us as far as finding out what he was really all about.Forman's direction and the screenplay basically play off the hopes that most audiences will be unfamiliar with Kaufman's work.  This is fine, however, there are times when a true fan can mimic what is happening on screen.  MAN ON THE MOON is merely a succession of scenes showcasing his talent, or lack of, leading to a mildly emotional climax.The question of whether or not Kaufman faked his own death is not really touched upon, but some subtle glimpses at film's end could keep you guessing.  R.E.M.'s classic tune fittingly ends what turns out to be a loving tribute to the guy.  Andy's antics did p*** a lot of people off. The film shows how he was able to create the illusion of what could be authentically unbelievable.  Were the wrestling injuries real?  Did Jerry Lawler really slap him on Letterman?  This is mostly left to your imagination for some time, but it is amusing to see who was in on some of the madness with him.The sickly humor of the piggish lounge singer ""Tony Clifton"" creates some huge laughs.  Clifton was Zmuda and Kaufman's favorite creation.  I think Forman and company with the help of Andy's pals use the Clifton character, who was the alter ego of Kaufman you could say, to show the tragedy of his comedy and his untimely death.  Clifton was the ultimate Kaufman fake-out, but he was able to live on while Andy was only mortal.What a curious man he was and who better than Carrey to play him (I mean really, WHO better).  His performance is the glue that holds MAN ON THE MOON together, barely.  I just wish I got to know Andy Kaufman much more over the course of the 2 hour film.RATING: ***",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
F---ing With My Head (Mountain Dew Rock),"I've always dug Andy Kaufman.  I like when people screw with an audience like that.  I enjoy Jim Carrey - his performance here, and on ""The Truman Show"" were excellent.  Milos Forman has directed two of the finest films ever (""Amadeus"" and ""Cuckoo's Nest"").  The two guys who wrote the screenplay also wrote ""Ed Wood"" and ""Larry Flynt"" bio movies, and I loved those.  I'm a huge REM fan.  They rock, especially live.  Danny DeVito is always a cool character actor, and has become one of the most interesting movie producers today.  I'm completely indifferent to Courteney Love, though somewhere along the way she became pretty.  So why didn't I like this movie more?",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Enigma, my foot","Andy Kaufman's motivation isn't at all hard to understand.  We've all had the desire to play practical jokes.  We've all had the urge to say and do things that are, objectively speaking, funny, even though, and often because, we know that the humour will be invisible to everyone but ourselves.  And it's obvious us all what a good practical joke requires: it requires that we shut up and let others work out for themselves what the joke is, whatever the cost of our silence.  Andy Kaufman - the character portrayed in this film, at any rate - was simply someone who loved a certain kind of humour more than anything else in the world.  You've heard stories about people who love, say, music, more than anything else in the world...? Well, this is no different; certainly no more mysterious.Remember the moment when his agent says, ""You have to ask yourself this question: who are you trying to entertain?  The audience, or yourself?"" Andy doesn't answer.  But the answer he would have given, had he been in a mood to be honest, would have been, ""Neither.  I'm interested in creating situations that are, objectively speaking, amusing - even if audiences are unable to laugh at them - even if I MYSELF am unable to laugh at them.""That's why it was worthwhile for Milos Forman to come along, after the dust had settled, and make Kaufman's life into a movie.  Some of the jokes are only visible to a God's-eye view.I walked into the film pretty much prepared to loathe Kaufman (whose stuff I've never seen).  Okay, the man probably had talent.  He was a skilled artist, of a kind.  Still: a skilled artist of almost any other kind would be more worthy of admiration.  But Forman keeps his distance, and simply asks us to see a genuinely tragic story of a human being who is somehow easy to like and - to us, if not to the other characters in the film - perfectly transparent.  (So much so that we have to wonder how it was possible for Kaufman's contemporary audiences not to know what was going on.  Are Americans REALLY as dense as legend says they are?  Maybe not; and anyway, Forman's frequent cut-away shots to the audience show a variety of different responses.)I could have done without that postscript with Tony Clifton; but the Philippines stint, and the funeral sequence it dissolved into, were marvellous.  Forman's best work since ""Amadeus"".",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Entertaining? Hmmmm, not really. Enjoyable? Hmmmm, not really.But definitely interesting. I would in fact recommend seeing this movie. Andy Kaufman was an - what word comes to mind - ah, interesting guy! And this movie fits him to a tee.And Jim Carrey gives an Oscar-deserving performance here. He brings Andy back to life. And that is saying something, particularly if you ever had the pleasure to see Andy in person.You see, Andy wasn't a comedian. He didn't excel in drama, or mystery, or any common form of entertainment. Andy was the quintessential essence of performance. I don't mean that he was a performance artist. I mean that literally ... Andy WAS the performance.And this movie does capture that. My only problem with the movie is that it does in fact capture Andy so well that ... it's unnerving.

Honest Bio of the Strangest American Comedian -- Carey's Best Performance,"Andy Kaufman reminds me a bit of Mozart, an enigmatic man with amazing talents but bizarre psychology. However, while Mozart's music has a transcendent quality to it that does not necessarily bespeak of the strange creature behind it, Kaufman's crazy antics and wacky routines ran a parallel course with their mad creator. His performances were as contradictory as himself, some being inspirational while others were mean-spirited and vicious. Kaufman gave new meaning to the definition of ""human being"". Not that comedians are ever normal, but Kaufman was probably the closest to a space alien on earth, with due apologies to Robin Williams. And probably the only actor space alien enough to attempt to play Kaufman was Jim Carey.Kaufman burst on the Saturday Night Live scene in the 1970's with bits so improbable and spontaneous that he was a breath of fresh air for those tiring of Chevy Chase falling off ladders. His ""Jimmy Carter"" and ""Might Mouse"" bits have become classics in the annals of the show. And he had the best Elvis imitation in the industry. Maybe not quite like Rich Little, but an entirely different take.He then got the opportunity to play Latka, a half-witted car repairman from an unknown eastern-block country, on the television show Taxi. Kaufman played Latka to the hilt, apparently creating Latka's ""language"" and improvising some of his scenes. When Taxi became a hit so did Kaufman and his character Latka. The movie reunited much of the cast of Taxi to re-shoot scenes with Carey as Kaufman playing Latka, and several of the actors believed that Kaufman had returned. Which is another point I want to make in this review: not for one moment did I think I was seeing Jim Carey. For two hours I thought I was seeing Andy Kaufman.One of the most outlandish stunts Kaufman pulled (but certainly not the last) was the appearance of Tony Clifton. Kaufman required in his contract that Clifton appear on an episode or two of Taxi. Tony Clifton was essentially the ultimate Las Vegas loser from a bygone era, a cigar-smoking no-talent yowler (I hesitate to call him a singer) replete with smelly cigar, unkempt facial hair, and disgusting ruffled shirt. The kind of guy that maybe had his way with the ladies 49 years earlier but now needs more than a makeover. When Clifton arrives on the set of Taxi, heads do more than roll... But this was not the end of Kaufman's crazy stunts, which are chronicled throughout the movie, including wrestling women.Simultaneously, Kaufman apparently was interested in transcendental meditation. And some of his live presentations had a gentler warmer rhetoric in which humor and laughter heal and enlighten audiences. However, his other stunts that provoked and angered other viewers received far more press. Unfortunately, it seems Kaufman could not decide which side of his contradictory personalities was really him and upon which he wanted to focus his energy. Late in the film, his agent, played by former Taxi cast member Danny DeVito asks Kaufman if he is really trying to entertain people or if he is just entertaining himself.Ultimately, the film begs more questions than it answers, as it should be. Kaufman cannot be neatly categorized. Was he comedian? Yes, but not in the traditional Bob Hope sense. He was also a performance artist. Was he suffering from psychosis? Probably. But he was also into meditation. Kaufman will never be fully understood, maybe because he probably never truly understood himself either, and that's at the heart of Carey's portrayal.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Homage to a fraud,"This movie is difficult viewing. It is reasonably well-acted by Jim Carrey, at least enough so to add some three-dimensional fullness to the character of Andy Kaufman. But I never have been able to shake the conviction that Kaufman was purely a fraud who made up for lack of acting talent and comic ability with massive loads of baloney to make people THINK he was a genius. This movie only reinforced that belief.Other than the brief television career he had on ""Taxi"", where he played the lovable foreign guy, Latka, who routinely butchered the English language, Kaufman was essentially a total loser who couldn't honestly act or make people laugh, so he had to resort to horrible excesses of fakery and deception and ""plants"" just to make certain gags work. (Even his arch-nemesis in the ring, pro-wrestler Jerry Lawler, was a plant.)I've found that people by and large are willing to forgive bad acting, but not dishonest acting. I have always thought that Kaufman was guilty of both. Hey, it wasn't for nothing that the viewing public voted him off ""Saturday Night Live"".If you see this movie, you should, if you ever get the chance, also see the E! True Hollywood story on Kaufman for a little added balance and perspective.",,Anonymous,Biography
Did you know Andy Kaufman and Jim Carrey both were born on January 17th?,"I was never really a big Andy Kaufman fan when I was younger. I didn't think he was funny. Most of my exposure to him came from his appearances on Late Night with David Letterman in the 80s. I do remember seeing a lot of his wrestling spectacles and I saw bits and pieces of him on Taxi in the 70s. I never understood his comedy, until I was much older, but after watching this film, I finally understood what I had been missing when I was younger. I get it now. I didn't realize how much of history I was watching. Also, what I didn't know, and this is explained in the movie, is he never was a comedian. He was a performer. His angle was to change reality, fool the audience and create chaos. It was clear by the end of the movie that this guy really was a genius and people, like myself, didn't get it (my only defense was I was a little young).And, speaking of geniuses; Jim Carrey was fantastic in his performance. He totally nailed the film. Andy Kaufman had an amazing mind and I think the creators wanted to tap into that and inject into the chaos, a reality-changing act, that takes you into the machinations of the film. The opening credits explain it all correctly from the start. When the film begins, Andy (Carrey) comes out and tells you that this is actually the end of the movie and the End Credits roll, which showcases classic film juxtaposition.The casting of Danny Devito was interesting too. Devito plays George Shapiro, who was Andy's Personal Manager. The real Shapiro was Executive Producer of this film. All the TAXI scenes in the movie are strategically shot, so that you don't even notice Danny missing from those remade scenes, thus it removed any awkwardness of Devito trying to juggle two roles and not embarrassed by trying to play the man he was 20 years ago. The rest of the TAXI cast returned (except Danza). They all looked a little weathered, but through the magic of Hollywood it passes the reality factor. I was amazed at how much Andy hated Taxi.There are many other cameos that drop by, used to explain that spark, which increased the scope of Andy's life, such as David Letterman, Norm MacDonald, Patten Oswald and Paul Giamatti. Also, you can never go wrong with REM and their song is a major focal point to this film.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Effort+Ego=Mediocrity,"I had very high hopes for MOTM considering Carrey's breakout in The Truman Show and Forman's history. I wanted to like this movie, but instead I was left with a technically superior film that had very little impact.Carrey's performance is little more than mimcry. I looked for him to humanize Kauffman or to at least personalize him. Instead, he opts for impersonation. While the impersonation is dead on, I wanted to see more elements of the person inside of his caricatures. I know Carrey can do impressions from his stand up and sketch career, I wanted to see him act and to show naysayers that Truman wasn't a fluke.The supporting cast particularly Devito and Giamatti grounded the film and gave it a soul. Love's proven her acting prowess before in Forman's People vs Larry Flynt, so I question why the director hamstringed her with a script that left her the most generic love interest since Minnie Driver in Good Will Hunting.As for the soul searching query that was supposed to be at the heart of the movie: Was Kauffman a genius or a quack? Very little is done to establish this in the first hour of the movie. He's established as a person whose career was never really in his own control and was more a victim of circumstance. Attempts to get to this in the last half of the film fall short because of a lack of establishment.Production values, cinematography, and the music are excellent as I would expect  in a Forman picture, but they don't cover what I perceived as a lack of heart.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carrey's best performance,"All ""serious"" comics tend to turn away from pure humour towards an investigation of what it means to be funny: perhaps, that's why they're considered serious comics, because they're just not funny themselves any more. But Andy Kaufman, throughout his career, pushed the definition of comedy to its limit. But we he any good, and does the fact of his early death justify a biopic? Or, to put it another way, can someone who did not grow up with, or does not appreciate, Kaufman's own peculiar form of humour, enjoy Milos Forman's film, 'Man in the Moon'? Fortunately, the answer is yes, because of Kaufman's own bizarre character, brought brilliantly to life by Jim Carrey (not an actor I usually particularly enjoy). It is said that Kaufman never came out of character, but in the film's most telling line, a girlfriend comments ""there is no real you"", and the film certainly does not subscribe to the view that there was a normal human being behind the masks. Kaufman, as portrayed in this film, remains an enigma, maybe he even was an enigma to himself, but this adds a quality to the story of his journey through life that sets it apart from ordinary tales. When you finish watching this film, you don't necessarily like the act (if ""act"" is the right word); but in spite of yourself, you do like the man.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""a song and dance man.""","When Kaufman was alive I had a sort of love-hate response to his material. As I'm sure many did. Needless to say I also have a love-hate response to this film. We were not in on the joke, those of us who were exposed to the real Andy Kaufman. This movie tries to demystify the perplexity that was Andy Kaufman. It tries to humble his stature while simultaneously praising him as if he were a gift to modern comedy and humanity. He was not. He was a selfish performer with a delinquent obsession for mischief. Any entertainment we got from him was despite his own efforts.He was a talented man, but many stand greater than he: Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, George Burns, Jonathan Winters, Bill Cosby, the list goes on. In a way the movie stands almost as an apology: ""He was only kidding, folks!"" and I wonder if that apology should be accepted, or even uttered. It's like trying to explain the joke after the punchline illicits no laughter. It demeans the attempt and makes the joke even worse.Kaufman was an entertainer interested in the interactions between performer and audience. He wasn't satisfied with just making people laugh. He also wanted to make us cry. He wanted to scare us. He wanted to inspire us to throw things at him and shout obscenities, and he wanted to be able to control his audience on all emotional levels. In that, he was successful.He would read The Great Gatsby to a crowd, not to entertain them, but to see how long it would take before they would all get up and leave. He wanted to see how much the audience would take of him. The audience was there to entertain him.He wanted to be known as a song and dance man. Fine. I'll call him that. However, he was no comedian. Comedians generally focus on trying to make an audience laugh. Kaufman preferred to see his audience as the butt of jokes for his own amusement. We were his entertainment. It was not the other way around.Should we laud him for it? Should we praise him for it? And should we make expensive movies about him when his corpse is hardly cold? As sincere and heartfelt as this movie wants to be, it is somehow unfitting to speak this way of the dead. And y'know what? That's probably exactly how Andy would have wanted it.The special guest appearances are enigmatic for me. Surely there's stories behind closed doors with Danny DeVito convincing some of them - stories we will never hear. Perhaps after DeVito is dead we'll see another movie about it.Jim Carrey's performance was impeccable. Naturally he was completely snubbed by the Academy and was not even nominated for an Oscar. Like Kaufman, Hollywood still doesn't quite know what to do with Carrey. If you like Carrey, this is a mustsee film. If you don't like Carrey, this film might just change your mind.DeVito's performance is underwhelming. His attention was diverted, and he would have been better suited staying behind the camera and concentrating on looking through the lens. DeVito wore too many hats for this one and it shows in his performance.I've seen documentaries about Kaufman that were just as entertaining and revealing. I enjoyed it, but I did so despite myself. I think the most powerful moment is the scene just before the funeral. For a film in which I already knew all the major plot points and I knew how it would end, the look on Carrey/Kaufman's face when he realized that the cruelest joke of life was on him, that alone was worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Normaly I simply happen upon them, but this one I actively sought out and I'm glad I did.As a child I loved Taxi and Andy Kaufman.  As an adult I can appreciate more of what he was and did.

Although not 100% accurate, it has been considered close enough by those involved for them to appear in the movie as either themselves or as other characters.  Danny DeVito, who gained his fame from Taxi which was made popular (and possible) by Kaufman plays George Shapiro, who in turn plays a club owner.  Many others appear as themselves, and it is just a shame that some of his contemporaries from SNL are now too old to play themselves as they were when the show first started, or have passed on also.Jim Carrey, as first proven conclusively in The Truman Show, is a fantastic actor and deserved an Oscar.  Unfortunately the Oscars are dominated by prejudice and politics (just look at the 2001 awards!) and he didn't get it. He was robbed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Too conventional, but very well done conventionality","To truly capture the spirit of Andy Kaufmann, the movie should have been much more experimental in style, not Hollywoodizing so much the life of the man who was to comedy what John Cage is to classical music.  The one thing Andy himself would have liked the film is the last scene.  If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about and if you haven't, I won't ruin it for you.  Enough criticism, let me tell you what's good about it.  Although I believe a conventional biography format was wrong for this film, it was still a very, very good conventional biography.  I was a fan of Andy long before it was fashionable, and I've seen as much of his work as anyone of my generation (Andy died when I was 4), and Jim Carrey does such a good job that at some points (especially Mighty Mouse and The Great Gatsby) I actually forgot it wasn't really Andy playing himself.  That's how good the performance is.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best movie Jim has made and best of 1999,"Man on the Moon is an excellent movie that is both funny and sad. It's a comedy drama that makes you think.

This movie deserves consideration by the Academy for not only Best Actor, but best director and Best Picture nods.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Maybe, like Courtney Love said as Lynne Margulies, Andy's girlfriend, ""There is no REAL (Andy Kaufman).""","I really like Andy Kaufman. I grew up watching him torture the world, and I think more than a little of his brand of humor made its way into psyche and helped me become the person I am today. I saw him on SNL and Fridays (and of course Taxi). I followed the tabloids when he got sick (the web wasn't around yet, so the tabloids were still the least accurate medium of the time) because they were the only ones who seemed to really care. I remember watching a late-night news program one time showing in great detail what the charlatans like the one who treated Andy really did. I followed anything I could on Andy to the point that I even watched wrestling for a while (and believe me, back then, if you didn't live in a trailer park, you didn't admit to watching wrestling.) In high school, his bits were always some of my circles of friends' favorites to recite ad infinitum. But I never felt for a moment that I knew who Andy Kaufman really was, and unfortunately I still don't.Man on the Moon is a really good movie; there's no denying that. Jim Carrey's performance is dead on. He deserves an Oscar nom here much more so than he did for the overrated Truman Show. But when you put Milos Forman together with writers Alexander & Karaszewski for a film about a comic genius, you expect GREAT. What Man on the Moon does is give almost perfect recreations of Kaufman's most famous bits. What it doesn't do is give any real insight to what made the man this way. If A & K get a writing nom for this one, they should defer it to Andy Kaufman and his longtime writing partner, Bob Zmuda, because those two wrote over half of everything seen in this film. The recreations were fantastic; they couldn't have been better if Kaufman had come back and performed them himself. But when it came time to show what was going on in Andy's head, they were obviously stumped. Maybe the behind the mask stuff didn't test well and was cut out. I don't know. All I know is most episodes of A&E's Biography show more insight in an hour than Man on the Moon did in two. Maybe, like Courtney Love said as Lynne Margulies, Andy's girlfriend, ""There is no REAL (Andy Kaufman).""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A JOKE THAT WEARS THIN,"The early depth of character and inventive fun that this film promised in the opening scenes faded away only a third into the picture as Jim Carrey's own alter-ego tossed aside Andy Kaufman's so it looked like a Carrey biopic on Viagra, with lacklustre and bewildered support  from the ensemble actors and the badly cast Danny de Vito. As in life, compulsive practical jokers become incredibly irritating and tiresome, and the joke wore thin way before the end. A film made by Americans for Americans  most of whom seem oblivious to the shortcomings of their own over-rated and over-paid celebrities and the tackiness of most of their tv shows, which have sadly become a universal dumping ground for the rest of us.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wearing down your resistance.,"Having viewed this movie for the second time today I now find it absurdly funny that when I watched it for the first time at least four years ago, I didn't get it. My first attempt at having a look stalled about 20 minutes in because I didn't know enough about the subject and sat down assuming that Kauffman was just another comedian. To me it was Jim Carrey doing a very convincing impersonation of some stranger with a funny haircut and a silly voice. I was befuddled. It seemed almost as if the film were daring me to switch off, being deliberately unconventional at the beginning to weed out those who would only miss the point. I caved in to its creeping demand, not being prepared to think at that time.Later I learnt that it wasn't just me. Andy Kauffman himself alienated a lot of people during his lifetime with the routines he performed, and so I resolved to watch it at least a second time now that I was armed with some idea of what to expect. On my second try I saw the whole thing, and what's more, I appreciated its aim, too.The most revelatory thing about Andy's approach is that it taught people something important if they were willing to observe. It taught them just how far imagination can take a person. If you have an imagination you can set your own rules, because then you'll be living up to your own standards and nobody else's. If you don't have an audience, pretend, like it's hinted Andy did as a kid - and then at any rate you won't be crestfallen if the real thing shows up only to leave. Executives may find it infuriating that you first and foremost choose to amuse yourself, but being so fearless will surely pull in a few admirers along the way, as a bonus.""What if they don't get it?!"" ""Then I'll just keep trying until they do."" I know now that I'm living proof of this philosophy working. It took giving it a go twice, but I got there in the end! Carrey's performance is good enough to make the effort on everyones part worthwhile, no matter how long before things start to click. It'll happen sooner or later. Your resistance will wear down. Andy would've been proud, because if there's a compromise, it'll be in you and not the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jim Carrey is a better Andy Kaufman than Andy Kaufman,"Having seen this film before knowing who Andy Kaufman was, I was truly in awe of the comic genius of Carrey. I am myself A big fan of Carrey and admire the lengths he goes to create a character that is so much more than what was imagined on paper. The endearing depiction of Kaufman that Jim portrayed makes this character my favourite.I was so excited by the story of Kaufman that I had to explore his eccentric world. I watched all the episodes of Taxi with Andy in, plus the ones he refused to be in. I watched his Saturday Night Live clips and his infamous special. Kaufman brought to comedy that no (at the risk of calling him a comedian) comedian had ever done. Above all however I was fascinated at how well Carrey portrayed Kaufman. Every nuance was replicated to an auteur style degree.As a whole Foreman creates an endearing and tragic depiction of such a man who was both loved and hated. The film flows with tranquillity and you cant help but fall in love with Carrey and Kaufman. Rumour had it Edward Norton was going to take the role, in my opinion this would have been a travesty. I cant think of another actor who could play Kaufman with as much conviction as Carrey. Perhaps Spacey would have been my second call for the role. This film ranks high in both my favourite Carrey film and my favourite film. I will continue to watch it religiously.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good film, but tough to take.","While Jim Carrey's performance in this movie is excellent, the trouble is that Andy Kaufman isn't really a very likeable character. He seems to have taken the approach to comedy that mean things are funny, which is very insightful, but he makes the assumption from that that the meanest comedian is the funniest one, which isn't true. It made for great bits on Saturday night live, but two hours of this is a little like eating a three course meal flavored with nothing but cayenne pepper. It's a good movie, it's just that try as might, I didn't think it was very funny.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jim Carrey Oscarwinning Good!,"The Reason that i Give this film a 10 Star Rating is that i have seen the original Andy Kaufman and if you compare it to Jim Carrey in 'Man On The Moon' you can see actually no difference.I Must say that Jim Carrey really fit in this character, he is a exceptional comedian and for this role he was the perfect one.You can see that it takes him little effort to act as Andy Kaufman, and what's also great to see is that Jim Carrey looks a bit Like Andy, so when you think about all that the film is already great because Jim Carrey plays the roll of Andy Kaufman! The next thing that i think is so good about this film is that the film shows all the important shows of Andy.The end of the film is also well chosen, because nobody really knows if he faked his death.Like the other reviewer mentioned it is sad that it must take fifteen years after Andy's death before a film about his live is made.Jim Carrey play's excellent in this film and maybe they wanted to wait until Carrey was available to play in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Well made biopic on the eccentric and brilliant Andy Kaufman,"If you are familiar with the late and eccentric comedian Andy Kauffman then you may want to watch this. However to those who are not familiar you may find this film weird and not appreciate it for what its worth.Man on the Moon dramatizes the life of the enigma that was Andy Kauffman. Jim Carrey doesn't excel at playing Andy because he becomes Andy in the film, won't be surprised if he idolized him. The real Andy Kauffman was a unique and brilliant comedian who was ahead of his time. His comedic sketches on Saturday night live and performance in Taxi was incredible which displayed his foreign man character. He was arguably the most creative comic in the twentieth century who was well ahead of his time. Often his creativity and eccentricity was misunderstood by many as Andy was a purist in his comedy. Many saw his wrestling with women as taking it too far but never realized the joke was on Andy and not women.Jim Carrey fills large shoes very well as he impersonated Andy who impersonated a foreign man and even his other personality Tony Clifton. We saw the often misunderstood Andy through most of his career and how a few of his stints were always an act. His tragic end is also well acted by Carrey which captured the tragic end to a legendary comic. Andy Kauffman once said he would fake his death and return years later. Sadly he or Tony Clifton have not returned.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
You'll Laugh So Hard You'll Cry; You'll Cry So Hard You'll Laugh.,"I'm what one might call a casual Andy Kauffman fan...if he was on a TV show, I'd watch him (and laugh), but I didn't seek out shows just to see him perform.  Having said that, this movie really captures the essence of who Andy Kauffman thought he was.  Jim Carrey, of whom I am not a fan, turns in a remarkable performance, and everyone else in the cast is first-rate.

"An enigma, wrapped in a puzzle...","Much like the man himself, ""Man on the Moon"" is a biopic on Andy Kaufman that tell you pretty much nothing you dindn't already know. The performances are outstanding, but it plays more like a highlight show that an introspective.First off, Jim Carrey is great. You get the feeling if there's one person who might get Andy Kaufman, it's Jim Carrey. He seems to hit all the characters just right. Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda is the best of the supporting cast, and there are a number of interesting guest cameos of people playing themselves.The only problem is that all the movie seems to do is show you his various acts in succession. There's no attempt to make Kaufman out to really be anything other than the actor he was, no attempt to see what was behind the characters. Milos Forman fails to make anything out of Kaufman, to suggest anything of his persona. This is strikingly different than his last movie, ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", and this technique lacks a little. There are a couple of various, really obvious attempts to show everyone's aware he's a little nuts, not no real probe into his physche. There's also a somewhat mysterious ending, something in the true Kaufman spirit.The bottom line is basically, if you thought Andy Kaufman was funny, you'll like this movie. Otherwise, it will likely appear a bit hollow, though good for a laugh. Still, it seems the movie could have somehow been a bit better. After all, if the filmmaker's didn't stick to the facts, as the opening suggests, why not take some guesses into his inner thoughts?",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Bizarre, eccentric, and brilliant.","Man on the Moon is one of the few biopics that is able to completely capture the full persona of its subject, here being the revered comedian Andy Kaufman. The film really seems like a documentary as it perfectly captures the feeling of Kaufman's character; bizarre, off the wall, and totally original. The acting is key here, and it pays off big time. Courtney Love, Paul Giamatti, and Danny Devito are all wonderful as their respective characters who support and stand by Andy in all he does. The best performance, of course, is Jim Carrey, who is so real and convincing as Kaufman you wonder if he is still alive. The script is smoothly written and Milos Forman's directing is flawless. One of the best films of 1999, this is also one of the best biopics ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie that interestingly works 'despite itself' ...,"When it comes to misunderstood geniuses or irreverent entertainers, Milos Forman is not the least interesting director for the biopic genre. So, when he's the one who handles the film relating the life and death of one of the most brilliant and misunderstood comedians of his generation: Andy Kauffman, portrayed by THE greatest comic star of his generation : Jim Carrey, it can't get more promising than that. The result turns out to be a very good film, with a little something that could have made it better.I think that ""little something"" is easily diagnosable and is to blame on the director, because basically, the movie lacked a direction. It's interesting that Milos Forman, an international film-maker -well, at least in his sensitivity- decided to make a film about an American TV and stage icon, someone whom a majority of people, even American, wouldn't be automatically familiar with. Think about this, Mozart was an artist with an undeniable universal appeal, and even to those who didn't necessarily love classical music, ""Amadeus"" worked as an extraordinary depiction of the poisoning effect of jealousy in the envious mind. ""The People vs Larry Flynt"" involves a universe even more marginal but despite its sleaziest undertones, the films worked as an inspired pamphlet against censorship and any form of closed-minded bigotry.And this is how a biopic should work, in my humble opinion, you don't necessarily need a famous character, but you cleverly use his life, his personality as an excuse to speak much larger statement about human nature, I mentioned ""Larry Flynt"" when I could have evoked ""Chariots of Fire"" or ""Gandhi"". OR the movie should plunge us in the darkest depths of human nature, and enlighten us on the soul's mechanism that can inspire a particular behavior that would influence a certain field, ""Amadeus"" is one of them, but also ""Ed Wood"". And there is a virtuous effect on these two distinct approaches: when you transcend your character, you invite the viewer to question his own sensitivity and when you dig into your character's sensitivity, you invite the viewer to transcend his own perception of life. These are the two directions of a good biopic, higher or deeper. I'm afraid the direction of ""Man of the Moon"" is too 'linear'.Exactly what is Andy Kaufman's appeal for someone who's never heard of him or never seen any of his skits even knowing his name? In its essence, ""Man on the Moon"" is trapped in its own concept. I didn't watch the film as a fan of Kaufman, which I can't be, because I've never seen any of his acts, not even as a fan of Carrey, but as a fan of Forman whom I was sure, was going to make either a great film about the inner mechanisms of humor or a much greater depiction of the world of entertainment, like Bob Fosse's masterpiece ""Lenny"" who was also about a comedian I wasn't familiar with. But it turned out to really be about Kaufman, well, I wasn't cheated but I felt a little deceived. The film is still good, but could it have really been bad since it recreates a succession of life's episodes that are funny or intriguing indeed, with a documentary-like realism? Hence the question, what did I learn exactly that I couldn't have learned from a documentary?I feel guilty by writing these lines because overall, I enjoyed the film, hell, I can't even get the great drums moment and the catchy 'Abudabi' song off my head, the film needed more moments like the one in the Carnegie Hall, if not more intellectual, something more entertaining or appealing. But it seemed like it only tried to please people who knew about Kaufman and wanted to revive his short but brilliant career, a sort of sympathetic tribute from the buddies. Okay, but the material had so much potential, Jim Carrey's performance was full of energy and poignant vulnerability and I appreciated Danny De Vito as Shapiro, his manager, and Paul Giamatti as his buddy and co-writer. The style, if we could even speak of style, of Andy Kaufman was an excellent demonstration of the power of humor, and how you can develop some comic avant-guardism out of it. And the more I got used to the awkwardness of Kaufman, the more I expected hints if not answers, why did he do that? Why did people relate or not to that form of humor?Maybe the film's alibi is that it tried to play as a self-reflexive portrayal of Kaufman's style. Why should I expect some deep meaning from a film about a comic who didn't even expect laughs. Sure. But Kaufman, from what I understood, loathed indifference, and wanted to be either loved or hated, at least inspire a specific reaction from his audience, ""boos"" or ""cheers"" but never silence or ""meh?"". And what made the character so interesting is the way he seemed to be also insecure with compliments and cheers, as if he felt that the path to reach the comedic talent, never passed by cheap laughs, or classic styles, another reason why he detested sitcoms, with its prefabricated laughs. He was indeed ahead of his time.Buy why was he like this? We'll never know, and we all have to take his personality for granted. I'm not quite sure about the self-reflexive approach, because the film is not that subtle, I wouldn't have minded if it was longer enough to avoid the brutal ellipse from his childhood to his first act on stage, or show how Courtney fell in Love with him. Nor would I have minded if the film avoided some unnecessary gory parts that really didn't belong to the film.The strength of ""Man on the Moon"" is that there is an inner fascinating charisma inhabiting the main character, and in a way the movie succeeded thanks to Kaufman's aura and despite the direction.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milos Formans Best,"Milos Forman has made a lot of great films such as Hair, and some more than decent ones such as One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, and this Man on the Moon is probably his best. It beats One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest in pure entertainment value, one of the only things that prevented One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest from being a great film. And it beats out Hair with the fact that it has a story and is not just a bunch of songs that will stick in your head and try to make you forget its aberrant lack. Man on the Moons is chop full of energy, it zooms along like a very entertaining bullet, it is truly vibrant as is Jim Carreys, well not performance more embodiment of Andy Kaufman, he proves that the academy is truly dumb for not even nominating him once he has deserved it four times for Eternal Sunchine of the Spotless Mind, The Majestic, The Truman Show, and most of all for his best performance in Man on the Moon.

I can't claim it's not well-done,"I haven't learned anything about Kaufman outside of what was found in this film. I doubt I was aware there was a person by the name before viewing this. Unless I'm terribly mistaken, this was given to me because I once could not get enough of Carrey. I'm still a fan, but I've realized, possibly due to this and The Truman Show, that not everything he's in is going to be a laugh a minute. I can't claim to ""get"" this release. But I certainly can't deny that it's marvelously done. The plot develops nicely throughout. The performances are pretty much flawless, even by the members of the cast who aren't actually actors. Lawler is not the first wrestler I've been impressed with the screen presence of, and he may not be the last... I don't see myself ever particularly appreciating their profession, but I am going to keep an open mind for seeing them in movies. The music is well-chosen and fits. The technical aspects of this really hold little, if anything, to draw negative attention to. The pacing isn't the most even. I'm not sure if this set out to do more than describe what Andy was like, and show us his life. I did pick up on a thing or two, but beyond that, I don't understand the man, his actions or truly know... him. Maybe that is the point. Perhaps he is, was, and shall remain a mystery. Regardless of whether or not I'm utterly missing what this is, it is a nicely done piece of cinema.

About as unexplainable as Kaufman.,"""They say, 'Oh wow, Andy Kaufman, he's a really funny guy.' But I'm not trying to be funny. I just want to play with their heads.""Andy KaufmanWas Andy Kaufman a brilliant comedian far ahead of his time, or a disgraceful, unfunny, mentally unbalanced individual who had a sick desire to confuse people? This is the topic at the center of Milos Forman's screen biopic, but the movie never really reveals anything remotely interesting - or enlightening - about Kaufman. He's more of an implacable human being after the movie ends than he was before.To be fair, Carrey does a commendable job of portraying Kaufman, the man who was present for the launch of ""SNL"" on October 11th, 1975, and was later voted off of the show by callers, after producer Lorne Michaels asked his audience to decide for themselves. What's most bizarre about Kaufman, however, is that he admittedly never actually revealed himself to anyone. He was never in touch with himself, and relied on multiple personalities for amusement. Back then, he was regarded as a different sort of comedic talent, but to be blunt and honest, as much as I love the television show ""Taxi,"" I think Kaufman really did have mental problems. As a child he used to stare at his wall, pretend there were cameras and put on shows.This is where the film opens. Then it skips ahead. If there's one movie that needs more flashbacks of childhood, it is ""Man on the Moon,"" a film that should have revealed Kaufman's past, rather then present us with a fairly mediocre timeline of events that we're already aware of. What has never been explained is Kaufman's past. Which leads to a startling conclusion, and one that the filmmakers may have stumbled upon (and which may explain the reason some twenty years are cut out of the movie): Kaufman has no past.He's a man who left behind a legacy of mysteries and loose ends that were never settled. Did Kaufman stage his death?To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if he did. It sounds far-fetched, but everything Kaufman did was a hoax, from the David Letterman sequence to the ""Fridays"" disaster to showing up on the set of ""Taxi"" dressed as Tony Clifton.Lots of people mimic his style, but after a while they usually let up and break character. Andy never broke character. When he was in character, he was in character, and that leads to another interesting possibility that has been oft discussed by his fans: Was Andy Kaufman actually a valid persona? Where did this man come from? One day he was a nobody, then he was famous, then soon infamous for his awkward behavior on and off the screen. (During filming of ""Taxi,"" his manager found him in the kitchen of a restaurant, cooking fries for people and telling them he was not Andy Kaufman, despite the similarities he was always noted for.) Andy unarguably received pleasure from confusing his audience. He fit into personalities and never let go. Is it too unreasonable to suggest that Andy Kaufman was another persona he created one day? And one he eventually grew tired of and abandoned like he had with so many others? If so, then why would he do this to his family? Why would he not resurface after his adopted daughter traced her origins to Kaufman?We don't know much about Kaufman's parents, and he introduced them only once on David Letterman's shows. To be fair, they could have been paid to pose as parents, and this is exactly the type of bizarre stunt that Kaufman would be capable of pulling. Also, as a child, he reportedly liked to run away and hide and scare his parents into thinking he had gone missing.""Man on the Moon"" tackles none of these subjects. It's a straightforward timeline of Kaufman's life, sloppily constructed and quite poorly directed on the whole. This could have been a controversial, epic biopic, and it also could have been a lot funnier and insightful. Even if Forman and Carrey decided not to delve into any ""conspiracy theories"" regarding Kaufman and his origins and his ""death,"" it still would have been nice to explore his background more.Was Kaufman an utter nut case or an under appreciated comic genius? We'll probably never truly know. And that's the primary fault of ""Man on the Moon."" By the end of the movie, Kaufman is completely unexplained. We're not able to truly sympathize with him, because the movie portrays him a freak of nature. Kaufman told the press once that he never cracked a single joke. It's true. So was he funny or just a sick, demented human being who liked pulling tricks on people, and possibly pulled a final one before disappearing into the middle of nowhere, leaving behind little traces? ""Man on the Moon"" doesn't know, and it doesn't try to offer any clearer resolutions. It's about as muddled and confusing as Kaufman was. And like Kaufman, it doesn't tell us a single joke, which is really a shame.2.5/5.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

great acting from Carrey but nothing new about Kaufman,"This is one of the greatest roles Jim Carey has ever made, and certainly a role he did enjoy. The story and character of Andy Kaufman, erratic stand-up comedian who refused to be considered as a comedian, who shocked the audiences with his behavior and tricks, and manipulated them up to the point that even his tragic malady and early death were considered a farce by many fit very well Carrey and gave him the opportunity to mix his facial and body expressions with a tint of tragedy and a feeling of permanent search for a more depth truth beyond his clownesque acts. Add to this Danny DeVito's performance - also one of the best in his career and we have all reasons to consider 'Man on the Moon' as good entertainment.And yet I also had a feeling of exploit watching this movie. I never heard about Andy Kaufman before, but after having made some Internet investigation I got the feeling that the film tries to match quite closely what have been the more spectacular moments in his career, without adding too much information about who really Kaufman was. Sure, Carrey's act is more than efficient, and the story is told fluently as you would expect from a fine director like Forman, but the almost documentary remake of Kaufman's schemes, the involvement of some of the people who were really engaged with Kaufman while alive and the homages and unfit ending gave me the feeling that the authors did not really have something new to say about Kaufman but rather try to play on the same story and characters as twenty years earlier. This feeling did not have the fun one must have had watching Kaufman's real acts.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
eh plus!,Jim Carrey continues to impress with this movie and makes his fellow Canadians proud. This movie was extremely funny and very entertaining. Well put together and well acted. The great thing about this movie was that there was no boring part in it. Jim displays his amazing acting abilities here and deserves some awards. How did Tom Cruise beat him for the Golden Globe? I don't want to take anything away from Cruise who is also a fine actor but this performance by Jim as Andy Kaufman is breathe taking. The best actor I've seen in a film this year and he's got good company. I even though Michael Duncan Clarke was better then Cruise.  Overall Man on the Moon gets a 9 on my scale and Carrey gets a standing ovation!,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Funny, warm, and entertaining but the film has one giant flaw.","""Man on the Moon"" is a funny film only in the fact that what Andy Kaufman did was sadistically funny.  Jim Carrey, who has stated that he ""became"" Andy Kaufman does a great impersonation, at best.  The biggest flaw for me was the question: Why watch one funnyman's impression of another funnyman? Why not just watch Kaufman's original material as performed by the man himself?  With that point aside, director Milos Foreman and his talented cast (including Courtney Love, Danny DeVito, and a great Paul Giamatti) do bring back the Kaufman gags with high energy and maximum laugh appeal.  The film becomes unexpectedly touching in its last moments and Carrey does a tremendous job with his material.  I would reccommend it, but again, why not see Kaufman's genius (or moronic/psychotic tendencies, depending on who you are) performed by the man himself? Grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"so, you don't like being had","You don't like being had. You don't like the fact that someone sees past your eyes. You want them to stop somewhere short of a vision of your soul. Andy didn't. Couldn't. That was his curse. As much as he had contempt for your need to be entertained, indeed, your presumption of a ""right"" to be entertained, he had a sincere desire to entertain. Tony Clifton is not a spoof, Tony Clifton is the avatar of this presumption. It is what happens when the machines begin to make machines. You think that CBS logo is an anomaly? No, you are caught in its all seeing eye, so even when you disdain the meal and want to send it back to the kitchen, that's entertainment.",,Anonymous,Biography
Mr. Fred Blassie And The Breakfast Mess,"The title of ""Man on the Moon"" was taken from REM's musical tribute to Andy Kaufman, a comedian/performance artist from the 1970s and 1980s who dotted the entertainment landscape of that era in many unforgettable ways.Kaufman (Jim Carrey) is brought to life by Carrey in a way no other actor could have accomplished, and it is clear from the film that Carrey himself, and his over-the-top performances, had been influenced by Andy. One got the impression from the film that Carrey reacted as we might expect a Bishop or a Cardinal to react when told he is to play the Pope. Carrey's reverence for Kaufman shines through in every aspect of an incredibly deep, Oscar-worthy performance.Carrey overshadows what is actually a very strong cast. Danny DeVito (George Shapiro) plays Andy's agent, and since those two actors worked together for years on Taxi, DeVito's personal history with Andy bolstered his ability to grasp the role. Shapiro is written as a man caught between a one-of-a-kind artist and the establishment attempting to profit from him by fitting him into their little box, a box Andy not only thought, but lived outside of.Courtney Love (Lynne Margulies) was well-suited for her role as Andy's wife, much as she was suited for People vs. Larry Flynt. Her energy and feistiness made her believable as the one woman who could handle the man no one else ever could. Paul Giamatti (Bob Zmuda) is Andy's best friend and co-conspirator, and has gone on to much bigger and better things after an excellent performance here. Appearances are made by most of the rest of the cast of Taxi (except for Tony Danza), while other figures in the movie have their real-life versions blending in with the crowd, such as George Shapiro as a club owner who fires Andy, Lynne Margulies as one of the mourners at the funeral. Jim Carrey's ex-wife also appears as the waitress in the recreation of ""My Breakfast With Blassie,"" which also includes Jerry Lawler and Fred Blassie.I never obsessed over Andy's antics as they were occurring, but I was aware of them. His ""Mighty Mouse"" theme performance on SNL's first show was a spoof of the ""musical guest"" concept (and brilliant), while the wrestling incidents, though staged, fooled almost all of the major media, who had grown so weary of pranks from Andy that they just assumed that his announcement that he had cancer was just another trick, but the ""punchline"" was sadly true, and Andy died much too young (35). It is true that Andy continued to bus tables in LA after working on Taxi, to keep his ""independence."" His reply to people who said he looked like Andy Kaufman was honest and brilliant: ""I get that all the time,"" he would say.Of all of Andy's work, ""My Breakfast With Blassie"" is the one which history will smile upon the most. Of all of Jim Carrey's work, this film is likely to enjoy the same fate. It's a shame that the Academy did not take a grown-up view of a mature comedian giving a mature performance that rivals anything done by any actor of that year, or even historically.The film captures Andy's brilliance, creativity, and refusal to change himself or his act for his audience, instead choosing to make us come to him and understand what he was saying, without any help or explanation from him.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Entertaining Look At The Life Of Andy Kaufman,"Jim Carrey does a nice job in his roll as Andy Kaufman. How much you enjoy it might be directly related to what you thought of the real Andy. It is well acted with an amazing performance by Danny Devito as Kaufman's agent. You will be constantly guessing as to what is really happening and what is a comic scam. Nothing is what it seems which was the genious of Andy Kaufman himself. My tastes are far different in what is funny and what is not, but still I was fascinated by the story of a young man who seemingly had it all but rejected it in favor of doing his own thing. If you liked Andy, this is a 8. If you did not, it will probably still be a 7. The last 20 minutes are really worth waiting for.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Hello My Name is Andy, and This is My Review","From a comedy aspect, I misunderstood it and at times found the movie hard to get around. But the Man on the Moon tells the odd yet interesting tale of Andy Kauffman, perfectly. Andy Kauffman was an eccentric funny man who died before being understood. Often called a comedian but described himself as a song and dance guy.This is probably the one of the most accurate biography movies ever told. With every actor doing they're bit. If you watch actual footage of Andy Kauffman which was in the movie, you will see just how alike it is to the film. Jim Carrey was the best possible actor for this role. And this film really shows the talent that Jim Carrey has, the ability to be absolutely hilarious then flick to emotional and serious.It depicts Andy's life perfectly. And what a life he had. Andy was the kind of guy who took a joke to its furthest extent. He was unpredictable, original, eccentric and good hearted. I actually genuinely think that he was the founder of Modern Wrestling.Man on the Moon is a marvelous, accurate portrayal of the unusual man, Andy Kauffman.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Carrey superbly embodies Kaufman's weirdness and complexity,"I was never Andy Kaufman's biggest fan, althou I laughed at Latka Gavras along with everyone else, but this is much more interesting.

A Complicated Person And A Complicated Movie,"The truth is that I should not have enjoyed this movie. First, I'm not really that interested in Andy Kaufman. To be honest I don't think I ever watched even a single episode of ""Taxi."" Second, I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey. He has talent, but he usually overacts and goes way overboard rather than letting his talent shine through. Third, I honestly didn't think this movie was great, although based on the content and what it tells us about Andy Kaufman my reaction to it may have been what he would have wanted - I just found that after the first little while it became too much. My gut was telling me that this movie (and the guy portrayed in it) was plain irritating. So why did I keep watching? Because, for some inexplicable reason and in spite of all that, this movie worked somehow. Maybe it's because of how Andy was described by his girlfriend Lynne Margulies (played by Courtney Love) - he was ""a complicated person."" The complicated nature of Andy Kaufman creates interest, even if the movie itself isn't all that great. His life - portrayed here from his childhood to his death - was a complicated one. You wonder having seen it whether there really was an Andy Kaufman - by which I mean, did he actually have an identity of his own or was his identity completely caught up in and submerged by the characters he created and played? I found myself admiring his take on comedy - not going for the easy laughs but instead going for the gut reaction of the audience, whether that gut reaction was positive or negative; whether it caused laughter or anger. I can imagine that one would not walk away from one of his routines feeling neutral about him.The other redeeming thing about the movie - my opening comments notwithstanding - is Jim Carrey. If ever there was a part that Jim Carrey was born to play I would have to say that it was Andy Kaufman. All of Carrey's excesses that usually bother me so much were on display here in abundance, but they seemed to be a perfect fit with what we were being told about Andy Kaufman. I've seen a fair number of Jim Carrey's movies over the years but now that I've seen this one I'd have to say that this is his signature part - in my mind anyway. It was a stunning piece of casting.It's strange to say this about a movie that I can't say I liked all that much - but in spite of not really ""liking"" it I enjoyed it. I think Andy Kaufman might understand that reaction. Both he and the movie were ""complicated."" (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
He Went to the Moon and Never Came Back,"I have to say that besides his name and the fact that he was a comedian, I didn't know anything much about Andy Kaufman. One thing that the movie did was raising interest in me about that peculiar artist's life and work (I'm going to do my homework now). On that basis, I can't say how much justice the movie did to Andy Kaufman, but one thing is sure - he probably was the most annoyingly interesting artist out there. And he seemed truly to be out there. By the time 'Man on the Moon' came out, Jim Carrey's serious acting talents weren't that big surprise anymore. And in here he proved again that he's much more capable than being Ace Ventura.The film itself is quite a classical story about rising to fame, and about artistic integrity. The wide audience has always been the same - demanding the same funny skit over and over again, while the artist has something new to say. And all the producers also want you to do the same - be safe, but funny. I guess the real genius of Andy Kaufman lied about how he handled these situations, rather than his brand of humor.'Man on the Moon' manages to be warm, intelligent and inspiring all at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An average movie at best,"I'm not sure exactly what to make of the latest Jim Carrey film, Man on the Moon.  I can only assume that the film seeks to provide insight into the life of Andy Kaufman (Carrey); show something of the man behind the act.  If that's the case, I am also forced to assume that writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski just didn't have much information to work with.For example, we learn very little of Kaufman's relationship with girlfriend Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love).  And as for the film's habit of revealing every single one of Kaufman's acts as fakes, mere practical jokes on the viewer, there aren't many people left who don't know that for themselves.The main problem with the movie is that much of it is simply recreations of Kaufman's varied acts, from the Saturday Night Live ""Mighty Mouse"" routine, to different clips from ""Taxi,"" to his wrestling performances with Jerry Lawler.  Carrey is an admirable Kaufman, becoming the late comedian so well that one forgets it's Jim Carrey up there.  But so what?  Anyone going to see the movie is probably familiar with Kaufman's act, and if they're not they probably won't find it that funny.I don't have much to say about this movie.  The basic plot simply runs through Kaufman's life from the time he gets his big break via George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), through ""Taxi,"" which he never really wanted to do, through his (entirely staged) run-ins with Jerry Lawler, and finally through his death.  The movie's ending is left intentionally ambiguous.  Did Andy Kaufman fake his own death?  Is the king of convincing pranks pulling a huge one on the world?  Probably not.  But it's something to think about as you leave the movie.Because not much else in it is particularly thought-provoking. B-",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a piece of crap,"How can this movie be described as a comedy? It's absolutely awful. What is fun in this movie?? Kaufman's jokes (if any) aren't even jokes, he just acts like a complete idiot.

I had to turn it off after an hour or so to ease the pain. It's more fun to be castrated without anaesthetics than watching this film.I give it 1/10.

Just Okay,"""Man On the Moon I though was a fair film.  I find Andy's humor a little off the wall for my tastes, and sometimes down right annoying from everything from his voice to his eye movement.  So far, for the year of 1999, the best picture so far has to be ""American Beauty"" followed by a close second with ""The Insider.""  Both films have showed magnificent star power, outstanding screenplays' and flawless directing.  I have yet to see ""Magnolia"" but I have a feeling that one is going to be a leading contender.With the Golden Globe nominations out and the Oscar nods just around the corner, one wondering if there is going to be a film to sweep the top 5 nominations (I.E.

Moon on the Man?,"In a way, Carrey-as-Kaufman's opening objections to the movie ring truer than the filmmakers probably intended.  The film is, as many here have noted, a mostly shallow biography.  It is saved only somewhat by a terrific impersonation and a fascinating subject.I'm not a Johnny-come-lately to either the Kaufman or Carrey bandwagons.  I dug Andy from his SNL appearances on -- always saw the genius subtext of every ballsy bit he tried, even the ""controversial"" wrestling stuff.  And I liked Carrey from ""In Living Color"" on...in addition to becoming a fine actor, he has become perhaps the most talented physical comedian since Buster Keaton.  It's fitting that they both have the same birthday...this is truly a match made in comedy heaven.So for that reason, and almost that reason alone, the movie is worth seeing at least once.  But man, what a botched attempt at a great film!   We get overly simplified transitions between Kaufman bits, a woefully slight treatment of Kaufman's developing years (Why TM?  Why Zmuda?  Why the ""performance art"" approach?), and a sloppy approach to the details of Kaufman's life (for example, no mention that he did ""Van Dyke & Company"" before ""Taxi""; that Dick Ebersol, not Lorne Michaels, produced SNL when Kaufman was fired from the show...and where was Elayne Boosler, a close pal and former girlfriend of Andy's?  Her presence was acknowledged not at all.)It's almost a shame to waste a great performance like Carrey's on a movie this compromised and lame (it does look as if it were brutally edited.) Someday, I hope, another fine actor will take on portraying Andy, and be supported by a director, writer and producer more committed to providing insight about Kaufman the man.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A tale of an artist too dedicated to his art.,"Coming in to see this film, I had watched a Biography episode on him and thought that Andy Kaufman was a real example of a pure artist who put his art ahead of commercial success.  According to this film, that would seem to be the case, but also that that kind of stance is not always a good idea.This film seems to show Andy as a performer with the soul of an artist, but lacked the instincts of a showman.  In other words, he and Zmuda were boldly original in their humour, but they too often failed to convey the humour to the audience. For instance, when Andy orders the verticle hold on the footage of his special put deliberately monkeyed with, there is no effort to let the audience in on the joke, not even a knowing wink to the camera. Compare this with Monty Python, who put out equally crazed and original comedy of their own, but they had the essential performing skill to include the audience in the humour and let them enjoy it.In short, this film is an intriguing testament of the need for the balance of artistic challenge for the artist and the need for the audience to entertained at the same time.  This movie showed that Andy, however stunningly original he was, could not achieve that balance and paid the price.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A positive surprise,"First of all I have to say that I really don't like Jim Carrey. After movies like ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Ace Ventura"" even the excellent ""Truman Show"" could not change my opinion. Also I have never heard of an Andy Kaufman before so I had no other reason to go see this movie then avoiding an argument with my girlfriend.But hey! What a surprise! Jim Carrey does an outstanding performance in this one. He really seems to be this Andy Kaufman with all his freakiness and ingenuity. Also Danny De Vito and Courtney Love (both not on my love-list either) do a great job.The most surprising thing to me: I was really emotionally touched by the story of Andy Kaufman. Through all the madness and fun there's a underlying feeling of melancholy and sadness.Despite it's length the movie never gets boring, due to good timing by Foreman and the fact that Kaufman had so many crazy ideas. But I could imagine that Man on the Moon is not so exciting for those who know Andy Kaufman well already and are not fans of him.For all others: a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Reasonable tribute to Andy Kaufman,"With 'Man On The Moon', director Milos Forman has produced an appropriate tribute to comedian Andy Kaufman in that he has tried, successfully in parts, to blur the lines between Kaufman's twisted imagination and reality. The audience is left questioning sometimes which parts of the film are the reality in Kaufman's life, and which parts are just a stunt created by Kaufman.  The film is slightly frustrating because of that, but it's probably the way the director wanted it.  The opening sequence is superb, accenting the sense of humour owned by Kaufman.Jim Carrey's performance is outstanding in a part that's perfect for him as it allows him to show both his rubber faced comedy talent as well as his potential for serious acting.The main fault with the film is the amount of information it tries to get in in too little time.  Trying to fit an entire mans life into 2 hours is difficult and will lead to bits being cut short, and that is exactly what happens in Man on the Moon.  Kaufman's rise to fame is barely documented, although his fall from fame is given a lot more screentime and so I'm guessing that it was decided as more important, which is fair enough.This is obviously a must-see if you are a fan of Andy Kaufman, and is a recommended watcher for everyone else as it's an often funny, occasionally heart warming comedy/drama7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Carrey completely embodies Kaufman,"The film is incredible.  I have been a big fan of Jim Carrey for years, and I have been a fan of Andy Kaufman for even longer, but after a while I could barely tell the difference between the two.  Carrey's performance alone is worth the price of admission.  The acting of the other main characters is excellent, although some of the roles, especially Courtney Love's, were rather limited.  Paul Giammanti is seen a lot but his character is not used to its full extent.However, these two complaints are only minor ones when taken in the whole scope of the movie.  The story really brings you into it, and even those who aren't fans of Kaufman are drawn in.  The man portrayed is not a saint by far, perhaps not even likable at times, but Carrey and director Milos Foreman make him utterly intriguing.

Best not to go in blind,"I went in vaguely knowing who Kaufman was but not to any real extent. That is to say, I couldn't tell you much other than he was in Taxi and considered both unusual and talented. On reflection I think that worsened the experience for me considerably.With subsequent research I can confirm that Carey performs remarkably here. He continuously surprised me with his acting ability (though I do not enjoy his comedic ventures), and I'll also mention that - though a much smaller role - Love is pretty solid too.What the film lacks is context of Kaufman's absurdity. And some of that lies on the audience's shoulders. This is a movie, not a documentary after all. It was at times an annoying watch, likely intentionally. It was also at times quite touching and sincere. The mystery to Kaufman's madness be it perceived or genuine remains with me and I suppose that's the whole point of his work. What is real? And if I'm entertained, does it even matter?Again, had I known more about him perhaps I'd have enjoyed the movie more. I was interested throughout but not necessarily entertained. Some scenes linger beyond their welcome. Likely this is to create a longer testimony toward Kaufman, but it weakened things for me.

character film,"Long before Titanic and Brookheimer, there was films such as Raging Bull or Chinatown. Films about characters. The story was not that important, it was just a scope for the film, but now it becomes more and more a cage. Of course there are films just for entertainment, just for having fun and feeling good. But those films I´m talking about and Man on the Moon by Milos Forman is part of them can give more to the audience. Identification, not by the the story of a person, but of his heart. Jim Carrey gave his heart to a man, died before a long time, and he played him such as he was alive again. Nobody can believe this man seen on the screen is not Andy Kaufman. But there are people who just don´t like Jim Carrey and they don´t give him a chance. His role in Truman Show was the beginning of a career which can present us an actor with an unbelievable tragicomedy. And Man on the moon is in a direct way tragicomically. The viewer feels for this lifetime clown and he loves him. This film is something for everybody. It doesn´t work with loud sound, it is just straight to our feelings.

Man on the Moon,"I do vaguely recall Andy Kaufman in ""Taxi"" but the remainder of this rather zany depiction of his life just reminded me of a compendium of the ""Goon Show"" meets ""Mork and Mindy"". His sense of what was entertaining was eclectic to say the least, and his stand-up routines reminded me a little of Peter Sellers when he was using his exaggerated (European) accents to try and get a laugh. Nobody is much interested in these stage shows until talent agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) spots him and sees something original about his talents. Exposure on television followed, then his casting in the sitcom about New York's amiable mix of yellow cab drivers - the series that made the name of Danny DeVito too - before he embarked on a curious and one-sided career wrestling women. It was this latter profession that introduced him to male wrestler Jerry Lawler who tired of this and took to fighting him man-to-man. Needless to say, he's no match for the man with the ""Piledriver"" so has to resort to other ways to keep ahead of the ever changing entertainment game. His behaviour becomes more erratic and soon nobody with a television camera will touch the man... Jim Carrey is a natural at these quirky and over-the-top interpretations, and here is no different. He immerses himself into the role and manages to very successfully convey the sheer irritation factor of this man who had practically no talent but an ability to pander the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" theory to an audience who thought, initially, it better to laugh with the crowd than to scratch their heads and wonder what they were actually laughing at. On that front, Milos Forman has created a cleverly structured biopic of a man who was flawed and obsessed and who was fuelled by a market place desperate for something different. What I didn't feel here was any empathy for Kaufman. The industry is hard, cruel and unforgiving to the best of them and maybe it is a testament to the acting, but I genuinely felt this person hadn't the skills required to entertain at an holiday camp for the hard of hearing. Maybe it's more relevant to Americans who can better associate with their standard and style of 1970s television programming but as an observer from elsewhere this come cross as entirely self indulgent.

Carrey diserved an Oscar,"This movie should be watched by everyone who descide's to become an actor. Milos Foreman and the scriptwriters did a great job; they found a way to let the viewer taste the great sense of humour of Kaufman, but still surprise you with some intelligent shots, so that you've know that you have been tricked by the same way, Andy Kaufman tricked his audience.

Great job by Forman, I nominate this for best picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sometimes Compelling But Can't Quite Capture The Full Kaufman Spirit,"Every once in a while, a character comes along in a given profession that makes us completely re-evaluate what the parameters of the genre can be. That is exactly what Andy Kaufman did for comedy in the 1970s & 80s. While director Milos Forman's ""Man on the Moon"" captures certain parts of that essence, it is nearly impossible to accurately portray what Kaufman meant to society--for better or worse--at that time.For a very basic overview, this film examines the rise of Kaufman (Jim Carrey) from lounge act comedian to Saturday Night Live fixture and Taxi TV star. This of course also includes his women-wrestling antics, feud with Jerry ""The King"" Lawler (portrayed by himself), and odd portrayal of the Tony Clifton (Carrey again--mostly) character. In an abbreviated time window, Kaufman popularized a sort of ""comedy anarchy"" that bamboozled audience and pushed the medium to the breaking point. His friendship with Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti) and romance with Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love) factor heavily into the proceedings.Strictly on the back of Carrey's performance, I'll never call ""Man on the Moon"" a bad movie. Carrey is so dead-on as Kaufman that side-by-side comparisons are nearly identical. From the odd voice and mannerisms to Kaufman's ""real life"" (whatever that actually was) persona, Carrey is transcendent here. The film also does a decent job of exploring the oddball humor that Kaufman perpetuated and how no one ever knew if his schtick was real or ""just part of the act"".Unfortunately, ""Man on the Moon"" suffers from two key issues that prevent it from being great:First, I think those--unlike myself--who experienced Kaufman first-hand will like this movie better than I. There is so little context given to Kaufman's antics here that such past prologue is extremely helpful (and a glaring weakness when not present in the viewer).Also, I just think it is extremely difficult to capture Kaufman's unique essence another medium removed from ""the real thing"". A film--especially a biopic--has to sustain a narrative and Kaufman was all about upending such conventions and making audiences as uncomfortable as possible (with the ultimate goal of wearing them down and winning them over eventually). That might just be too tall of a task for any singular film or director to tame.Overall, though, I basically enjoyed ""Man on the Moon"" and will largely remember it for Carrey's remarkable performance. Truth be told, however, the 2017 Netflix documentary ""Andy & Jim: The Great Beyond"" which covers the making of this movie is actually even more compelling than its source material, as it gets closer to Kaufman's comedic roots.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An excellent portrayal of a very unlikable person,"I only knew of Kaufman from his work on 'Taxi'. I bought this DVD because I had heard that it was a great performance by Jim Carrey, portraying one of his idols, and I figured I would learn a bit about Kaufman. The thing is, it was a great performance by Carrey and I did learn a lot about Kaufman. I learned that he was remarkably unfunny and a pain in the ass. I learned that the only thing he did that I enjoyed was 'Taxi' and that Kaufman hated being on the show, and most of the other regulars could not stand him. In short, this is a well made, well acted movie about an extremely unlikable person who seemed to enjoy irritating everyone around him. His only redeeming talent was portraying a character on a show that he did not enjoy. Watching the movie was not an enjoyable experience, and I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you are a big Kaufman fan. It is difficult to express my feelings upon reaching the end of the movie. I did not care a bit for Kaufman, but Carrey did an excellent job of portraying him. What baffles me is why anyone would want to make a move about this guy. I give it 1 out of 10, and only because Carrey did such a great job of convincing me that he was Kaufman.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not So Much a Celebration of Any Comic Figure as a Portrait of One's Passionate Agenda and Pursuit of It Until the End, No Matter How Strange It Was","What is most important about the effect of this film is that it stays faithful to Andy Kaufman's intractable conception. Oh, it polishes things up slightly. Indeed, ""all the most important things in my life are changed around and mixed up for dramatic purposes,"" Kaufman tells us directly at the ingenious beginning, which is a brilliant tone-setter. Yet fundamentally it remains allegiant to his personage: A guy who would try you, lie to you and orchestrate laborious tricks and facades. The movie doesn't manufacture him into a tender, misread guy. And it doesn't grovel for laughs. When something is not working in Kaufman's act, it's not working in the movie, either, and it's not funny but excruciating.Written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karascewski, the same writing team who penned Tim Burton's similarly visceral biopic of another obsessively off-kilter aspiring artisan, Ed Wood, this nuanced film has a monumental performance from Jim Carrey, who auspiciously vanishes within the character of Andy Kaufman. Carrey is as big a star as Hollywood has, and still rather early in Milos Forman's eighth American movie, we forget who is playing Kaufman and become enmeshed in what is happening to him. Carrey is himself an obsessive performer who will do anything to get a laugh, who wants to amuse, whose veneer is zany and saccharine. That he can extract the intricacies of Kaufman's comedic misery is quite awe- inspiring. That he can quench his own compulsion to kowtow takes a sort of maturity nobody expected out of Ace Ventura. Not only is he working without his own buffer, he's playing a guy who didn't know what that even was.The film, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, begins with Kaufman as a vexatious child in his room, declining to go out and play, preferring to host his own TV variety program for the cameras he perceived to be concealed in his bedroom walls. His material was compelled by poor nightclub and lounge acts. He understood that a live performance is seldom more intriguing than when it is going wrong.This highly creative, admirably relentless movie, which because people are stupid ended the then nearly decade-long succession of Jim Carrey movies that had very successful opening nights, follows Kaufman into the L.A. standup circuit, where a talent manager played by real- life former Kaufman co-star Danny DeVito, sees something in his act and signs him. Kaufman is soon a sitcom star, a regular on Taxi. He presses for ""guest bookings'' for his ""protege,'' a hilariously repugnant lounge act named Tony Clifton, who is played behind seamless makeup by Kaufman and sometimes by his accomplice Bob Zmuda. Kaufman steadfastly refuses to admit he is Clifton, and in a way, he isn't.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movie of the Year,"This was the best movie I have seen all year.  I have seen it twice already and I want to see it again but it has already left the theater I go to. Jim Carrey was great in it.

Man on the Moon has done something that very few movies have done to me and that is it got me interested in the topic of the movie which happens to be Andy Kaufman.

Rather ordinary,"This was a rather ordinary commonplace biography about a very uncommon person.  Jim Carrey was good as Andy Kaufman.  Just good, not great.  When doing Kaufman's great acts Carrey was seen as acting the parts; Andy Kaufman became the parts.  When you saw Andy imitate Elvis you were struck by the transformation from the nervous geek to the swaggering super confident king. Jim Carrey made it seem to be another imitation.  Maybe I was spoiled by seeing the original.  Courtney Love was surprisingly effective.  Tony Clifton was absolutely fabulous.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely Brilliant!  Jim Carrey Gives His Best Performance!,"I finally got to see this movie on video.  Unfortunately I never got to see it in the theatre, especially since I am a huge Andy Kaufman fan.  At the end of this film I was a amazed.  Jim Carrey was Andy Kaufman!!!  He was brilliant!  I can't believe he was not nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor.  It just goes to show how some people at the Academy can be jealous of younger talent.  The movie in itself was extremely entertaining.  Even though it was 2 hours long, I wish there was more.  Some people don't seem to understand Andy Kaufman, and why he is so popular.  Well this film shows what kind of a person he was for real life, not just his characters on stage and on the television.  And to tell you the truth, his character traits and himself are not that different.  To me Andy Kaufman was unlike any other comedian who has ever existed.  No one at this time believed it was funny to laugh at someone else's expense, or to trick people of something truly horrible.  Today we see that all the time, and it would have to be all because of Andy Kaufman.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good...but not Great,"""Man on The Moon"" is a good movie, but is not great.For the first three quarters of the movie, I felt like I was watching a compilation tape of Andy Kaufman's greatest hits, which is good, but I'd rather just watch an old video of Kaufman. There was no exposition into the personality or life of Andy until the final few minutes of the movie.I was also confused by Courntey Love's presence in the movie. We meet her, she hates Andy, then she goes on a date with him, then she is marrying him, then they are going out, and then they move in together. This is representitive of the major problem with the movie, it jumps around from major point in Andy's life to major point, while avoiding specifics.I thought that there were few minor factual anecdotes that were missing that would have worked nicely. First, when Andy, on Letterman, wearing neck brace and all, apologizes to his parents, and says ""I know I've never said this before, but I love you."" Putting that in would have made the movie a lot better. Also, there was no mention of his daughter that he put up for adoption.I also thought that since ""Taxi"" was a major part of Andy's life, Foreman could have dedicated more then a short montage to it.Carrey was good when playing Andy playing someone else, but seemed, when he was playing ""Andy"" Andy, was varying. Danny Devito was good, and seemed to really enjoy his part.If you are a big fan of Kaufman's work, want to find out about it, or indeed want to find out about what part's of Andy's routine was real or not, then this is the movie for you. If you are looking for the method and reasoning behind the man, then this really doesn't work.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A review by a Kaufman admirer that loved this film.,"I just saw this movie, and it was terrific. I loved it! Andy Kaufman was a comic genius, but no one really understood him, which was part of his mystery. This incredible movie does a superb job of telling his story, and letting those who never heard of him, as well as those who hated him, know exactly who he was, and why he did what he did. Jim Carrey definitely deserves an Oscar for this (and I'm NOT a big Jim Carrey fan!). Courtney Love once again makes her acting talent known, and I've never seen Danny DeVito show this much emotion. Paul Giamatti (best known as ""Pig Vomit"" from ""Private Parts"") also adds to the cast with his supporting role as Comic Relief creator and Kaufman cohort Bob Zmuda. I recommend this movie to anyone that ever loved or hated Andy Kaufman, as well as those who didn't quite know what to think of him or don't know who he is. It is a remarkable look into the life of a misunderstood comic genius, who left this life too early....or did he?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Reenactments add little to Andy Kaufman,"Jim Carrey was uncanny in his impression of Andy Kaufman.  The film seemed to move along point by point recreating each significant event in the comedy career of Andy Kaufman, but it did little to add insight to who he was and what he was trying to do.  His sense of humor was well relayed but the characters lacked depth.  The relationship between Andy and Lynne Margolis was particularly underdeveloped despite a fine job by Courtney Love.

"Hello I come from Caspiar, the small island in Caspian sea which sunk","This is one of my favourites. Even I dont know Andy Kaufman - i was only a kid when he died, but this movie made me adore him.

Most people probably think that Andy is a big loser, but as u can see especially in last scenes (Carnegie Hall) he was a very good man - this is real life - as mentioned by Bob Zmuda in the movie - dont believe everything what u see. I saw all of the movies from Milos Forman and I think that this is the best one (but its only my opinion - maybe fans of Cucko's nest or Amadeus will disagree).

What made the man tick?,"As one of the few Brits to have heard of Andy Kaufman before his death in 1984, I was intrigued at this biopic of him as played by Jim Carrey.To be sure it was a good movie, with a first-class performance by Carrey, but I felt a feeling of detachment from this film. I feel we never really ever got to see the real Kaufman in this biopic. Instead it relied on the old standby of the 'misguided genius' and that the world never really understood what made Kaufman tick. After this movie, which attempted to explain what made Kaufman tick, never got near to what I feel made Kaufman tick.

Very Average,"Some things about this movie are pretty good, but for the most part it is incredibly blah. Jim Carrey does a pretty good Andy Kauffman impersonation, but if I wanted to watch Andy's standup, I would watch the 2 specials that are on Comedy Central all the time, which are hilarious. The material from these 2 specials make up more than half of this movie, but with Jim Carrey instead of Andy. Many of the things that were wrong with Ali are wrong with this movie as well. Much like anyone interested in Ali is probably familiar with Ali's boxing, everyone who would be interested in this movie are at least a little familiar with his standup, so why make it the focus of the movie. It would have been far better if the focus would have been on Andy's personal life and his struggle with cancer. The end of the film does focus on this, but waiting through the first hour and 15 minutes is a waste of time.",,Anonymous,Biography
Andy Kaufman's soul was in Jim Carrey's body,"Before the movie ""Truman Show"" came out to the screen, i saw Jim Carrey as an commedian and nothing more.

A spectacular piece of art,"Jim Carrey manages to pull off a tremendously difficult role with this film. How to honestly portray someone who was not a very good person. Sure, it's less difficult to a Nazi psychopath or some other sicko, but how do you let the audience in on the fact that the person they thought they knew wasn't who they thought.So it takes another misunderstood genius to adequately describe him. Andy Kaufman was an artist, but a jerk, a lot of people knew this, but not the vast majority of his fans. Now we know. His goal in life was to annoy people and he was very talented at it. He could also sometimes do comedy, but mostly he spent his time trying to figure out how to annoy the most people he could. He went after pro wrestling fans because he perceived them as being easily deceived and annoyed. He couldn't stand his day job, so he tried to destroy it.It must have been insanely difficult to portray Andy. To be able to bring a mass audience into his mind, to not sugar coat anything and to make the audience understand someone in a completely new light is film making art at its highest level.That doesn't mean that this was a particularly enjoyable film to watch. Much like a lot of expressive art, it's not supposed to just be a pretty thing to enjoy. Anyone could represent an uncomplicated concept well enough for thoughtful people to understand. Representing a complex subject well enough for average people to understand takes great skill.There were a few minor annoyances about the film and I can't say that there was much to laugh about, but Jim's acting makes this a solid 8/10 in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good but missing something.,I liked it but I felt Jim Carrey's performance was a little too over the top for my taste and as a fan of Kaufman's.  Bob Zmuda's book is much better than this movie and I have not finished reading it yet.  It just seemed too quick and choppy to do Andy's life and career justice.  Too much on Tony Clifton and the wrestling and less on Andy himself.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Powerful triumph for Milos Forman, Jim Carrey.","Going in I was leary. Andy Kaufmann, Jim Carrey? Kaufmann was described to me as a loony whenever described, and maybe he was, but what the writers, actors, and director Milos Forman have done is show us Andy (his true side?) at his best. I'm not going spoil anything but there's a few times in the film that you will be fooled by Andy's humor, but in the end, you'll love every second of it. You'll love Andy. You'll love Carrey for bringing Andy back for 2 hours. And it'll leave you questioning if any of it was really funny at all, or just a really damn good try.I thought that this film towered over Forman's last exploration of a misleading personality, in ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"", which struggled to show the torment of Hustler magazine's founder fighting for his first amendment rights. ""Man on the Moon"" doesn't waste time showing us every one of Andy's vices, but instead shows enough for us to know that he had them, but they didn't overcome him, the story stayed with Andy. In ""Larry Flynt"" it was sometimes diverted to his wife, Althea, also played by Courtney Love (as was Andy's girlfriend). In short, a touching history of a man trying his best in a business that sporadically awards greatness on a whim. In my mind, this film awards Andy his final world champion belt, in true form, thanks to Jim Carrey. A 9.8 out of 10, but I round down, so this fell to a 9 out of 10. But please, don't miss it... and don't walk out after the first 2 minutes, that was just a joke.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Unique And Chaotic Andy Kaufman,"Even as an adult, Andy Kaufman had a child-like personality. He liked to play elaborate, childish pranks and hoaxes on his unsuspecting audience. A big part of the plot details some of those pranks. He was also well known for doing a very good impersonation of Elvis. And of course his ""Latka"" was a major character in the 1970s sitcom ""Taxi"".Kaufman had a unique outward persona that made him easily recognizable. In ""Man On The Moon"", Jim Carrey captures that persona well. Carrey's performance is probably the best element of the film.But there are a couple of problems with the movie. First, too much time is spent on these pranks and hoaxes. Just a little of the nasal and obnoxious ""Tony Clifton"" goes a long way. I would have preferred more emphasis on Andy's personal life rather than so much time on his various ""acts"", such as Clifton and the TV wrestling bits. Which leads to the second problem.It's true that Kaufman's relationship with his audience was significant. But in this film there are way too many camera shots of the audience. Even worse is their hyped-up expressions. Many of Kaufman's performances are neither funny nor bad; they do not evoke much response of any kind. Yet people in these irksome audiences gush with animation every time Kaufman does so much as move his eyes back and forth or pauses in silence. Audience over-reaction is one strike against the film's Director.Though Kaufman could be humorous, and many people regard him as a comedian, I would not put this film in the comedy genre. Indeed, there's an undercurrent of sadness throughout, owing mostly to Kaufman's death at an early age. The film has a poignant ending.Although somewhat superficial, ""Man On The Moon"" is a reasonably interesting biography of an enigmatic entertainer who died too young. I admired Kaufman's uniqueness. And he came along at just the right time, in the late 70s and early 80s, a chaotic time culturally, a perfect historical fit for a chaotic personality.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Oddly Heartless Movie, Misses Andy's ""Cherubic"" Persona","I was a big Andy Kaufman fan (yes, even the inter-gender wrestling stuff) and was looking forward to the movie. Jim Carrey tries SO hard in it, and Danny DeVito and Courtney Love just spend the film reacting to him. But they can't overcome an oddly anachronistic script (Carter president in 1975? All of Me and ET out in 1980? I don't think so...) and direction on the level of ""Unsolved Mysteries.""There is one moment near the end of the movie where Andy realizes he's been conned.  It's the sort of moment where there shouldn't have been a dry-eye left in the house. It completely fizzled.Forman has made some wonderfully emotional movies - Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus, Valmont and even The People vs. Larry Flynt.  But Man on the Moon comes off as completely sterile.  The only surprise in the whole movie was Jerry Lawlor saying he was in on the famous David Letterman incident from the early '80s.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"If you have seen the Kaufman bios on A&E, you have seen the movie.","Jim Carrey, originally just cast as an obnoxious character with the rubber face, has managed to really start breaking out with better and deeper parts. Admittedly, I didn't care for Ace Ventura, but with acting skills displayed in Man On the Moon and the Truman Story, I could become quite the fan.  I won't bore you with details or personal thoughts and comments, but I can sum this movie up in one sentence:  if you have seen the autobiography on A&E, you have seen this movie.  There is no new information.  No insight.  No answer to why?  Andy Kaufman was a performance artist that performed for reaction.  It just happened to be a benefit that he was able to make money doing it.  Jim Carrey performed like a man possessed and played the part as well as Andy did.

sweet sappy holly woody that would make andy upchucky,"Let me start by saying that I do not regret seeing this movie, nor would I recommend against it -- especially those who thought  that Andy Kaufman really was a sexist pig who wrestled women to  prove men were superior.  But fans of his humor will be disappointed.  I must also say that I have not liked most of Carey's humor with the lone exception of ""The Mask"" -- he does manage to pull off AK as well as anyone could have.This was a real hollywoodizationalization that tries to ""humanize"" AK for those who ""misunderstood"" his humor.  Anyone who took his macho wrestling against women stuff seriously should see this movie and be ""educated.""  Just like anyone who thinks the pro wrestling fights in the parking lot are real should talk to his or her daddy or mommy.I remember almost wetting my pants during the real letterman ""fight"" when the ""insulted pro wrestler"" decked AK whose neck he had ""cracked"" in the ring with a ""piledriver"".  Dave's reenactment was less than genuine -- i remember him pulling off his ""fearful"" routine far better in the original -- kissing up to Lawler.  That was part of what made the whole routing funny then, it was decidedly less funny in this movie.  Thinking about it I have to agree with many viewers' impression that this thing looks like it was hacked up by some standard brand studio editing.Like a pro wrestler, andy made us believe his characters while this movie tries to make a larger audience that never liked or even had a clue as to the humor in his routines ""like Andy"".A nice homage, I would have preferred less sap and more AK spirit -- like trying to convince us his death was staged -- that would have Andy Kaufman smile.

Go for Kaufman but stay for Carrey,"Man on the Moon: I never liked Andy Kaufman. My most vivid memory of Kaufman was the night he guest starred on ""Fridays"", got into a screaming match and tried to pick a fight with one of the cast members (broadcast live).  There was also the whole wrestling schtick and Tony Clifton (the obnoxious untalented lounge singer).  Kaufman went out of his way to push peoples' buttons and lots of people couldn't wait to see what outrage he'd commit next.  I frankly couldn't have cared any less. While the film did not change my opinion of Andy Kaufman, it did reinforce my opinion of Jim Carrey's acting abilities.Carrey does not merely play Kaufman, he becomes him: from his physical appearance to his mannerisms.  Carrey displays a depth and energy that goes beyond anything he has done before. I was concerned that he might give an over-the-top performance then realized that given the subject matter that simply wasn't possible.  Carrey apparently became so enmeshed with the character that while on set his colleagues addressed him by the names of the different persona he portrayed.  If he is not nominated for Best Actor this time around (after having been snubbed for his work in ""Truman"") I think the Academy will have a riot on their hands.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Un-compelling, uninteresting and not very easy on the eye.","The night I was watching this, `The Thomas Crown Affair' with Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan was on the opposite channel. And now I regret missing the other film. Every 15 minutes I was tempted to change the channel, but I decided to stick with `Man on the Moon' to the end.The film is disappointing to say the least. While it is an informal and marginally interesting character study, it's not a very likeable or enjoyable one. Partly, because we are presented with a rather unlovely character. Andy Kaufman isn't given much justice here. He's not the kind of person we want to route for, or really care about. Because of the film's accurate but rather gritty portrayal of him, he doesn't get our sympathy, nor do we give a damn about what happens to him.The majority of the film is made up of a series of dismally unfunny stand-up acts. We don't know if it's trying to be intentionally unfunny or unintentionally funny, but either way it doesn't work. `Man on the Moon' is deficient of the most basic `easy on the eye' qualities which really bring it down. It opens well with a black and white `credits' sequence but doesn't keep the audience compelled.Jim Carrey gives a generally good portrayal of Kaufman, but some of the scenes are too far out of his depth. He still hasn't made a satisfying transition to steady drama. Tinseltown throwaway Courtney Love is surprisingly good as Kaufman's down-to-earth girlfriend but is introduced too late into the movie to make much of an impact. The rest of the performances from the likes of Danny De Vito, Paul Giamatti and Vincent Schiavelli are good enough.It lacks dramatic shape and very basic qualities that are expected of most films. So `Man on the Moon' was an awkward project from day one. I suggest you give this one a miss. 4.2/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A strange movie about a strange (genius?) man.,"I came into the picture never having seen Andy Kaufman in anything, not on Saturday Nite Live, not on Taxi, not anywhere. Somehow (I must have been severely distracted at the time) he was off my radar screen. Some friends told me they loved him and waited for  all of his appearances -- he was different, a genius, etc., and I was looking forward to the picture. I must admit I came out confused - a strange movie about a strange and apparently dysfunctional human being who may or may not have been a genius, depending on how loosely one uses that word.I don't remember seeing a movie with so many audience reaction shots. The purpose seemed to be to let you, the audience, know that it it was appropriate to be confused, or embarrassed. Andy's concept (and he stated during the film that he was NOT a comedian) seemed to be fully confrontational and to act unexpectedly at all times (say, like a 4 year old). Some of it was certainly funny, but most of it was simply embarrassing. (This may have been completely intentional on Kaufman's part.) I know that this point of view puts me into the category of old fogy, but so it goes. When you can't say you're sick to someone  and be taken seriously, maybe you have gone too far.Yes, I will make amends and try to get Andy Kaufman reruns. Or go to the Museum of Television and Radio and seek him out.Of course it is a movie, and the acting was all excellent. But I still went out shaking my head...",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hardly an easy watch but fascinating......Carrey is terrific as the complex Kaufman,"Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) has been an odd duck since childhood. Instead of playing outside, he often put on ""shows"" indoors, using puppets and his vibrant imagination. Although his father objected to his spending long hours alone, both parents love their son greatly. Now an adult, Andy does stand up comedy in the Long Island area but his routines are often greeted with stony silence, as the audience does not understand his sense of humor. However, a Hollywood agent (Danny Devito) catches Andy's act one night and senses something unique. He signs Andy on as a client and soon Andy appears on SNL, where he lip-synches the ""Mighty Mouse"" song and gets big laughs. This leads to a stint on a hit sitcom called Taxi, something Andy does not want to do, feeling that ""canned laughter"" television is the lowest of the low. However, as part of his contract, Andy will get his own television special, among other unusual demands. But, away from the show, Andy participates in bizarre wrestling matches and travels to college campuses where he often insults audiences. Just who does this Andy Kaufman think he is? This is a fascinating film about Kaufman, who was certainly one of the strangest ""stars"" Hollywood ever encountered. It is very difficult to say, even now, whether he was mentally ill or just highly unusual. In any case, Carrey is magnificent as Kaufman, leaving the audience to wonder if anyone else could have played this role. The supporting cast, too, of DeVito, Courtney Love, and Paul Giamatti is just terrific. The movie's recreation of the 70's and 80's, through costumes, sets, and art direction, is great as well. But, the story, which alternates between high humor, sadness, and outright disgust is as complex as they come, making the flick a difficult watch. However, if you love Carrey or harbored great affection for Kaufman himself, you MUST see this film. It's ""look-behind-the-scenes"" portrait of an unusual man is fascinating stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carry as Carry,"Jim Carry gives a hit or miss performance as Andy Kaufman.  When he hits, he really hits.  Unfortunately, there are many more misses.When Carry does certain Kaufman characters, such as the Little Immigrant (aka Latka) and Tony Clifton, he gets the role down perfect.  But while playing Kaufman himself, Jim Carry is Jim Carry -- a weak actor who is overwhelmed by the material.  I never doubt that it is Carry and not Kaufman I am watching.On the other hand, Courtney Love totally disappears into her role.  Unlike Carry, she can act!",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Breathtakingly dull,"After a brilliant opening sequence, the film lapses into TV movie-of-the-week mode, offering a paint-by-numbers script that does little to delve into what made Kaufman tick (his motivations for some of his more outlandish behavior go completely unexplained). It also didn't do a very thorough job of explaining his celebrity--his standup routines seem lame and stilted, leaving many people in at least my screening audience to wonder what ever made him popular in the first place. His club audiences in the movie, however, roar with atrociously exaggerated delight over every little facial nuance of his. It just doesn't work.Furthermore, the movie lacked any real visual flair, which was a real surprise coming from a talent like Forman. While Carrey did an admirable job of capturing Kaufman's mannerisms, trust me when I say you've seen this schmaltz before on NBC and CBS. Pointless flashbacks. Rote relationship conflicts. ""I'm an underappreciated genius."" Ugh. The final frames of the film leave the audience wondering what this guy EVER did to warrant being labeled a ""comedian,"" outside of a somewhat memorable (though minor) character on ""Taxi"".",,Anonymous,Biography
"Thank you, Andy, for this friendly, friendly world...","I just got back from the theatre and I HAVE to comment on this movie.  If you are familiar with Andy Kaufman's work then you will know that you should never get what you expect.  I thought that after reading so many reviews and seeing so many previews I would have a pretty good idea about what this movie was about.  I was wrong.I personally thought that the movie was excellent.  The acting was great and Jim Carrey WAS Andy Kaufman.  If you really want to see a good movie then I would have to recommend this one.All of that said, if you go expecting nothing then you will probably get the most out of the movie.BTW, I've heard that everyone should stay through the credits, but I forgot to tonight, so I'll have to go back tomorrow.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Good Role for Carey, and a surprisingly good movie","Nothing really to spoil here.Jim Carey and Andy Kaufman in someways are similar. Both were over the top. And, in some ways, it's dangerous. However, Jim threw himself into Andy's head, and at some times I think he was possessed. At some times, Jim tended to play ""Andy the Character"" as opposed to ""Real Andy"", though who really knows what that was.I wish they would have had Jim play Andy a bit more straight when he was off-stage in private, though it's quite possible this is not a far stretch from reality. In many ways, Andy's private image has remained an enigma to the public, but I suppose Andy would want it that way, and would rather be portrayed a bit more over the top in ""private"" than he may have been.Of course, with Kaufman, this eventually backfired on him when he was suffering from cancer and the world thought it was a joke (Jim hasn't blurred the line like Andy did).Historically, they got a lot out of sequence (again, for dramatic purposes). Still, it was pretty nice, and I was pleased with how it told the story. The acting was solid, and Danny DeVito was interesting to see as his manager (since we see most of the rest of the TAXI cast in it as well as themselves). And this movie just reminds us that whether you belive Andy is alive or dead, the fact it is questioned to this day by some people, he truly has had the last laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something Missing...,"I write this, some 21 years after the film was released, because Carreys' movies never really appealed to me - so I avoided watching them - his facial comedic idiocy was not for me... but this film... this masterpiece... well...
You cannot say that Jim Carrey 'plays' the part of Andy Kaufman - no, he takes the role and absorbs it.
This is one of the most intensive and extensive adoption of a 'persona' that you'll ever see: Mannerisms, Voice(s), Habits, Gestures... it's all there. This goes far beyond imitation... and it was an absolute joy to watch.
I've (recently) learned that he never won an Oscar for this performance - that Tom Hanks got it for Saving Private Ryan - what absolute BS. I've watched Hanks in SPR - and he has absolutely NOTHING on Jim Carrey !",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best movies of the 90's!,"Normally I am not such a fan of Jim Carrey, but this is only because of the fact that most movies he's starred in aren't what I'm really after. But hell, what a genius actor is this and I think this can bes een in Man On The Moon. I usually go for those who walk out the line and that is what Andy Kaufmann did and that's exactly how it's portrayed by Carrey. Recently I saw the documentary in where you can see that Carrey takes it really far and you can see that perfectly in this movie. You don't see Carrey, you just watch Kaufmann and that makes it a hell of a hommage. The movie surely made me cry. It's a real shame Milos Forman didn't make that many movies in his American years but they were one for one incredible masterpieces and Man On The Moon is surely one I regulary will rewatch many times in my life, or at least I hope. One of the best movies of the 90's!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Recreation of an act, not a biopic","This is a strange kind of biopic, hardly looking at all at Kaufman's life offstage and away from the cameras; while Carrey puts in an adequate performance as the crazy non-comedian, and we learn lots about the kind of things Kaufman thought were funny (though, as Danny DeVito's character frequently points out, only to him, not to his audience), the filmmakers scarcely bother looking into the man behind the loopy stageshows. After a few seconds of one moment of his early childhood, we skip straight to adult Kaufman, already quite weird and with (suggested) compulsive-obsessive disorders aplenty, his odd, not-that-funny act already fairly developed. Though the storytelling is often touching, the performances fine and the ending quite poignant, it is quite a superficial story, with little to interest anyone familiar with Kaufman's antics and wanting to know more about his ideas and motivations. For those (like me) who only know him from vague childhood memories of repeats of Taxi!, it does stir a little interest, only to disappoint by not going deeper. Very average.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
What would a man gaze from the Moon?,"I was not fully prepared to understand the character of Andy Kaufman which I thought at the time, was a made-up character. Nonetheless, the shock of knowing that a person like him could exist was becoming more and more overwhelming as I was watching the movie, and one gets the impression that somehow Milos Forman does not excuse or blame him for what he is as a person, rather he makes a portrait-biography of a phenomenon. And what a phenomenon! For once, he doesn't fit in any kind of comedian we know. Second of all, he doesn't fit in ANY kind of human we deal with, every day. What upsets the most is the way that he considers what's funny and laughable at the cost of people's uncomfortness, to say the least, for what he says and does. He is disgusting, shocking, rude and not the kind of person we should have as a friend as he turns your thoughts into garbage. However, the genius of this ""character"" is your pursuing of making believe that being alive is the most extraordinary thing on Earth as he recollects all the bad emotions in human being and shows to the same human beings that want all but look into themselves. And he shows them with a great laugh without even consider where the bounds are, as all emotions take part of the comedy of life. But do we really know where are the bounds? When Kaufman tears apart the polish guy for just being polish or spreads his machismo-like thoughts about women; before we discover that this kind of attitude is actually funny material for his jokes, we feel threatened by him. And we still do afterwards. But he's being a comedian because THOSE SUBJECTS ARE FUNNY for him. The question he asks (as well as Forman) but does not answer is why shouldn't we laugh of our very sacred dogmas as humans, regarding that they can change as people change over centuries in their thoughts and prejudices about relationships. Perhaps we should have a little of Kaufman inside us to expand our emotions to the edge as far as relationships in our lives is concerned. After all, that is the fun: being alive and prepare to laugh at that feeling! The other aspect of this movie is Jim Carrey. Before Truman Show I was in the category of viewers that hated him and consider his performances as hysterical and not funny. After Truman Show, which I didn't see, I was very much surprised of what I read in reviews of his performance and I gave him the benefit of doubt. But when I ""stumped"" in Man of the Moon, I surrendered to him. He is the same Jim Carrey as he is in Mask or Cable Guy, but in so many ways completely different. For once, he is directed and his character knows where to go. On the other hand, he's free to play whatever he likes in portraying this person except that he is, in a way, THIS PERSON! What he gives to Kaufman (note that I don't know the real Andy Kaufman) is genuinely and apparently himself which makes us heart-felted and moved by his generosity in this role. (Why didn't he win an Oscar?) One last word: Somehow extraordinary people are not always the best people in the world but, as Forman shows to us and did in his previews films, are people who expand their views to the infinite possibilities of human life. Like only a Man on the Moon gazing at the earth would view.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

After seeing it, I feel that Carrey is a really talented comic and an above average actor. He gives an impressive performance through out the film although at times he looks as if he is trying to hard. Part of the problem is that he chose to play a man who really was not that funny to begin with so it was hard to empathize with some of the more 'heartbreaking' scenes of the film. The public never really understood what Kaufman was trying to do and I think this movie simply states that. Carrey does give a good performance though.",,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting depiction of a very complex personality.,"While this film didn't really show me anything new about Andy Kaufman, it is an insightful look at a man virtually nobody, perhaps including himself,really understood.Jim Carrey is a virtual replication of Kaufman, successfully pulling together the look, mannerisms and vocal range that Kaufman used in his various characters. The entire cast is stellar, with Danny DeVito as the manager and Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda particularly strong. Courtney Love is maybe the weakest link in the movie, being only mediocre as the girlfriend.

"Stand-out performance by Jim Carrey, but film lacks depth.","Jim Carrey gives a phenomenal performance as Andy Kaufman, but ultimately that performance is lessened by the lack of depth in the script and the development of the other  characters.

Jim Carrey & Danny DeVito are brilliant! One of their best.,"When I first saw this movie I had no idea who Andy was. I'd never seen Taxi. But I'm crazy about Jim and he didn't let me down. Andy is one of his most memorable performances and he was backed by equally talented actors. But I didn't realize just how brilliant this feature was until I became Danny's fan as well. This prompted me to watch some Taxi episodes where I warmed to the characters of Latka, Louie, Bobby, Jim & Alex. So on this 4th viewing I enjoyed spotting them in the Taxi segment. The film is funny, warm & tragic. Great music too. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carrey's remarkable performance makes this one work,"The late Andy Kaufman was a tortured soul who wanted fame on his own terms and didn't care if others were in on the joke or not. This seems to be the permeating theme of MAN ON THE MOON, director Milos Foreman's rambling 1999 biopic about the comedian, who would achieve his greatest fame as mechanic Latka Gravas on the ABC series TAXI during the 1970's.This film explores Kaufman's humble beginnings in dingy comedy clubs to his unnerving appearance on the premiere episode of Saturday NIGHT LIVE, his tenure on TAXI and his invasion of the WWF, which ballooned into a full blown feud with WWF wrestler Jerry Lawler.The film shows Andy's consistent discontent with his success and how no matter what he achieved, it wasn't enough. This purely evidenced in Kaufman's obnoxious alter ego, Tony Clifton, who Kaufman tirelessly worked at creating a separate career for, despite the fact that no one was interested.The film aggravates as we watch Kaufman constantly put up roadblocks to his own success, but also fascinates due to the mesmerizing performance by Jim Carrey in the title role. Carrey channels Kaufman flawlessly, in a performance that's positively spooky in its accuracy and should have earned Carrey an Oscar nomination.Kaufman, I mean Carrey, gets solid support from Danny DeVito, who plays George Shapiro, Kaufman's agent and Paul Giamatti, who plays Bob Zmuda, Kaufman's co-writer and co-parter in conspiracy and the only one in all of Kaufman's jokes. Courtney Love's performance as the leading lady is a matter of taste, but it really doesn't matter because this is JimCarrey's show all the way and he makes the film worth watching. The film also features appearances by Jerry Lawler, Peter Bonerz as TAXI producer Ed Weinberger and TAXI cast members Judd Hirsch, Jeff Conaway, Marilu Henner, Christopher Lloyd, and Carol Kane. A long but involving look at one of show business' most tragic figures and I'm not completely sure that it's over.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Genius Hollywood documentary - genius Carrey - made me discover Andy,"I'm afraid I might offend those of you who have been big fans of Andy Kaufman a long time. I know that I probably wouldn't like this movie if I had watched his shows and been an Andy fan for a long time myself.Anyway, I think this movie is brilliant. The beginning of it is very much like Andy's performance concepts; everyone remotely intelligent realize that this is a joke on the people who are too stupid to understand.I don't think very many of the viewers turn the movie off after this though - I've heard stories about people watching this movie in their homes and continously heckling it. That's the brilliant part.Right now, the second last entry in this IMDB comment list is actually also an Andy Kaufman heckle .. it's so brilliant that Andy haters are still out there! Because when ""Man on the moon"" and Andy Kaufman concepts are funny, it is very much on the behalf of the feeble-minded viewers who demand jokes and entertainment(tm)(c).This movie - a Hollywood production - actually dares to do what Andy did himself - just don't care about the people who don't understand it. I would almost go as far as to say it's a non-commercial film. Even, as the producers probably hoped, a lot more people get this humour now, I don't think Andy Kaufman will become accepted as a mainstream ""legend"" in my lifetime - probably never.On the surface, you certainly don't see too much of the actual person Andy Kaufman in this movie. Would it have been possible to create a documentary for the Andy fans out there - documentary-style about Andy? I don't think so - I agree so much more with the producer and director's intent - to make the movie an Andy Kaufman performance - and only let glimpses of his life through.Jim Carrey does an excellent performance - I would almost call him the number one typecast actor - and actually manages to make you forget Ace Ventura and The Mask completely during this movie. His best performance? I think so. I've really come to respect Jim Carrey a lot - to actually make his best performance as an actor a tribute to another comedian, and managing to envelope that comedian's unique style by means of his own acting - wow!Again, to the people who are Andy Kaufman fans and didn't like this movie - I'm from Norway, I never knew about Andy until I saw this movie. But it spread the message. ;) I personally was instantly fascinated, because I could identify myself so much with him. Throughout my childhood, I liked to play with people's/audiences' heads the exact same way Andy did. But that's another story. ;)10/10 - and thanks again to the people who don't understand the movie.

Carrey astonishes in a shallow film,"Jim Carrey turns in a very memorable performance as Andy Kaufman, his attention to detail really paid dividends. It stands as one of the greatest characterizations of a pop culture icon ever. Unfortunately, the level of talent surrounding this movie have turned in a film somewhat unworthy of its subject; in that, we see many recapitulations of things a lot of us have seen Kaufman do, but we don't see much insight into what motivated his actions and art. It is an entertaining and funny movie, and MUST be seen for Carrey's performance, but don't go looking for a very substantial exploration of exactly who Andy Kaufman was.

I as an Andy Kaufman fan know his story, and understand his revolutionary brand of comedy. I know his stageact also, but that is like after the fact. What i expected and didn't get from this movie was a backstory. I didn't want to watch Jim Carrey pulling Andy's stageact and his legendary pranks. I expected his passion articulated on screen.  If you like E! entertainment story type bio pics, you'd enjoy man on the moon, but it's a clunger for anyone expecting to understand the real Andy Kaufman.

average comedy drama,"Jim Carrey's (Ace Ventura) performance as this quirky insane comedian in this biographical comedy about a stressed comedian trying to make it in the world failed to capture my interest.Carrey has always been my favourite comedian with his physical enthusiastic style of humour and although he shines in this film once again, I failed to be inspired by the plot.The beginning was sensational. A black and white shot of Carrey standing addressing the audience with the credits running infront of him, this is simply a must watch! The humour behind Carrey's impressions are cannot be missed it is that captivating and humorous.However from the beginning the film did somewhat drag with many lapses of concentration from the central idea. Too many characters are introduced and focused upon rather than the idea and struggle behind Kauffman's life. I understand that this film is based on a true story but unfortunately the plot behind this film is far from stimulating.Carrey's performance makes the film enjoyable however. There are many great scenes with him in, for example the beginning and the ending provides an interesting twist to the film.I found myself drifting off at points if I'm being honest.

I came into Man on the Moon knowing all I knew about Andy Kaufman from watching those specials on Comedy Central shown in the weeks prior to the film's release.,"I left the movie knowing very little more. While the movie was entertaining, and Jim Carrey did a dead on Andy Kaufman, overall I found the movie to be lacking the answer to a very important question: Just who was Andy Kaufman?Anyone who watched Comedy Central has seen numerous specials on Andy Kaufman. From his odd stand up routines, to his stint on the highly acclaimed TV show Taxi, to his strange obsession with wrestling women, Andy Kaufman was a mystery to just about everyone. Was he a comic genius or just a nutcase? There is no denying that his strange brand of comedy has influenced many performers today, including the man playing him in this film, Jim Carrey. So when a movie was planned based on Kaufman's life, I was looking forward to finding out more about the man. What I saw instead was a rehashing of the public moments of his life, that I had seen before. Even a lot of those public moments were glossed over without a lot of thought and effort put into it. His entire five years on Taxi was done in a few minutes, and then not brought up again until the show was cancelled. His wrestling fixation, including his feud with Jerry ""The King"" Lawler was over and done with in a matter of moments. I will admit though, I was happy to finally find out the truth about their feud. For years, Lawler refused to say whether their relationship was real or fixed, and finally, the movie answered the question whether they really hated each other, or it was just another one of Andy's comedic moments.What this movie played out to me as, was the Cliff Notes version of Andy Kaufman's life. He began as a standup, moved into TV, had a few TV specials, wrestled some women, somewhere in there meets this woman named Lynne (Courtney Love), then found out he had cancer and died. In between we saw some extremely funny moments from his public life, including his infamous Carnegie Hall appearance, but what we didn't really see was his personal life. We got to meet his best friend, Bob Zmuda, and his manager George Shapiro, but we didn't really get to see a lot of personal interaction between them. We meet his girl Lynne who he falls in love with, but we never got to see why? All we see is that he wrestles her, and then they fall in love, but for no apparent reason. We see the wrestling, the Mighty Mouse - SNL skit, the reading of the Great Gatsby, all legendary stories and performances. But not a lot else.Maybe I was hoping for too much, that's happened to me a lot. But I would have liked to have seen more about the life of Andy Kaufman we don't already know. Things that went on behind the public performances; things that we didn't already know. Considering his best friends, and I assume most of his family, are still alive, I think it would have been easy to find out more about the private life of Kaufman, instead of rehashing the same tales we can see for free any Saturday afternoon on TV. Yes, a lot of the moments that were shown in the film were hilarious. And yes the movie was entertaining. But it wasn't as deep and personal as I had hoped it would be. Did Jim Carrey deserve an Oscar nod for this film?  Probably, but it seemed to me more that Jim Carrey was doing an Andy Kaufman impression, rather than becoming the man himself. Like one of my friends once said, when you saw Denzel Washington in Malcolm X you saw Malcolm X. It wasn't Denzel up there anymore, he became Malcolm. Jim Carrey, while delivering a great performance, was still Jim Carrey doing Andy Kaufman, rather than Jim Carrey becoming Andy Kaufman. And I don't really think it was his fault. It's hard to become a person so many people already know and love. Anytime you try and play an historical figure, it's difficult for the audience not to see the actor as playing a role (I think of Anthony Hopkins playing Richard Nixon). I see Andy Kaufman's facial expressions, his movements. I hear his voice and see his mannerisms, but I see Jim Carrey doing them.So overall, Man on the Moon was an entertaining film, but not very deep. I thought the best part of the film was near the end, when Kaufman goes to the Philippines to try and get a mystical treatment for his cancer. And when he gets there, and is lying on the table, he sees that this ""mystical"" treatment is all a hoax, and for the first time in his life, the joke is on Andy. And as he realizes this, while lying near death, he starts to laugh and I think finally realizes what his audience and his fans thought of him. A man who played with their emotions and tried to get them to believe things that weren't true, who finally had the tables turned on him in the end. But that was the only part of the movie that I felt really showed who Andy Kaufman was. So while the movie was fun, it didn't show me anything new about the man, and I was really hoping to find out the answer to the ultimate question: Just who was Andy Kaufman?",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The mood we miss,"A bibliographic film that tells the story of a comedian who did not care for the public, but a man who had a humorous belief, and persecuted it faithfully, mixed the impolitically incorrect with a kind of abstract humor, Andy Kaufman was a different comedian , with a unique sense of humor, his story is worthy of film, a film that falls into the hands of the competent Milos Forman, who adapts his life and work in an absurdly consistent way. Andy Kaufman is Jim Carrey, and this is not just a catch phrase to put on the poster, Jim's acting is spectacular, and for me, his best acting career, Jim does not do an identical interpretation of how Andy was, he does a very similar performance but puts a lot of his personality to the character, which gives us an absurdly funny movie, making the viewer delirious every second. The screenplay is not perfect, but it's very good, it's from childhood context and familiar to Andy, and highlights his already famous life and his controversies, which are not few, and cause much confusion in the viewer in being able to interpret who is who and what is false what is real - although in this aspect the film uses a lot of poetic liberty - but that was always part of Andy's mood. The screenplay sends a somewhat depressing and hopeful message, something like ""Life is a Big Joke"", and this is exposed once in a scene, which to me is the most striking of the film, which is when Andy discovers that your greatest hope is a fraud, and find grace in it. Technically the film is all well directed, mixing a gray photograph of the 80s with something hotter than the 90s, as well as creating ambiences and great extras, not to mention the fluidity of the film, because even the film repeats itself at different times, never the same you lose the rhythm. Finally, the film is far above the level, it just fails to develop Andy's character, just to show his deeds, with an avant-garde and unique humor, Kaufman charmed audiences and even dying at age 35, is still considered one of the greatest comedians of the American scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Definitely enjoyable, but..","... I think Carrey's best performance remains the one in Truman Show. He does deserve a nomination for this one, but to hope for the Oscar would be too much. I really think Carrey has powerful dramatic possibilities, but when he is to deliver... he can't refrain himself from putting a ""Carrey"" touch (or to be even more precise: a ""Cable Guy"" touch), one that says maybe: ""Well I'm upset, but don't worry, it will pass"". It's those dramatic moments that he needs to master a little bit more and I think he was closer to doing that in Truman Show.As for the movie, I knew Andy Kaufmann only from Taxi, but I think the portrayal made here is one of the best possible.  You really get to see the complexity of a character that many people, including, at moments, even the closest friends, did not understand. If you did not *hate* Andy Kaufmann for one reason or another I think you would definitely enjoy this movie, and even if you did, if you are willing to forgive this is your chance to better understand a great character.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Milos Forman does it again!,"Milos Forman is one of the greatest directors of our time. He has only made a handful of movies but each one he makes is an excellent success. ""Man On The Moon"" is no exception. Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman to a ""T"": his voice and mannerisms are top-notch. The movie doesn't leave out any major details about Andy Kaufman's life. Everything you've seen or heard about is in this movie. Although it's a few minutes shy of 2 hours, it never seems to rush through anything. I didn't want it to end. The opening scene is one of the most interesting scenes ever in a movie. This goes right up there with Forman's previous works (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus) and is superior over Forman's last biopic The People Vs. Larry Flynt, another very good movie but not an excellent one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Dislike For the Wrong Reasons,"A lot of the bad things I see in people reviewiing this movie are thinking bad things about Andy Kaufmann. The movie portrays him as unprofessional, unfunny and just a completely unpleasant person all around. And the the people who don't know Andy seem to think that Carrey gave a brilliant performance.I used to agree with those people. I loved this movie when it came out. I had a low opinion of Kaufmann but thought Carrey was brilliant.However, the movie made me want to learn more about Andy. I watched a lot more of his work and he eventually became my favorite comedian of all time. And as my opinion of Andy grew, my opinion of this movie sank.Carrey was bad at playing Latka, which should have been easy. This movie also made it falsely seem like Andy was an unprofessional and soiled his legacy.I lowered my score from a 10 to a 2.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
If you believe they put a man on the moon...,"Andy Kaufman has come alive in Man on the Moon, the movie based on his own life. They say that Jim Carrey is the star of this movie but I certainly never saw him. Instead I saw Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman. Not the Jim Carrey of Dumb and Dumber or Ace Ventura or even The Truman Show. There were no usual, obnoxious, gross Jim Carrey jokes. Instead Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon. The one thing that makes this movie special is Carrey's `performance' which I think you can hardly call a performance because it is beyond that of a performance. He does something with his character of Andy Kaufman that we have rarely seen before. Something like Tom Hanks did with his character named Forrest Gump. Like Hanks, Carrey fuels the movie with his portrayal. Carrey does everything perfect as Kaufman including the nervous looks, the many voices, and the multiple egos that Andy had. Carrey not only portrays Andy Kaufman perfectly but all of Andy's characters including Taxi's Latka, the infamous Tony Clifton, and even Elvis perfectly. He is especially good as Tony Clifton, the Vegas lounge singer who to this day is still a mystery. Tony produces many of the laughs in Man on the Moon with his highly offensive behavior that often includes making fun of others. Carrey also recreates many of Kaufman's acts throughout the movie including ones on Taxi, Carnegie Hall, and Saturday Night Live. These recreated shows are some of the most interesting things about Man on the Moon due to the fact of how accurate they are. Some of the other stunts recreated in this movie are Andy's infamous appearances on The David Letterman Show and his highly controversial wrestling matches with whom he wrestled women. All of this is highly entertaining to watch and will make you love and hate Andy Kaufman's character all at the same time. However, Man on the Moon is not just a movie about Andy's acts and many different personalities. It is a movie about Andy as a person. It shows with much heart and feeling how Andy was affected by his many triumphs and tragedies. How he rejoiced when leaving Taxi and how his whole world was an act with him playing the main character. He was in character all the time never coming out. Never revealing his true nature to anyone, not even himself. There never was a `real' Andy. It shows how he always would almost abuse the crowd always making them angry with him and making the tension build between the audience and himself. If he did not like the audience he would simply bore them but if they were a good crowd going along with his never before seen humor and antics he would please them and try to put on his best show for them. Andy never liked to be recognized for just one character like he was for many years with Latka. He wanted people to know him as his many personalities not just singling out one character to know him as. His famous run on Taxi was the thing that made him characterized as Latka for those many years. One of the best parts in the movie comes when Andy is trying to do his act while everyone in the audience is yelling for him to do Latka. This of course makes Andy mad and very disgusted with the crowd. So instead of doing his act Andy decides to bore the audience by reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. He does not stop until the whole book from cover to cover is complete. When he looks up after the act is over and after finishing the book the few members of the audience who are left are asleep. This might well be the best scene in Man on the Moon. A great supporting cast and a legendary director back up Jim Carrey in this superb movie. Paul Giamatti, whom I am sure you have seen before as either the notorious `Pig Vomit' in Private Parts, Ed Harris' assistant in The Truman Show, the reluctant hostage in The Negotiator, or as the soldier who knocked down the wall while trying to get a rock out of his boot in Saving Private Ryan, plays Bob Zmuda. Zmuda is Andy's writer and partner in crime who helps Andy think up his many acts, stunts, and pranks. Zmuda is the best supporting character in Man on the Moon. Danny DeVito plays George Shapiro, Andy's agent. You may remember DeVito was one of Andy's fellow cast mates in Taxi. DeVito also serves as one of the producers of the film. His performance is solid but nothing special. Courtney Love (The People vs. Larry Flynt) plays Lynne, Andy's wife. She does a decent job and seems to have good chemistry with Carrey. The are a number of cameos in this movie including ones by Christopher Lloyd and Jerry Lawler who both portray themselves. The renowned Milos Forman expertly directs Man on the Moon. He is well known for his works such as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus which both earned him an Academy Award. He puts his expertise into Man on the Moon to make it a great picture. Man on the Moon should appeal to many people. Kaufman fan's or not they will enjoy this movie and have a great time seeing it. If you do not like Andy and his brand of humor you still might be satisfied with this movie because watching Jim Carrey at work as Andy Kaufman is an incredible thing. If nothing else see this movie for Carrey's performance alone. The best thing that Man on the Moon does is it does not try to explain why Andy did what he did or why Andy was why he was. Both of these things are unexplainable and if this movie had attempted that it would have turned into one big mess. It simply shows who Andy was and it makes you laugh and cry along with him. It makes you appreciate Andy and his style of humor and it makes you want to see more of him. Man on the Moon forces you to become emotionally involved with Andy and his life. But Man on the Moon ultimately makes you wish Andy were still with us making us mad and stirring up controversy. ****(cinematic ecstasy)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Either you get it, or you don't.","There was a certain angle to Andy Kaufman's humor, just like any other comedian that stands out from the crowd.  The audience that likes that type of humor is not ""hip"" to it, or ""in on the joke"", we just happen to find that kind of thing funny.Much of the movie is devoted to getting into Kaufman's sense of humor, and its ties to his individuality and refusal to compromise.  He apparently really was one of the few entertainers who performed what he wanted to perform, and wasn't going to be a puppet to his popularity.If you ever laugh all by yourself, then you may ""get"" his sense of humor. If you do, you will ""get"" this movie, and find it hilarious in the sections where those who did not ""get it"" found it uncomfortable and uneven. >Of course, if you liked Andy Kaufman, you are likely to like this film.  I'd say that the converse is true, too.  If you don't ""get it"", try watching something without laugh tracks, and see if you know when to laugh.  Jim Carey does a good job of demonstrating that he can actually play a role other than roles that just rehash his old In Living Color comedy bits.If you don't like stories that vary from the regular Hollywood plot lines, leave this one alone.  If you're curious, don't mind bypassing some social conventions, and have a healthy respect for the selective use of tact, check out Man on the Moon, there are some nice philosophical angles to it, not unlike American Beauty.  They share a common thread of not being palatable to the people that they make light of.One of the deeper messages of Man on the Moon is that we should all be able to make fun of ourselves, and have a good time in life.  Of course, to take that message out of the film, you have to agree with that message already.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman!,About five minutes into this masterpiece biography I forgot I was watching Jim Carrey playing Andy Kaufman and instead just thought I was watching a film starring Kaufman himself.  Carrey is brilliant while the supporting actors compliment his performance.  The movie captures the undefined character of Kaufman and plays as if it were one of Andy's zany shows.  A must see for all that will finally bring Jim Carrey the credit he deserves as an actor.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting and watchable portrait of a professional dysfunctional,"When Elvis died some wag said ""smart career move"" and the same line can be borrowed for the subject of this film. Andy Kaufmann was half a good comedian -- half a weirdo so you could either laugh at him or with him (or not at all). You could even do a bit of both. His premature death allows him to be remember as a pioneer of alternative comedy rather than a cult performer who believed that simply by reversing expectation you could get a laugh or ""an experience"" -- even if you were the only one laughing or having the experience!This bio takes the view that the real Andy was a bore and a loon and we spend most of our time looking at the on-stage version. The best and the worst of his gags that seem aimed to alienate any audience other than the doped-out college one (where there was never an empty seat according to this!) When he got voted off Saturday Night Live ""for life"" that was what the US audience really felt about him -- a one joke crank that they were tired of. Not that he thought of himself as a comedian -- he never told jokes per se.Milos Foreman took on this project as part of his late ""sleeping"" period and just lets the camera run and run from middle distance. Film other material like this and it would look like a TV movie. The technique of looking at members of the audience to underline reaction is overused. Every one of them -- it seems -- wearing a brightly coloured shirt with a big collar!Jim Carey is a natural for this type of material. He manages to look surprisingly like his target although he is a better and more rounded comedian. He is a first division comedian (he could sell out any venue in the world in minutes!) imitating a second division one. It would have been interesting to see a non comedian try and tackle the role and do all the stage business just to see how they would have coped. Or not.All comedians think up wild ideas and stunts (indeed we all do) but very few of us act on them. AK did act on those impulses and while some are funny (or interesting) others are gross and simply rude. Andy, death took your life, but it saved your reputation. Your best ever gag.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Andy Kaufman - who never told a joke in his life,"This movie is about a man who had never been understood, and who had never been really known by anyone. Andy Kaufman never considered himself as a comedian, he would rather have been introduced to everyone as a song-dance showman. He didn't want the audience to laugh. His real intent was to share his ideas with people.Andy Kaufman was the biggest mystery of our world, and he took his real thoughts with him to his grave without telling everyone truly about himself. This movie tells about his extraordinary life... Andy Kaufman was 35 years old when a rare form of lung cancer killed him on the 16th of May in 1984, so he couldn't finish his ""mission"". This film was created to remind people of this strange man who wanted to push the limits of reality.Jim Carrey's performance in Man on the moon really is stunning. He could give us the feeling that Andy just came back to tell his own life. Some people says that during the film they got the feeling Andy haven't died in reality, he just did the biggest joke in his life: he made his own biography movie. Well yes, this would be a real Andy joke. He was curious about human reactions, I wonder if he's laughing somewhere right now thinking how nicely he could fool us.Maybe this film is not so entertaining for somebody who haven't a clue who was Andy Kaufman, or rather for somebody who just can't understand his peculiar slant of life, but it's full of thought-provoking ideas about human mind. Andy thought in a totally different way than people usually do, and that's what makes the whole story interesting. It drives you to get more information about him. Because he was special, just as special as this film is.If you're not in the mood that you would want to think about the mysteries of human mind, about Andy Kaufman's unusual mind, then don't watch this film. Don't misunderstand, you must see this movie, but only if you feel like it. Then it's sure that you will like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carrey's Remarkable Performance Makes this film work...,"The late Andy Kaufman was a tortured soul who wanted fame on his own terms and didn't care if others were in on the joke or not. This seems to be the permeating theme of MAN ON THE MOON, director Milos Foreman's rambling 1999 biopic about the comedian, who would achieve his greatest fame as mechanic Latka Gravas on the ABC series TAXI during the 1970's. This film explores Kaufman's humble beginnings in dingy comedy clubs to his unnerving appearance on the premiere episode of Saturday NIGHT LIVE, his tenure on TAXI and his invasion of the WWF, which ballooned into a full blown feud with WWF wrestler Jerry Lawler. The film shows Andy's consistent discontent with his success and how no matter what he achieved, it wasn't enough. This purely evidenced in Kaufman's obnoxious alter ego, Tony Clifton, who Kaufman tirelessly worked at creating a separate career for, despite the fact that no one was interested. The film aggravates as we watch Kaufman constantly put up roadblocks to his own success, but also fascinates due to the mesmerizing performance by Jim Carrey in the title role. Carrey channels Kaufman flawlessly, in a performance that's positively spooky in its accuracy and should have earned Carrey an Oscar nomination. Kaufman, I mean Carrey, gets solid support from Danny DeVito, who plays George Shapiro, Kaufman's agent and Paul Giamatti, who plays Bob Zmuda, Kaufman's co-writer and co-parter in conspiracy and the only one in all of Kaufman's jokes. Courtney Love's performance as the leading lady is a matter of taste, but it really doesn't matter because this is Jim Carrey's show all the way and he makes the film worth watching. The film also features appearances by Jerry Lawler, Peter Bonerz as TAXI producer Ed Weinberger and TAXI cast members Judd Hirsch, Jeff Conaway, Marilu Henner, Christopher Lloyd, and Carol Kane. A long but involving look at one of show business' most tragic figures and Im not completely sure that it's over.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good for Kaufman fans,"If you're an Andy Kaufman fan, you'll love this movie. Jim Carrey looks, sounds like, acts like Kaufman. It's an incredible performance. But if you're not a Kaufman fan (like me), stay away. This movie offers no insight to who Andy Kaufman was or why he acted the way he did. It brings up the question--why did they bother making the movie? Movie biographies are usually made to show us who someone was and why they acted in a certain way. This one just turns out to be Carrey aping Kaufman and giving us a ""greatest hits"" of Kaufman's career. It's all well-done and acted, but what was the point? It's no surprise that this is failing at the box office.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautiful cinematic valentine,"It's a shame that more people haven't seen this film, but then again many of them wouldn't be satisfied by it.For me, it's nothing so much as a celebratory valentine to a man no longer with us. Yes, the reviewers are right on many accounts: it's not an idealized portrait, it does have to make changes for dramatic purposes, and it can't cover everything in his life.  But...It's a film that demands a viewer to be patient, to be willing to accept that it won't have all the answers, and perhaps most importantly to have an open mind and heart...to at least *try* to understand him, to see why he was/is important, unique, and beautiful.  A viewer with those attributes will have a huge head start on enjoying this film.This description does make the movie sound cold but it is really very funny and touching.  The script and direction evoke feelings skillfully yet without callous manipulation.And then there is Jim Carrey...if ever a movie depended so much on a lead actor's performance, it is this one, and he rises to the incredible task set before him (as Peter Travers pointed out in ""Rolling Stone"") to deny his own personality so Andy's can shine through.  It is not a ""mere impersonation"", despite what you may have heard.  No ""mere impersonation"" can make a person weep.  There is something greater at work here.Perhaps you won't feel the same way - I understand that.  You're not me. But please give ""Man on the Moon"" a chance.  Please open your mind and your heart to it.  Let it work its spell.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A sorely underrated movie showcasing the best of Jim Carrey's acting abilities.,"Jim Carrey had a reputation of showcasing his rubbery face and goofy personality which endeared himself to many audiences. Although very popular throughout his career, others found him to be one dimensional and it was another case of asking ""Can Jim Carrey do anything else?"" While The Truman Show (1998) was the start of Jim Carrey proving he can branch out, I felt his role as the ill-fated Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon suited him perfectly to the ground. Although the movie netted a lot of critical acclaim as well as a well deserved Golden Globe for Jim Carrey, sadly it was quite an underrated movie which flopped at the box office.Man on the Moon squarely focuses on the biography of legendary comedian Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) right up to his untimely death in 1984 at aged 35 from lung cancer. The movie explores his early days through childhood and showcasing his comedic talents in comedy clubs and television appearances, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live (which saw him banned), Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role in the popular TV show Taxi. There is special mention of the inside jokes and scams including his long-running feud with wrestler Jerry ""The King"" Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton. Kaufman's personal life is also explored including his romantic relationship with Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love in a good role), and his friendships with Tony Shaprio (Danny DeVito) and creative partner Bob Zmunda (Paul Giamatti).Jim Carrey was a real pleasure to watch as Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon and I'm sorry that the movie was not a hit in 1999. Director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, The People vs Larry Flynt) proves he is still a quality director with Man on the Moon by bringing out the best of Jim Carrey.Sorely underrated, Man on the Moon is a quality movie showcasing that Jim Carrey can, in fact, act is not just a pretty (rubbery) face.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tragically Shallow,"I really wanted to like this movie a lot.  I'm not a huge Jim Carrey fan, but I knew beforehand the level of commitment he made to really becoming Andy Kaufman for this part.  Fortunately, his performance does not disappoint.  Down to Andy's voice qualities and mannerisms, Jim Carrey really succeeded in in exploring and reflecting each of Andy's strange personalities on Taxi and on the stage.The problem with this movie is that every scene that takes place off stage is tragically shallow.  There is not a drop of depth to this movie or any of its characters.  The talent that is wasted in this movie is almost criminal. Courtney Love, who proved to be a great talent in Forman's ""People vs. Larry Flynt"" hardly has any meaningful screen time or dialogue.  Paul Giamatti, one of the great character actors of recent memory is completely wasted in this film, playing a two-dimensional Bob Zmuda with only a single flash of his real acting brilliance (if you haven't seen him before, check out Private Parts or The Negotiator).  Danny DeVito tries to escape the shallow script but is largely unsuccessful as well.  Its not that these performances are poor, only that they have very little good material to work with.The ""Taxi"" scenes were also strange with no real dialogue for any of the cast members, only multiple scenes of them watching Andy's antics with concerned or angry looks on their faces and showing their ages much too much for the scenes to seem real.  There was also the conspicuous absence of Tony Danza.In short, if you want to relive some of Andy's great comic genius, you will enjoy Jim Carrey's portrayal.  If you want to see a film that really explores the off screen life of one of the 80's most misunderstood and enigmatic figures, you are going to be sorely disappointed.  Milos Forman is capable of a much, much better film than this.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Milos Forman Does It Again!,"Man on the Moon, from the director of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus, and The People vs. Larry Flynt is nothing short of a pop-culture masterpiece. Forman reunited with the writers of Larry Flynt for this sensational---I hate to call it a biopic because it's so much more--this sensational film about the life of the late entertainer Andy Kaufman. It seems that there is no half-way on this film. Almost everybody I talked to either loved it or hated it. This depended largely on how you felt about Andy Kaufman's humor. I think that those who had never heard of Kaufman, or who had liked him when he was performing, loved the film. Everyone else didn't. To put it simply, Jim Carrey turned in the best performance of the year. Keven Spacey is my favorite actor, but Carrey was simply magnificent here. To use a trite expression, he simply becomes Andy Kaufman. This film wasn't really supposed to cover the entire life of Kaufman, and sure, it had minor innaccuracies, but the sheer movie making magic here is phenomenal.     All of the supporting players were quite good, especially Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda. It's nice to see nearly everyone Kaufman ever worked with making a cameo here. Dave Letterman, Paul Shaffer, the cast of Taxi (minus Tony Danza and Danny DeVito who plays Kaufman's manager in the film), Lorne Michaels, the real Bob Zmuda, Jerry Lawler, Lance Russell, Norm MacDonald even appears as Michael Richards. The ending of this movie was totally beautiful. It summed up everything that Kaufman was. Critics blasted this for not probing into who Andy Kaufman was...but that's just it, Andy Kaufman was whoever you wanted him to be. He was a product of your mind. Asking ""Who is the real Andy Kaufman"" is just what he wanted.Man on the Moon 100/100 A+. Forget everything you ever knew about Kaufman, and enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Maybe an attempt to make the ""Comedian"" seem Human and we should empathize, forgive, and try to understand.It is a hit and miss Movie with some real Actors playing themselves that lend a you are there feel, but who among you really wants to be there. It is not a pleasant place or a fun time. According to the Movie, Kauffman spent most of His energy behind the scenes trying to convince everyone that everything is a joke.He comes across as probably the most misunderstood Performer in the History of Show Business. He did receive his ""15 Minutes"" and an amount of Fortune. Deservedly or not, the troubled Man squandered it (or did He?).The Movie is as painful to watch, at times, as an Andy Kaufman skit.

Outstanding Performance - Will he ever get anything as good?,"I've always, like many, seen Jim Carrey as a modern-day, less-funny(if that's possible) Jerry Lewis. His involvement with the Farrely Brothers leaves us with quite hopelessly crude and unfunny nonsense. In this film, however, his performance is unflawed as it tells the tale of bizarre artiste Andy Kaufman. Kaufman seems to have been at the very least an aquired taste. The film is gripping from the start as you are taken through some unbelievable scenes of Kaufmans early days to the even more bizarre days of his succesful time. His alter-ego of Lounge Lizard Tony Clifton defies description. Kaufman's aim seemed to be to push boundaries further than they could ever be pushed.  But it's a very moving film as he falls ill and, after getting everyone to realise he really was ill, he shows a childlike naivety and desperation when he goes looking for a miracle cure. Courteney Love is brilliant as his lady and Danny De Vito is outstanding. Whether you knew any of them or not, this film will leave a mark.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Didn't understand the motive of the character but the film was nicely directed with a very strong performance from Jim Carey.,"The film relies heavily on the acting performance of Jim. It is a biographical drama and there was no flaw in the direction, but what lacked in the film was the representation of the ideas of Andy Kauffman. This film is entertaining even though it had the flaws of character analysis. You'll definitely not regret watching this.PROS:The acting of Jim Carey is flawless and extremely satisfying. He did his best in making an entertaining film. What I got about the ideas of the character- ""Andy Kauffman"" is that he wanted to do something unorthodox and was rejected a lot of times. This line is attractive and makes us watch how it was handles in a film. Other cast performed fine. The story is good. I am glad that they made a film on this character.CONS:Just one little and important thing which is missing in the film is its ability to make the audience understand the ideas of a major comedian. The soothing fact of the film is that he wanted to be original all the time and that is something worth watching.MESSAGE: ""Dare to be different.""VERDICT: ""A recommended watch.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Jim Carey's performance is one of his better ones and his Moving performance can only do his Cv good especially after some poor recent performances. It is hard to tell what Kaufman was all about, was he retarded in any way? that is not meant in a bad way but it does seem as though he wasn't the full package at times.

8/10. Recommended.,"I watched for the first time this movie 24 years ago. I liked it but i was too young to appreciate it : I didn't know who Andy Kaufman was, i had not even seen the TAXI tv series. I watched it again a few days ago and i found it much better than i remember it. And i was deeply moved, i don't know, Kaufman is something bigger than i thought.Carrey is (almost disturbingly) fantastic,channeling Andy like a vessel (Watch the JIM AND ANDY documentary, this is something that's being said there, by his family). Critics kinda hated it (58/100 Metascore). It's not the first time that movie critics look clueless and ignorant but this score is even more ridiculous than their most ridiculous ones.Watching the part with the original actors from TAXI made me emotional, among other moments.In conclusion, this is a great comedy/drama biography, with amazing acting, as close to the truth as it can get. As i said above, watch the JIM AND ANDY documentary too, in order to understand even better this movie and both Andy and Jim.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A must see movie,If you're a Andy Kaufman or a Jim Carrey fan you will enjoy this movie. An excellent film that shows a side of Andy that very few people got to see when he was alive. He is a great lost to us and Carrey portrayed him very well.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography
a stellar performace from Carrey...Outstanding Movie!,"Jim Carrey really shows his diversity in the fantastic biopic to a controversial character. I thouroughly enjoyed this movie, despite having no idea who andy kauffman was. I think its a shame Carrey was overlooked by the academy yet again. They need to get over their prejudices and recognise this man's talents.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sad Man on the Moon,"To begin with, Jim Carrey had Andy Kaufman down cold.  The mannerisms, speech, his persona.  I was disappointed in this movie however due to the fact that I felt it would delve more deeply into what drove Andy Kaufman. There were many holes and assumptions to be made in the movie.  The recent MSNBC production of Headliners and Legends was much more interesting and delved much deeper into what made Kaufman tick.  What I perceived the most from the movie was that Andy Kaufman was compulsive, mentally unbalanced, self-absorbed person, caring only if he made himself and Bob Zmuda laugh. I left feeling sorry for him, the sad caricature of a man that he had become. At least the way it was portrayed in the movie. Happy with life, but always pushing the envelope between reality and con-man. That being said, I will give him credit for being an original.  I would recommend seeing it to judge for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"One of the best of the year, again","Man on the Moon is a really good film.  I thought it might not be too good, but with Jim Carrey, you can't loose.  He portrays Andy Kaufam in ways that makes us laugh and cry (sort of).  Milos Forman directs in a really great form in bringing Kaufman's life (not who he was, but what he was).  Plenty of cameos can't break Carrey's charm.  A+",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
What? This is Funny?,"The whole thing is stupid, and not funny at all. Any one can act stupid. It is Jim Carey getting paid to be stupid. Still a very boring movie. The actor on Taxi was better, than Jim Carey.I can't watch the whole movie, because its so boring. The guy can barely make a good impression on his audience, and they made such a big deal about him dying at the end.The guys first act was completely rude to everyone, and was not even funny at all. Barely see any smiling from any of the actors through out the movie. Where do they come up with this stuff? This movie can not be rated 7.4. There is nothing on it that makes it that good. I swear people that rate this high obviously must be doing the exact make themselves look like fools to make people laugh, and think it is funny.Most of the comedy movies is just whacked out stupid things that people do to get attention, and then put it out on a movie for others to see.At least dumb and dumber was funny. This is not. This is more him making an complete a** out of himself.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very good film on an interesting man,"Man on the Moon was an excellent movie. Jim Carrey plays in a second great movie in a row(The Truman Show being the first of those). Is performance is very impressive. He is a very good Kauffman. He looks and acts like the real thing. The movie is a good way to discover Andy Kauffman, a fascinating character. This movie is funny and touching at the same time. In that way, it resembles Tim Burton's Ed Wood. It is not as great as Ed Wood... but still, it is one of 1999 best movies(along with Sleepy Hollow).

The music by R.E.M. is great, i bought the soundtrack at once and I recommend others who liked this film to do the same.It`s really a very sad story and a very funny story at the same time and that alone makes the film great.Jim Carrey deserved that Oscar!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Forman does not make bad films.,"Forman does not make bad films.  I sat spellbound for 2 hours and was sorry when it was over.  It's no comedy, in fact it is hard work to watch.  But worth it.

This movie proves Jim Carrey's talent,"I went into this movie as a semi-Andy fan, not much of a Jim fan, but a huge fan of the soundtrack.  Through the movie, I discovered Andy Kaufman.  I discovered he had a mind immature in its brilliance, misunderstood in its talent.  I discovered that this ""bio-pic"" was more of a walk through a mans career, leaving questions instead of answers.I thought Jim Carrey was incredible.  I am not a fan of Carrey in any way, but no one else could have sufficed as Andy Kaufman.  He relayed Andy as best as possible.  I spent a large amount of the movie feeling bad for Andy, but laughing at him anyway.  He didn't want an ordinary reception from the audience, he just want A reception.  And that is what made him unique.I walked out wanting more.  More answers, more questions, more Andy.  And I walked out believing that was his purpose in life.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A somewhat interesting failure with a miscast star.,"I went to see this movie knowing very little of Andy Kaufman, and I came out knowing little more.  While structured in a semi-interesting way, the movie worked too hard to be entertaining and not hard enough at making Andy a believable person--it was impossible to get to know or like Andy. Whatever you thought going in was the only thing you could think when you left. Jim Carrey's performance seemed barely adequate for the task, and he was not able to cover up for his lack of acting ability here any more than in his previous big screen ""triumph,"" The Truman Show.  While the sequences involving the cast of Taxi reprising their roles from the show (with Danny DeVito, the producer and another actor in this movie, conspicuously absent), very little of the rest of the movie displayed the same life or energy. In the future, I hope filmmakers who would like to create biopics of complex (or perhaps misunderstood?) figures will take a lesson from the failures of Man on the Moon and make sure the movie reveals something about its subject that goes beyond common knowledge.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, great and wonderful","I had never heard of Andy Kaufman before I heard about this film. People keep telling me that this film is only for Kaufman fans, yet without ever really knowing anything about the man I got immense enjoyment from this film.Okay I admit that alot of that could be because I am a huge fan of Milos Foreman (I even share my birthday with the 2 time best director Oscar winner)or the song with the same name (I loved that song without knowing who Kaufman was????) and ofcourse Carreys performance)Jim Carrey is an actor who I've admired for years now, but it wasn't until this film that I truly learned how wonderfuly talented the man really was. I could get over it when the Oscars forgot him for the Truman Show, even though I cheered for him when he won the Golden Globe, for though that was one hell of a performance, it was nothing remarkable. But I could not stand it when they ignored him for this incredible terrific piece of work that, in a year of great leading performances such as given by Denzel Washington, Russel Crowe and Kevin Spacey, still deserved to beat the daylights out of the competition.The only annoyance I really have with the film is not actually with it but the promotional work for it and the reception it got in that- IT IS NOT A COMEDY!!!!!!!!. This film has moments where it is very funny but it is not a comedy but a drama on a guys life as he strives to be him. American Beauty was sidesplitting at times yet everyone knows it's a drama. I guess if ever a film was going to be miss-understood,a biopic on Andy Kaufman was going to be it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jim Carreys finest moment,"If you had said 20 years ago my favorite film with Carrey would be Man on The Moon, I would raise an eyebrow. Now... I know better. Why he didn't get an Oscar for this is beyond me. He takes character acting to a new level with the enigmatic Andy Kaufman. Even Courtney Love deserves praise, for once. The perfect companion is watching this and then ""Jim & Andy"" back to back. Carrey is a strange character, and that's why he managed to bring Andy to life. His struggle with illness is well known, among depression and ADHD, and seeing footage of Jim as Andy shows us an actor far from his old funzone. Carrey wanted something else, and created it trough a ""twin soul"". A funny, serious and in the end sad story about Kaufman, a performer way before his time. The funniest moment isnt in the movie, but in the documentary. When Hugh Hefner invites Carrey to the Playboy Mansion, and Kaufmans ""agent"" shows up. Everyone thinks it's Carrey, until Jim himself shows up 2 hours later, in true Kaufman style. Accompanied by R. E. M beautiful score, this is a true gem, with Carrey in top form. So much more than a comedian, a true artist. Respect.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Forman has fun...,"Man on the Moon was a lot like its character, Andy Kaufman, in the way that it's tricky and you never know what's about to happen.

The beginning is smart, fun, and perfect for the rest of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An excellent movie no one should miss,"This movie could not be made by an American - it had to be an out - standing person. Geniality of this Czech director Milos Forman gave us a great view on a controversial comediant Andy Kaufman. Sorry that the Academy did not think of outstanding job Jim Carrey did there. As Forman says, he did not see Carrey there at all, so he is gonna rethink his sallary... You go out of the cinema and think to yourself: did I like it or not? That is exactly what you would have thougt after you left Kaufman's show. And that is exactly why I think Forman is a genius who should be noticed. Where were you, Academics?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carrey is Incredible,"As this film indicates, there were two kinds of people when it came to Andy Kaufman.  Those who got it, and those who didn't.  Most reviews I have read said this movie is funny, but there are others that just don't get it.  When I saw the movie, about 3/4 of the theater laughed with me, while others did not.  So let's make it clear.  If you did not like Andy Kaufman, or at least did not find him interesting, you will not like this movie.However, if you were amongst Group A of Andy viewers, go see this movie. Never before has a star of a movie been more deserving of the phrase ""(Actor) is (Character)"" than Jim Carrey in his incredible portrayal of Andy.  It's just about perfect.  Voices, mannerisms, even eye movements.  A lot of times you see biographies of famous people and you can't get the fact that it isn't the real person on screen out of your head.  Not in ""Man On The Moon.""  After all, Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman.The rest of the performances are strong, and so is Foreman's direction. Another criticism of the film I've read quite a bit of is that the film does not offer enough insight into Kaufman's head, instead just giving a ""best of"" series of his material.  To that I offer that Kaufman was so insane and obsessed with keeping the audience guessing that what he was ""really"" like is irrelevant; or perhaps that the ""real Andy"" wasn't much more than the sum total of Latka and Tony and who knows who else.Though it's just my opinion, while watching, I kind of got the feeling that the film was constructed like one big gag that Andy would pull.  You think you're in on it, you laugh, then you think it isn't real, you stop, then you think it's a joke, then you don't know what is what.  Reality and performance are blurred and by the end, who knows what is what.  And that's just the way Andy would have wanted it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I don't have time for this...,"Obviously they put that weird act with the ending credits shown in the beginning and Jim Carey shows up and talks a bunch of crap and then goes away for awhile and comes back telling us this movie is definitely NOT for everyone... you have to be soo patient especially since it's about some guy's life where i have never even heard of this comedian, I just watched the film ONLY because i heard Jim Carey was in it but this movie was soo stupid and ESPECIALLY ANNOYING! His jokes were soo stupid not even worth hearing. This movie just made me pissed and if they didn't tell us Jim Carey was in this movie then most people would probably not go see this like me, let's face it who actually knew about this comedian and wanted to know more about his life? raise your hands people! Uh, let's see maybe 5 people out of 1,000,000...?! Seriously i think Jim Carey is a great actor but he was soo annoying and stupid in this movie and i know Jim Carey likes to act that way like in (Dumb & Dumber) and stuff but those are ""stupid funny"" but in this movie he was just plain stupid and annoying.

A Wonderful Tribute,"In short, this is a wonderful tribute to an artist who, though greatly misunderstood during his life, changed the way comedy was performed. Jim Carrey's portrayal is so on-target it's frightening, and Kaufman's various pieces are recreated with delicate care.  The point is not necesarily to understand Andy Kaufman, the man, but rather the artist as perceived through his work.  This should serve as a wake-up call to anyone aware of Kaufman only through his performance as ""Latka,"" and hopefully would propel the viewer to check out the real thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Preserves the Kaufman legacy,"""Man On The Moon"" has several actors doing some fantastic work, bringing one of the most original performers ever, Andy Kaufman, back to life.  Jim Carrey turned in possibly the best work of his career as Kaufman.  He emulated Andy Kaufman's genius artistic style, performing even the most subtle of Kaufman's mannerisms in a superb way.  While the movie focuses more on Kaufman's stage performances than his personal life, the movie preserves Kaufman's legacy with definition and truth.  Danny DeVito, Paul Giamatti and Courtney Love are also at the top of their act.  Also, the movie does not make the mistake of glorifying Kaufman's act - it shows that he dealt with adversity as well as triumph in his career.  Highly recommended, especially for those who were alive to see the original Andy Kaufman.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Andy Kaufman the song and dance man.,"There was only one Andy Kaufman, a true genius of the put-on. In Man on the Moon though it seems Jim Carrey has tapped into the spirit of who Andy was.Carrey once again lets Kaufman live through him and lets Andy be the star he always was.

Man on the Moon, the movie of the year.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Strange and awesome,"My first taste of avant-garde comedian Andy Kaufman was, while watching old episodes of Saturday Night Live, his Mighty Mouse bit he did for that show. I knew nothing about him at the time, and I still didn't know much about him until seeing this brilliant biopic about his life and career. Jim Carrey plays Kaufman in this Milos Forman directed flick that examines the controversial and confusing career that Kaufman had. It's full of lies, deceit, and publicity stunts that established his career as something of a great big farce. Andy Kaufman was a brilliant mind that very few could understand completely. What he did, he did for himself. He had huge aspirations to be incredibly famous, he just didn't know what to do in order to get there.It's clear that the world of comedy has never seen anything quite like Andy Kaufman. It's hard to adequately explain just what his career was all about. It includes sitcoms, jazz singing, wrestling, and everything else you wouldn't expect it to have. But there was a bizarre brilliance to it all that translates throughout this film wonderfully. Watching the dramatized development of this strange career is as entertaining as it is fascinating. We never get an idea of why Kaufman does all that he does and no explanation is given as to why he is how he is. This somewhat breaks the ideals of what a biopic should be but, then again, nobody fully understood what Andy Kaufman was all about, so does a film really have the right to make that up? The biggest complaint I've seen about this film is that it focuses more on the career of Andy Kaufman rather than his personal life. There is undoubtedly some truth to this, but it's not something that bothered me. His career is what is interesting, and his career was so involved and it completely consumed his life so, in a way, his personal life was his career.Man on the Moon is simply just a great film. It's not a perfect biopic, but a damn good one and it tells an incredibly interesting story about an incredibly interesting man. Jim Carrey absolutely owns his role as Kaufman and gives it his all in portraying the late genius. The film is more entertaining than it is heartfelt and it's more comedic than it is dramatic, but it possesses all of these elements in some degree. It's a bizarrely fun film to watch, uncomfortable at times but always pleasing, much in the same vein as the career of the strangely brilliant Andy Kaufman.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Was that Jim Carrey or Andy Kaufman himself...?,"I have seen a lot of movies, based on real people, but this is the best one. First of all, whoever like Andy Kaufman should see this movie to learn a little more about him and even those who doesn't know who's Andy, should see it, to learn about a new way to make comedy. Don't think that you're going to see an normal movie of Jim Carrey, to see him make stupid things and weird faces. This is a serious movie, about a real person, the man, the myth, the miss-understood Andy Kaufman. This movie is the proof that Jim is one of the best actor that Hollywood have. When i saw the movie, there were parts that i wasn't sure that i was looking at Jim Carrey, but Andy himself. It defenetly was'nt Ace Ventura, the Mask, or the Riddler.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Start, Standard Finish","Man on the Moon is a great film, but one that could have been better. The opening sequence with Andy saying the movie is stupid and rolling the credits was incredible, but I wanted more. Instead it turns into a very good, funny but ultimately a very conventional biopic. I wanted 20 min. of the ""Great Gatsby,"" I wanted half the theater to walk out and the other half to give a standing ovation at the end. Andy was someone who screwed with your mind but this movie, one that was supposed to give you a feel for who he was, didn't do that. I guess it's asking a lot for a studio movie to put the film out of frame during the scene about the v-hold on his TV special but it would have been great. Something along the lines of ""Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould"" but about Andy was what I guess I really wanted.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Maybe they can put a man on the moon, but they can't make a good Andy Kaufman film","This uninspired biopic of the infamous oddball performance artist/comedian Andy Kaufman misfires on almost all counts. To begin with, there are millions of people who have never heard of Andy Kaufman, so there's a entire demographic that would need to be taught about the late auteur. Right away, when you have to convince a large portion of the population that the subject of your movie is worthy of your cinematic paintbrush, you're in a hole that most moviemakers can't dig out of.But that's only the people who weren't aware of Andy Kaufman when he was alive. What about those of us who were? Those who closely followed the television series Taxi remember the character of Latka Gravas, but how many people paid any attention to Kaufman's offscreen antics? Those who did notice generally seem to fall into one of two categories: those who loved Kaufman and believed him to be an unsung comic genius, and those who despised him and saw him as a relentlessly weird pathological  liar.Those who loved Kaufman and his work might find something of value in this film. As a straight biography, there are inspired, original moments - such as the beginning acting as an end, or some of Kaufman's bits (including the legendary Saturday Night Live ""Mighty Mouse"" skit) - but most of the movie is rather pedestrian, given that it's directed by Milos Forman, who brought One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to the big screen. Our Hero struggles against People Who Don't Understand Him (parents, audiences) until he is saved by a Nice Agent With a Heart of Gold who shows him the way to superstardom. Ho-hum. The viewer, instead of being enticed by this purportedly unique, larger-than-life character, finds that it's really just an exercise in somnolence. The script is smarmy and self-satisfied, as if it's telling it's damn funny and if you want to be hip, you'll think it's funny, too.Jim Carrey, as Andy, turns in some remarkable work, but thanks to a rather standard script doesn't really get to show off his acting chops (which we saw in The Truman Show). As Andy, Carrey turns in a good impersonation, but not a full characterization. Courtney Love as Andy's girlfriend Lynne isn't exceptional, but the character lacks depth. She's no more or less important than Adrian from Rocky, cheering her man on through thick and thin, leaving him at one point but - surprise - coming back to him when he needs her the most. Danny DeVito is his agent, George, and he's likeable in a thankless role (remember Edward Norton in The People Versus Larry Flynt?).Like Oliver Stone's The Doors, we come away from this movie not knowing much more about the lead character than we did before the movie. There are no deep insights, no real secrets revealed. The result is a slipshod, lackadaisical film, a movie that promises to bring the story of a 'misunderstood' man to light but winds up being a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Shock horror- Carrey in dramatic acting scandal!!,"I never really saw Taxi when i was a kid. Never knew of Kaufman's cutting edge exploits ('happenings') aimed at the American public. Also, i've never been much of a Jim Carrey fan, finding what i perceived as quasi-Jerry Lewis posturings just a little bit irritating. However, after viewing a couple of films i decided that was a little harsh. After seeing Man on the Moon, i realize he is an awfully gifted artist. Playing someone in a biopic isn't that difficult in itself. All it requires is an adequate enough amount of mimicry- an impersonation almost. For example, Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison comes to mind as a good charcterization, but with no actual life to the character. Carrey, however, one sensed there was a person underneath all those masks of Kaufman. He had splendid support from some actual members of the Taxi cast playing themselves. Courtney Love, in this, her second film for the excellent Milos Forman, shines- herself somewhat of a dramatic surprise in The People vs Larry Flynt. I should like to see Carrey get awards galore for this film, though i somehow think it won't happen. It would be a shame to see his promise unfulfilled, tossed aside for the Ace Ventura kind of films. My one regret was that i was never more aware of the real Andy Kaufman when i was younger. I like to think i'd have laughed then aswell.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is just a great movie for people who like odd humor!,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was instantly enthusiastic about Carrey's performance. I never heard of Andy Kaufman though, since he wasn't very well known in Germany in his time.This movie is a ""must-see"" for people who like extremely odd humor!!Kaufman's intention is to deceive and manipulate the audience. He enjoys himself most when they get really really angry with him for doing absolutely controversial things on stage - like beating up women, teasing elderly people until they get a heart attack or just standing there performing silence for minutes.Once the audience grasps that the show is just a show, he either has the next shocker ready for them or  already left the stage with a quick ""good-bye""!Also, Jim Carrey is brilliant playing Kaufman. He is just the right person. I do not know how much of Kaufman is really Kaufman and how much was added by Carrey. Neither do I know if the biographic part of this movie is absolutely correct.

The movie never doesn't really get boring or uninteresting. It always has something to entertain us. My only problems with the movie are one of them is the movie does follow the biopic cliches we see in other biopics. My other problem is once when it gets to the last 30 minutes of the movie, it does start to lose its momentum because the movie didn't really build up to the last part of the movie.

"Carrey, an Oscar?  Injustice!!","Is Carrey good in this role?  Yes.  Just as he was in Truman Show.  But there is something separating him from the great actors.  He is trying to hard, he is acting too much.  Too many exaggerated expressions, and not enough of a real breathing human being.  Granted, Kaufman was aloof, but when the gaurd went down, he was closer to normal, a little shy and awkward, but normal.  It was a great task for Carrey to master the vocal tones of Kaufman, and he is much toned down from that mug fest Liar Liar, but he's still not there yet.  I think he'll get there, but not yet.As for the movie, I thought it was good.  I'd say wait to video.  I think a lot of people will hate this movie, because it's not a laugh fest.

Very funny but surprisingly dramatic,"Jim Carrey delivers a superb performance as Andy Kaufman. Carrey clearly did his homework in preparation for his role as all of Kaufman's mannerisms, speech, facial expressions, and body movements are nailed down perfectly. Here's a role that perhaps only Kaufman himself could of played better. This film, in addition to his work in Truman Show, solidifies Carrey as a legit film actor who can perform brilliantly in dramatic roles.In fact, drama is the strength and backbone of this film. Although no serious film about Andy Kaufman could of been made without showing the comical genius of the comedian/entertainer, the film's best moments are when it takes you behind the scenes and show Kaufman as a human being and his deep relationships with his friends, not just a silly Kaufman on stage as either a prankster or wrestler or comedian.Perhaps my only problems with the film were the recreations of televised footage of Kaufman such as when he appeared on Saturday Night Live, David Letterman Show, Taxi, or his wrestling matches. What I would of love see is to transpose Carrey's image over Kaufman's image (ala Forrest Gump style) in those real footages and thus allow the audience to see the actual events as they had taken place.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Why did they do this?!!!!!!!!!!,"Let's face it: Andy Kaufman was a zero. As far as I could tell, he never tried to do any meaningful skit; he just acted weird all the time. If people got annoyed with him, it was only because he brought it on himself. And he was pretty weird as a person. SO WHY IN THE NAME OF ANYTHING HOLY WOULD THEY WANT TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT HIM????????!!!!!!!!! Apparently, they thought that everyone on earth really admired the guy. ""Man on the Moon""'s dismal performance hopefully disproved that. I don't care that Jim Carrey looks almost exactly like Andy Kaufman or that they share a birthday; there was no reason to make this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
trip to another planet,"Based on a real story, the film brings us into a mysterious world of Andy Kaufman, who appeared to be one of the most enigmatic comedians of our time. Andy derides the audience, makes them laugh or amazed, whips up emotions; i.e. he entertains them. But this entertainment is so uncommon that you start thinking whether it is entertainment or just nonsense, a wasting of time. And together with Andy we are involved in exploring the categories of real and unreal. Although Andy was mixing reality with imagination, the film makes us feel that Andy, by his art, has still made distinguishable the borderline between good and evil. The film, despite its immense strangeness, radiates warmth.Jim Carrey as Andy is brilliant: you can't imagine a better performance of an actor in this role. Excellent are Paul Giamatti, Denny DeVito and Courtney Love. A Carnegie Hall, the Philippine trip, and the funeral scenes are staged and shot masterly. The music is wonderful.In each Milos Forman film, behind what you watch, on a backstage, there is always a problem, idea or opinion that provokes you to think. Forman's latest film at first glance seems to be simple: it portrays only a showbiz part of Andy Kaufman's life, almost no off-scene life of the comedian is shown as well as the reasons for his so eccentric behavior.But Andy's life, according to the film, was indivisible from his art: his art was his life and vice versa, mostly feeding on irrationality and imagination. Imagination has no boundaries, all the same as, say, the universe. It forms a whole, the film and its backstage, something without boundaries, something amorphous. Therefore, you don't have to look for something specific or concrete behind the film: there is again the same irrationality and imagination there. All you have to do is to watch and enjoy this multilayer, elevated and refined philosophical film (which, by the way, is not a comedy) on our today's absurd life where the love and kindness are to be praised. And these are the main categories that the movie instigates us to think about.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
He was so much more than an entertainer.,"In this 99' Milos Forman film, audiences get to experience a more peaceful character portrayed by Carrey, but equally(or more so) as colorful. Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, who throughout the film is constantly acting on his distinctive ideas to entertain the people around him. At the time the idea of being so clueless that you're making people laugh, was unheard of. People didn't usually like to be put into awkward positions, however Andy had this almost childlike trait that made people feel as if he was in fact a child at heart, at times. Andy is constantly putting peoples emotions at risk to get a real reaction and in some cases give people emotion that(even if it's a gloomy emotion) these 'victims' needed to feel to achieve a greater sense of humor or a more manifest view on what is important and what is needed to successfully execute your own life. He was so much more than an entertainer.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Painfully beautiful,"After Foreman's ""the people vs. Larry Flynt"" ,this movie is another excellent example of the director's ability to get the ultimate performance out of his actors. Again the story is about a misunderstood individual who chooses to follow his own ideas rather than limit himself to the standard ideas set by the world that surrounds him. Just like most of Foreman's work he seems to want to make tribunes to people who were really brilliant and suffered for it. Carrey gives an absolutely fantastic performance, and in my eyes is so good that this movie is indeed already a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An underrated, poignant, and essential biopic","I just finished watching ""Man on the Moon"" for the first time, and it's already one of my favorites. I had a tiny amount of knowledge on Andy Kaufman before now, and I'm sure not everything in the film is 100% accurate, but as a film, this really really holds up. Kaufmans whole character, and Jim Carey's portrayal of him is absolutely fantastic, wildly funny and brilliant. I really appreciated how many of the people in this film were portrayed by the people who actually were there at the time (Loren Michaels, Christopher Lloyd, Richard Belzer, and ESPECIALLY THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND JERRY THE KING LAWLER) Paul Giamatti and Danny Devito are class acts as always, and really lend a great weight to the film, balancing Carey out wonderfully. Carey in comedic/serious roles strikes me in all the right ways. Everything about this movie strikes me. I love entertainers like this (both Kaufman and Carey's portrayal of him) and this film just really played my emotions in all the right ways. The only time I ever was slightly disappointed with this film was during the milk and cookie scene, as the closeup on Carey's face and the music swell was a little too intentionally sappy and ""redeeming"" for my taste, but it's a nitpick really. Usually I don't bend backwards for ""feel good"" stories, but the way that this story is depicted before it gets to that point really had me, and it's one of the only times that the ending of a film made me emotional: I highly recommend this film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman!,"Man on The Moon is one of my favorite movies of all time!  Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman who is this interesting & funny entertainer.

"The joke is on you, Kaufman is alive and well.","A lousy movie...a brilliant film...poorly directed with style...written ineptly, yet true to life...a terrific bio-pic about a mediocre comic. Kaufman's idea of comedy was based on contradictions and deceptions. When sticking to straight comedy he was amusing, but too often his goals were strictly a pursuit of controversy and publicity. Apparently the strategy worked to a certain extent, because he is so well remembered. Back in the days when he started his wrestling routine, I thought he had gone insane. The decision to scream obscenities on Letterman's show was clearly poor judgment, and most people (including myself) believed the performance was not an act. This was the only Jim Carrey film I haven't see in the theatre, because Kaufman lost his appeal after those shenanigans. I honestly think Carrey is the greatest comedic actor of our age, with the exception of this movie. The film is only fair, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but staunch fans of Andy Kaufman.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Plenty of absurd and bittersweet humour,"Milos Forman (Amadeus, The People vs. Larry Flynt) consolidated his position as one of Hollywood's great movie biographers with this film about comedian/performance artist Andy Kaufman and his short but eventful life. In many ways, Forman continued where he left off with Larry Flynt, namely by shedding light on another public figure who was to a large degree despised by the public, but who also was frequently misunderstood and perceived as more or less an enigma. Forman's wonderful recreation of a not so distant past and the many details and mannerisms in it gives the picture a fine backdrop, but from there on Man on the Moon is all Jim Carrey's extravaganza. At this point in his career, Carrey had risen to a stardom which the world had possibly not seen for a comedian since the days of Charlie Chaplin, and his position was such that the cast and crew did not oppose his audacious method of ""becoming"" Andy Kaufman (and his various characters) for the duration of the shoot - whether the camera was rolling or not. As documented in the 2017 documentary Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond, this led to a number of abrasive situations and put a strain on the production. But it arguably also helped bring Kaufman back to life in a way that otherwise wouldn't have been possible. Carrey's often mimicry-based acting is perfect here, because Kaufman himself to such a degree put on an act while in public. The so-called real Andy Kaufman remains a mystery, and will probably always do. As his girlfriend Lynne Margulies (played by Courtney Love) remarks at one point: ""There is no real you"".Aesthetically, the film is much less mysterious than Kaufman himself. Forman uses his experience and cunning to weave a traditional biographical structure of rise, conflict and downfall. It's effective and sometimes poignant. And of course, it's also often hilarious - given that you appreciate the talent and antics of Mr. Kaufman himself. The film does perhaps not reach the depths you could have hoped for, but it recreates Andy Kaufman and his life in a way that does him justice, and with plenty of absurd and bittersweet humour.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kaufmans Bland Exit,"Andy Kaufman may have been a funny guy, but this movie is a bomb. Jim Carrey is not good as Kaufman, but Andy would have said..""Ï don't care"". The movie has so many flaws i really don't know where to start. Mr. Kaufman was an ""avante guard"" comedian, which is like saying...it is kind of art house and you ""get"" it or you don't. His flaky style of substituting himself with another character was funny...if you saw it once. But Andy used this over and over. He was in the sit-com Taxi, and if there was one thing Kaufman did have it was confidence in his own material. (he didn't see his weaknesses). The best thing one can say about Kaufman---is that he was highly original. The movie is one long tedious bore, and Carrey does nothing to lift the sinking film. If this was Kaufmans highlights, i am glad they never showed the low parts of his life. It appears he was vastly over-rated.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
The greatest Oscar ripoff since Val Kilmer in Tombstone.,"Not since Val Kilmer was snubbed for his fantastic role in Tombstone has an actor so deserving of a nomination been left out of the Academy Awards.

He's proved it with the Truman Show, and with this movie he has cemented that fact with this movie. Andy Kaufman receives a brilliantly fitting and entertaining tribute with this fine movie.

The movie he doesn't have too much to say about apart from the fact that Jim Carey was good in the title role. But Kaufman's life, he just can't believe what he is seeing. How could he possibly get a part on SNL it is unbelievable, how could he get a part in Taxi, it's incredible. The reviewer is so astounded he seems to imply that these things could not have happened. They did happen, he was on SNL, he was in Taxi, he was one of the most popular comedians of the day and he was a genuine eccentric.

A celebration...,"When I first rented this, I was hoping it would be an explanation of Andy Kaufman's life.  I then discovered it was not.  This has been pointed out by several people who disliked the movie.  The beginning of the film is not very good.  It jumps from time period to time period (from his stand-up days, to SNL, to Taxi) and doesn't give you a chance to get to know the characters.  The first about half-hour to hour is boring.  However, after a while the movie finds its way.  It gets very funny (the humour derived directly from Kaufman's material) and at the same time moving.  By the end I found myself smiling from the very touching last 3 scenes.  But then I got to thinking about what the critics had said.  It really didn't explain Kaufman at all, and in a docu-drama-comedy such as this, that is a bad thing.  But I really enjoyed the film.  Jim Carrey gave an excellent performance (he makes you believe he is actually Andy) but I knew liked it for another reason.  I have finally figured out that the movie is not an explnation of who Andy Kaufman was, but instead a celebration of life.  It chronicles all the very, very strange things he did but it is always external.  We never hear why he did these things, and that is the point. That's probably how Andy wants it.  So if you're looking for a comedy that is also touching, this is a good film.  But don't forget, don't get this movie thinking it will explain Kaufman, because like many other people, you will be disapointed.  I am glad to know that out of the three movies directed by Milos Forman I've seen now, I've liked each one.  One other thing: R.E.M.'s song ""Man On the Moon"" played during the credits rocks!

"If you believe there's nothing up my sleeve, then NOTHING is cool...","Yeah, it's right. Then really nothing is cool. What am I saying? I don't know. It's maybe I'm really impressed by Andy's story.

It was really more than enough.Anyway, did we come here to criticize ourselves, or the movie? So, the movie is really touching, but it lacks on laughs alittle. What we have to know before going to see the movie is, that it's not completely a comedy. Well, of course it has its moments, but the real mission is not to make people laugh to tears.Jim Carrey, one of my all-time favorite actors, in his second drama (with Truman) is awesome as always. You can see that he's living Andy. I think the greatest moment of his performance is when he finds out the secret of the cure in Phillipines:he just laughs. I laughed with him in there.

I'm surprised that I hated this movie,"First of all, I was a big fan of Andy Kaufman's, I enjoy Jim Carrey and I've seen 4 or 5 Milos Forman films that I would call ""great.""  That being said, I do not understand the motivation for making this movie.Most of the scenes were just staged re-enactments of televised moments from Kaufman's career.  On that level, you're much better off watching one of the oft-repeated documentaries on Comedy Central or parts of the retrospective shown at the Museum of TV & Radio last year.  As far as the ""uncanny"" portrayal from Jim Carrey, I don't remember Kaufman as that blissed out.As for his off-camera life (what there was of it, which I suppose is almost the point of this movie/exercise) some of those scenes were dreadful.  Like when Jerry Lawler & he are in Shapiro's office and Lawler says something like ""We really showed them, didn't we Andy?""  I don't remember the exact line but things like that were so clunky you could hear them coming out of the typewriter as the writer pats himself on the back.There's kind of a built-in system from fans of Kaufman and/or this movie that if you didn't care for him/the movie, then you ""don't get it.""  I was right there with Kaufman most of the time.  But there were other times when he really was neither funny nor interesting (like that one-time TV special of his - oy!).  Like every performer, he had his ups and downs.  Yet those in his camp seem a little too eager to think of him as a ""genius"" and thus won't say the emperor has no clothes and admit that everything Kaufman touched wasn't made out of gold.As for this movie, OK ... he's an enigma.  We get it.  That does make this script worthy of an audience for two hours.This thing was so stiff it made me rethink the whole creative principals involved and admit to myself that The People Vs. Larry Flynt was also a waste of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wrestling With Andy,"There's a scene in this biopic about the life and career of comedian Andy Kaufman when Kaufman and his creative partner Bob Zmuda tell their agent, George Shapiro, about a prank they played years ago, hiring actors to run around a zoo yelling that a lion had gotten loose, and watching everyone run.I can see the headline now: ""12 Killed In Zoo Stampede Panic; Comedy Frontiers Extended.""Andy Kaufman was a very brilliant comedian. He wasn't always funny, and sometimes was just weird for the sake of it, but he had an amazing talent that created something remarkable in show business, a way of reaching the audience for something more than laughter or sympathy. He wanted complete engagement, a shared sense of purpose, even hatred or childlike awe. Laughs were fine, too, but he really just wanted to break down the wall between entertainer and audience, and give people something to take home and think about.A lot of people took Andy home and thought about him. That's what was so great about him. You really don't need ""Man On The Moon"" for that. Yes, Jim Carrey captures him in all his guises, such as Latka the star of the TV sitcom ""Taxi"" and Tony Clifton the bitter lounge singer. You have to marvel at Carrey's talent. Even the way he uses his eyes is spot-on Andy. But everything worthwhile Carrey does in this movie you can see Kaufman himself do in documentaries and video clips.The main problem with ""Man On The Moon"" is the story around Carrey, which is a very pedestrian retelling of the various outrageous public moments in Kaufman's career. Carrey as Kaufman introduces the film in a funny bit, telling us they played around with the facts for dramatic purposes and that he doesn't approve. But there's nothing organic or involving in the rejiggered storyline, just a lot of set pieces people already know from seeing the two Kaufman documentaries that did the rounds at Comedy Central back in the day.There's a ""Taxi"" montage where we see many of the real cast members playing alongside Carrey, but it doesn't say anything about what Kaufman did on the show to connect with a mass audience for the only time in his career. The assumption going in is everyone watching this film knows we are watching a master at work. Throughout the film, there's a sense of homage being paid which grates.""You're insane, but you might also be brilliant,"" his aspiring manager George Shapiro tells him in one of many groaner lines.Danny DeVito plays Shapiro. DeVito worked with the real Kaufman, and I guess that's a plus, but I don't get why a guy so well-known for playing ""Taxi's"" Louis DePalma is filmed hovering around the ""Taxi"" set playing someone else. It's distracting.Nobody else clicks in the supporting cast, either. Paul Giamatti feels awkward and forced as Kaufman's writer and friend Bob Zmuda. He's too smug, and not enough of a doorway into what makes Andy tick. Courtney Love is awful in the role of Kaufman's squeeze, never really giving us any sense of why she's there and loves him after all the misery he puts her through around the wrestling ring. Does she know if Andy is playing with her? Does she care? She did a good job in director Milos Forman's previous film ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt,"" and you get the sense he either enjoyed working with her or fancied she was a critics' darling.The film does work more near the end, especially with a giddy Carnegie Hall performance starring Kaufman where the Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and Santa Claus close the show and Andy takes the audience out for milk and cookies.

Well-done biography of comedian Andy Kaufman...,"1st watched 6/3/2000 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Milos Forman): Well-done biography of comedian Andy Kaufman with a very much real to life performance by Carrey.Again, brilliant casting with Carrey in a perfect role for him with a story and direction that keeps you interested although seems to be missing key elements which could have showed Kaufman as a more well-rounded character.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very satisfying movie.,"""Man on the Moon"" comes at the tail end of a year of great movies, including ""American Beauty,"" ""The Insider,"" ""Fight Club,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""Summer of Sam.""  Although I was a bit frustrated with the lack of exploration into Kaufmann's childhood in beginning of the film, I soon realized that the film did not deeply explore certain aspects of his life because nobody (even those closest to him) did not know a whole lot about him.  I then realized this movie was perfectly capturing this enigmatic character.Jim Carrey's performance is absolutely phenomenal.  He captures the essence of Kaufmann's insanity, while still allowing him to be human when they show Andy with his performance ""hat"" off.  Being completely ripped last year by not receiving an Oscar nod for ""The Truman Show,"" Carrey should gain his long-deserved respect from the Academy this year.  If it does not happen again, it will be an absolute crime.The movie as a whole is also tremendous, with Milos Forman doing a top-notch directing job with this bioptic.  R.E.M. also provided great music for the film.  There should be Oscar noms for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Original Score.  I would even like to see a best supporting actor nod for Paul Giamatti, but that will be a long shot.The best part of the entire film is the beginning, which would probably be how Kaufmann would have started the film himself.  Absolutely perfect!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Jim Carrey's performance is flawless,"This is by far Jim Carrey's best work.

"Unenlightening, unnecessary movie","Despite a great performance from Jim Carrey, this feels more like a ""greatest hits"" collection of Andy Kaufman performances than any serious attempt to examine him or try to understand him. Some people have said that by not trying to psychoanalyze Kaufman the filmmakers show admirable restraint and point up the fact that we can never truly ""know"" anybody or their motives. Fine, but in that case why make a movie? Without an angle or a point of view to it, a biopic is just dull. Books and/or documentaries remain the best way to chronicle a person's life - and in Kaufman's case, there are several good examples of both (books: ""Lost in the Funhouse"" by Bill Zehme and ""Andy Kaufman Revealed"" by his friend and writing partner Bob Zmuda; documentaries: Comedy Central's Salute to Andy Kaufman and, if you're interested primarily in his wrestling exploits and his bouts with Jerry Lawler ""I Come From Hollywood"" - and there are others as well). With so much information out there about the man, this movie just feels redundant and unneccesary.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A view from someone not born before Andy's death.,"I'd only heard minimal things about Andy Kaufman before Man on the Moon was even thought of.  I'd heard of the things he'd done with Jerry Lawler as a wrestling fan, but I never knew truly what was so special about Andy. Insanity or Genius is the big issue, and as Jim Carey portrayed in this movie, Andy was 100% pure genius, just as Carey was.Anyone who doubts Carey's dramatic acting abilities, even after the Truman Show, will be proven wrong completely by his role in MOTM.  Andy may have died when I was two years old, but this movie will keep his legacy alive for years.  Absolutely amazing, is all I can say.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carreys best,"This is Jim Carrey's best acting performance yet. The portrait he does of Andy Kaufman is amazing.

Simply one of the best films,"Jim Carrey stands out, it's good that after so many years, with his outstanding performance in The Truman Show, people are realizing how a great actor he is instead of making him just act in ""faces-grimaces-sneers-pouts"" movies.I read from someone that Andy Kauffman wasn't that funny, well, whomever wrote that comment definitely didn't ever watch him. As Latka Gravas, Andy was Unique, whomever I've shown tapes from Taxi, can't help but laugh out loud with the first ten minutes of watching Andy. So that was a pretty judicious comment by someone who might be just jealous of Kauffman's talent. Just a comment in my opinion.I really loved this movie. 10/10 in spite of the small goofs the movie shows in continuity and others.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Reality is an illusion. Mess with it!,"I loved Andy Kaufmann on taxi. Apparently he was not thrilled doing it. ""Man On The Moon"" is a must see for anyone serious about comedy. I know something is good when the hair on the back of my neck stands up. It happened while watching this movie. Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufmann so seamlessly that the character you see is Andy not Jim Carrey playing Andy. A similar experience for me was when Anthony Hopkins played Nixon in ""Nixon"". Because Andy believes that reality is an illusion he feels compelled to mess with it. Damn the torpedos! Straight ahead. Screw them if they can't take a joke. Silence is humorous. Excruciating dead air silence is even funnier. If you have never seen a lounge lizard then you have to see this movie for more reasons than I am able to mention. I loved how Andy was always bucking the establishment. He was not only marching to a different drummer he was in a totally different band. If rules are made then more often than not they should be broken. Amazingly humor and chaos are often the by-products. If he stirs up extreme antipathy, all the better. I will not spoil the extravaganza part of the movie but it is amazing. Andy has the sensibility of a child at Christmas who leaves Santa milk and cookies. Andy is in bad shape with a rare form of cancer and decides to go to the Philippines for a miracle ""cure"". After waiting in line for a very long time, it is his turn to be ""operated"" on. When he is on the table he notices ""his tumor"" being palmed by the ""surgeon"". I am sure that the macabre humor of just another reality illusion is not lost on him. It is very sad that Andy dies so young but his funeral is a blast. Andy could honestly say that he did it his way.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Man on the Moon,"Looks at the so called strange 'anti-comedy' of Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) and the man's cult following and rise to prominence, most famously perhaps in 'Taxi'. Supported by colleague and stooge, Paul Giamatti and manager Danny DeVito, it tracks Kaufman's early stand up work through to his untimely death from lung cancer at just 35.Clearly Kaufman had a considerable following with many labelling him a genius - although that badge seems to apply to anyone who died young. However, his deeply odd sense of what constituted funny is not to everyone's taste, including myself. That said, this is not a stand up nor is it trying to explain the man's thinking. It a biography and it is acted extremely well by Carrey, who famously stayed in character for the duration of the shoot. He is also well supported by DeVito and Giamatti. I guess I'd have liked to get underneath the guy a bit more to understand the thinking behind say, his 'hilarious' wrestling phase, but you can't have everything. Worth catching as a well acted biographical drama, as for the comedy you either believe him incredible or like me, you may tend to scratch your head.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Questions about Andy that have stuck in my mind for years are not necessarily answered by this film, but they are acknowledged, and that acknowledgement makes me feel better overall.","I was only 6 years old when Andy Kaufman started working on ""Taxi"" and believe it or not, I remember. Who wouldn't? Latka Gravas was an adorable character, and despite his being a network redefinition of Andy's original Foreign Man (from his stand up routine), I still believe that the tenderness was true facet of Andy's complicated heart.Those expecting a standard lifeline biopic will perhaps be disappointed. A look at the teenage Andy in high school is not to be found here. No first dates here. We go from a very young Andy singing animal songs with his baby sister, directly to his singing those same animal songs with a drunken and unamused audience in an anonymous comedy club. But the film suffers nothing from this leap in time, because this is a look at the private Andy behind the public Andy we all watched develop on television.To say the representations of the people in Andy's life are accurately portrayed is an understatement, because the people he knew and worked with are (with notable expections) all here. The cast of Taxi, Lorne Michaels, Jerry Lawler, David Letterman and others all play themselves, and you sense that they are all doing this out of their love for Andy.My feelings about this film are time-released, like the old Contac commercials used to claim. I saw it yesterday afternoon, and today I find myself pondering points and sorting emotions.Questions about Andy that have stuck in my mind for years are not necessarily answered by this film, but they are acknowledged, and that acknowledgement makes me feel better overall. It is hard to explain, and especially difficult because I have no desire to reveal any of this films secrets and surprises prematurely.The film is wonderful. I have been asked by friends if it is sad. Yes, very much so. And it is very funny. There was a gleeful darkness to Andy's art that did not make him an easy person to appreciate, but there is a poignancy to his story that offsets that darkness. And somehow this film has managed to give its audience a look at the center of that balance of light and dark, of sadness and joy.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

It's a highly conventional movie, totally lacking in Kaufman's flair and style - especially his way of toying with an audience's expectations about what they're going to see.

Excellent movie with a stunning performance by Carrey,"""Man on the Moon"" was an excellent movie by director Milos Forman.  It is about Andy Kaufman's career as a performer and around the end of his life, leaving an open mystery at the end.  Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman to a tee in this movie and never misses a beat in any scene. The movie doesn't give much depth to the real Andy Kaufman, which adds to the mystery of the real man, plus Andy is one of those people no one can fully understand.

Controversial... but I loved it!,"This is a film I have seen three times now and I must admit I love it! Apart from his portrayal of Ladka (hope I spelt that right) on the TV show 'Taxi', I knew very little about Andy Kaufman. Of course much of his work was focused on the US and so we didn't really hear much about it here in the UK. He was quite a character who had a very controversial career, some of it worked and was brilliant and some of it was a bit too wide of the mark for many. Either way, I found it a very interesting and entertaining film with a stand-out performance from Jim Carrey. I will tell you more after this brief summary.We begin with a very young Andy Kaufman putting on shows for his kid sister. Moving on, he's doing stand-up in a club when an agent, George Shapiro, sees him and offers to represent him. This leads to him landing the role of Ladka in 'Taxi', a role which, we are lead to believe, he didn't really want to do. Another character, Tony Clifton, puts in an appearance at this point. He is a cabaret singer and a very good friend of Andy's; in fact, Andy would only agree to play the part of Ladka if Tony could also appear in the show. Moving on, Andy and his writing partner, Bob Zmuda, turn their attention to wrestling and Andy begins to play the bad guy, wrestling women. One of the top wrestlers in the country, Jerry Lawler, doesn't like it and challenges Kaufman to a fight! It all comes to a head when they come to blows live on the David Letterman chat show. Little did people realise, but it was all staged and Kaufman and Lawler were really good friends. Andy eventually meets Lynne Marguiles who becomes his partner and they move in together. Sadly, it's not long after that he is diagnosed with cancer. Whilst fighting it he fulfils his lifetime ambition and puts on a show at Carnegie Hall in New York. I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Biopics Division) will be making my biopic a little shorter.A well made film with many people playing themselves which is either a testament to Andy Kaufman or they needed the work (that's a joke by the way). For me, the stand-out performance came from Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman; his best performance to date (IMO)! Danny DeVito did a great job as George Shapiro, as did Courtney Love as Lynne Marguiles and Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda. But, for me, a film that can bring together the likes of; Marilu Henner from 'Taxi', Judd Hirsch from 'Taxi', Carol Kane from 'Taxi', David Letterman and Christopher Lloyd from 'Taxi' has to have something special.I think the reason I like Jim Carrey in this so much is that it gives him the opportunity to play the crazy zany stuff he's famous for while at the same time giving him the chance to show the audience what a fine dramatic actor he is as well. The title comes from the REM song about Andy of the same name, refrains of which can be heard throughout the film, which I thought was a nice touch. As I said at the beginning this is the third time I've watched this film and it's the third time it's touched me emotionally. Not many films do that these days and so I have no problem in giving it a higher score than many and also deeming it 'highly recommended'.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 7.4/10 (based on 59,843 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 62/100 (based on 117 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 74/100 (based on 89,423 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fine Performance in Fair Film,"Andy Kaufman fell into the same ""trap"" as did Harry Houdini--having to ""top one's self"" with every performance. It just can't be done.Like many excessive talents (Garland and Jolson come immediately to mind) such quests lead to career burnouts and fast trips to the morgue.No matter how much the audience may scream and holler for more, the solo performer must hold back. It's a technique and lesson that, unfortunately, some performers are incapable of implementing.  Kaufman was one such performer.Not only did he give his all onstage, but his outrageous antics were carried over into his real life behavior, so that it became difficult to separate one from the other.Jim Carrey does indeed ""become"" Kaufman, so successfully that his work may be held up as a model of the ""Method"" tehcnique.  Alas, the interminable timing and delivery of the late comedian's lines, the quirkiness of his style, and the outlandish behavior of his offstage persona, make for some mighty uneven going in this presentation.One is never quite sure just what makes this guy ""tick.""  We cut from a brief childhood scene to a fully grown man, with little idea of what's actually going on in that unique brain.  Just what's the driving force and need to make his entire lifestyle an avant guarde ""happening""?There's some pieces missing from the scripters' creation here, and it has to do with filling in some of the blanks to the Kaufman legend. Milos Forman's direction is professional enough, yet it too seems to lack insights to help render a fully realized portrait.We end getting uneven highlights of the late comic's life and work, and an impressive and memorable job of characterization by the very talented Jim Carrey.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

A classic Jim Carrey effort,"Genius or lunatic, regardless of what you think of comedian and boundary pushing performer Andy Kaufman it's safe to say he influenced and heralded in a whole new age of comedian and is responsible for the likes of Jim Carrey, Sacha Baron Cohen and other such similar blurred-line acts.While perhaps not a household name as such, Kaufman who rose to fame in the late 70's and early 80's from roles in shows like Saturday Night Live, Taxi and his infamous live TV appearances such as what occurred with pro-wrestler Jerry Lawler on David Letterman, was an endlessly energetic and constantly mysterious human being that underrated director Milos Forman and his leading man Jim Carrey shone a light on in the memorable 1999 film Man on the Moon.A film that harbors one of Carrey's best individual performances (a performance that will be examined in upcoming Netflix doco Jim and Andy), Man on the Moon does a fantastic job of recreating many of Kaufman's most infamous events from his early rise, his Taxi fame, wrestling exploits and perhaps most fascinating of all, his washed up Las Vegas singer alter-ego Tony Clifton.Kaufman being the figure he was (or still is if you buy into many conspiracies around the fact Kaufman never in fact passed away), makes it extremely hard for Forman and Carrey to offer any significant insights into what drove Kaufman to do the things he did or what possessed him to pursue certain aspects of his too short of a career.It's part of the unarguable charm of the performer though, a man that as sure as day would be concocting his next surprise or event at any given chance and it's this manic, almost otherworldly ability that Carrey and Forman capture to great effect.In a performance that blurs the line between imitation and full on embodiment, Carrey literally becomes Kaufman and it's a turn that deserved more plaudits upon initial release.Ably supported by Danny DeVito as Andy's committed agent George Shapiro and Paul Giamatti as long-time friend and fellow ""comedian"" Bob Zmuda, watching real life footage of Carrey and Kaufman and key scenes of the film compared with real life footage, you get a full understanding that this was as good of a reincarnation of Kaufman as we're ever going to get.Final Say –For anyone looking for an insight into the life and times of Kaufman Man on the Moon is the perfect answer, as well as being a refreshing reminder that Jim Carrey can match it with the best of them when given material that suits his unique and often underrated acting abilities.4 neck braces out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Carrey does it again!,"I actually don't know if i'd have liked Kaufman if I 'd got to watch any of his performances, but from what I saw in this movie, he wasn't very funny. Notwithstanding that, I sympathized with him watching him go through all those ups and downs; and that's all due to the excellent direction and acting - mostly, of course, Carrey's acting.  DeVito and Love may do their best in this movie, yet it seems that there's not much space for them and the characters they impersonate end up seeming  a little shallow. Apart from that, though, this is a very good movie, whether we like Kaufman or not; because, in my humble opinion, we're supposed to comment on the movie here, not him.When he's not making all those weird faces in crap movies, Jim Carrey is a brilliant actor.

The movie I've waited for for years.,"Before the making of the film was even conceived, I was remarkably impressed by the impact Andy Kaufman had made in his few short years (the NBC special had reinforced that), and I knew full well that someone was going to make a movie about that man, sooner or later.To my delight, I heard that it was going to be a definite, and, of all people, Milos Forman was going to direct (a pleasant surprise, on my part). I had a good idea who would try out for the part even before the project had initially materialized, but I never would have guessed that it would've been Jim Carrey.To me, Nicolas Cage would've been the ideal Kaufman. For one thing, Cage looks and sounds like Kaufman, and at minimal effort, no less. Though Cage often comes off as dry, at least on screen, he has the capacity to be dynamic (e.g. Vampire's Kiss), and if anyone has the reputation for throwing himself into a part, it's him.I was pleased that he had at least tried out for the part, as had Kevin Spacey (a genuine master of mimicry), John Cusack (a remarkably underestimated actor), and Gary Oldman (one of the most typecast men in the business), and was disappointed that none of these men landed the role. Then I learned who had.I am not downplaying Carrey's abilities; I believe that every comedic performer needs to diversify, that is, to try out at least one non-dramatic role. Steve Martin did ('The Spanish Prisoner', among others), as did Mike Myers (with '54', establishing himself as this generation's Peter Sellers), and Robin Williams (though, in his case, is often not completely, but that is a separate discussion), all with stunning success. Carrey had amazed me with 'The Truman Show' (though his trademark dynamics had, at times, popped out), as with 'Simon Birch' (although we only received an inkling of it, there). Granted, Kaufman's film is, at the root of things, comedic, so superficially, it may not seem as much of stretch.Then, after the long wait (and countless shifts of the release date), it came to theatres. Not since Rain Man or Awakenings have I seen more fine a technical performance. The fact that Carrey was resurrecting a person who actually lived and breathed, that was even more impressive. The only harm to the film was that the material had a slight air of deification (e.g. the first dinner with future agent George Shapiro), but despite that, it is a showcase of genuine talent.It was somewhat startling that Carrey was not included among the five men chosen to be Best Actor nominees by the Academy for 1999, though one must remember that there are so many spaces to fill (and that the five performances that were chosen were not unsatisfactory, themselves; we must also remember that there were several other magnificent performances over the course of the year that were overlooked for that category, including those of Bob Hoskins, Matt Damon, and my personal dark-horse pick, Val Kilmer). Carrey, to his credit, did put more effort than most, and should've at least seen the fruits of his labour. Hopefully, Carrey will not become dis-heartened by the whole thing, and will continue to venture into the dramatic (there is no doubt in my mind that he has the capacity to play a completely serious lead; if 'Man on the Moon' has proven anything, it has proven that there is very little Carrey can't do).Enough about that, though; back to my review of the film. Overall, it is a well-presented and well-organized (though a few of the details are modified out of convenience for the sake of plot and casting), and the fact that it was the first of its kind, and that it was actually pulled off, that was a feat, in itself, so kudos to the team, that for two hours and ten minutes, made Kaufman live, again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply a mind-blowing experience,"This film single handedly tackles some of the most complex social problems in the world, whilst giving credit (and discredit where necessary) to some of the most beautiful (and often, unappreciated) cultural assets of the world as a unified culture.No comment would ever describe the numerous (and possibly uncountable) messages contained within this film.This is by far the best film I have ever watched in my entire life, and I am only sorry I did not watch it before (although I believe the timing was perfect, as only after experience what I have experience in life could I really appreciate all this film has to say).If you are an open minded human being, who appreciates cultural diversity and wants to spread kindness and positive energy throughout the world, this will become your favourite film, as it has just become mine within the last few hours (that it has taken me to watch it!).Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Confusing, moving, and a bit overwhelming. A must see.","First, I think that audiences who have seen Andy Kaufman perform will get the most kicks out of this movie, (whether you loved or hated him), but even someone who has never heard of Tony Clifton, or has never seen Taxi, will probably enjoy this picture. Carrey was born to play Kaufman, and I think that his performance was Oscar-calibre, (as was ""Truman Show"" for which he was tragically looked over).

Out of this world!!!,"Saw this movie on New Years Eve and LOVED it. Jim Carrey is beyond brilliant in this movie that after awhile you forget it's Carrey and you just see Andy Kaufman/Tony Clifton. Danny DeVito is solid(as always) as Kaufman's agent George Shappiro and Paul Giamatti is perfect as Kaufman's partner in pranks Bob Zmuda. Courtney Love is effective as Kaufman's love interest. And pro wrestling star Jerry Lawler appears as himself and does well. This movie hit me in all the right places with the only flaw being that it had to end sometime. Just give Carrey the Oscar, now!

His performance was his best yet, only equalled by that of the Truman show. Jim i think is one of the most under-rated actors ever.

good movie with excellent performances,"this picture is a very complete and interesting biography of the great andy kauffman. jim carrey is andy kauffman and we really believe he is the man, his performance is great, i don't know why hollywood guys don't nominate him for best actor (he is great in this movie and in ""the truman show""). i think he can do anything, from comedy to drama, i believe he's a very underrated actor. danny de vito is very good as kauffman's manager and friend. courtney love is rather good as his girlfriend and paul ""something"" is great as his friend. direction is good but milos forman can do better (""one flew over the coocko's nest"" and ""amadeus""). the rest of the movie is ok, the story is good but it has sometimes lame dialogue and the score is forgettable.overall, this is a very good movie with some little flaws. special mention to the best scene: when andy tells his friends that he has cancer (i love this scene, especially when jim carrey speaks). 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Some reviewers missing the point,"We have just watched this on TV. I get easily bored but this kept me rivetedI didn't know anything about Andy Kaufman.

You might just as well say "" I didn't agree with Adolf Hitler's policies and he was a real jerk so I'll give Downfall 1 star too"". I don't understand why you would want to watch a film where there was really no possibility that you would like it. I've got better ways to spend my timeI thought JIm Carrey was excellent. Good supporting cast too.

Hollywood...on its own importance....,"narcissism abounds. While Jim Carrey gives an excellent performance, the director of this film apparently has forgotten about international audiences, the fact that a sit-com from the 1970's is not high art, and even though he was an oddity, Andy Kaufman as a person, playing a practical joke on American audiences, may not be interesting or well-liked to many.Is it news that Kauffman knew how to manipulate the press? (what star doesn't). Is it news that TV has its trends, and he hooked into something (no). As Paul Giamatti says:...""we got 40,000 people tuning in to see 'Taxi' every night""... . Kauffman: ""What do they know?"". Giamatti: ""exactly"". Ah, yes, thank God for stupid American audiences.The funeral scene in particular was irritating. Coutney Love, Peter Bonerz, Kauffman's parents, all are reverently singing the world is a happy place (or some such nonsense) because the sing-along song is a backdrop behind Kauffman's coffin. What is the subliminal message? We, Hollywood, revere Kauffman; we know something you don't.Presumptuous, smug and really, I hope the international audiences out there don't think all American audiences are stupid. Some celebrities have gotten a free ride, (especially sit-com celebrities) and it would be refreshing to hear them admit that once in awhile.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolute genius! Carrey was robbed of an Oscar for this!,"?This film is utterly fantastic! A work of genius even. Jim Carrey was Oscar worthy here, and Tony Clifton needs to be on T-shirts! A unique biography with unique humour and a unique yet true story. I cant praise this film enough, and what an ending! Along with cable guy, and Me myself and Irene, this film is so under appreciated its criminal. I am at least glad its found its way into cult status, especially in the UK. Tony Clifton has some of the funniest and quotable lines ever! And without disrespecting the real Andy Kauffman, Jim added more spark to his characters, but played a convincing job.I think in many years time when Carrey is old, and receives a lifetime achievement award, this film will resurface and get the recognition it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Extraordinary Film- as it should be,"With its terrific cast, well crafted direction, and a spirit that seems to belong to Kaufman himself- Man on the Moon proves to be a fascinating biopic about the life of one of Hollywood's most unusual characters. Many people have different opinions on this film. On the negative side of things, they find Carrey's portrayal as Kaufman to be over-exaggerated and poorly done- which honestly I find kind of funny to hear. Not to diminish anyone's opinion, but for me it's clear that Carrey doesn't just play Kaufman or mimic what he did word for word action for action- he is playing the role the way Kaufman would want- exuberant and quirky. In a biopic on his own life, I can only see Kaufman being played by Carrey- as clearly more than any other human being out there- Carrey truly understands what it's like to be misunderstood- and still be able to joke about it. Carrey's performance, despite what some may say, is absolutely brilliant, and is perhaps his best performance to date. The supporting actors in the film are also onderfully casted, specifically stars Danny DeVito and a young Paul Giamatti- who play their roles perfectly alongside Carrey's encaptured and dedicated performance. I adore the look of the film, subtle and yet so 70's, that it just fits so perfectly. The film can be quite hard to watch unfold at times, like a car crash exploding in front of you. What's so amazing though about the film is the range of emotions it makes you feel and understand, not just throughout the film, but throughout each scene. It may not be a perfect film, but Man on the Moon manages to both move and fascinate any open viewers upon its strange canvas of a life that could never be understood- and still longs to be as well. If your a fan of Kaufman or Carrey, you'll easily love the film, and even if not- your opinion might just change on both of them.My Rating: 9.9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This film is enjoyable.,"I found Man on the Moon to be an entertaining and informative film on the life of Andy Kauffman.  I grew up watching Andy on 'Taxi' and 'Saturday Night Live', and it was extremely interesting to me to see how he lived his life.

I will recommend this film to all my friends.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tour de force performance by Jim Carrey,"This realistic biographical treatment of the life of Andy Kaufman is a tour de force triumph for Jim Carrey in the starring role.  Carrey portrays Kaufman with such spooky accuracy that one has to wonder whether this was an impersonation or a possession.  Kaufman could not have played Kaufman any better.Andy Kaufman was an audacious pioneer in the world of shock comedy.  His most popular work in Taxi' was not his most important and was the work he liked the least.  Kaufman was a ruthless manipulator of human emotion.  He didn't care whether people loved him or hated him, laughed or cursed him as long as they were reacting.  He would go to any lengths, no matter how ridiculous or distasteful to shock his audience and put one over on them. Though not the first in this regard (Don Rickles and Don Imus were offending people's sensibilities long before Kaufman emerged) his antics raised the bar for shock comedy, aiding people like of Howard Stern, Sam Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay.  Though I don't personally believe this is a particularly constructive direction, I must concede that Kaufman broke through some major barriers.The film's biggest shortcoming is its neglect of the inner Kaufman.  Some of the best scenes explaining Kaufman's motivations and reactions to his own behavior ended up in the deleted scenes bonus feature on the DVD.  This relegated the film to becoming an Andy Kaufman greatest hits film without Andy.  While it was entertaining as such, the burning question remains unanswered, namely, `What is this guy thinking as he behaves this way?'I can't say enough about Jim Carrey's performance.  He totally immersed himself in the character down to the most meticulous detail.  As he explained in the featurette, he didn't just try to impersonate Kaufman, he was intent on becoming him 24 hours a day.  People who knew Kaufman well like Danny DeVito and Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Margulies said that it was like Andy had taken over Carrey's body.  With each film he makes I gain a new appreciation for Carrey's skills as a comedian and actor.  Though much of his early work was tripe, his range of abilities continues to expand with each new role.  In many ways he reminds me of Jerry Lewis, a brilliant mind behind the face of the village idiot.I rated this film an 8/10.  It is a must see for Andy Kaufman fans and will still be entertaining for those who missed Kaufman's work.  Unfortunately, it lacked insight and that made it incomplete.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A dumber Andy for a dumber age?,"As I recall the appeal of Andy Kaufman was that he did a hip, sophisticated act, somewhere between state-of-the-art standup and museum-quality performance art. In this film he's portrayed as an obnoxious, antisocial jerk whose humor mostly consisted of alternately insulting and boring people. Which I suppose is credible as the ""Kaufman for Dummies"" version, but hardly the whole story. Anyway, the very stale, predictable Hollywood biopic style of the film is so far beneath the intelligence of its subject that it's practically nonsensical. How can a stupid film properly celebrate a smart man?",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A must see biography,"I just got out of the theater a matter of hours ago and I must say that this has been one of the most stunning movies of the year.Jim Carrey definitely performs at an Oscar worthy level, in fact I might be so bold as to say that this is his best performance in a feature length movie. I admit to my lack of Andy Kaufman knowledge, although I have seen many of his SNL skits and plenty of TAXI episodes, I learned a great deal of respect for his genius in entertainment and also became aware more of his personal history and personality.Not only is this movie informative, but amazingly entertaining. Nowadays, a combination that can seem almost non-existent. Milos Forman has proven himself again in my book, as I loved One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, and more recently, The People vs. Larry Flynt. I'm convinced that, although he hasn't worked on many films, he chooses them wisely.So all I can really say is see this one for yourself and then pass the word along to your friends because this is a guaranteed winner.

A genius portraying a genius!,"What struck me about this film was the fact that even though I had not a clue as to who Andy Kaufman was prior to watching this film, I felt as if I had been hearing of him for the past twenty years after seeing it. This film told me about him very, very much and in a very, very realistic, non movie-like way...it did not dramatize every other minute and I felt as if I was actually watching his life story, not a fictional drama or comedy.Also, I was glad to see that this film did not attempt to explain, nor attempt to find a cause in Andy's way of performing, his way of LIFE. In the end, the audience is left with the same thought with which they began watching this film: ""Why was Andy Kaufman so strange?"" Nonetheless, you do not find yourself disappointed once the ending arrives. What you are left with are joyous thoughts, intense thoughts...which is exactly what Andy would wish you to have.And Jim Carrey - WOW. Many have said this and I agree with all my heart; Jim Carrey became Andy Kaufman for this role. When I got on the internet and watched a few videos of Andy, scenes which were featured in the film, but acted out by Jim, the resemblance was, at times, even frightening. Jim Carrey, the man who uses his typical facial movements in many films, was something absolutely different in this film. Of course, his ability to change his countenance was imperative, but in a completely new way.If you are not looking for extreme Hollywood entertainment, but a wonderful film, this will make you smile.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Long, repetitive, tedious and boring","I'd never heard of Andy Kaufman prior to seeing this movie, growing up in the 80s perhaps he was just a little before my time. If the depiction in the movie is even remotely accurate though then it seems I wasn't missing much. There were a few bits that made me snicker but then those sparse bits were stretched out and used over and over and over well beyond when they were worn out. It's 2+ hours of a guy impersonating two strange characters over and over and over, acting like a jerk with a personality disorder and playing juvenile practical jokes on people. I found myself groaning and cringing far more than laughing and when it ended I thought OMG it's finally over. Maybe there's something I'm missing here but I just don't get it or understand why this is supposed to be funny. All of the entertaining bits from the entire stinker of a movie could have been put into a 5 minute clip.

Andy Kaufman is a man on the moon!!!,"Honestly, I didn't know who Andy Kaufman was before watching this movie. Allow me to recreate the scene: I was about to sleep and I was watching TV (I think it was HBO, I don't remember), however, I saw that a movie called ""Man on the moon"" was about to start so I decided I was already tired of watching porn by that time at night and watched it.OK, now that i think about it, it wasn't necessary to tell all that story,eh whatever. I found out some things after watching this movie, first, it wasn't Neil Amstrong's biography (thanks god), it was Andy Kaufman's, one of the biggest comedians in the world that I got to know better after watching this movie and searching for some taxi episodes.And I think there's one point in his movie that gives a lot of sense to understanding Kaufman's attitude and that is that Andy worked to entertain himself, not to entertain his public.That's the reason why he did a lot of crazy stuff that sometimes public didn't like, because he wanted to laugh, that was his priority, sometimes it was good because public laughed also, but that wasn't important for him, he just wanted to be happy like every person.One of my favorite scenes is when he goes with the guru guy to try to heal his cancer disease and he laughs a lot wen he sees the guru is cheating on people, because that was a joke life played to him, he liked to play jokes for everyone and now it was his time.And I think that's all I got to say, Andy Kaufman is a man on the moon, because he was different from all people, he didn't forget the meaning of life, do things for you to be happy, not always for the others and I think that's a lesson we all have to learn.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly Enjoyable,"This movie once again shows Jim Carrey's eclectic talent.  He seems born to follow in Mr. Kaufman's footsteps.  Considering his own personal love and admiration of Andy Kaufman, he gives the role a warmth that even the people who used to hate Andy Kaufman will enjoy.  I personally loved him for his crazy humor, even though I was not old enough to appreciate his genius in his time.  It was very moving as I felt that I was experiencing it first hand.  Carrey plays Kaufman with a haunting reality.  I see a nomination in the future..hopefully this will make up for the one he should have gotten for Truman Show (even though I am still pretty sure that Kevin Spacey will walk away with it).  There are some fabulous cameos in the movie, which also hint at how much people miss him.  It also lets in on the secrets that people might still not know.  I actually went with someone who has never seen anything Andy Kaufman has done...and I still think she is confused...but in any event.  I highly recommend this film.  It is touching, well acted and well directed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Who is Andy Kaufman?,"Some called him a genius; others thought him insane.  Myself, I would say unfunny.  Of course, I'm talking about Jim Carrey.  And it's only appropriate, I guess, that Carrey would play the part of Andy Kaufman, who falls under the same criteria.  Milos Forman gives Carrey full rein with the role of Kaufman and Carrey delivers.  The film itself, though, is more of a mixed bag.  You have to be familiar with Kaufman to really appreciate the film.Things start out in a Kaufmanesqe manner in a great opening that sets up the tone.  Kaufman addresses the crowd directly to tell them a bit what the film is about.  I won't give anything away, but this seemed to divide the audience immediately.  Some found it hilarious, some were puzzled, and some were expecting a Jim Carrey film.  They were unhappy when they didn't get it.From there we go to Andy's childhood as we see him perform to his bedroom wall.  Eventually, he gets nerve to perform on a stage, though things are lass than ideal for him as the manager tells him he isn't funny.  But Andy's a survivor and he eventually wows a club with his Elvis act.  Robert Shapiro (Danny DeVito) sees him and decides to take him under his wing as manager. Don't say he didn't get warned.Andy then makes it big on the television show ""Taxi"" as mechanic Latka Gravas.  Andy's experiences on the set are nicely dramatized in a clever montage featuring Judd Hirsch and Marilu Henner in their old roles of Alex Reiger and Elaine Nardo.  Things seem to be going well, that is until Shapiro gets introduced to Andy's protege, the obnoxious Tony Clifton.  To make matters worse for Shapiro (and heavenly for Andy) it seems that Andy Kaufman has found his calling, namely wrestling women.  However, Andy gets more than he bargained for when he crosses paths with professional wrestler Jerry ""The King"" Lawler.Finally, in the early 80s, Andy gets diagnosed with lung cancer.  Andy tries all sorts of exotic treatments to cure his cancer, and in one painful moment all of his hucksterism and pulling-the-strings comes back to play a cruel joke.  Andy's response?  Laughter.  He appreciates a good joke, even if it is life-or-death.Forman's biography is not as illuminating into the mind of Kaufman as he makes it out to be.  And I suppose it's just as well, the only one who totally knew Andy was Andy.  Still, this film is a nice introduction to Kaufman and why he was more than just ""Latka on Taxi.""But will people care?  That I'm not so sure about.  What I found interesting, at least with the audience I saw it with, was that more people were laughing at the ""ordinary"" behavior of Kaufman more than his act.  For instance, many people thought a dinner between Andy and Shapiro was hilarious and a scene where Andy reads ""The Great Gatsby"" from front-to-back was stupid.  One thing that bothered me was the reaction to his belief in transcendental meditation.  Many in the audience got a kick out of seeing Andy with the weirdly dressed gurus.  I was straight-faced because to Andy TM was serious and I respected that.There is also a kind of fairy tale like feel to the story which I found to be distracting.  But then one could make the argument that Andy saw his life as a fairy tale and that's fine.  Still I had to keep reminding myself that Andy Kaufman did exist, that he did wrestle women, that he stretched performance art to its limits, and that he died of lung cancer.  I wonder if people who went for Jim Carrey and not for Andy Kaufman understood all that.As for Kaufman's place in stand-up history...let me put it this way, no one currently in stand-up is doing what he did, which says something.  Lenny Bruce, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Albert Brooks have all stuck with anecdotal, observational, and social humor.  Kaufman didn't tell jokes.  In fact, Kaufman did everything possible to not let humor be the end-all be-all of his act.  It was reaction that he sought, whether it be a groan, a curse, applause or laughter.  To him failure was success.  He was basically a behaviorist.Now whether non-fans will see all that, I don't know.  In explaining him to one person I know, I used his ""Mighty Mouse"" act where Kaufman just stands there for three minutes, then he puts on the song and mouths the words on ""Here I come to save the day!""  She just looked at me, ""That's just stupid."" On the other hand, I took a guy to see it and he thought Kaufman wasn't funny at all.  After the movie, he looks at me and says, ""I get it now.  I get what he was trying to do.""Andy would be proud.Man on the Moon ***",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Talented Man That Brings You Strong and Contradictory Emotions,"Before seeing ""Man on the Moon"" I had never heard before about Andy Kaufman. By reading some comments and plot outlines, I got the impression that this was simply another celebrity guy who projected an aura of eccentricity just to raise his publicity level (like quite many stars do).However, I have to admit that watching ""Man of the Moon"" was definitely a shock. Portrayed fantastically by Jim Carrey (which gives an Oscar-worthy performance, here), this is a story of a talented man that brings you strong and contradictory emotions: At one point he can make you laugh, at another he can (intentionally) bore you to death; at one point he can make you berserk with his vulgar and rude jokes, at another you can become deeply touched by his strength and willingness to live and entertain his audience despite his grave illness. Andy Kaufman was truly a special man, who did not conform to any norms or rules of society, but whose sole purpose in life was to produce laughter with his own twisted way: Even if the product of his acts was not laughter but boredom, anger, or insult, he still was happy with himself as he thought he was doing the right thing.The film is neither trying to make a hero out of Kaufman, nor a villain out of him; it depicts him in an objective way, leaving the viewer to decide for himself about what kind of man Kaufman really was. As I noted previously, Carrey does a stunning act as Kaufman; an example that shows how he wanted to identify with his role, is that during the filming he insisted to be called ""Andy Kaufman"" both on and off stage! (I read this in the IMDb trivia).The rest of the crew are also superb, and the fact that some actors come from Kaufman's real-life circle brings an air of greater authenticity. Forman's direction is also up to the task.Either you already know about Kaufman, or not (like me), I strongly suggest you see this movie. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Andy Kaufman in a Nutshell,"Many of Andy's antics are recreated in this film, making it a kind of ""Best Of"" compilation.  Unfortunately, some of the details were romanticized, as is so common in Hollywood.However, the film is very enjoyable, interesting, and funny.....funny especially because you get a better idea of where Kaufman was coming from than you did when he was alive(Hard to believe it's already been over 15 years since he died).  His years on the TV show Taxi is given some substantial time (with most of the original cast members present), as well as his escapades in the wrestling ring with women and Jerry Lawler. Particularly funny are the bits when Kaufman was his alter-ego, Tony Clifton.  I have never been much of a fan of Jim Carey's, but he did an EXCELLENT job of portraying Andy Kaufman in this film.Of course, you know that near the end of the movie, Kaufman will die, and although the film deals with it as painlessly as possible, I left the theater saddened that I hadn't paid more attention to Kaufman when he was alive.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is where the magic starts...,"Who was Andy Kaufman?  What was he really like?  The answere is, I think, no one really knew, not even himself.  I think that is the point the critics who mention the film doesn't get to the heart of who Andy Kaufman really was.  Man on the moon may not be 100% accurate, but it's a wonderful film. Being a late Kaufman fan, (I was to young to have a clear memory of him when he was alive and in the direct spotlight), I have become a fan through showings of his classic performances and news shows about him.  What I've seen has been recreated very vividly.  Jim Carrey doesn't just play Andy Kaufman, he is wisked away into Andy, he becomes Andy, in a performance that should earn him one of those little golden trophies.  (If it doesn't then I'm convinced the Oscars are rigged.)  I remember two young ladies leaving the theatre half way through the film, they must have been expecting another ""Ace Ventura"", or ""The Mask"", and had no idea who Andy Kaufman was.  The film isn't for everyone...bottom line, but on the other hand, we have my fiance on the other side who went into the film kicking and screaming, and was all misty eyed at the end (I cried to, it didn't help that she started it...), falling in love with Andy Kaufman as I did long ago.

The Emperor's New Comedian,"Let me say, first, that the film is brilliantly done. I think Jim Carrey is really underrated as an actor. He really shone here: it was very, very easy to think of him as Andy Kaufman; I can't imagine anyone who could have done it better. And given the number of people involved in making this movie, who were actually there and knew Andy, I imagine it's quite accurate.But as someone else here has stated, your reaction to this movie will depend largely on what you thought of Andy Kaufman. If you were fortunate (?) enough to have seen any of his performances (apart from Latka, which was fairly mainstream), you most likely thought, ""What the hell was *that*?"" My high school principal used to tell a joke. It was a really stupid joke. If I told it to you, you would say, ""That's a stupid joke."" And you'd be right -- it's a really stupid joke. But you might also laugh. I always do. I've never understood why this particular joke struck me funny -- it just always has.Andy Kaufman was like that. Why did I laugh? I don't know. He was stupid! But I laughed when I saw him, and I laughed all through this film, and I cried at the end.It's obvious people loved Andy in person -- look at the credits!

Brilliant Biopic,"There's not much that I can add to 561 reviews of this film. It is a loving tribute to a much misunderstood man, or maybe to a man who could not be understood. He created his own life, much like an Andy Warhol character or a latter day Lenny Bruce. He lived his life to create happenings, and maybe was an anachronism by the 1980s. Only Jim Carey could have pulled this off - it was his finest role. But, in the end, Kaufman was a man. Probably a man no one will ever get to the real meaning. Was he certifiably insane. No. He was a performer through and through, and that comes through is this amazing tribute.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman...not the event-movie people were hoping for,"Jim Carrey (as Andy Kaufman) opens this film insisting that there is no movie and tells the audience to leave. The credits roll and Carrey continues, ""It was all a joke, there is no movie, go home!"" This gag, perfectly in keeping with Kaufman's sense of absurdist (and straight-faced) humor, is more interesting than anything else director Milos Forman comes up with. Forman stages Kaufman's life as if it were a manic episode treated matter-of-factly; perhaps he was just the wrong filmmaker to translate this story. Carrey is just about perfect as Kaufman, who was terribly unafraid to be unlikable and yet left audiences wondering whether he really needed the applause and acceptance or not. The movie is a little plastic, a little smug, and finally--by the end--not very satisfying. The recreations of Andy's TV events aren't well captured, and the wrestling stuff gets dull fast. Courtney Love has a nice (if benign) role as a young woman who loves him, but she's not used much. Carrey certainly gives it a valiant try, but you don't learn anything new about Kaufman via the film--which may have been deliberate. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Full of praise for a faultless performance,"If you see one film this year.... I know you have heard it before from me, but this movie has got to be the best film I have had the good fortune to see. The story line is excellent, made more so by the fact that it was true (well most of it), and Jim Carrey's performance (and all the cast) was perfect. Jim WAS Andy in this movie, and the story was moving, funny, and very entertaining.

"Fascinating, but not for everyone","Man on the Moon is one of the stranger films I've seen in recent memory, which is fitting for the life of one of the strangest men ever to acheive fame, however fleeting.  From the first scene, in which Jim Carrey (as Kaufman) tries to convince us the film is already over, the movie is a non-stop celebration of Kaufman's sense of humour, in which the joke was usually on the audience.  The film is somewhat sketchy - Kaufman appears to go from nightclub comedian to 'Saturday Night Live' guest in no time flat - but Jim Carrey's remarkable performance perfectly re-enacts his most famous comic antics.  I was not really familiar with Kaufman before seeing this film, but I will now try to hunt down his real performances on tape.The audience I saw the film with didn't really know how to react.  Andy Kaufman is not really that well known to Carrey's usual audience, and it wouldn't surprise me if many theatregoers didn't even know Andy Kaufman was a real person.  Indeed the audience was as befuddled as the people who paid to see Kaufman do 'Latka' and ended up hearing him recite 'The Great Gatsby' in full.  All of this may hurt the film at the box office - but I think Kaufman, in a way, would have approved. (8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Whether You Loved or Hated Kaufman, You Will Like This Movie.","If you don't know anything about Andy Kaufman, this movie probably won't interest you much. However, if you either read about his antics during the 70's and early 80's, or saw him perform, this movie provides a lot of information about Kaufman's ""shows"" that will interest you.Fans of the T.V. series Taxi may be surprised at how Kaufman manipulated the cast and crew of the show, but shouldn't expect to be entertained by ""Latka"" style humor.Kaufman was a unique individual that nobody ever understood - Kaufman probably didn't understand himself for that matter. The writers of this movie focused more on the facts (interlaced with some fiction) than they did trying to figure out what Andy's motives were.During his public life I enjoyed Kaufman's humor but I agree with most people who saw him perform - he did things that I considered over the line. They were always interesting mind you, but they were over the line. It's really a shame Andy died because now nobody will ever know for certain if there was any ""method to his madness."" His death is relevant, however, when you consider that Andy probably had planned his demise as  his final ""show"" (he seemed to be that far ahead of everybody else.)Who knows, maybe it was!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing performance,"Jim Carrey's sensational performance as Andy Kaufman is at the heart of ""Man on the Moon.""  In fact, it's the whole movie, which doesn't amount to much more than re-creations of Kaufman's greatest hits.  Kaufman's offstage life is not as compellingly presented.  Those who were hoping that the movie would shed some light on this most eccentric of performers will be disappointed.  Still, the movie is well worth seeing for Carrey's uncanny impersonation (some have said ""channeling"") of Kaufman.  When he imitates Elvis, he's not just imitating Elvis -- he's imitating Kaufman imitating Elvis.  And his portrayal of ""Tony Clifton,"" Kaufman's obnoxious alter ego, is a comic masterpiece.  So, you will be greatly entertained, but still clueless as to what made Kaufman tick.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Nothing Special About This Movie. Bob Zmuda's Book Gave Better Incite.,First I have to say I was looking fowared to this movie ever since the 1995 T.V. special that introduced Andy to me.

My expectations were raised for the movie when I read Andy Kaufman Reveled! By Bob Zmuda. The movie was not edited in a time frame that was belivible and key parts of Andy's life where left out. If you had not have known much about andy you whould have sworn he died at the clinic.

Did he or didn't he?,"I was unsure what to expect when I decided to see this film, having little memory of Taxi and none of Andy Kaufmann himself. But without doubt, this was one of the years best movies. An excellent director and top grade cast complement a balanced and entertaining plot that has many quality moments, both dramatic and comedic. The plot deals with Kaufmann's public life well, from his early days on Saturday Night Live to his enduring, endearing character on Taxi, to the crude, rude, but hilarious Tony Clifton. But it also brings the human element through, which is credit to Milos Forman, a great director, and to the writers. The ending was a real highlight, original yet very appropriate, I won't reveal it, but ask yourself this question: Did he or didn't he?"" An excellent supporting cast, including Danny DeVito and Courtney Love in a good performance as Kaufmann's wife, add much to the film as a whole, but undoubtedly the star and shining light is Carrey himself. He portrays the troubled genius that was Andy Kaufmann with brilliant ease, transforming himself and showing the undoubted dramatic talents he has in abundance. His versatility through Kaufmann's many personas and life events, from his stand up act to wrestling to Tony Clifton is worthy of Kaufmann himself. How Jim Carrey didn't get an Oscar nomination I'll never know, but he richly deserved the Golden Globe he did get. An excellent film, one which certainly left a lasting impression, and which deserves the acclaim that it received. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Was this a film or a documentary?,"There are a couple of things that distinguishes a film from a documentary. One of the most important is building a unifying theme throughout the movie, telling a story, rather than just reiterating historical events.  This movie was mostly just a replay of the real-life exploits of Andy Kaufman, with very little attention given to the behind-the-scenes action or, more importantly, motivation behind the events.  Carrey does a great impression of Kaufman, but no effort is given in making Kaufman a complete character.I could have rented a ""best of"" Kaufman tape and gotten the same effect as this film. In fact, the real Kaufman would have been much funnier.  This was like reading a biography written by the subject's biggest fan...a skewed effort attempting to show how great Kaufman was.  Unfortunately, we already knew how much of a comic genius Andy was...he showed us himself.  There is no reason to watch imitators attempt to replay his shining moments.

Stranger than faction,"This remarkable film by Milos Forman tells the life story of the eccentric comedian Andy Kaufman, who died of lung cancer in 1984, aged only 36. The actor who plays Kaufman is himself a comic genius, namely Jim Carrey. (He well deserved his Best Actor Golden Globe award for this role. By the way, Kaufman himself was once nominated for a Golden Globe award.) The film does not attempt to hide how difficult and bizarre a person Kaufman was, but instead 'lets it all hang out', so that we can better understand Kaufman's unique comedy, which derived directly from his weird personality. Danny de Vito, who is always marvellous in all his films, does an excellent job of playing Kaufman's manager. Bud Friedman, of the New York comedy club The Improvisation (sometimes called the Improv), plays himself. It was he who 'discovered' Kaufman in 1975. I used to hang out at The Improvisation some years before that with Joan Rivers and Howard Storm in the old days. (Back then we did not call it the Improv, but used the full name.) They and Dick Cavett and Rodney Dangerfield and Maddy Kahn and all the gang were then regulars. Rodney once challenged me for writing down many of his jokes that he was trying out for the first time at the club, but Joan vouched for me and said I was not someone who wanted to steal his material but was doing it only to discuss and analyse them with her later, so all was well.) The puppet Howdy Doody plays himself in this film. (How Kaufman would have loved that!) The amazing evening at Carnegie Hall in 1979 is wonderfully recreated, complete with dancing Rockettes, after which he took the entire audience in 24 buses to have milk and cookies. It was so good to create a dramatic record of this unique person. Long may we all be different!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

In Holland we only had Taxi and most of the other things Andy Kaufman did we couldn't take notice of. But now in this retrospective all these things come together. Kaufman is portaited as a very sensitive person inside who created an outside of harshness. That is also the part that made me cry. Why was not he able to communicate a little better with himself, despite of all the effort he put in the transcendental meditation. Courtney Love is a surprise. She played a very good part. This movie is strongly recommendated.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I never thought Andy Kaufman was very funny...,"but I was very young then and didn't know any better.  In this movie, you see Jim Carrey actually become Andy Kaufman.  With the exception of Kaufman's true speaking voice, Carrey has him nailed.  I didn't think Carrey could do better than his portrayal of the Riddler in Batman Forever, but this performance was absolutely fantastic.  If you don't know Kaufman, just flip on Nickelodeon and catch a Taxi rerun before you see Man on the Moon. You'll think you're seeing the same guy.When I was watching this film, I saw recreations of things that I saw a long long time ago.  I remember seeing the bit Kaufman did when he came out on Saturday Night Live and lip-synched the theme to Mighty Mouse.  I remember seeing his wrestling antics.  I remember him getting smacked by Jerry Lawler.  What was really cool about this movie was that while there was some dramatic license taken in some places, many of the scenes were recreated exactly as they happened originally.  One thing that disappointed me though was that in almost all of the recreations the actual people were used where ever possible with one glaring exception.  When they recreated the night Kaufman guest starred on Fridays.  Norm MacDonald portrayed an actor that was actually Michael Richards of Seinfeld/Kramer fame.  I was disappointed that Richards didn't play himself there.  Jeff Conway who's been said to have punched Kaufman out appeared in the film, so why no Michael Richards??I didn't know much about the Tony Clifton stuff, but the first scene he appears in was hilarious and disturbing at the same time.  I won't spoil it, but it was genius.If you know anything about Andy Kaufman, you have to see this movie just so you can see Jim Carrey play him.  It's almost unbelievable.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A credit to Kaufmann's Genius,"The film Man on the Moon starring Jim Carrey is one of the best motion pictures I have ever seen. It is a credit to Jim Carrey as an actor and Andy Kaufmann as an artistic genius.This film is just what Andy would have wanted it to be. It is an emotional roller coaster that was the definition of what Mr Kaufmann's artistry (I don't want to say sense of humor) was all about. There were points in this movie where I laughed hysterically (particularly the ""closing"" credits) There were points where I was balling my eyes out and there were points where I was doing both simultaneously.Jim Carey does an awesome job, to the point where I thought he was Andy Kaufmann at times. The Academy over looked one of the best actors and films in 1999. Which makes me give more credit to the Golden Globes (who did reward Mr. Carrey)I have always understood Andy Kaufmann as a ""comedian"". However, even after this movie, I will never understand him as a man. The ending of this movie alone is pure Andy Kaufmann and will leave you as confused as ""The Usual Suspects"" Go out, rent this movie. If you enjoyed it as much as I did buy it. This is a great film for Andy Kaufmann fans, Jim Carrey fans alike. Even if you do not like Jim Carrey, you will in this film.

"If You ""Got"" Kaufman You'll ""Get"" This","Forman's second straight bio~pic works better than his last (""The People vs. Larry Flynt,"" which was good but more flawed).I followed Andy Kaufman's career from its meager beginnings (actually saw that Fridays episode live, as well as all of his SNL perormances, most of that woman~wrestling phase, the Lawler match & Letterman interview, etc.) thru the shock of stumbling across his surprise obit.Like many others, I thought that it too was yet another in a series of the serio~comic's brilliant geneology of gags.Of course we were wrong.But I always felt that I ""got"" his brand of humour, his ""winking at us"" eye. Then again, I'm among the few I know who also ""get"" Dennis Miller.

This is neither. I mean Carrey IS Kaufman.He's got the look (on and off-camera), the voice(s), the very essence of Andy... the non-comedian.Paul Giamatti finally gets a meatier role as Kaufman's partner/co-writer/co-experiencer Bob Zmuda and is fine. Courtney Love ~ a new Forman staple? ~ is good as the love interest. DeVito's a stabilizing factor as Andy's agent.And Forman pulls it all together with style, perception and above all, dignity.Couple of questions:Why bring the ""Taxi"" cast back together for this? So that we can see them 30 years later? Jeez, these guys & gals look AWFUL. Co-star DeVito's wife Rhea even avoided this project.And if Milos Forman could pull the ""Taxi"" folks in, why couldn't he talk Michael Richards (""Fridays,"" ""Seinfeld"" and his self-named TV show which appears to be headed for 6-week termination) into doing this? Norm MacDonald's terrific, but he's no Michael Richards.Kinda cool to see ""Newhart"" regular Peter Bonerz (Jerry, ""The dentist who was less funny than Bill Daly"") as Ed.

Andy Kaufman isn't interesting enough that you feel like spending an evening with him, not even in cinema. It would be good for a semi-documentary (IF - I want to see the real Kaufman, too!), but Forman decided to bring his life onto a big picture - with all the ingrediences you need to reach the masses, especially the pathetic stuff. Infortunately it doesn't work here. The film can't tell me where is the special significance and the importance of Kaufman. He provoked the TV-public with his artistic and humoristic extravaganzas, Forman says, and he is right, but he did it in an era, in which the public was already accustomed to nonsense in TV programs. In fact, Kaufman didn`t hurt existencial taboos of society, but just the feelings of some of its members. There was a documentary about the Sex Pistols on the Berlin Film Festival, where the anachronisms in society (monarchy and british hypocrisy vs. punk phenomenon) is shown much clearer.

Loved it ... but:,I loved the movie but was wondering if anyone else had the same reactions to certain areas. 1- Some of the extras in the many scenes involving audiences were overplaying their delight/outrage. 2- Though all the scenes featuring members of the Taxi cast were brief I still couldn't help but notice how much older they all are. This kind of made it harder to keep my disbelief suspended.  3- The public Andy Kauffman was never as inherently likable as Jim Carrey (I suppose Woody Harrelson was also more likable than Larry Flynt but I bet a sawbuck that Mozart was much better company than Tom Hulce).

"ANDY, WE HARDLY KNEW YA, THANK GOODNESS!","MAN ON THE MOON is a thoroughly unpleasant little movie about Andy Kaufman. Andy Kaufman was a gifted performance artist of the 1970s and 80s, with, unfortunately, the self-discipline of a mean-spirited seven year-old. Thoroughly unpleasant little movies generally are rewarded with small audiences and grosses, and this one, thankfully, is no exception.   Unfortunately for Universal, MAN ON THE MOON cost 100 million dollars, largely for the salary of star Jim Carrey, for whom this movie can only be called a ""vanity piece."" Carrey is in virtually EVERY scene; worse, no other actor is given a chance to ""break out"" and show any real emotional range.  Worse, Carrey ""imitates"" Kaufman's best bits, but never succeeds in submerging himself in the role. In any event, that may have been a futile task.  No one seems to have known whom ""Andy Kaufman"" really was.  To paraphrase Courtney Love's character, ""There is no 'real [Andy Kaufman].'""Some of what Kaufman did was funny, hilariously so (largely his TAXI work, which he disowned).  Most, unfortunately, was rude, condescending, self-indulgent, embarrassing, cruel and, worst, unfunny.  Too bad, this is the work that is largely on display in MAN ON THE MOON.  While we long for Latka Gravas and Vic Ferrari, we get Tony Clifton and the ""Intergender Wrestling Champion.""  The stars of TAXI are exploited; but what made THAT show great is entirely excluded.   Would it have been too much for ONE interchange between Latka (Carrey) and Simka (Carol Kane)?  All Kane gets to do is sit around looking embarrassed and slightly frightened at ""Tony Clifton's"" antics.  Kaufman may have thought TAXI (and his contribution to it) was junk; but, just because Kaufman was a great performance artist doesn't make him a good judge of his own work.MAN ON THE MOON is not a terrible movie.  It's just a terribly wrongheaded movie.  It's about as much fun as root canal work; as was, unfortunately, much of Andy Kaufman's ""humor.""

"On or off the stage, a character on the edge.","This is a witty and fond look at the unconventional career and life of comedian Andy Kaufman. From his beginnings as a struggling stand up comic; through his television success with 'Taxi' and 'Saturday Night Live'; his tongue-in-cheek wrestling stint; to his final days before losing his life to cancer; Kaufman crossed back and forth over the cutting edge.Jim Carrey did an excellent job in recreating Kaufman. Although I do believe that Kaufman did a much better Elvis than Carrey doing Kaufman doing Elvis. Carrey was remarkable duplicating Kaufman's mannerisms. Carrey fleshes out a touch of the comedian's humanity most people tend to overlook.The cast also features the multi-talents of Danny DeVito, Courtney Love, Paul Giamatti and Bob Zmuda.'Tenk you veddy much'.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Who knows what made Andy Kaufman tick?,"There has been much panning of this film because it does not delve into Kaufman's inner workings. The people who were the harshest most probably had not viewed ""I'm From Hollywood"" or ""A Comedy Salute To Andy Kaufman"" before watching ""Man On The Moon."" Andy was best known as the adorable Latka on Taxi, but his other characters were focused on much more. This film made many people uncomfortable because you're not supposed to laugh at some obnoxious person named Tony Clifton degrading and spilling beer on his audience. As I laughed aloud, almost through the entire picture, it was almost more funny to see the audience reacting to the few people laughing than the film itself. Most people unfamiliar with Andy Kaufman's deeds during his career have misguidedly labelled ""Man On The Moon"" as shallow, and although almost all critics have recognized Jim Carrey's performance as truly impressive and unique he is likely to get snubbed again in the 2000 Academy Awards. The truth is, probably no one knew or knows what made Kaufman tick, but who cares. His legacy survives as a comic pioneer not because of who he was, but what he did. ""Man On The Moon"" fell out of the top ten at the box office in mere weeks because of what it is, an inside joke for all Kaufman fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
For people who don't know Kaufman,"As I heard, the film Man on the Moon` tells Andy Kaufman's biography quite authentically. I didn't know the man before but he must have been really hard to handle. He provoked lots of ethic discussions, and the film corresponds to them. For people who haven't taken part in the excitements Kaufman caused at that time, the ethic questions appear during watching the film. Is it funny what Kaufman does? Does he intend anything special with it? How far can he go and when do we start feeling betrayed? Actually, Kaufman himself seems to have had more fun on stage than his audience.Man on the Moon` is not told like the biography of a man we already know. Maybe Kaufman fans will be bored because there are no surprises for them. But at the end and in the end Forman carries Kaufman's humour one step further and, by doing that, gives him an appropriate reference, I think: the way he directs Kaufman's death is as ambiguous as the way Kaufman would have done it: It outrages one part of the audiences and makes the other part smile sadistically.Well, I liked it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jim Carrey's best role...,"Well Ace Ventura and The Mask proved he can do over-the-top comedic roles, and The Truman Show proved he can do dramatic roles.  This movie proved he can do both quite well.  This was an excellent portrayal of Andy Kaufman, Jim Carrey is fully believable in this.  If the Academy actually paid any attention to comedies (well, this is more a drama, but being about a comedian, it does have its comedic moments) Jim Carrey likely would have received an Oscar for this.  He did get a Golden Globe at least, though.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Awesome movie, performance, portryal","This movie, as many others think, deserved ATLEAST a nomination if not an Academy Award. Many say that Carrey was the PERFECT Kaufman.  I think he was the best man for the mind-set of Kaufman, but to me it didn't really look like Kaufman, which is not a bad thing.  He portrayed him almost to a T.  For those of you who posted that this was just a mesh of scenes, yada yada....you don't know what you're talking about.  The people who made this film were Kaufman's close friends, girlfriend, and the list goes on.  They have said they felt like they were with Andy the whole 3 months of filming and thought the movie portrayed Andy Kaufman greatly.  THEY, not YOU, are the ones to really decide if the movie portrayed Andy well or not because they all actually knew Andy, and you didn't.  You saw the ""Bad Guy Wrestler"" on TV and the jerk who pulled pranks on people.  They knew him off the set.The movie is great and I highly recommend it...OH and if you have DVD, rent the DVD version.  It as a Making-Of on it, Kaufman Footage (a few I'd never seen before, performance stuff), and a lot of other cool Kaufman stuff!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Potentially Very Good Movie.,"The core idea is exceptionally good. Usually every AO's become Mr. Niceguy in the media. Here the opposite and rare thing happens, surprisingly it's a biography.

Brilliant reincarnation of Andy,"Granted, I went to this movie a little biased having grown up on Kaufman, Taxi, and Saturday morning 'rastlin, so I was expecting to enjoy it. Jim Careys' performance was brilliant, not only in the characters and voices he immitated, but in doing Andy's actual speaking voice also. Carey deserves an Oscar nomination, but the powers that be will probably view this as one stand-up imitating another, and not Oscar worthy.

"Jim Carrey CAN act, and I Loved it!","Let me first say that I am not a fan of Jim Carrey.  The first movie of his I saw was ""The Cable Guy"" and I swore I would never watch another.  Then I watched ""Liar, Liar"" and didn't think too much better.  Then came ""The Truman Show""; I was somewhat impressed.  However, I wasn't too thrilled about watching ""Man On The Moon"".  Given my feelings about Carrey and the little I knew about Andy Kaufman, this didn't seem like my kind of movie.Guess what.  Not only did I like ""Man On The Moon"", I loved it!Jim Carrey proves he can act, and he does it very well.  ""Man On The Moon"" was funny, sad, touching, and more.  Often at the same time.  Danny Divito was good and Courtney Love will probably win a Supporting Actress nomination.It is uncanny how Carrey was able to take this controversial comedian and make him human.  By the end of the movie you get a sense of knowing who Andy Kaufman was and why he did the things he did.  I was very young when Taxi was on, and had no real knowledge of Kaufman.  I can only imaging what this film will be like for those who actually followed his career.I don't know what else to say.  I loved this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a great movie we have here!,"I am a fan of Carrey's comedic artistry and all of the elements that he brings to the table. I have seen some of his cartoonish like comedic roles (Ace Ventura, The Mask, Dumb & Dumber, Liar Liar) which in their own right were the signs of things to come.  I saw the brilliant film, ""The Truman Show"", this film proved to the world that hiding beneath that Ace Ventura outfit, is indeed a talented & gifted actor that can do more than just comedy. I just recently had the chance to see his new film, ""Man On The Moon"". His performance was outstanding, only three times during the entire film did I say to myself, ""okay that's Jim up there"", the rest of the time I was totally involved in his portrayal of comedic genius Andy Kaufman. I must admit that I'm not familiar with alot of Kaufmans work, but I did get a sense of what he was like here, and now I want to learn more about him.Credit the film makers here, for creating a film that not only will satisfy the  huge Andy Kaufman fans of the world, but also bring in new ones who are now discovering the talents of Andy Kaufman. Also credit the cast of ""Man On The Moon"", all the performances are solid and powerful. Danny Devito's character was interesting and Courtney Love's performance was very nice. The film's cinematography was great, the directing and editing was great, the script was great, all the performances were great. If this film does not get some recognition by the members of the Academy Awards, then that would be disgraceful. It's a very powerful and moving film about Andy Kaufmans life, played out brilliantly by Jim Carrey.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carrey is Kaufman,"This film is uniquely entertaining and redefines the words hoax and optical illusion. Jim is so close to what I imagine Andy to be like, even that itself is an illusion. Yet somehow Andy Kaufman lives on in what can only be described in my opinion as Jim Carrey's stand out best performance. The song and dance man, anti humour improvisational comedic, doesn't tell jokes. He is more interested in making himself and his friend Bob laugh at their own genius than entertaining his audience or so it appears. Danny DeVito plays George his stage manager/agent and appears not entirely sure at first what to make of Andy Kaufmans act himself. He may be crazy with surreal gimmicks and untimely motions but George is willing to take the risk with his out of the world man on a moon act. With bizarre alter ego character Tony Clifton and controversial anti women should be in the kitchen act. From the Taxi sitcom to wrestling to appearing on David Letterman, Andy has everyone guessing what's next? Not even George is in the loop with who is in on each act. Andy created a world where the audience were always second guessing and he wanted to stay one step ahead. But when tragedy strikes not even Andys own family can take him seriously.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carrey makes this great film even better,"Rating: ***1/2 out of ****""Man on the Moon"" opened in Brazil two weeks ago, together with two other films: ""Down to You"" and ""Hanging Up"". It was released in the biggest number of screens, received the best reviews, but it seems that the audience didn't like it very much. Well, Andy Kaufman is almost unknown here (I confess I had never heard about him before reading about the film). Only the people who watch ""Taxi"" on Sony Entertainment Television may know him. But I'm sure that about 60% of the people who went to the movies to watch ""Man on the Moon"" left disappointed because they were expecting a slapstick comedy- the last thing it is. In the audience I attended to, there was a group of stupid teen girls (whose favorite film is probably ""She's All That"") who didn't seem to get the point of the amazing, hilarious beginning. At the end, I heard one of them complaining: 'This is the worst movie I've ever seen.' And another one said a kind of nonsense thing: 'This is even worse than ""Sleepy Hollow""!'  another great film, I have to say. So I got very angry and thought: 1- They don't know that this is a biography about a REAL person. 2- They've never heard about a genius named Milos Forman; ""Amadeus"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" mean nothing for them. 3- They were expecting ""Dumb and Dumber- Part 2"" or ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective- Part 3"". 4- I'm sure they also didn't like ""The Truman Show"". 5- They are futile, disposable people who should be ignored (I'm sure they would make annoying jokes about the frog rain in ""Magnolia"", like 'Duh! Senseless!').""Man on the Moon"" is another great creation of Milos Forman. He has been criticized for making an empty film, without telling details about Andy Kaufman's life, showing only his shows, his polemics. But that's how biographies should be. Who cares if Andy lost his puppy dog hit by a car when he was a child? Who cares if his parents used to fight? Who cares if he had problems at school? What is important in the life of a person, more specifically an artist, is how he/she became famous, how he/she faced it etc. And ""Man on the Moon"" shows it perfectly well. Milos Forman had already done masterpieces as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Amadeus"" (another unusual biography) and, in my opinion, ""Valmont"". ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" was also a different kind of biography and was almost perfect. That's what happens in ""Man on the Moon""- it is almost a masterpiece. As in Carrey's previous picture, ""The Truman Show"", there is a small, almost imperceptible thing missing. Here I guess it's the presence of Courtney Love's character in Kaufman's life. She could have been quite more significant here.But this small flaw can be left by the side in the middle of so many qualities: an amazing director, a great screenplay (with hilarious moments and some emotional ones) and, above everything, Jim Carrey. It was just prejudice, I think, his snub at the Oscar. This was the Oscar of snubs: ""Magnolia"", Paul Thomas Anderson, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", Stanley Kubrick, ""Being John Malkovich"", Cameron Diaz, Reese Witherspoon and there it goes. But the Academy should have forgotten Carrey's mistakes of the past (hey! Hilary Swank was in ""The Next Karate Kid""!). I guess it's the best performance of his career- by far. God! I don't know almost anything about Andy Kaufman, but Carrey resurrects him. Personification, whatever! HE IS ANDY KAUFMAN!""Man on the Moon"" is a must-see- specially if you like Forman's style of film-making. There are many memorable scenes: the beginning, the concert in Carnegie Hall, the funeral and the ambiguous ending- ambiguous in a good way. It's superbly directed, acted and written. Even if it can't be between Forman's masterpieces, it is something worthy of much recognition.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thank you Jim,"Wow! After the second time seeing ""Man on the Moon"" thats the first thing a viewer can think. Jim Carrey shines as Andy, in fact he IS Andy. After the first few moments of the film (and an opening that is pure Kaufman) Jim melts into the role, without ever stooping so low as to pull trade mark Carrey moves. The idea that the same man who used to talk out of his rear end is now very possibly going to be nonimated for an oscar is well... wow! The only flaw I could find after the second viewing is the movie requires some previous knowlage of Andy's life. We as viewers are never quite told how Andy became the man he is, or how he met writing partner Zemua.An incredible feat, the movie manages to remain fairly nutral. The viewer is given an insite into the mind of Andy, without given any concrete answers. Refreshingly enough, the movie isn't tied up neatly in the end. The viewer is instead given the luxary of drawing their own conclusions and beliefs, without being force fed any opions. In short... WOW~",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Unique experience while watching a very good movie.,"An excellent movie made even better by a bizarre situation.  On opening night I went with my son to see Man in the Moon because we have been Kaufman fans.  He was brilliant in Taxi and in many Saturday Night Live routines. We were aware of his disasters but enjoyed the fact that you couldn't tell if it was the act or just a bomb.  During the crucial scene when Kaufman announces that he has cancer, the film started rolling and finally white light shone at the screen.  After about 5 minutes people began wondering if the film break was real or just part of the movie.  People were screaming out ""I'll bet it is part of the film""  Others shouted ""No, the film is broken"".  After about 15 minutes people were offered free passes because indeed the film had broken.  (I wouldn't be surprised if a Kaufman fan had somehow sabotaged the projector).  Indeed, if the director had actually decided to end the film that way, it would have been brilliant -a 10 rating! Anyway, we have yet to see the last 15 minutes, but enjoyed the film. Kaufman would have been thrilled with the situation as we saw it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A wild, funny, eccentric, moronic, silly, good-natured look at Andy Kauffman","Only seeing Andy Kaufman on the old TV show Taxi, I never understood why people loved him so. He was funny, yes, but what was the big thing about him? After I saw this movie, however, I just had to look up more info him, and sure enough, the movie was very true to life! Andy's antics of playing a joke on the audience was very real, and yes he did wrestle woman, and yes he did manage to get a lot of people very upset. He was however a comedian that was way ahead of his time. Or perhaps Andy defies time.Jim Carrey plays Andy so well, it's scary. Using Danny Devito as his agent was a stroke of genius. Even Courtney Love is good as Andy's sweetheart. There are times that the movie isn't funny. But that's the point. Andy didn't consider himself a comedian. It shows how completely original he was,  how you should never expect the expected with him. Even if you never liked Andy, then see this film for Jim Carrey. And you if you don't like Jim Carrey (shame on you!) Then see it for the way ABC and it's execs get abused.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Excellent Film,"One of Jim Carrey's finest films.  Carrey eschews his Ace Ventura/Dumb & Dumber persona to fill the shoes of Andy Kaufman. Man On The Moon is the story of Kaufman from his days as a television star on Taxi to his career killing intergender wrestling champ.  Danny DeVito plays George Shapiro, Kaufman's manager who finds himself defending Andy constantly. Paul Giamatti plays Kaufman's best friend Bob Zmuda and Courtney Love plays Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Marguilles.  The film is fairly accurate in depicting Kaufman's life from his days doing standup where he introduced us to Foreign Man who later became Latka Gravas to his Carnegie Hall show to his death.

"Carrey Delivers, But the Script Doesn't, in This Soft Clip Show Reenactment","Andy Kaufman, the enigmatic, often inexplicable comic mastermind, gets a glossy Hollywood biopic, complete with a high visibility big-name plunge in the headline role. Man on the Moon gets the optics right, documenting the star's most memorable gags amongst the din of a cigarette-stained 1970s comedy club (or network studio), and an inspired Jim Carrey clearly spent a lot of time and effort refining Kaufman's childish charms and odd contradictions. The connecting biographical bits are lackluster at best, though, and the film's determination to force-feed its own reality-bending meta mechanisms is more trouble than it's worth.At least the performances are good. Carrey really threw himself into this role, ruffling feathers with his dedication to method acting, and the results are worthwhile. Costars Paul Giamatti and Danny DeVito (who also produced) shoulder their share of the load as caring lifelong co-conspirators; a pair of sharp guys who alternate between blithely pressing buttons alongside the mad genius and being involuntarily pulled in his wake. There's genuine sweetness in Carrey's on-screen pairing with Courtney Love, who plays a composite of several Kaufman girlfriends. That's a range I didn't realize she had, a tricky mix of her usual no-frills, street-smart b**ch and the compassionate soulmate who visibly understands, appreciates and accepts the troubled star in his troubled later life. Director Milos Forman worked with Love three years earlier, in The People vs. Larry Flynt, and must've seen something in her that the rest of us didn't.On that note, I was shocked to learn this was directed by the same man who brought us Amadeus and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I guess it had been fifteen years since those films and his career was now well into its final act, but still, Man on the Moon feels awfully soft; an incomplete drama at best. For a story with so much real, unique flavor, it's also dreadfully bland, with a far heavier focus on replicating its subject's big career moments than understanding his own odd personality. Carrey's rendition of Kaufman is noteworthy, and Andy's bizarre comedy portfolio is always worth revisiting, but the film adds nothing to those beats and the original material is better enjoyed on its own.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A good turn by Carrey, but...","Watching Jim Carrey's 'Man on the Moon', I got a feeling that to entirely like the movie and feel for the character, you had to have been a fan of Andy Kaufmannn, the stand up comedian on who the biopic was based. As such, I did not know anything about him, and I left the movie with a strange feeling of detachment with the movie and the character it portrays. Unfortunately, it does not do a good job of endearing a newcomer to Kaufmann as an individual. This would have been fine, if we could identify to Kaufmann as an entertainer. Again, unfortunately here, Kaufmann's antics hardly seemed appealing to everyone. I, for one, did not find his stage performances depicted in the movie to be too funny. Neither did I think the World Wrestling antics with women and Jerry 'the King' Lawler (who makes an extended cameo in the movie) hilarious.The movie started off on a disjointed note, with a scene of Andy performing in front of the wall in his room, believing that there is a crowd applauding him, before his dad puts an end to it. Then we see a grown up Andy (Carrey) performing in a rundown bar, and the patrons leaving halfway through the show. He is told by the manager at the end of the show that he has to let him go, as his act is just not funny enough. This is where I felt it dropped off for me. After this, Andy's rise as a stand up seemed to happen quick, and I did not see enough background of how and why it happened after the initial setbacks. However, a poignant thing about the film was how Kaufmann seemed to pull so many stunts that no one believed him, even when he mentions that he does actually have a serious condition.Of the acting, Jim Carrey once again proves he is definitely not a comic wonder, and can do dramatic roles if given more opportunities. Danny DeVito as his manager and Paul Giamatti as his friend/sidekick do great supporting turns as well. Jerry Lawler also puts in an entertaining turn. Ultimately, I guess it depends on what you would consider as funny.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Was Surprised At How Poor This Biopic Was,I'm a fan of Jim Carey and I think he did a great job of portraying Andy Kaufman but the script or storyline was really lame. The skits were awkwardly unfunny and frankly annoying. The Tony Clifton scenes were painful to watch. I really can't believe how they could make a funny guy look unfunny and unwatchable. Not sure what the high reviews were about here. Must have given the film points for sentimentality reasons. There's really not much character development. Just obnoxious reenactments of bad skits. I could even finish it. Terrible waste of time. Watch Taxi reruns instead of this mess of a movie.,3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great movie,"Before I say anything about the movie I want to state I liked it very much. I have a couple of minor complaints but over all it was a great film. First, Jim Carey had better get nominated for his performance. He was brilliant. He captured Andy and it was almost like watching Andy on screen. I defy anyone blindfolded to tell the difference between Andy's foreign man and Jim's. The academy snubbed him for The Truman Show so anything is possible. They may have a hard time getting over the Ace Ventura movies. (Which are very funny) All I can say about that is Jack Nicholson was in the original Little Shop of Horrors, and Tom Hanks starred in Bachelor Party. I have been a fan of Paul Giamanti for a while and he had Zmuda down. This guy has replaced the late J.T. Walsh as my favorite character actor. I felt Danny De Vito came across very well. You could feel how much George Shapiro loved Andy and fought for him. Not many agents would have been able to withstand the Kaufman antics. The beginning of the movie was pure Kaufman. Jim had me right there. Now for my complaints. I know it is a 2-hour movie and you only have a certain amount of time to tell the story. The facts and timeline of this film are all off. Andy did not meet Lynne until 1983. He filmed his Carnegie Hall show in 1979. He meet Lynne on the film My Breakfast with Blassie. None of the Taxi stars attended Andy's funeral. It really glossed over Andy's rise to stardom in his early years. But, I can forgive these things as simply minor and only a Kaufman freak like myself would even care. Milos Forman does a great job making the audience see Andy and appreciate him. He was the master prankster and was willing to do anything for the sake of entertainment. Whether it was his own or the audiences. Sometimes the audience did not get him, and now I hope that we can appreciate where Andy was coming from. At the end of that movie I had even more respect for Andy, which is no small task considering I considered him a genius even before I plunked down my $7.50. Andy was indeed a genius, and as most he was misunderstood when he was alive. Like, Van Gough, one can only hope that he will finally get the recognition he so richly deserves",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Of the worst movies I've ever seen, horrible acting, story, unlikeable characters and poor ending","I really dislike this film. At Carreys career peak, he threw himself into this ""passion project"" for one of his heroes and was a committed method actor, acting like a twat on camera and off camera - in others both a selfish sociopath and a bad actor (acting should be able to turn on and off the character on a dime). Carrey also overacts trying to catch his mannerisms and ticks, you never feel its anyone but Carrey trying to act.I dont like the main character Andy Kaufman, although he was a true troll and he definitely did some funny things. But it was mostly purposeless except amusing himself and getting attention at the expense of others.

"An okay biopic, though Carrey is fantastic...","Milo Forman is a legendary filmmaker, he's made the best of films during his heyday. I've always been a fan of his, always loved his work. 'Man Of The Moon' however, ranks amongst his okay efforts. A biographical film about the late American entertainer Andy Kaufman, comes a biopic, that doesn't really entertain.Kaufman was an amazing entertainer, who got in Tony Clifton & Latka Gravas, both of which are legendary today. 'Man On The Moon' brings the biopic to life, but, it could've been better. The film beings with a bang, but slides as soon Kaufman becomes a flop star. Some biopics are worth-watching again and again and again, but 'Man On The Moon', despite being an honest effort, isn't one of those gems.Carrey is the highlight of the film, playing Kaufman from top to bottom. He's fantastic in every dialog he delivers, A Golden Globe isn't all, he at least deserved to earn a Nomination at the Academy Awards. Courtney Love is excellent. She's always been an actress to watch! DeVito is his usual self, which is passable. Paul Giamatti is good, while Jerry Lawler hams.On the whole, 'Man On The Moon' isn't the best biopic in any angle, but it surely deserves a watch for Carrey's fantastic performance.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good performance,"Good performance from Carrey although I truthfully only saw Jim. How these critics saw him as Kaufman belies my imagination.I truthfully was hesitant to see this movie due to the fact Jim Carrey was in it, knowing I've never seen him in a serious role. I didn't think he could honestly pull it off. But he did a great job, it's just he didn't at all remind me of Andy.Also, I don't think they should have made a bio film of this. Too many great comedians would have made far more compelling stories - think Abbott and Costello and their triumph over Hollywood in the 40s, etc.This movie was truly a feel good movie (where the good guy wins). It is for anyone who wants to be entertained slightly.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
blurry lines between reality and fiction,"Wow. I don't think I could top the front-page review if I wanted to.I found the movie entertaining, and definitely worth watching, although I had a bit of a problem with the way Milos Forman handled the re-enactment of scenes from Andy's career. For example, most of the cast of Taxi played themselves, creating a very disjointed effect since most of them look significantly older than they did in the early 1980s when the real show aired. (Okay, so Marilu Henner doesn't appear to have aged a day, but still.)And the character of Louis De Palma is left out of the ""Taxi"" scenes entirely because Danny DeVito is already in the movie playing Andy's agent George Shapiro. Ummmm, problem.David Letterman also looks significantly older than he did in 1982 when Andy and Jerry Lawler appeared on Late Night, creating the same ""suspension of disbelief"" problem as the Taxi scenes.Then we see the infamous Fridays sketch, which instead of being reprised by the original participants as most of the other recreated scenes are, is actually performed by comedic actors (Norm MacDonald, Caroline Rhea) who are famous enough in their own right that a viewer unfamiliar with the Andy Kaufman story could be led to believe that they were really involved in the original incident.So you end up with Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman at more or less the correct age, playing against a lot of people who look the wrong age for the time because they're playing themselves, one person who should be playing himself actually playing somebody else, and two people who are playing other people but are recognizable enough on their own that it interferes with the veracity of the scene.I really believe Milos Forman should have stuck to one of two approaches: either *all* the original participants in the recreated scenes should have played themselves, or *all* of them should have been played by other actors. Mixing the two actually detracts from the movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
Carey proves his worth in this superb dark comedy.,"Man On The Moon, produced by Danny Devito and directed by One flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest director, Milos Forman,  deals with the tragic story of Andy Kaufman who's comedy was so real, his close friends couldn't even tell when he was joking. His entire life was a song and dance act and such comedy came to be expected of him. It is how the film and Carey portray Kaufman and Hollywood that is so interesting and highlights a part of American life. In a media obsessed culture, Hollywood films are known to follow a general format. They have a clear beginning where the viewer's attention is usually grabbed dramatically, a clear middle section follows and the film ends with a climax and closure. It was people like Andy Kaufman who exposed this well known method of entertainment, mocked it and generated a great deal of laughter in the process. The film itself manages to stay away from the usual format, partly by the subject nature and Kaufman's erratic behaviour but also by Carey's incredible and realistic performance as the comedian and Forman's unnoticeable and fluid direction. It seems the story almost tells itself. The reality of the film is further strengthened by the appearance of most of the original cast of the sitcom, Taxi, of which Kaufman received great reviews for his part as the almost incoherent yet enigmatic, Latka Gravas. The wrestler Jerry Lawler is also included in the cast as yet another of Kaufman's victims of comedy. The comedian wrestled women wrestlers for a time before challenging Lawler to several matches.  He very cleverly worked Lawler into a rage in front of a live audience on the Late Show with David Letterman and then proceeded to shout obscenities that fitted perfectly with the situation. Had it been anyone else, such as the not so enigmatic Madonna, it would have just appeared childish and rude. The irony of such acts was that Kaufman and Lawler were friends behind the camera, but Kaufman lived out such lies so convincingly on stage and screen. The beauty of the film is that it feels like watching the real Kaufman and his gift for comedy is not lost on Carey who scores another credibilty credit, following his other noteable dark comedy, The Truman Show.  The film also highlights how human nature mocks what it does not understand as Kaufman was thrown off the Saturday Night Live Show and cancelled by many theatres. In capturing the comedian's talent and worth with an excellent supporting cast, Man On The Moon offers an engaging tribute to a still, very under rated comedy figure.",,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing,"Thus far this is by far the best film that Jim Carrey has been in. All my friends hate this film, because they just don't understand the life of Andy Kaufman... Ha ha ha one said... ""The film was way to unrealistic"" Hmmmmm.... They didn't understand the concept that Andy was real... They also couldn't realize why DeVito was in it but not in the TAXI segments... Yeah I don't talk to that crowd much anymore!The cast portray characters with much sensitivity and respect for the memory of Andy Kaufman a man who spent his career annoying America and tricking America no one believed him when he needed them the most.

"Interesting, but not that entertaining","Deciding whether or not to see this movie is relatively simple. If:1) You are a big Andy Kaufman fan, or 2) You've heard about this Kaufman guy and want to know more about him, or 3) Want to see an excellent performance by Jim Carrey,see it.If  you're just looking for an entertaining movie, skip it.It's not really a funny movie.  It's more of a serious movie about a really strange guy's life. The basic point of the movie was that Kaufman's career was really geared towards making himself laugh rather than his audience. For most people, Latka, Mighty Mouse, and the Jerry Lawler bits were funny, but beyond that, most of Kaufman's stuff was just funny to him.  I found it interesting to see the whole story because I grew up during the Kaufman era and vaguely remember much of the stuff in the movie.Interesting from a biographical perspective, but not that entertaining.",,Anonymous,Biography

Majorly depressing,"I guess the real difference between a lunatic and a genius is that the genius gets applauded and the lunatic gets committed.I came away from this flic feeling sorry for Kaufman, but not because he was a misunderstood genius. If he was anything like the person portrayed by Carrey (and other readers assure us he was) there was something profoundly wrong with the man, but because people found his problems entertaining, they preferred to watch him self-destruct.I guess we could get into a debate about the reality of mental illness. We could debate Kaufman's sanity.

As a life-long Kaufman fan I was thrilled with the movie and Carrey's performance. This time around, he deserves best actor.

Pulls Its Punches,"Jim Carry turns in an excellent performance in this film but is let down, as he was in Truman Show, by a director and writers who don't have the courage to go all the way.  While some tout Kaufman's originality this film had the vitality of a Wolfgang Puck tv dinner...yes, we know it's supposed to be gourmet food, so why does it go down like warmed-over meatloaf?Kaufman, let's face it, was an unhappy guy who used his comedy to work through some deep mental problems and never quite succeeded.  Was he a genius who died at the height of his powers?  No, by this time he was a has been.  Of course it would have been difficult for writers and directors to write close to the bone with the knowledge that those who loved and cared for him would be watching (indeed were part of the production), but how could Foreman, etc., not delve into the self-hatred and contempt for audience which was clearly a part of Kaufman's act?  I say that with respect for the dear departed, I was a fan, but I wasn't fooled, surely we're more sophisticated about these sorts of things.Watching this film reminded me of the feeling I got during the last few minutes of Truman Show, the directors and writers were opting to cut and run just when the story got good, when Truman was about to face the rest of the world, when the story might have a chance to say something original, nope, that was too risky.  Only in Man On the Moon such feelings lasted for two hours of movie.  Not brave, not a classic, this film will be forgotten quickly.",,Anonymous,Biography
CONGRATULATIONS JIM CARREY,"Even though the movie overall, wasn't as good as I thought it would be, Jim Carrey's portrayal brought tear's to my eyes, he really put effort into this project and again his performance should have won him an Oscar, but the movie in general just doesn't work. Carrey basically became Kaufman in the movie and his interception of the character and all his craziness was fantastic to watch. He really brought us along for the journey into in my opinion Kaufman's mental and physical demise. It was a real meaty role, but the script get's tired and ""commercial"", and Courteney Love is brought in even though all she really does is stand and smile and watch him deteriorate. She fulfilled my full expectations, she does little or nothing for this movie. She was brilliant in ""Larry Flynt"" though. Yes, rent it for Carrey alone, he brings poor old Kaufman to life once more.Andy Kaufman R.I.P",,Anonymous,Biography
My thoughts,"One excellent film that has been criminally overlooked by pretty much everyone. Ask someone in the street if they have have seen man on the moon and they will either mumble something about Neil Armstrong or say they've heard the song (which does appear at the end of the film). The Golden Globes recognised this film as great and awarded it as such. (always an indicator of a genuinely good film, unlike the Oscars...)If you think Jim Carrey is just about funny faces and toilet humour, you must see this film, and you will see he can play *slightly* more serious & complex roles too, though the film is still funny, there are less fart jokes than, say, Dumb & Dumber.I've got to get off the net now, so the bottom line is THIS FILM IS GREAT.:)",,Anonymous,Biography
Movie is very encompassing!,"I don't have much to add that hasn't been stated already. Jim Carrey, Milos Forman, and the rest of the cast did an amazing job with this film. I have never been so ""into"" a movie. During the movie, when they first showed Lynne (played by Courtney Love), I was so into the movie that I didn't realize that it was Courtney Love. I remember thinking that she resembled Love, but then thinking that Love wasn't old enough back then. Later I realized that this is a new *movie* and that it was Courtney Love!!This was a wonderful movie, and I strongly recommend it to Kaufman fans or even if you've never heard of him. Personally, I didn't really know who he was, but I had heard of him. After seeing the movie, I am intrigued by this revolutionary man. If you don't know who Andy Kaufman is, you definitely need to find out... and seeing this movie is a great way to get an overview of his life.",,Anonymous,Biography
An unsatisfying biopic,"As a die-hard fan of Andy Kaufman, I am upset to be so disappointed with his long-awaited film biography.  While _Man on the Moon_ is a well-made film, it presents a portrait of the comedian that simply does not ring true.  I understand that Kaufman was a complex individual whose life cannot be summed up in a satisfying package.  But this movie leaves out the one important aspect of Kaufman's multiple personalities that made him bearable and entertaining: his innate sweetness.Jim Carrey does a good job of aping Kaufman's mannerisms, and he does manage to create a three-dimensional, interesting character.  However, his performance is too brutish, too physically intimidating, to really capture what made Kaufman appealing.  Carrey's Kaufman is a complete pain and everyone around him knows it.  The film makes no attempt to explain why George Shapiro promoted the renegade comedian so relentlessly; why Bob Zmuda put up with his bullying; why his parents and his girlfriend weathered the cruelty of his gags; why the entire cast of ""Taxi"" admired him despite his prima donna status and his self-centered shenanigans; or why anyone would make a movie honoring such a mean-spirited individual.Whether or not Kaufman was ""nice"" is a subject for endless debate.  In interviews concerning Kaufman, his onetime colleagues almost unanimously discuss his good-natured sweetness, his generosity, and his boundless creativity.  It seems incongruous that the selfish star Carrey portrays would inspire such adulation.At the same time, the movie soft-pedals Kaufman's more irritating moments as well.  When he reads the entire _Great Gatsby_ to his audience, Forman underscores the scene with an orchestral adaptation of the movie's theme song, as if to say ""What a misunderstood genius!,"" giving the scene an elegiac quality that is completely misplaced.  Even when Kaufman's acts fail, we are made to feel that audiences were wrong to walk out on him.As a result, the movie is tremendously unsatisfying.  We are left with no idea why anyone would ever find Kaufman appealing.  As a Kaufman fan, I could at last admire the last moments of the picture for their touching portrayal of Kaufman's battle with cancer.  But I am dismayed to think that for many audience members Carrey's portrayal will be the closest they come to experiencing Andy Kaufman's comic talents.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Well done, but won't answer many questions.","I can barely remember Taxi back when it was on television, as my tastes were much younger back in its day.  Also, I never saw anything Andy Kaufman did besides Taxi back when he was still alive.  I did see a Comedy Central special about the enigmatic comic which is really what sparked my interest in Man On the Moon.  The movie is very well done.  It seems to move a bit fast, compressing Andy's rise to fame seemingly into just a few scenes, but that was okay, since I was guessing the director wanted to focus more on Andy's later life and career.  Jim Carrey does an incredibly convincing job of portraying Andy, seeming to get all of his mannerisms and characters pretty much spot on.  The supporting cast is largely made up of people who really did work with Andy, and everyone does a good job.  Even Courtney Love, though admittedly Andy's relationship with his wife wasn't deeply explored.  And that was one of my main complaints with the movie.  It was largely very good re-creations of Andy's bits done on camera, and not enough of the man being himself away from the camera.  This may have been due to the fact that his mode of expression actually left even people close to him wondering what he really was like. So much so that not a lot of material on the man himself was readily available.  And that's a shame.  I can see where his material was easily crass and offensive on one hand,  while being profound on another level.  Was he just wrestling women, or waving a prevailing undercurrent of unspoken attitudes about what women were fit for in society's face?  By making stereotypical remarks about Southerners, was he disparaging them, or trying to make people think about how ridiculous stereotypes can be by forcing them to defend themselves against them?  True, he may have been a very simply motivated man who just liked to draw raw emotion from people and play pranks,  but I would have dearly liked to see some more of what made the man tick, and the movie doesn't deliver much of that.  The ending scenes are quite poignant and touching, and he is obviously loved by many around him,  but the character of the man himself isn't fleshed out quite enough to show why he was able to endear people to him so.  The film focuses just a little on his spiritual beliefs,  but once again gives facts and little else. Man On the Moon is entertaining to watch if you're curious about Andy Kaufman's life, certainly.  And Andy's comedy is perfectly recreated so you'll find it funny at least to the extent you can enjoy what he did.  Just don't expect to get many answers about his deeper motivations for his choice of comedic styling.",,Anonymous,Biography
I think Andy would have liked it,"I saw this film having no idea what to expect having found it while channel hopping. I watched and was amazed at how Jim Carrey captured the essence of the Andy Kaufman I remember from Taxi and a few other snippets we got to see of him here. Yes, he is an unsympathetic character on the surface, but Jim also managed to show the occasional hint of the torture that Andy must have suffered. I was then further surprised by the sheer amount of duplicity that Andy used in his life. Yes, no doubt a comic genius, but one with a serious personality disorder. But show me a comic genius that hasn't. I think he would have loved to see how this film divides opinions. It was this he lived for: Making people wonder (not in awe, but as in 'I wonder what that was all about...') and it's good to see that long after his death people are still wondering. All in all a great film, but not if you're looking for easy laughs. A solid 9 out of 10 for me.",,Anonymous,Biography

Jim Carry *is* Andy Kaufman,"It seems that one's impression of this film is going to be largely dependent on one's impression of Andy Kaufman.  I hesitate to call myself a fan of his.. I don't know that you can truly be a ""fan"" of Kaufman's.  He didn't want ""fans"" and in fact, often tried to create the exact opposite- enemies. I do appreciate his work and what he was trying to do though, so I went into this movie hoping to get a glimpse of the mind behind the man.Jim Carrey is absolute brilliant as Kaufman, encompassing the late performer so completely that often it was hard to believe I *wasn't* looking at Andy himself.  He recreates some of the best and most famous of Kaufman's performances and if you loved or hated them originally, you will feel the same here.However, after the recreations of what I already knew, I was hoping to see what led Andy to perform the way he did.  What motivated him?  Why was he so dead set against ever letting the audience in on the joke (his one-upping the executive after the ""Fridays"" staged argument)  These questions the film doesn't answer.  Perhaps this is in keeping true to Andy's enigmatic persona but in a bio-pic I expect these kinds of revelations more than just finding out the truth about him & Jerry Lawler.Speaking of the wrestling.  Way too much of this too-short film is dedicated to Andy's ""wrestling"" career.  Now, in all fairness, too much of Andy's life was dedicated to his wrestling career as well, but that doesn't mean the filmmakers have to make the same mistake.Here's to hoping there is a 3 1/2 director's cut lying around somewhere that gives more background on this fascinating performer.",,Anonymous,Biography

Strong support from the likes of Danny de Vito also added to the film. My only disappointment was Courtney Love, but then I just don't like her anyway! I suppose you can't have everything.

I don't have as much to say about the movie as I do about Jim Carrey's performance.  Although I know it went along with the movie's theme practically, but I don't know if I like the very end in the night club.  But I guess it did show how he will be remembered, but could also confuse people about his death. Jim Carrey's performance was AWSOME.  I heard Ed Norton was also a choice to play Andy.  I don't know if that could have been better.  I agree on Jim receiving the Golden Globe.  But would like to ask the ""Academy"" what Jim has to do to get nominated.  This performance was extremely hard.  It is hard becoming a complex character,in which Andy's was way beyond that.  For Jim's performance as Kaufman, out of a 10 (10 being a reproduction of Andy) I would give Carrey a 8 1/2 or 9.  And even with a 6 grade, he should have got nominated.  I mean, COME ON.

"A Celebration, Not An Explanation, of Andy's Life","The major complaint from critics so far on Man On The Moon is that it doesn't really attempt to explain Andy Kauffman.  But looking at director Milos Forman's previous masterpieces One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984), it is apparent that the filmmaker isn't so much concerned by the psychological make-up of his characters as he is in celebrating their individual freedom.  Andy is treated in the same vein as R.P MacMurphy and Mozart, a unique and charismatic individual who tries to break through the conventions and rules set before him.  Forman uses him as a symbol of individuality constantly fighting the accepted rules of stand-up comedy (just as Mac fought the rules of Nurse Ratched and Mozart's own flakiness set off Salieri).Jim Carrey, of course, gives us a dead-on impression of Kauffman.  But Carrey's Kauffman is distant from the audience through most of the film (if Andy could be explained in full, no one would take the time to make a movie about him).  We mostly view Andy through the eyes of George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), Andy's long-time manager.  He is as perplexed as the audience by Andy's behavior, but he also realizes the ""genius"" at work (the sort of cycle Forman expects the audience to experience).Man On The Moon, like most of Forman's films, is both highly entertaining (especially Jerry Lawler's performance as himself and the bits involving Tony Clifton) and moving (the final sequence).  It doesn't reach the plateau set by Cuckoo's Nest, but it is still one of the best five films of 1999.",,Anonymous,Biography

A compelling performance about a man who was not compelling at all.,"Jim Carrey again demonstrated that he is more than just a slapstick comedian with a rubber face who does outlandish things.

Andy Kaufman was a no-talent hack who became famous because he was willing to make an ass of himself. There is a group of people out there (let's call them Andy's fans) that think they know something that no one else does.  They can see past the ""facade"" to the real genius of Kaufman.  Well, perhaps that is the funniest joke that Kaufman ever pulled off.  There's no facade, the guy was a goof. Unfortunately, Kaufman's death is portrayed as the passing of a great American comic genius.  This is far from the truth.  His death actually is the only thing that prevented Kaufman from inflicting his unfunny brand of humor on a ""wise-to-it"" public. Jim's performance was great and the movie was very interesting.  It will give enough to Andy's fans to make them think they were right, but it actually demonstrates his extreme failings as a performer and a person.",,Anonymous,Biography
What are you people talking about?,"""The announcement came as Carrey's latest film, Man on the Moon (1999), seemed certain to become the comic actor's biggest failure."" - January 17th, 2000 IMDB NEWS BRIEF.I fail to understand what that news story meant... Jim Carrey gave an Oscar worthy performance as Andy Kaufman...  I know the film is not at #1 right now, I don't know if it ever got to that point, but I don't see it as a failure.Originally I wasn't going to make a comment on this film because the comment on the main page sums it up well.  I just don't understand the statement.",,Anonymous,Biography
It grew on me,"I never really watched taxi and if no one had made this film I probably would never heard of Andy Kaufman, apart from the line in the REM song. At first I found him irritating, but as the story went on and his stunts became more bizarre, I realised he wasn't your stereotypical comedian looking for acceptance but a performing artist who wanted to provoke a reaction, not just laughter, although he certainly amused himself and his cohorts.Perhaps it's a good thing he died young as I can't see him ever making it as a big hollywood star and he might have faded into obscurity, but you never know, he might have been as big as Robin Williams or Bill Murray - I doubt it though.The film is an interesting biopic of an artist, but no more. Jim Carrey makes the film and I particularly liked the ending. Worth seeing",,Anonymous,Biography
a likeable film if you like comedies,"This film portrays the rise to fame of a US comedian Andy Kauffman. Kauffman is played by Jim Carey and delivers some of the best acting I have seen and he most certainly carries this film forward. Although Kauffman is portrayed as a man of little patience and plenty of eccentricity it is not so obvious whether this is due to his complex personality or his simple desire to make it big in show business. There are many occasions where he uses his charm and wit to fool the audience with many on stage pranks. These 'pranks' continue to intrigue him and becomes central to all his shows including the highly publicized wrestling scenes . When Kauffman is reported to be ill, no one believes him and we are left wandering through to the end whether it is real or just another hoax. There were some nice moments in the movie like the trip he makes to Philippines to be cured of his illness but only to find that the treatment is just another scam. Towards the end of the movie the film loses all sense of reality as Kauffman is shown to be deceased but soon after is shown to be performing one of his caricature acts (Tony Clifton) or so we are led to believe. A nice film to watch if you like comedies.",,Anonymous,Biography
Jim Carrey Has True Heart & Soul,"Jim Carrey has brought Andy Kaufman back, and showed him as an uncompromising artist and sweet man/child, which he was.  The key scene for me was when he challenged the ABC executives, endeavoring to have an intentional technical ""glitch"" occur during his infamous special.  Not getting the joke, they took the bait... allowing themselves to act just as Andy wanted them to, trying to fix the TV.  Anytime you attempt something ""different,"" you face opposition... and Andy comically went against not just the grain, but the entire history of agriculture.  He was in a wrestling match for creativity and originality.  ""Man On The Moon"" existing as a major motion picture starring the world's top cinema comedian, directed by an Academy Award winner, most likely proves that Andy won the fight.",,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointment,"I was disappointed.  I was expecting more.After months of build-up to this film I had such high expectations going in that I came out a little let down.  I was expecting a masterpiece worthy of Academy Awards and all the rest.  Unfortunately, all I found was an everyday movie.Don't get me wrong.  It was a fine film and was worth the time and money. I just didn't see it as the superb piece of art I was expecting.During the course of this movie we grew to loathe our protagonist.  I hated him more every second that the movie continued.  Then for the final ten minutes of the film they attempt to turn the premise of the movie around and make us feel pity.  I just couldn't.It was interesting, and fascinating having the knowledge that it was true to life and I would recommend it to anyone.  Just be warned not to set your expectations too high.",,Anonymous,Biography
First of all....I loved it.,"First of all....I loved it. Jim Carrey is the spitting image of Andy Kaufman. Now with regards to wanting to see the movie this can be good, but it can also be a negative for the film. For there are some people who disliked Andy Kaufman so much that they could never bring themselves to watch a movie about him, let alone one that has an actor who truly brings him back to life. On the other hand, watching a film in which an actor such as Jim Carrey portrays a man as complicated as Kaufman so perfectly is worth seeing just for the great acting. Andy Kaufman is a comedian who did so many things to the audience that made him both endearing and hated. He was so enjoyable to watch on ""Taxi"" and yet so offensive to watch on TV talk shows when he became a woman's worst enemy. This film is the brainchild of Danny Devito, who not only worked alongside Andy Kaufman on ""Taxi"" but also stars in this film. I give two recommendations: 1) if you liked Andy Kaufman (even the slightest) you should see this film for Jim Carrey is excellent; and 2) if you disliked Andy Kaufman, you should see this film because it will open your eyes to the complexity yet simplicity of the man. ""Man on the Moon"" brings some deeper understanding and appreciation for Kaufman as an actor/artist/comedian. It seems that this season has brought forth a great deal of true stories to the big screen and I think that's cool. Anytime we can gain a greater appreciation of someone or something through movies, I am all for it, for it also brings back some great memories, rewrites an injustice, or it may just entertain us. Bottom line...while Andy Kaufman is someone who died at an early age and may have been completely forgotten in a few more years, this film will keep the inevitable from happening for at least a bit longer.",,Anonymous,Biography
Andy - not the audience - gets the last laugh,"Andy Kaufman was not the most radical or subversive comic that lived, neither as dangerous as Bill Hicks, as trailblazing as Peter Cook, nor as taboo-challenging as Lenny Bruce. When he died, the public had long forgotten him, having given up on his enigmatic, annoying brand of performance art. The very thing that made him doomed made him brilliant. He annoyed the world to entertain himself, he didn't care whether he was loved or hated. MAN ON THE MOON is faithful to Kaufman's ideology. That is, it is annoying and trying, but ultimately rewarding.Milos Forman's portrait is that of a genuine anarchist - Kaufman makes reference to admiring the sneering arrogance of punk rock - but beyond that, is curiously alienating. While Carrey delivers his best performance yet - you completely forget who is playing Andy -  his character is distant. When MAN ON THE MOON runs out of gas at the end, it is because, much as we admire him, the exhausted audience finds it hard to care too deeply about what happens next.A film has to get points for caring enough to alienate its audience, and it's the ultimate tribute to Andy. Certainly, the best way to watch this film is as a series of escalating practical jokes. The narrative, and supporting characters are neglected, and we never get an insight into what makes this fascinating, complex individual tick. But, if you sit back and watch Andy turn his tricks on the world, and turn the audience into the punchline, you will laugh yourself silly.In the end, it's not a classic to rank alongside Forman's AMADEUS, CUCKOOS NEST, and LARRY FLYNT. But you get the impression Andy would approve, which makes it an incredibly brave biography.",,Anonymous,Biography
People paid money for this?,"I had no idea who Andy Kaufman was before this film was made and I always just assumed from what everyone on TV said about him he was funny. Until I saw this. I don't know if it's a good or bad thing to have stayed and waited through that pitch black nothingness at the beginning of the film. I don't know why those college students even laughed at his taxi impression. I don't see what's so funny about wrestling with women. I don't see what's so funny about going on Lettermen and staging a punch just to get a reaction. I don't understand Andy Kaufman, so sue me. I didn't think this was funny at all or anything he ever did. Who cares about his antics and tricks, none of it was funny or entertaining. What is funny is anything idiotic from South Park and Beavis and Butt-Head to anything brilliant like Dr. Strangelove or Blazing Saddles. Andy Kaufman is very original, but so are Koala Bears, they're just not funny or entertaining.",,Anonymous,Biography
Andy Kaufman is difficult to understand,"I rented this movie because I thought it would be funny, but it seemed to be more of a dramatic documentary to me.  I never saw any of Andy Kaufman's skits or roles, so I don't know how true to history the movie is.  Assuming the movie is accurate, people would have to be mature and informed of Kaufman's style of humour before they could appreciate it.  Jim Carrey portrayed him as an eccentric person who was struggling with crowds who wanted him to be funny in a way different than he wanted to be.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Good recreations, but....","This movie does a good job recreating Kauffman bits, but there doesn't seem to be much of a story here. They don't explore the relationship between Love's character and Kauffman. They use creative license in places, so why not go all the way with it and put a movie together that works. Why Danny DeVito is playing Shapiro rather than himself still baffles me. Joining DeVito in producing this movie is Robert Shapiro and Bob Zamuta. I can see why these characters came off so good in the movie. Not an ounce of friction between them and Kauffman. Lawler does a good job. Carey must not have done his homework very well when it comes to Lawler, thinking he had to bait Lawler for real to get a good performance from him. I wish good ole J.R. (Jim Ross) commentated like he did back in the 80s, rather than his 90s style of speaking in soundbites ""Oh my! Oh my!"". Here's an interesting note: Summer 1998 Tony Clifton was at Hugh Hefner's Midnight Summer's Dream party. He was going on and on about being in a Milos Forman movie. So was that Carey, or Paul Giamotti?",,Anonymous,Biography
