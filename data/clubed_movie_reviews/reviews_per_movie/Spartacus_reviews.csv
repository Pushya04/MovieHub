Controlling Stanley: The Spartacus Experience,"As most are undoubtedly aware this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS (1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.Shooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.Later, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together.But SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Spartacus? You are he, aren't you?""","It is very much part of Hollywood folklore that having dispensed with the services of Anthony Mann, producer and star Kirk Douglas brought in Stanley Kubrick with whom he had worked so effectively in 'Paths of Glory'. This represented a daunting challenge and Kubrick passed with flying colours. The rest as they say is history although Douglas always felt that Kubrick was not as grateful as he should have been!It would be well-nigh impossible now to assemble a cast of such substance and quality. There were bound to be clashes of temperament of course and the animosity between Olivier and Laughton has been amusingly recounted by Peter Ustinov who picked up an Oscar as Best Supporting actor. Olivier here is in his physical prime and is magnificent in the role of Crassus. He is ruthlessness incarnate but tender in his scenes with the Lavinia of Jean Simmons. He had previously directed her in 'Hamlet' and their professional bond is palpable.There are scenes which are indelibly etched notably the gladiatorial combat between Douglas and Woody Strode and the scene where the slave army watches the legions of Crassus forming for battle which must surely have been inspired by Eisenstein's 'Alexander Nevsky'. The score by Alex North although harsh captures perfectly the brutality of the times whilst Russell Metty's cinematography is outstanding.Forget the others, this is the only gladiator film that really matters and it will never be surpassed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spartacus or How I learnt to live away from Hollywood,"This is Kubrick's farewell to Hollywood. I would have liked to be a fly on the wall. I don't believe for a minute that it was a cordial parting of the ways. I mean, Kubrick never returned, never! With ""Paths of Glory"" Kubrick gave Kirk Douglas, not just his best part as an actor, but his best movie. By the time Douglas called Kubrick to ""take over"" ""Spartacus"" Douglas was already a huge star with too much saying in the matter. Look at it, it's clear. ""Spartacus"" is more Douglas than Kubrick. Great fun to watch, yes, absolutely. A terrific script by black listed Dalton Trumbo. Some fight sequences unequalled in the history of film. Look at the fight between Douglas and Woody Strode and compare it to the ones in ""Troy"" or ""Gladiator"" for that matter. It is sad an embarrassing to realise how low we've fallen. Computer generated images or not. The cast is unbelievable but it's clearly not Kubrick's. The casting of his movies was part of his master plan. He would cast a Ryan O'Neil as Barry Lyndon for instance so he can blend perfectly with the magnificent tapestry, without adding any colours of his own. The same can be said of Keir Dullea, in 2001, a robotic non entity in a showdown with a voice. When he needed actors to be at the very pinnacle of his universe he went to Peter Sellers, Malcolm McDowell or James Mason. Even the casting of Tom Cruise made a lot of sense. He used the star and his wife to talk about the dreamlike powers of betrayal. In ""Spartacus"" Tony Curtis, plays Antoninus, a teacher of the classics. A campy idea never seen in a Kubrick film, before or since. To be fair, there are some spot on, brilliant pieces of casting. Charles Laughton is, as usual, superb. Peter Ustinov, terrific. Laurence Olivier manages to give a multifaceted portrait of weakness, fear and greed. Jean Simmons makes the reason to survive totally believable. But the cutesy love scene between her and a shiny muscular, coiffed Spartacus is truly terrible. As a final blow, the scene is enveloped in a sticky, corny music theme. Having said all that. Don't you dare missing this epic. I'ts Kubrick's goodbye to Hollywood and like everything else that the master said or do, he really meant it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Eternal Cry For Freedom,"From what little I've read of this film it was lucky to have been made at all. Some very big talents had some very big egos and those egos clashed repeatedly. Original director Anthony Mann was replaced by Stanley Kubrick by Producer/Star Kirk Douglas among other clashes.But the result was all worth it. The stars all give top notch performances, but the mark of a really great film is the memorability of each individual in the ensemble. To give a few examples, Charles McGraw as the sadistic trainer at the gladiatorial school, John Dall as Sir Laurence Olivier's protégé, and John Ireland as Kirk Douglas's fellow gladiator trainee are all memorable in the brief roles they have.Kirk Douglas wisely opts for a straightforward interpretation of a hero in the title role of Spartacus. He's a BC everyman, born into a world which hadn't heard anything about human rights, he knows and feels he's not just cattle. Catch the alternating scenes of Douglas and Sir Laurence Olivier addressing the slave army and the Roman Army. Olivier with his years of Shakespearean training coming across as the tyrant to be, and Douglas in simple prose talking about the slaves fighting for their hopes and dreams. Very effective.The plot concerns a revolt at a gladiatorial school which mushrooms into a crisis for the Roman Empire. Political factions led by Olivier as Crassus and Charles Laughton as Gracchus seek to use the slave revolt to further their own ends.Laughton as always is a wonder. It's a bit of unusual casting for him because his parts are usually those of very tortured souls. His Gracchus is a sly rogue, but a decent man. One of my favorite movie lines of all time is delivered by him addressing the Roman Senate where he says he'll ""take a little republican corruption for a little republican freedom.""Another sly rogue in the film is Peter Ustinov who won the first of his two Oscars as Batiatus the owner of the gladiatorial school. Like so many others I'm sure in those days, he's just trying to come out on the winning side when doing so could be a life or death situation.Jean Simmons as Varinia, beloved of Spartacus, has the only woman's part of any substance. But when was Ms. Simmons bad in anything. One of the most underrated and under-appreciated actresses in the history of film.The lessons about man's desire for freedom and to control his own destiny are eternal and valid. And this film will be also.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
praise,"The darkest historical epic. No dancing girls, no chariot races, filmed in sombre browns and reds.  Nominally directed by Kubrick but Douglas, as a very 'hands on' producer was responsable for the operatic sweep of the film. I was astonished when revisiting the film in 1991 at the cinema at the bravery of the project-to have the hero cry several times, once even out of self pity and with a heart rending ending! The film has depth and weight, the characters are well drawn. The performances are almost flawless, Douglas managing as actor to create tension in each scene-Olivier, not withstanding his eyerolling mannerisms is perfectly cast. The minor parts are richly drawn-gravel voiced Charles McGraw, Herbert Lom and Woody Strode. The cinematography and music are flawless. Only John Dall as a very modern Glaberus and John Ireland as Crixus seem out of place.  Ironically, despite the downbeat tone of the film it is impossible to watch it without being uplifted through your tears of compassion. Unofficialy remade as Braveheart...watch one after the other and you'll see the similarities in mood, theme and even the battle choreography. Spartacus would be my 'desert island' movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Still relevant after all these years,"A very moving and compelling story of epic proportions. The plot is relentless, propelled by a dazzling screenplay. Kubrick draws some of the greatest performances of the cast, and fills the screen with images that fascinate throughout. Well paced for a movie of this magnitude.To those who complain of anachronisms and poetic license with historical events, I say to them, 'Remember, it is a movie.' To be truly accurate, the cast would be delivering their lines in Latin and ancient Greek, with English subtitles. Whatever Kubrick might lose with historical inaccuracies, he gains far more in his ability to convey the story to the viewer. Even though it is over forty years old, the film tells us more of the present day than it does of the past.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
When slaves rise up against Rome.,"Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) has been a slave since the age of thirteen. He is among a handful of slaves selected by the Roman Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) to be trained as gladiators. (I absolutely loved Peter Ustinov in the role of Batiatus; he was fabulous!)Slaves are treated like animals, and those in power have no feelings for them whatsoever. They would have slaves kill each other purely for entertainment. Spartacus makes friends with the slaves, and when an opportunity arises, they overpower the guards and manage to escape. Now, the slaves are building their own army in revolt against the Romans.Laurence Olivier stars as Crassus, a wealthy Roman senator and the film's main protagonist. Jean Simmons stars as Varinia, also a slave and the love interest of Spartacus. I enjoyed the developing romance between Spartacus and Varinia. The film follows Spartacus as he builds his army and plans to avenge the Romans, even if it seems impossible to fight against such a mighty power.From all the costumes to the magnificent sets and thousands of extras, 'Spartacus' is an incredible production. In a time before CGI, the scale of the production is jaw-dropping! The film apparently had a cast of 10,500 members (with all the extras). Today the extras would simply be added with CGI in post-production. And this is why I enjoy older movies so much; it was real film making. On every level, 'Spartacus' is a film of epic proportions. It's hard to believe this film was made more than six decades ago!!If I had to compare 'Spartacus' to more recent films, movies like 'Gladiator', '300', and the TV series 'Rome' comes to mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gladiator prequel or sequel,"Another Kubrick's masterpiece and very influential movie in it's genre.
Kirk Douglas did great job as Spartacus but for me the best charachter in this movie was Laurence Olivier as Crassus. He brings on of the best villain performances I've ever seen. Spartacus had a lot of influence on Ridley Scoot's Gladiator, from way of acting (especially the similarity between Joaquin Pheonix and Laurence Olivier's character) to the way camera moves and shots are taken. This is truely a great historical film and a classic you should see. It will be hard for me to rank it amongst other Kubrick's films but I will try it (don't get angry if you disagree).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spectacular movie 7/10,"""Spartacus"" is an amazing movie. Along with other movies such as The Ten Commandments and ""Cleopatra"". They all have features in common: they have massive amounts of stunts and film locations, they are huge movies with amount of production and they all tell interesting and fascinating stories of human history. Today you won't see any massive production like this in Hollywood because everything is made with CGI and green screen. Back in the day it was a revolutionary, that's what makes Spartacus so well appreciated and fascinating. The story is really good. A slave becomes a leader of a big rebellion against the Roman empire. Kirk Douglas is an amazing actor and he does a fabulous job in the portrayal of the heroic character. The score was beautifully composed. The cinematography is probably the main reason this film is so well appreciated and I admit, it is fantastic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stanley Kubrick's Magnus Opus on legend Spartacus couldn't battle out the fact that it came just after Legendary Ben-Hur,"Spartacus (1960) :Brief Review -Stanley Kubrick's magnus opus on legend Spartacus couldn't battle out the fact that it came just after Legendary Ben Hur. Maybe Stanely Kubrick is not the man for Magnus Opus and Historical Biopics. Spartacus could have been an epic tale and a legendary motion picture considering the kind of grandeur and topic it had but the fact that Hollywood went too ahead with films like 'The Ten Commandments' and 'Ben Hur' just before Spartacus couldn't let it become so. I am a big fan of Stanley Kubrick and the kind of realistic, brutal films he has made but may be he's not the one who fits in magnum opus genre. This kind of films need different perspective and different cinematic liberty which is lacking here in Spartacus. You see the grandeur in the film but somehow it just doesn't work the way it should work, it doesn't feel big. It just passed by so quickly with lack of cinematic Liberty hence making it look so rough. I remember so many moments from Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments giving me jitters every time i watch them. Every time they look big and thrills me. Here Spartacus lacks it and it also lacks the feel of legend of Spartacus. The man should have been glorified in the film like a Hero, like a legend but he looks so ordinary in the film. The film is about 195 minutes long but more than half of the runtime doesn't focus on Spartacus, it goes on focusing more on Roman politics which was not at all needed in the biopic of Spartacus. There should have been more about Spartacus and then maybe impact would have been more powerful. The film has got positives like Acting, cinematography and technical brilliance but i would have been more happy if all this had been used to glorify the legend in heroic and enormous way. Maybe Ben Hur being too huge and legendary causes me to accept the goodness of Spartacus but what can i do if this film came just an year after Ben Hur. And i don't need to tell you about Ben Hur and it's impact. Spartacus is very good film though, i was expecting a Classic from Kubrick and it didn't happen with this film at least.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The greatest battle .. is against time,"One year earlier, in 1959, William Wyler finished his own opus known to film buffs as Ben Hur.In 1960, Kubrick directed this film under the tight scrutiny of the ""real"" producer, Douglas himself.Both films seem alike in the IMDb. That is, the ratings are similar, the public acclaim (at the time) similar, and both won multiple awards.But the real battle, the real foe, is time itself.A half-century later, BEN HUR still shines, the dialog still rings, and Heston's prideful acting outlives the actor himself, as is true with all great actors.This film does not fare so well for any who would spend 3+ hours with it. Douglas could not resist casting himself in the lead even though he was 45 at the time. The average age of an actual Roman gladiator was 22.So Spartacus, to the jaundiced eye, seems more than the story of someone's father raising an army of slaves, than an actual gladiator.The fight scenes all seem staged, as, indeed, much of the ""action"" seemed in most films of the era -- compared to SPARTACUS BLOOD AND SAND in 2010, for example, the 1960 film seems almost in slow motion.The point? I could go on. Jean Simmonds seems lost in her role. The dialog is stilted. The music is insanely wrong, too much wind instrument noise, also common for the era. In fact, of the entire cast, the only one who seems comfortable in the role of a Roman is Peter Ustinov and that is because he carried himself in real life the same way, as if everyone he met was in some way beneath him.There are timeless films and timeless performances. This is not one of them.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
So what if it's historically inaccurate?,"I know my summary may sound opinionated...but I couldn't help being entertained by this film. If I had any complaints it would be there are one or two parts that suffer from uneven pacing and in the latter half especially there are a lot of wordy speeches from Kirk Douglas. That said, it is very well made, with sweeping cinematography, beautiful costumes and well constructed sets. The score is triumphant and bombastic, Kubrick's direction is secure and the script is surprisingly intelligent and knowing. Also the action is brilliantly done, and the performances are to be much applauded, with Kirk Douglas believable and sincere in the title role, Jean Simmons alluring as Varina and Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton stealing every single scene they are in.Overall, maybe not Kubrick's very best, but a fine historical epic. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The World of Stanley Kubrick: Director for hire.,"Spartacus (1960) was a director for hire gig for Stanley Kubrick. Kirk Douglas was in a pinch for his next film project. He was making an epic film about a slave in the roman republic who rebels against his masters. Anthony Mann stepped down from the director's chair and Mr. Douglas needed someone to take over. Enters Stanley Kubrick. Although he has little creative input (i.e. script and story wise) he manages to make a compelling movie with his keen eye and directorial abilities.Filmed in a grand scope and in such great detail, Spartacus is eye candy for fans of epic film making. I can only imagine what the film would have been like if he had total control over the project. Kirk Douglas is the man as Spartacus, Tony Curtis is quite good as his sidekick, Charles Laughton is wise and witty as the elder senator, Peter Ustinov is a hoot in his role as the poor victim of fortunate (and unfortunate) circumstance and Sir Laurence Olivier shows why he was the premier actor of his day as Crassus.Highly recommended for Kirk Douglas fans and Stanley Kubrick philes.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece,"This is, by far, the greatest movie ever made about the ancient world, in part, because it centers itself around a still topical subject: slavery. It's a subject society continues to grapple with and which continues to inspire political debates and public demonstrations of intense emotion. The screenplay by blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo was an adaptation of a novel by blacklisted novelist Howard Fast, who had to self-publish the book. Produced by a man of uncommon courage, Kirk Douglas, it relates the story of a man of uncommon courage, the Roman slave, Spartacus, played by Kirk Douglas. Nearly shut down by the American Legion and their political allies, one of our most courageous Presidents, John F. Kennedy, gave it his public blessing when it opened in Washington, DC. The gladiatorial combat and battle scenes are very suspenseful and perfect in execution. The art direction, 70mm design, Russell Metty's cinematography and a great score by Alex North insures a fascinating 197 minutes, that fly right by. The casting is perfect as are their performances. Only a heart of stone would fail to be moved by the final scene.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worthwhile but uneven and poorly paced,"For all the praise it's received, I really think Spartacus is a pretty flawed movie.  Basically the film's scenes fall into two distinctly different categories.  First, there are scenes following Spartacus as he suffers through gladiatorial school, rebels against his tormentors, falls in love, and leads a slave revolt that threatens to topple the power of the Roman empire.  These segments succeed in everything they seek to achieve-- they entertain mindlessly and viscerally, and somehow manage to be exciting and predictable at the same time.  We all know, for instance, that the mean gladiator instructor is eventually going to get what's coming to him, but we're actually surprised and a little shocked when he finally does.  Add an effective score by Alex North, some occasionally touching human drama, and a massive battle sequence that clearly served as inspiration for Braveheart's massive festivals of destruction, and you've got one hell of a movie.But then someone decided that the film needed about an hour and forty-five minutes of flat, uninteresting, irrelevant, utterly useless political intrigue among the Roman heads of state.  Spartacus is one seriously lengthy movie, and during the segments focusing on the senate and the military leaders you can't help but look at your watch a few times.  I went along with these scenes at first, but after a while I lost track of all the confusing different political figures and what they were trying to accomplish.  I sat trying to figure out who everyone was and how the intrigues affected the Spartacus revolt story and found myself dozing off. Having seen the film again, I now know who everyone is, but I still haven't figured out why all this scheming and plotting is important to the story at all.  It's just dead weight that slows the movie down right when it should be reaching escape velocity, and I really wish most of it had been left in the editing room.I can only half recommend this film.  A movie made up of just the Spartacus story along with only a few, essential scenes devoted to the Roman leaders would really have been a true classic.  But instead we have a movie that just gets in its own way for just about half of its running time.  Good thing Kubrick had more control over the rest of his films...",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A box-office triumph about the rebel slave with all-star-cast and impressive battles.,"A famed masterpiece and marvellous epic version about Spartacus life that won 4 Oscars, containing exciting drama and overwhelming battles featuring thousands of real extras. The true story of a gladiator who leads other slaves in a rebellion against the power of Rome in 73 BC. This is the classic version about the true story of gladiator Spartacus. At the beginning , the Thracian slave laboring in harsh rock, when he's purchased by obese Battiatus (Peter Ustinov). Brought back to Capua in a gladiator's school, he meets corpulent gladiator named Draba (Woody Strode) and falls in love with Varinia, a gorgeous slave (Jean Simmons). He escapes and stirs up all gladiators and slaves in a revolt (73 B. C.) against the power of Rome .After various generals are vanquished , the rebellion is put down by Crassus (Laurence Olivier) who confronts with wily old senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton). Spartacus actually died in battle and his body was not found. Electrifying Excitement!. The Electrifying Spectacle That Thrilled the World!. Human Desires so Strong they changed the course of History...of a Rebellion that shook a Civilization in a Pagan era, 71 B. C....the grandeur and might of Rome and the challenge of an immortal gladiator...of a love that changed the world.Spartacus history, based on Howard Fast's novel, is imaginatively brought to life on groundbreaking frames with great production values, outstanding scenarios and Kubrick's control of the massive battles is commendable. Sword cross, drama, gladiators fights abound in this spellbinding adaptation on audacious Spartacus existence, one of the most rebels in the history. Kirk Douglas, whose political leanings are amply on display herein, also served as executive producer , surrounding himself with best talent available. Magnificent climatic battle scenes, featuring 8.000 real, live Spanish soldiers to stunning effect. It is a fitting description of Spartacus character, and it doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. But it is in the observation of human detail and in many memorable little scenes when the film gets splendor. The picture score most heavily over other epics and in which it finds an inner strength. It's all immensely grand, though predictable , but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic performances of excellent starring with flawless portrayals and all around with the best talent available. Jean Simmons as Varinia , Charles Laughton as Gracus Peter Ustinov as Batiatus, John Gavin as Julius Caesar, Nina Foch, John Ireland, Herbert Lom, John Dall, Charles McGraw, all do commendably craftsmanlike work. A version featuring Kubrick's 'director cut' is nowadays available featuring a restored, controversial homoerotic bath scene wit Laurence Olivier and Tony Curtis. It contains a rousing and pulsing musical score by Alex North. As well as impressive cinematography in mighty 70mm and on the Giant Panoramic Screen by Russsell Metty with colorful images when the rebels are defeated and crucified along Via Appia, in a sea of crosses silhouetted against a sunset. The film was excellently directed by Stanley Kubrick that gave much-desired financial independence. Anthony Mann is uncredited as co-director.The Spartacus life was previously adapted in 'Spartacus' (2004) by Robert Dornhelm with Goran Visnjic, Ben Cross, Angus McFayden, Ian McNeice, Rhona Mitra, Alan Bates.

More Trumbo than Kubrick,"Kubrick dismissed several of his early films from his canon. Fear and Desire makes sense because of its amateurishness while Killer's Kiss has some similar problems (though I feel it's a successful movie overall). Spartacus, though, isn't about quality but more about authorship.Out of all the feature narrative films Stanley Kubrick, he produced most of and had writing credits on all of them except Spartacus. The history was that Kirk Douglas, as producer, had hired Anthony Mann to direct the film but fired him (for unclear reasons) after a week of filming. In desperate need of a director as quickly as possible, Douglas called up Kubrick, with whom he had made Paths of Glory, and Kubrick took the job. He hadn't written a word and had say in only one casting decision (that of Varinia, a character that hadn't begun filming yet, who was played by Jean Simmons). There is even a story of Douglas asking Kubrick what he thought of the famous ""I am Spartacus"" scene just before filming it. Kubrick admitted that he thought it was stupid, and Douglas openly berated his director (and, as producer, employee) for the opinion. Notice that this scene was filmed and included in the final cut.So, I think it's easy to see why Kubrick, who had such complete control of literally every other movie he made, would feel a certain distance regarding Spartacus. It's more of a creative output for Dalton Trumbo and Kirk Douglas than Stanley Kubrick.So, Spartacus is a curio in the Kubrick filmography. It sticks out like a sore thumb. It's too bright, colorful, and optimistic, and yet it's still good.The slave Spartacus gets purchased from a salt mine to a gladiatorial school where he learns how to kill. When the Roman senator Crassus visits the Batiatus, the owner of the school, he pays for a pair of to the death combats. This is the spark that leads to the beginning of the slave revolt the next day. Spartacus leads the gladiators to form into an army and raid, pillage, and sweep across southern Italy to a port city where they will pay for ships to carry them away from the Roman Empire.The movie is at its best when either Crassus, played by Laurence Olivier, Gracchus, played by Charles Laughton, or Batiatus, played by Peter Ustinov, are on screen. They are thankfully center stage for much of the film. Crassus is the personification of Rome at its most dangerous, affluent, and corrupt. A man of no morals, he revels in his power over the world. Gracchus is a man of appetites who revels in the fights of the Roman Senate, countering Crassus with intelligence and wit. Batiatus is a working man who built up his wealth through the creation of his gladiatorial school. He shares a special corpulent bond with Gracchus and the two have some of the most fun written scenes in the film.Spartacus, unfortunately, is just not that interesting. Once freed from slavery, his drive of necessity is replaced by a gauzy need for freeing slaves. He's purely an idealist of no fault. This is a direct result of Dalton Trumbo's communism. The way he painted Spartacus, as the faultless ideal, was in line with the then socialist artistic norm of portraying what was essentially the New Socialist Man. Douglas liked this because he got to play the hero, but Kubrick thought he was uninteresting and a wash of the more interesting history of the real Spartacus who unnecessarily turned from northern Italy towards Rome to continue raiding instead of escaping like he could. But, as we've already seen, Kubrick had little say on this movie's characters and story.There are hints of themes that Kubrick had been, and would continue to, dealing with. The first hour at the gladiatorial school is all about the dehumanization of man at the whim of a larger, impersonal, and inhuman system. This falls directly in line with the events of Paths of Glory. The ending of both movies echo each other to certain degrees. In Paths of Glory sees the system win, as it does in Spartacus. However, in the Roman epic, there are hints of optimism as Varinia holds up Spartacus' baby boy to him, pledging to carry on the boy's father's name and cause. That sort of optimism is missing from Paths of Glory, and, really, most of Kubrick's filmography until Eyes Wide Shut, I think.Where Kubrick was able to shine was in the movie's visual design. He had little say in set construction, costumes, and locations (though he apparently convinced the producers to shoot the famed battle in Spain instead of America), but he had full control of his camera. Compositions carry that intelligent and clear dynamism he was known for. The most striking imagery might be the gladiatorial fight between Spartacus and Draba. In the foreground we see the two in their small box as two others rise, pass through the narrow opening at the center of frame with Marcellus in the middle and Crassus at the top of frame. It's an elegant composition that shows a visualist making the most of the conditions he had.There are also several action scenes that are surprisingly well filmed. Not that I don't imagine Kubrick had the ability, but the most action he had filmed was the chase in Killer's Kiss and the long tracking shots over no man's land in Paths of Glory. They were nothing like the dynamic and violent action in the gladiatorial fight, the uprising, and, especially, the battle near the end of the film.In the end, the movie's certainly good, but it's got too many authorial hands moving it in different directions. Instead of William Wyler getting support from producers and star to make Ben-Hur in the best possible way, we had a screenwriter insisting on less interesting characterizations, a producer and star who seemed more interested in making himself look good than telling a story, and a director that couldn't pursue anything like his own vision. It's a compromised film that amazingly works as well as it does.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rome Epic Roams Too Much,"""Spartacus"" has its moments but feels for the most part like what it is: An overblown epic with too many cooks stirring the pot.It's shortly before the dawn of the Christian era, and somewhere in the vastness of the Roman Empire, a slave named Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is forced to become a gladiator, providing kill-or-be-killed entertainment for leisured decadents. Alas, he is pushed too far, and leads a revolt that soon threatens great Rome herself. Will Spartacus lead his people to freedom? Or will the vile Crassus (Laurence Olivier) bring him to heel?Nominally directed by Stanley Kubrick, for which this was his introduction to the big-time, ""Spartacus"" is in fact a shining example of limitations, both of the Hollywood star vehicle as art form and the ability of a 1960 film to come to grips with the ancient world. How best to condense the social upheaval of the Third Servile War? Why, how about Kirk and Jean Simmons smooching at a pond!The film starts off well enough, with Douglas in fine fettle glowering at the camera and everyone else, especially trainer/tormentor Marcellus (Charles McGraw). In a sequence that obviously influenced the later Best Picture winner ""Gladiator"", Spartacus learns the ropes, makes some friends, and begins to want to do something about the injustice he is experiencing. The first hour concludes in the film's only great moment, a duel between Spartacus and the mysterious Draba (Woody Strode) for Crassus's cruel enjoyment.Once Spartacus rebels, however, the film goes to pot. Douglas loses the fire while Kubrick loses interest in Spartacus's story, becoming engaged only when the scene shifts to Rome, where the aristocratic Crassus battles with the plebian Gracchus (Charles Laughton) for the city's soul, and Spartacus's former owner Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) finds himself in the unhappy role of political pawn.Ustinov's performance was the only Oscar-winning one in any Kubrick film, and he's great both as a bridge between the two story arcs and as low-key comic relief, playing off the high dungeon of everyone else. The problem with ""Spartacus"" is you also have some Golden Turkey performances, too, like those of Simmons, John Dahl, John Ireland, and John Gavin.Olivier may be the best thing in the film, in those moments when he is at the center of it. Playing Crassus as if he were Roy Cohn in a toga, he plumps quite convincingly as he makes sheep eyes at slave boy Tony Curtis and displays a patriotic narcissism in uncovering his lusts: ""There is only one way to deal with Rome, Antoninus. You must serve her. You must abase yourself before her.""Nothing else sticks quite like that (and that only because the restored version on the Criterion DVD put back an excised scene of Crassus and Antoninus in a bath, which explains what the old Roman meant by ""abase"".) Whenever the movie goes back to Spartacus and company, its hard watching as Douglas smiles a lot and moves through adoring crowds like John F. Kennedy at a campaign stop. We are told a lot of Spartacus's skill as a commander, but the battles all occur off-screen, with the one exception being the final one, a clumsy set-piece that compares badly to the spectacle of less-heralded ""sword-and-sandals"" pictures.Not uninteresting, especially as the Criterion DVD includes many commentaries and supplements that enrich the experience of the movie. It's just that for a director of such discipline as Kubrick, ""Spartacus"" is all over the map. It's no mystery why he largely disowned this film after its release; it really was never his picture in the first place.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant Film, Brilliantly Portrayed","Until Shakespeare in Love came out, this was my number one movie. It still stands the test of time.Acccurately described as ""The Thinking Man's Epic,"" this film should be must viewing for everyone who wonders why ""progressivism"" will never lose its appeal. The villains are brilliant in their belief that ""Rome is an eternal thought in the mind of god."" (Crassus. He died, by the way, by having molten gold poured down his throat.) And the heroes are united in their belief that ""The finest wine comes from home, wherever it is."" Spartacus has, in its own way, become almost a cliché - its ""I'm Spartacus"" lampooned in an Academy Award lead in and the whole movie replayed as Braveheart. (Witness the sound effects as the shields slap into position during the charge. Mel Gibson admitted to stealing it.) But I defy any thinking person to watch the movie and not tear up: at the scene where Spartacus tells his army, ""I know that we're brothers. And I know that we're free. WE MARCH TONIGHT."" At the scene where he kills Antoninus, with the words, ""I love you, Antoninus, as I love the son I'll never see."" And at the end scene, where Jean Simmons - transcendently beautiful - shows the dying, crucified hero his son and says, ""It's your son, Spartacus. He's free."" In an age when we are so willing to trade our freedom in for the illusion of safety, the message of Spartacus - the movie, and the true historical character - will remain forever uplifting.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
great commentary on DVD,"I think the movie is quite good; what I want to add to the comments already made is just this:The commentary (on the DVD) by screenplay writer Dalton Trumbo is great. Kirk Douglas said it was the greatest analysis of film-making ever. He explains the purpose of every scene, very openly and honestly critiquing the changes the actors made, for (in his estimation) better or worse.There is another track of commentary by the actors. The actors had an unusual degree of latitude in re-writing their lines and forming their characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Based on a historical slave revolt in areas controlled by Republican Rome, it is a story of both tragedy and triumph.","If you saw the movie, read the book (by Howard Fast) and if you have read the book, see the movie and see that they fit seamlessly together without major deviations.The most memorable scenes are of course those of the final battle with the eerie and chilling sound of the clink, clink, clink of armor as the Roman infantry marches into intricate battle positions. I believe soldiers of the Spanish army were used as extras for this movie.The most memorable line is that of Crassus (Olivier) as he impresses upon Antoninus, the slave (Tony Curtis), the strength of the Roman Republic. He gazes at a cohort of soldiers with their massive pilae (spears or spikes)and their bronze shields marching pass his villa at night. ""There Antoninus, goes the might and power of Rome. Nothing can withstand it...........how much more a mere boy?"" And at that point Antoninus, whom he had been trying to seduce into a homosexual tryst with oblique erotic talk referring to ""snails and oysters,"" escaped to join the rebelling army of slaves led by Spartacus.Made just as the various civil rights organizations were starting to cohere, one wonders if this epic movie which highlighted the injustice of slavery, had an impact on American society which finally acknowledged and did something about its gross violations of human rights based on skin color.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best credits sequence,"A magnificent movie deserving of every accolade heaped upon it. Watch out, especially, for the credit sequence at the beginning. It is truly worthy of this epic.Unless you are watching it at home (and can rewind), it might just pass you by before you are settled in. And that would be a pity. So get comfortable quickly before the movie starts. Be prepared for a real treat.Whoever put the credit sequence together ought to be commended. Coincidentally, Alex North also composed the music of the other epic with a great credit sequence, Cleopatra.",,Anonymous,Biography
One of the great epics,"In 1960, ""Spartacus"" must have been a stunning achievement - it was one of the most magnificent, intellectual, daring epics since ""Gone With the Wind"" and dealt with important ideas like freedom and independence as well as spectacle. The unconventional ending denies the hero a happy victory, and he has to take solace in the fact that maybe the world will be better for his children as a result of his achievement.In 1999, it still holds up well, especially the quality of the battle scenes and the subtle dance of sexual motivations. In particular, there is a key, daring scene which has been restored in the new version (it was cut by censors), where Olivier's Senator Crassus and a slave, played by Tony Curtis, share a bath. In that scene, the complex motivations of Crassus are made clear, and they are way ahead of their time - Crassus confesses, ""I like both oysters and snails,"" and essentially reveals that he is a bisexual who sexual desires are a form of conquest and an outgrowth of his possessive nature.Unfortunately, I also found to be a very restrained film. Writer Dalton Trumbo suffered at the hands of the Hollywood blacklisters (this is his first screen credit since he was blacklisted more than 10 years before), but he avoids any stirring speeches about freedom and revolution. Frankly, it isn't clear to me why the other slaves are so quick to join Spartacus in his largely personal rebellion, or why they follow him as a leader. The audience has to believe that the individual freedom we enjoy in 20th century America was universally and automatically something that the gladiators were willing to readily die for, on Spartacus' say-so.Director Kubrick's later works (most notably ""A Clockwork Orange"") would rebel against authoritarian governments with much more passion than this film. In addition, the relationship between Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) and Varinia (Jean Simmons) is tender but restrained; they fall in love in the opening scenes of the movie even though they never speak, barely ever touch each other and never speak more than three words.All that said, the film is a remarkable achievement. The performances are all superb, especially Ustinov's sly, Oscar-winning comic performance; Olivier's evil dictator; Laughton's wonderful work; and Simmons and Douglas as well.The battle scene is one of the most spectacular ever filmed, with over 8,000 Spanish soldiers filling out the ranks of the slaves and the Roman army, in sharp contrast to those all-too-common ancient battle scenes in which fast cutting and close shots fail to create the illusion that the couple of dozen men fighting are two clashing armies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very famous classic,"Just as Ben-Hur is the most famous biblical movie ever, Spartacus is the most famous gladiator movie ever. (Sorry, Russell Crowe.) In 1960, the year after Ben-Hur's spectacular success, producing a three-hour movie about Roman gladiators was risky. Everyone in the audience would be comparing it to Charlton Heston's slavery scenes, so it'd better be good! Well, whether or not you like it, it's remained a classic through the decades.Spartacus focuses on the treatment and life of slaves, and the dissension within the Roman Empire, rather than copying any Biblical theme from the countless religious movies to come out of the 1950s. There are so many famous scenes and lines that have come out of this movie, it's almost superfluous to give a plot summary or even mention the cast. Briefly, Kirk Douglas plays the title character, an unruly slave who is sent to train as a gladiator. He falls in love with Jean Simmons, and while his fellow slaves turn to him as a leader, he bonds closely with one in particular, Tony Curtis. Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, and John Gavin give very memorable performances as a Roman politician, a slave trader, and Julius Caesar, respectively.If this is one of the first old movies you've ever seen, you'll form very definite opinions of everyone in the cast that will be hard to shake no matter how many more of their movies you subsequently watch. You'll find it hard to believe Laurence Olivier was once a handsome hero after you see him as such a convincing villain. You won't find Charles Laughton very endearing, and you'll probably wonder why Peter Ustinov won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. Ustinov's character is important to the story, but it's not a very demanding performance, and I have to think this was a long overdue make-up Oscar for his turn in Quo Vadis. It's also puzzling when you find out Kirk Douglas wasn't even nominated, but Alex North's absurd music was. I understand North wanted to conjure the ""Roman circus"" idea in people's minds, but once he heard what he wrote and realized it wasn't working, he should have come up with something else. It's hard to take a movie, let alone a huge epic, seriously when the music is comical and ill-fitting.Kirk Douglas pulled out all the stops in his most famous film, and when you see him performing his gladiator training stunts, you'll drop your jaw-and not only because he looks so good. There are rigorous physical scenes that had to be performed take after take without tiring, but there are also tender moments that prove he's ""not an animal,"" a phrase he keeps repeating to his captors. When he falls in love with Jean Simmons, they're repeatedly kept apart as another torture tactic. In one horrible scene, she's thrown into a neighboring prison cell with a gruff brute so Kirk can hear what happens to her and realize he's helpless to stop it. The next morning, he sneaks a private moment with her during breakfast to ask if she's alright. Keep in mind this movie was made in 1960 after the fall of the Production Code. Scenes with implied rape were allowed, as were partial nudity and sexual innuendo.Spartacus is one of those classics, like Gone with the Wind, that everyone sees at least once in their lifetime. If you have no idea what the phrase ""I'm Spartacus!"" means, your film education missed a key course. Go rent the movie during your next guys' weekend, and get ready to appreciate the movie that fathered all the modern gladiator movies we know and love.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Great Movie Due To Its Romantic Ideals,"Did you know that Karl Marx hero was Spartacus ? There's something deeply ironic about this because the film version of SPARTACUS has so many Marxist ideals it could have been subtitled "" THE STORY OF AN ENLIGHTENED PROLETERIAN HERO "" As film buffs may know the screenwriter of SPARTACUS Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted by the Hollywood studio system because of alleged communist sympathies and it's impossible not to notice that Trumbo has done a sort of leftist inversion of John Ford's "" Always make the legend "" mantra . As a history lesson SPARTACUS is rather poor , if you look up the goofs on this page you'll notice that no one has really bothered to their home work as to the history , politics and machinations of ancient Rome with perhaps the most striking piece of speculation is the myth that Spartacus was from a Greek province sold into slavery when it's far more likely he was a Roman legionnaire who was sent to gladiator school but I guess the being sold into slavery makes for a better storyBut this very simplistic black and white view of history can be forgiven because it's what makes SPARTACUS a great movie , we know who the bad guys are and why they're bad guys ( They're rich and cruel ) and we know who the good guys are and why they're good guys ( They're poor but noble ) and therefore the audience know instantly whose side they're on SPARTACUS is also a film famous because its director Stanley Kubrick supposedly hated it mainly down to the fact that he didn't have any involvement in the screenplay . What ? A director dislikes a movie of this standard ? I'm certain Spielberg or Scorsese would have killed to make a movie this good . It contains fine performances from all the cast but the stand outs are Douglas , Simmons , Laughton ( Someone else alleged to have had leftist sympathies ) Olivier and Ustinov , so many fine actors in one movie and you don't notice how many different accents used until it's pointed out to you . Check out those battle scenes at the end and remember this was long before CGI so these were real people making up the slave and Roman armies but for me the greatest scene of the film and one of the most haunting scenes I have ever seen is where Woody Strode and Kirk Douglas sit facing each other waiting to go into the arena . What makes it even more spellbinding is that there's no dialogue at all , we only hear the sounds of the previous contestants fighting to the deathWithout doubt a movie that deserves to be in the IMDb Top 250 Movies list and possibly Kubrick's best film , he certainly didn't make anything as good as this ever again . But it's a movie that was ignored for most of the major awards at that years Oscar nominations . I guess that because the Oscars are a celebration of American film making talent they didn't want to give awards to movies celebrating communist heroes",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Go Now, and Make Your Joy Complete""","Spartacus, although far from the best Stanley Kubrick film, can still hold its grandeur compared to the average films released during this era. The most prominent aspect of the film that I love is its often successful use of practical effects. Practical effects involving crowds really captures the vastness expanse of the environment and sometimes the stakes of the situation, as being shown during Spartacus' final speech and the combatant's march before the final battle.In terms of writing, the flow of the film is perfect for me. The runtime is technically long but there are no noticeable dragging sequences in its duration. The march before the final battle might look dragging to some, but for me, its tediousness adds a significant tension to the ensuing encounter. Another good facet of the film's writing is the Spartacus-Antoninus dynamic. The 2 character's personality fits perfectly, one being a rigid battle-tested brawn while the other being a calculated artist-scholar brain. This type of character dynamic is not new to films but in Spartacus' case, it is very natural and subtle, unlike other films that forcefully shove their characters' inter-personal mechanisms to viewer's throats.When it comes to acting, Peter Ustinov being Batiatus brings home the bacon for me. There are no bad performances across the casts but Ustinov is the greatest among them by a wide margin. He manages to masterfully convey a very complicated character that hosts several range of motives and emotions throughout the film.But in my opinion, there are still some aspects of the film that drags it down beneath perfection. The most evident for me is the lack of internal conflict inside the rebel army. During their march through Italy, after Spartacus takes charge, all the rebels seem to always agree with one another. No one opposed their leader, which looks unrealistic to me. Or if there's no internal opposition, at least show to the viewers the hardships the rebel army endured during the expedition such as their scavenging of food, battling with the harsh climate or even exhaustion or lack of morale to some slaves. Without these internal conflicts, the rebellion seems like it's all sunshine and rainbows, which is far from the truth.This first concern springboards to my second issue which is the lack of characterization among Spartacus' generals. If only the writers fleshed out Spartacus' rebel comrades a bit more, it could at least create internal subplots inside the rebel camps.My last concern, albeit minor, is a potential plot-hole during the Spartacus-Antoninus duel. Why did the 2 slaves didn't just slit their throats instantly? Both of them will die on the spot so none would be crucified. It's probably due to gladiator honor or whatever.So with all things considered, I think that this film is more than your average money-grabbing product. Baring a few weak characterizations and unfulfilled potential conflicts that could make the story better, Spartacus is still a joyful spectacle that can be recommended to anyone if they could spare approximately 3 hours of their lives watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The sword and sandal epic that has everything.,"Spartacus is the Thracian slave who refused to be a Roman plaything, breaking out of their clutches he led the slave revolt that panicked the Roman Rebublic in circa BC 73, this film is based on that period in history.Spartacus got off to a troubled start, original director Anthony Mann was fired by leading man Kirk Douglas (Spartacus) after a falling out, some of Mann's work does remain in the final picture, though, notably some of the early scenes in the desert are thought to be at Mann's direction. In came then director for hire Stanley Kubrick, who along with Douglas crafted arguably the greatest sword and sandal epic to have ever been made. One that holds up today as the one any prospective new viewers to the genre should seek out. Adapted by Dalton Trumbo from Howard Fast's novel (whilst also tapping from Arthur Koestler's novel, The Gladiators), Spartacus is a stirring experience highlighting the power of unity when faced in opposition to a tyrannical force. It's also boasting a number of intelligent and firmly engaging strands that are a credit to the excellent writing from the once blacklisted Trumbo. Politics figure prominently, whilst the story has a pulsing romantic heart beating amongst the blood and power struggles that are unfolding. Brotherhood bonds within the slave army are firmly established, and the love story axis between Spartacus and Varinia is very fully formed. We are in short set up perfectly for when the film shifts the emphasis in the second half.So many great sequences are in this picture, the gladiator training school as Spartacus and his fellow slaves find that they have dignity within themselves - forced through a tough regime designed to set them up for blood sport entertainment to the watching republic hierarchy. The break out itself is tremendous for its potency, but even that is playing second fiddle to the main battle sequence that Kubrick excellently puts together. The Roman legions forming in military precision is memorable in the extreme (this before CGI, with Kubrick's directing of all those extras being worthy of extra praise from us). Then with the battle itself raging one can only say it's breath taking and definitely a genre high point. Then of course there is the sentimental aspects of Spartacus. Kubrick of course was never known for his warmness, but with the aid of Douglas they get it right and manage to pull the heart strings whilst simultaneously stirring the blood via the action, right up to the incredibly poignant and classical ending that stands the test of time as being cinematic gold. The cast are wonderfully put together, Douglas is fabulous as Spartacus, big, lean and brooding with emotion, very much a career highlight as far as I'm concerned. Laurence Olivier takes up chief bad guy villainy duties as Marcus Crassus, just about the right amount of sneering camp required for such a dislikable character. Peter Ustinov (Best Supporting Actor Winner) is in his pomp as Batiatus, Jean Simmons (perfectly bone structured face) plays off Douglas expertly as Varinia, with Tony Curtis (Antoninus), John Gavin (Julius Caesar) and Charles Laughton (Graccus) adding impetus to this wonderful picture.Spartacus also won Academy Awards for Best Colour Cinematography, Best Art and Set Direction and Best Costume Design, with nominations rightly going to Alex North for his score and Robert Lawrence for his editing. It's a special film is Spartacus, excellently put together and thematically dynamite. Which while also being technically adroit, it's ultimately with the story itself that it truly wins out. Even allowing for some standard Hollywood additions to the real story (Spartacus most certainly didn't meet his maker the way the film says), it's emotionally charged and as inspiring as it is as sadly tragic. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

It could never be ranked,"There´s so  much emotional charge set on this film you´ll find it difficult to remove yourself from the coach after watching. I think this film perfectly stands up today and it could easily ashame Mel Gibson´s acclaimed Braveheart which I think is a disguised carbon copy of this cinematic gem. Performances like Ustinov´s, Olivier´s and Douglas´we don´t see anymore. Are they overacting? How could they not dressed up in those gorgeous roman costumes. This story has the content and the form, actors who are legends today, Kubrick´s magic and his abity to portrait the roman universe: the greed, the pride, the suffering of the slaves, the beauty and how it could´ve changed the fate of thousands and the joy of freedom, some of our basic spiritual needs put together in a 3-hour bright-dream that always keeps you thinking how the basic struggle of manhood (the privileged vs. the unsheltered) some 2000 years ago is perfectly up to date in the 21th century. Unluckily I don´t quite remember the first time I watched this picture so I can´t recall my first and my true feelings towards the plot and the drama, luckily I´ve gotten to watch it several times and I often think it could be the best ever made, but that, of course, always happens after watching a unique masterpiece like this one and perhaps a bunch of another 50. I refuse to rank any of them since this sort of constraint doesn´t fit timeless pieces of art (could you give a mark to Picasso, Garcia Marquez, Mozart, Maradona,...?). In terms of comparison I could say that Braveheart, Gladiator and others like that deserve 0 out of 10 if you already know what Spartacus is about.",,Anonymous,Biography
you can tell that it wasn't Kubrick's idea,"When you watch most of Stanley Kubrick's movies, you can identify the certain touch that he puts in them. ""Spartacus"" is the exception. Kubrick was in fact hired to direct it, and you can tell: it seems more like something that Cecil B. DeMille would have directed.That said, it was actually pretty good. The true story of Thracian slave Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) who led a revolt against the Roman Empire never drags itself; on the contrary, you want it to continue. With a supporting cast of Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis, Charles Laughton and others, this is what sword-and-sandal movies are all about.

inspired movie making,"This is one of the greatest epic movies ever made.  It would never have been made at all if Kirk Douglas had been given the role of Judah Ben Hur in William Wilder epic masterpiece Ben-Hur. Burt Lancaster had also been considered for the role but turned it down.  Kirk was offered the role of Messala opposite Charlton Heston but he turned it down refusing to play second bill to a young upstart such as Heston.Douglas made Spartacus purely to get back at MGM and William Wilder.  This need for revenge drove Douglas to make what is a truly great film.The Direction given for Anthony Mann and Stanley Kubrick is excellent.  The cast is also flawless.  Kirk was clever enough to cast all the Americans in the film as Slaves and Gladiators including himself. The English actors in the Film were all cast as Romans, Olivier, Laughton and Ustinov. This made perfect sense as the Romans and Slaves now sounded different. This makes the film all the more believable.This film is one of my all time favourites, but I often wonder if kirk had got his way and had starred in Ben-Hur, would this film have ever been made ???A final word on the lovely Jean Simmons.

"Stanley Kubrick's early-career epic strikes satisfactorily with both spectacle and emotion, particularly with the latter","Like with many epics, the production for 1960's ""Spartacus"" was not an easy one. The film went through two directors, many troubling cast decisions, and other grueling filming procedures, however, the final result is by all means pleasing. ""Spartacus"" was the first great film for acclaimed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick who would later go on to direct films such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and while his slavery gem does not par with epics such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) and ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956) it is a very interesting motion picture that while dated, seems somehow more effective and mature than its modern day mimickers.Kirk Douglas stars in the title role as Spartacus: a Thracian slave who revolted against the tyrannical Roman Empire during its greatest years. Not much is known about the real Spartacus, but Douglas's portrayal, which very well might have been an influence for Mel Gibson's William Wallace in ""Braveheart"" (1994) and Russell Crowe's Maximus in ""Gladiator"" (2000), as a freedom-hungry but bloodthirsty nationalist is certainly the model for what many like to base their ideal heroes from. Opposing Spartacus is the vicious Marcus Crassus (Laurence Olivier) of Rome, whose goal ultimately becomes not to destroy Spartacus, but to destroy the name and goals of Spartacus.At a length of more than three hours, ""Spartacus"" is a tad too long, but there's not a single uninteresting moment throughout its running time. Perhaps it has too much for its own good and MAYBE some of the cuts from the past releases were necessary or did it some good, but ultimately there is no better way to see a film than the way its creator intended for it. It is held up by a very strong cast, especially by a performance by Peter Ustinov as a conniving, opportunistic slave trader. A common error of many historical epics are strong supporting characters and weak leading characters. But here, ""Spartacus"" does not fault. I was very intrigued by the performance by Kirk Douglas and saw him as a fleshed-out human being and since so little is known about the man he's portraying, there's no room for complaints on accuracy. Laurence Olivier, too, was very compelling as the tyrannical Crassus who taunts and torments with more than just his armies and his declarations for destroying the slave revolts.Stanley Kubrick was only thirty-one years old when he directed ""Spartacus"" after the first director was removed from the production and already one can see the early stages of his visions for spectacle and emotion. But in this case, the most interesting thing about Kubrick's film is the latter. While the glorious battle scenes in the film are by all means riveting, I was more compelled and interested in the genuine human stories that went on between the slaughters, especially with the romance between Douglas and Simmons, which never overstays its welcome and has an effective, pleasant atmosphere surrounding it. Alex North's Academy Award-nominated music score really finds the right note and volume for these surprisingly tender and poignant moments. And note how Kubrick wisely did not cast young actors for these performances and how he chose primarily middle-aged people for his principal cast members. Ultimately, this is more effective than going with the stereotypical approach that only the younger generation can wage a battle and the older ones mostly sit around and lecture. That is where it becomes more mature than its contemporary mimickers, as I noted earlier, and it's more convincing.Unfortunately, it was not until recently that audiences saw ""Spartacus"" the way Stanley Kubrick intended it to be. Twenty-some minutes were cut before the film even premiered, some more was cut later on, and there are still some small pieces that are lost to us, but thanks to Robert Harris and James Katz, who saved other masterpieces such as ""Vertigo"" (1958) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) from the ravages of age, the film has been magnificently and commendably restored and the missing scenes have been put back where they should have always been. There are still some glitches and color problems left in the film, but of course, it was stored under the most deplorable of conditions since its original 1960 release.Is ""Spartacus"" what I would call a great epic film? No. But is it an entertaining and good one, nonetheless? Absolutely. My only real complaints for the film is the long running time, which I feel is a little too stretched, some underdeveloped supporting characters which were meant to strike with, I think, more emotional impact. And save for the romantic cues, I didn't find Alex North's score particularly passionate and majestic. But these small complaints aside, ""Spartacus"" is an altogether strong epic and a very satisfactory motion picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not as good as I expected,"Overall, a pretty good film, I thought that Douglas had too many scenes of him just staring into the distance with that look of determination.  I get it, he's determined.  When I saw that Kubrick had directed this, I was a bit surprised at the final result.  There was nothing that amazing about the camera work here.  Some scenes, such as the large migration sequences amazed me not because of the cinematic power, but because there were a hell of a lot of extras.  The musical score was weak, the same 4 or five notes played over and over again.  I don't think xylophones have a place in that kind of score.  I know I seem to be tearing down the film.  I understand it is a classic and respect it for it's sheer magnitude but don't think I would ever watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
find something better to do,"If ""epic"" equates with ""tedium"" then this is indeed a classic of the genre. Every so often there's a shot that reminds you that Kubrick was involved - for example, a breathtaking long shot against an amazing sky in which Spartacus carries his wife on horseback from one side of the screen to the other across the ridge of a hill - but most of the time the entire enterprise is wallowing in an over-emotionalism that renders it mostly difficult and usually impossible for the audience - well, this audience, at least - to feel anything at all.The very guilty party is Kirk Douglas. There is a scene towards the end of the film when he is addressing his slave army, and the scene alternates with Olivier addressing Rome: the difference in quality is palpable. Poor old Douglas doesn't have a hope, he is so greatly outclassed. Now, I have seen Douglas be very good indeed: he is excellent in Wilder's ""Ace in the Hole"", to name just one of his movies, so I'm not an unqualified loather of his work. It's just that here, where he was apparently producer as well as star, we have a film that was made according to his taste, and his taste is lousy. There are good moments, but he's rarely in them: they feature Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov and Lom. The wonderful Jean Simmons copes pretty well with her poorly-written part. The early fight sequences in the gladiator training camp are good too, and promised better things to come, a promise sadly unfulfilled. As we discovered in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, too many battle scenes make for emotional numbness. Which brings me to Alex North's score, to which the same applies: there's just too much of it, and so much of it the same.The epic movie as a genre is, I'll admit, something I find very hard to take. It generally requires you to believe in unflawed heroism, which I find an uncomfortable, nigh-on dangerous idea. In the case of Spartacus, this is somewhat redeemed by the film's reaching for a tragic ending, and it is here that Douglas' performance begins, far too late, to turn into something to which one can relate. In his climactic fight with Curtis (a star actor strangely wasted in this film) the impossibility of Spartacus' position gives the actor something to chew on other than the scenery, and the outcome is the kind of emotion sadly lacking elsewhere. The same is I don't think quite true of the final scene between Douglas and Simmons: ""The Life of Brian"" has perhaps intervened too powerfully for such a scene ever to be truly poignant again. But Simmons and Douglas try very hard to make it happen. Unsurprisingly, it's when the intervention comes of Ustinov's all-too-human, hitherto comic character that the scene starts to mean something. If you can spare the hours of your life to watch this kind of thing, then fine. But having sat through it myself now, I honestly think you'd be better off walking in the park.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is how movies should be done!,"""Spartacus"" is a cinematic masterpiece that epitomizes what movies should be about, earning a solid 9 out of 10. The film is brimming with value and deep meaning, encapsulating themes of brotherhood, friendship, and love. The camaraderie among the slaves, led by the indomitable Spartacus, offers a poignant contrast to the ruthless, indifferent Romans. This stark dichotomy adds depth and tension, keeping viewers engrossed throughout the film.The narrative's exploration of human resilience and solidarity is both moving and inspiring. Spartacus' journey from a slave to a leader who unites a diverse group of individuals in the fight for freedom is portrayed with great emotional depth. The performances, particularly by Kirk Douglas as Spartacus, are powerful and captivating, drawing the audience into the historical epic with authenticity and passion.However, the film is not without its flaws. Some scenes, especially the love scenes between Spartacus and Varinia, felt a bit awkward and superficial, detracting slightly from the otherwise profound storytelling. These moments, though, are overshadowed by the film's overall brilliance. The passion and struggle of Spartacus are palpable, making his journey both compelling and inspiring. The film's grandeur, with its impressive battle scenes and sweeping landscapes, adds to its epic feel.The supporting cast, including Laurence Olivier and Peter Ustinov, also deliver stellar performances, enriching the narrative with their complex portrayals of Roman characters. The film's score and cinematography further enhance its dramatic impact, making it a visually and aurally stunning experience.""Spartacus"" is highly recommended for its emotional depth and powerful storytelling. It's a film that resonates on many levels, celebrating the human spirit in the face of oppression. Despite its minor flaws, it stands as a testament to epic filmmaking, a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a story of courage, unity, and love. This film truly exemplifies the power of cinema to convey profound messages and evoke strong emotions.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A monumental achievement!,"Stanley Kubrick had everything a filmmaker could have. For every genre he made a grandious movie. 2001: A space odyssey for sci-fi, Paths of Glory for war, barry lyndon for romance, a clockwork orange for dystopia, The Shining for horror, Dr Strangelove for politics and Spartacus for history. And within all these movies he made us laugh with his uncomparable humour. What I am trying to say is, there is no director superior to Dtanley Kubrick and there never will be.Spartacus tells the epic tale of the man who faught slavery during the roman empire and led an army of slaves against the legions of rome. Kubrick installed a love interest for Spartacus which gave the story another important point and leads to an emotional ending.The cinematography is breathtaking, Kubrick's Italy is beautiful and romantic but also brutal and barbarious.The actors, most important Kirk Douglas as Spartacus and Laurence Olivier as Crassus have their career's best performance in this picture. Every character has its place in this gigantous 3 hours movie and nothing felt too short or too long.Kubrick's storytelling and pacing is excellent. Comapre this to the often extremely hasty or extremely slow movies of today. This was masterclass craftmanship back then in 1960.This movie is still relevant, although slavery does not exist anymore in its original form. But take a look at the chip industry in China, the working conditions are comparable to those in slavery. And what about child labor in countries like Africa? Modern slavery is still a problem and Spartacus's message is still relevant today.Watch this monumental achievement if you are a fan of Stanley Kubrick and epic, gigantous movies like Ben Hur. This is definitely worth your time!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Extremely visually appealing, Stanley Kubrick's epic ""Spartacus"" is also a very human drama about a slave's struggle against the oppression of the imposing Roman empire","The fight for the rights of minorities has always been present on the cinema screens, but bringing this discussion to the 60's turned ""Spartacus"" into an epic, breaking with the stereotype of a gladiator movie. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, renowned for the films ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", for the first time, he ventures into an epic journey. Extremely visually appealing, Stanley Kubrick's epic ""Spartacus"" is also a very human drama about a slave's struggle against the oppression of the imposing Roman empire. Even without the usual artistic freedom that he would get a few years later, Kubrick manages to do an excellent job, building wonderful sequences and narrating an extremely captivating story with the usual competence.The good script by Dalton Trumbo (based on a book by Howard Fast) is full of extremely striking moments, such as the emotional phrase repeated by all the prisoners (""I am Spartacus!""), after the bloody battle between Romans and slaves. In addition, he owns a unique courage for his time, as we can see in the dialogue between Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Antoninus (Tony Curtis) about oysters and snails, clearly containing a homosexual subtext (remember, the film is from 1960). The game of interests for power is also very well portrayed in the feature, reinforcing the quality of Trumbo's script.Trumbo's screenplay, transmitting the power of awakening, is the rebellious form of classic cinema, capable of disseminating ideas, making the content even more valuable. As well as the technical part that takes praise, all this before the improvement of CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery) and the images generated on the computer, the performances stand out. Starting with Kirk Douglas, who embodies Spartacus, the slave turned leader of the rebellion, with great vigor. His firmness in leading thousands of people demonstrates his extinct leadership ability, and Douglas is competent in transmitting the necessary firmness to the character. The actor is also competent in subtle moments, like when he says that Antoninus has great value and that he has a thirst for knowledge (""An animal learns to fight, but to recite beautiful things... I am free and I cannot read, I want to learn everything. Know where the wind comes from...""). In Varinia's words, Spartacus was strong enough to be weak, showing feelings and showing himself to be quite human, as is clear when he has the opportunity to save his skin and that of his family, but instead sends the offer away. , extremely offended by the idea of leaving the other slaves behind. In addition, the romance between Spartacus and Varinia is only believable due to the couple's excellent chemistry. Spartacus's interest in Varinia was real (""Did they hurt her?""), and she feels it. Passion is born when he treats her like a person, a real woman, and not a sex slave who is there to serve him. This passion will be the trigger for Spartacus' revolt, who will start his fight against Rome the moment he sees Varinia leave the city gates. Jean Simmons is the ideal partner for Douglas, living Varinia with sensuality and sensitivity. Her greatest moments happen precisely when she acts with the slave, creating empathy with the spectator, as in her reunion with Spartacus after being taken to Rome, the moment when she tells him she is pregnant and the couple's sad farewell.Completing the cast, Charles McGraw is solid as Marcellus, the former gladiator who is now a trainer. Peter Ustinov is also great as the cunning slave agent Lentulus Batiatus. Notice how, when sensing that the place was boiling, he runs away without blinking, leaving everything behind, moments before the rebellion is consummated. Charles Laughton gives a great performance as Senator Gracchus, who makes it clear what is the only way to stay alive in the dirty universe of the Roman Senate (""In Rome, dignity shortens life more than disease""). And finally, Laurence Olivier creates an absolutely fearsome Marcus Crassus, suddenly switching his sense of humor, for example when he is with Varinia. His ruthlessness is evident when he finally comes to power. His thirst wasn't just to capture Spartacus, he wanted to ""kill the legend"". But his actions had the opposite effect. It is interesting to note how the cruel Crassus surrenders to the woman's power of seduction when he sees Varinia, taking her to live with him. As cruel as it may be, a man never resists female charms.""Spartacus"" cannot effectively be considered a Kubrickian film, in the broadest sense, that is, of being a work conceived, programmed and executed by the famous director. Indeed, Kubrick was hired by Kirk Douglas, in his capacity as executive producer, as filming had already begun (the salt mine sequence), under the direction of Anthony Mann, a director with whom Douglas would fall out, ending up the dismissal. And even then, relations between Kubrick, Trumbo and Douglas would not be the best. After the finished film, Douglas went so far as to say that he would never work with Kubrick again (which he did) and that he was sorry to have fired Mann. Still, Kubrick directs ""Spartacus"" with his usual firmness, working on the smallest details to create absolutely unforgettable scenes. Notice, for example, the stunning shot of the slaves walking, now free, filmed from the top of a hill, or the curious point of view of Spartacus as he waits anxiously to fight in the arena, looking through the gap in the wood. Kubrick still commands two absolutely sensational sequences. The first of them is the gladiators' rebellion and the consequent escape from the place where they were trained, filmed with great vigor and realism.Even more impressive is the spectacular final battle sequence, with the orchestrated movements of more than eight thousand extras, extremely agile camera movements and a breakneck pace completely consistent with the moment, making the scene very realistic. An example of great direction. This sequence highlights the excellent sound work that works in small details, such as the noise of swords, and on a large scale, through the screams of the crowd. The beautiful and sad final scene moves, when Spartacus, on the verge of death, meets his son, who will live free as he dreamed. The sad ending sums up the main thread of the plot well. A man's struggle to be free, live normally and have a family. It is exactly by portraying this battle focusing on the drama of one man that ""Spartacus"" becomes very human. The spectator identifies with the drama he sees on the screen, which would not happen if he only followed thousands of men fighting in an open field, without knowing the motivations of each one. The reasons for the conflict are clear and the spectator knows what is at stake.The political interest of ""Spartacus"" is based on its revolutionary base, formulated in its own historical structure - the confrontation of two totally incompatible and incommunicable mentalities: that of the slaves, which is being structured between the coordinates of revenge and freedom, with problems of order and organization, and with a clear vision of the danger of the depoliticization of the subversive movement, and that of the patricians, senators and Roman military, incapable of evaluating the uprising of the slaves as more than madness or despair. For the Romans, their social order is ""the"" social order; for them no other advanced social or political form is possible. The confrontation of these two mentalities gives the film a new dramatism - thematic-ideological -, which compensates, or at least reduces, the prevailing sentimentality in several scenes.Considered a minor work by Kubrick and an epic of moderate dimensions compared to the Hollywood standard of the 1950s, in which the super spectacles by Cecil B. De Mille and William Wyler dominated, throughout its extraordinary 183 minutes. One recognizes Kubrick's intelligent framing, lack of shame in showing violent scenes and lack of interest in building a genre film as we know it. It is even said that the filmmaker wanted to make an epic without the film looking like one. Perhaps this intent was not fully achieved, but it is correct to say that even though the genesis of ""Spartacus"" had ""Ben-Hur"" as its main reference, the two feature films are quite different.""Spartacus"" is not the great work of Stanley Kubrick's life, who would later make at least two masterpieces in the history of cinema, as in ""2001"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". But that doesn't stop it from being a great film, beautifully photographed, with a passionate and engaging story and, for a change, extremely well directed. Still featuring excellent performances, the feature ensures fun and proves that great productions can indeed offer good entertainment, without offending the viewer's intelligence.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spartacus: 8.3/10,"""Spartacus"" was one of the many big Hollywood historical epics to come out of the 50s and 60s, and though Kubrick disowns it, I found it to be very enjoyable.It succeeds the most on 2 levels. One: spectacle. Its sets are grand and very good looking, and it also has an awesome soundtrack. These make ""Spartacus"" a very welcome surprise to the eyes and ears.Second: it's drama. ""Spartacus"" is pretty dramatic with its well-written characters that the film intellectually explores, making it all the more entertaining and enjoyable.But that's not to say ""Spartacus"" is perfect. The acting, besides a few of the players (Ustinov, Douglas, and Olivier) was just good half of the time, and less than good the other. Also, several sequences seemed pretty drawn out, maybe the reason being an excuse for more spectacle.One more thing: this is all just my opinion, and it's completely fine if you disagree. 8.3/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overkill,"""Spartacus"" is an overrated spectacle whose parts (and there are many good ones) are better than its whole.It starts out well with Douglas becoming a gladiator and learning the ins and outs of the business.  But after the revolt, all the slave scenes become unbearably tedious.The Romans steal the movie.  The politics, the backstabbing, the jockeying. The Romans also are better actors, and their scenes are done with a wry humor.  In one scene with Peter Ustinov's and Charles Laughton's characters are sharing a meal, and each of the actors desperately trying to outact each other -- and better acting you're rarely likely to see as the old ham and the up and coming ham both try to steal the scene.Olivier's Crassus is also notable.  In fact, some of the slave scenes are so cloying and tiresome one winds up rooting for the Romans.  The slaves scenes are enlivened occasionally by the arrival of Herbert Lom (Inspector Dreyfus).  So, many good scenes (especially the climactic battle), many good performances, some fine writing here and there, but ultimately boring with the people who should be most interesting and sympathetic, the revolting slaves who are willing to die for the cause of freedom.",,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie which could need an update,"Spartacus is a movie with a good and interesting story. I think the main theme in the movie is the ""fight for freedom"". Spartacus was born as a slave, but he dreams about being free.It is impressive with all the soldiers in this movie, it is before the time of computer technology, and the battles seem real.A problem with the movie is that some of the scenes are made in a studio, and it looks very fake. I don't understand why they have made these outdoor scenes inside a studio. Also other scenes in this movie look very fake, and I think that Spartacus loses one rating here.The overall impression is 7/10 - I think it would get 8/10 or maybe even 9/10 if Hollywood made a new updated version of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inconsistently paced epic,"""Spartacus"" has many scenes of note, but it unevenly paced. The first segment of the film shows Sparatcus' life as a slave. This part is engaging as we see the animosities that develop between Spartacus and the slave-masters and the camaraderie that develops between the slaves. The second part of the film, showing the aftermath of slave revolt, starts with a number of tedious scenes as the slaves slowly formulate their plans. Occasionally Herbert Lom's character breaks up the tedium in the slave camp with his dealings with Spartacus, but usually seeing the politics and machinations on the Roman side was more interesting. All of this culminates in a well-paced and well-shot final conflict followed by a strong ending.Kirk Douglas is solid as Spartacus, who turns from difficult slave to revolt leader with conviction. Jean Simmons is also excellent and strong as the female lead, Varinia. Peter Ustinov is notable as the somewhat timid yet resourceful slave trader. Charles Laughton is perfect as the devious Gracchus and Laurence Olivier gives an intricate and compelling performance as Crassus.""Spartacus"" has a number of memorable scenes as performances, but is inconsistently paced and contains a number of tedious scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Epic Masterpiece,"Stanley Kubrick has given us many memorable films, but this is my personal favorite.  It is hard to imagine that he was not even nominated for best director in 1960.  I suppose his final satisfaction must have come in the endurance of this film's popularity after all the other nominees faded into obscurity.'Spartacus' is one of the great Hollywood epics and Kirk Douglas' defining role.  It is a brilliantly written screenplay that combines the struggle for freedom from oppression with a compelling love story in a setting that accurately depicts the majesty as well as the corruption of the Roman Empire.  The scenes depicting the political maneuvering of the Senate were priceless.Kubrick's work was nothing short of brilliant.  His attention to the details of the period was wonderful.  The orchestration of tens of thousands of extras in the battle scenes was phenomenal.  His presentation of the love scenes between Varinia and Spartacus were sensitive and compelling.  I was most impressed with his treatment of the slave army.  He put a human face on the slaves by showing mothers with their children and scenes of Spartacus walking among the people.  This completely wins the affections of the viewer.  His pacing was perfect and despite the film's length at over three hours, it did not seem to drag since there was always something fascinating on the screen.Kirk Douglas gave a powerful performance and created a character that was bigger than life.  He was strong and inspirational while simultaneously being gentle and kind.  Laurence Olivier gave a riveting performance Crassus.  He was cunning, imperious, consumed by ambition and utterly heartless.  It is hard to imagine a more nefarious bad guy.Jean Simmons has had an impressive acting career that has spanned more than 50 years.  She is both a great beauty and an enchanting actress.  She gave Varinia dignity, strength of character and a quiet seductiveness that played well off the power exuded from Douglas.  Their screen chemistry was both passionate and touching.Rounding out a great cast were Peter Ustinov who was terrific as the sniveling and cowardly Batiatius always conniving to profit from someone else's misfortunes, and Charles Laughton as the astute and duplicitous Gracchus, manipulating the Roman senate to his best advantage.This is among the best epics ever made and certainly among the top three films about the Roman Empire.  I rated it a 10/10.  This film should be on every film buff's list of required viewing and is highly recommended for its moving story to anyone who hasn't seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good for a Hollywood Film; Ehh for a Kubrick Film,"Far, FAR better than ""Ben-Hur,"" which came out the year before, ""Spartacus"" still doesn't quite shake some of the same epic movie shackles that made William Wyler's film such a dismal bore. The point of this film is the sets and costumes; the studios denied Kubrick the freedom to direct this movie in his instantly recognizable style, so while it's certainly solidly enough crafted and easy to sit through, it also feels anonymous, which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't know that someone as distinctly NON-anonymous as Kubrick helmed it.Can you imagine how much better ""Spartacus"" would have been if Kubrick had been able to direct it in the same style as that other piece of eye candy he created, ""Barry Lyndon?"" Best not to think about such things that can never be.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stanthony Mannbrick,"SPARTACUS is a solidly produced historical epic of the time, but unlike EL CID, BEN HUR, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, or THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, it doesn't hold up as well under scrutiny. This may owe more to a poor script than Stanley Kubrick, who stepped in for original director Anthony Mann during the production due to a fight with Kirk Douglas. Had it been the other way around with Mann been kept on and Douglas fired, I doubt this CLEOPATRA-style grandiose-yet-awkward film would have suffered. Actually it might have been much better and more cohesive as too much feels as though the director lacked interest and most of the best scenes are more Mann-ish than Kubick-esquire.The film starts off traditionally enough – Spartacus is raised in the slave pits and makes a seamless transition to gladiator. Somewhere along the line he manages to figure out a sense of unbreakable moral virtue and never strays from it the rest of the film, thus making his character 1-dimensional and unfortunately pretty boring. Despite all this, the film is fine up until the standout slave break-out scene where Spartacus begins his rebellion and our plot lines diverge. The film then cuts back and forth from following Spartacus's army to the political rivalry between Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton as Roman senators looking to profit from the whole mess. It turns out that these extremely charismatic villains are much more interesting to watch than bland Kirk Douglas, who is completely overshadowed with his ""subdued Heston"" performance and Christ-like central character.The film does highly benefit from many colorful supporting characters and great performances. Some highlights include: Peter Ustinov as a stressed-out slave trader, Woody Strode as a stoic gladiator who snaps, Herbert Lom as a Phoenician pirate (!), and Charles McGraw as a hateful veteran gladiator/instructor. John Ireland and Tony Curtis don't get to do much as Spartacus's right and left hand, though Curtis has a disturbing yet slightly amusing scene where Olivier (extremely well-dubbed by Anthony Hopkins for the reissue) attempts to seduce him. Jean Simmons (no, not one from ""KISS"") is quite restrained and bland as Douglas's love interest, though she isn't really given much to do either.Usually epics like this are redeemed by massive battle scenes but (despite some heavy gore for the time) the big show-stopping fight is not the best of the genre, owing some to Alex North's pedestrian score and Kubrick's apparent disinterest. All throughout you'll be wondering if Kubrick really had much input on this movie at all as it contains almost none of the touches he brought to his films before or after this one. Add to that the fact that this ""true story"" really oversimplifies, skimps, and downright lies in its complete dearth of historical accuracy, this film may actually make you dumber having watched it. SPARTACUS is just a big disappointment all-round, despite some great performances and costuming.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I do know that, as long as we live, we must remain true to ourselves.""","SPARTACUS is an adventurous drama in which an idea about freedom has resisted to strength of a glorious Roman Empire. A bloody and romantic tragedy is filled with historical inaccuracies.A proud and gifted man named Spartacus, is so uncooperative in his servitude that he is sentenced to fight as a gladiator. He was transferred to a school for gladiators, led by a sly Roman businessman. Spartacus, despite harassment at school, forms a quiet relationship with a serving woman. A Roman senator, who aims to become dictator of Rome, has visited the businessman and his school. Two women from his entourage want to enjoy the fights to the death. Spartacus is one of the selected gladiators. This fight will change awareness among slaves...The main protagonist is a kind of ""trigger"" , who has changed the political situation in Rome. An arrogant and uneducated slave has risen from the bottom through an immortal idea of freedom. Mr. Kubrick has very meticulously processed topics related to leadership, true love, politicking and dictatorship. He has, regardless of the historical inaccuracies, skilfully pointed out a ruin of the great empire. The ideas of eternity can be interpreted as a kind of paradox or fear. Unlike other epic films from that time, Christian motifs were replaced with determination and desire for freedom. Dealing with ""tricky"" issues is important in this film. Mr. Kubrick, in a very clear way, shows scenes of sexual desire, homosexuality, bisexuality, and even torture through scenes of crucifixion.Scenery is impressive, especially in the final battle. Soundtrack is great. Characterization is reflected in a sort of rivalry. Rivalry in love and politics.Kirk Douglas as Spartacus has offered a good performance. The tension in his face is a reflection of seriousness of his character. He is not overly romantic, but he has a remarkable sense of leadership and fellowship. Jean Simmons as Varinia is an attractive slave and a very strong woman, who shows her pride, love and character in almost every scene. Laurence Olivier as Crassus is the main antagonist and a very complex character. He is actually an unfortunate character, because he can not feel the love and the freedom.There is always interesting and entertaining Charles Laughton as Gracchus. Peter Ustinov, in my view, did not deserve an Oscar for the role of a wily and manipulative Batiatus. Tony Curtis as Antoninus is a bit theatrical and unconvincing as an artist among the gladiators.This is an exciting epic adventure in combination with the political drama.

Gladiator as realistic individual,"What a difference a script can make!!  This past Sunday, March 25, 2001, a ""historical"" movie, GLADIATOR, won an important award, the Oscar for Best Picture.  Its credentials and appeal are in striking contrast to the 1960 epic SPARTACUS.   That slave and gladiator and human being (played by Kirk Douglas) stands head and shoulders above the slave and gladiator and human being, Maximus (played by Oscar-winning Russell Crowe).  The story and underlying ideas that send the characters to their comparable deaths are of considerable impact on their audiences.  The 2000 script by co-producer David Franzoni and others did not win in the category for Best Screenplay (Original) because of any number of plot discrepancies and overall ""leaps."" The 1960 script, on the other hand, utilizing a powerful historically based novel, does convey more of the reality of slavery's cruelty and oppression. Whereas Russell Crowe's portrayal comes across as a blend of ""Terminator"" and ""Rambo,"" the Kirk Douglas fight scenes retain an urgent, fearful, and yet human effort to stay alive one more day.  A contrast of the villains in the two screenplays (Commodus versus Crassus) as well as other minor characters (e.g. Lucilla versus Varinia, Quintus versus Antoninus) shows again and again that the earlier slave/gladiator epic went for message and subtlety while the 2000 slave/gladiator ""vehicle"" goes for enormous effect and visceral fast moves.  I find the new GLADIATOR to be visually impressive and interesting for its use of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) as a conflicted world leader.  The story of the downtrodden and their champion that is SPARTACUS is going to last and hold up far better to future generations, however.  The DVD extras that include commentary by Director Ridley Scott and others may hold some answers to the plot ""flaws"" of the new movie but the reverent restoration done a few years ago on the old movie improved its story's already evident strengths and daring characterizations.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Benchmark historical epic,"Kubrick's retelling of a Roman slave revolt remains fresh and exciting over fifty years since it was first released. Kirk Douglas, in one of his most iconic turns, plays the titular role as a low-born but noble hero and the opening sequences of gladiatorial combat are excellent - truly this was the GLADIATOR of its day (and then some).Once the revolt comes about the film veers into the murky waters of politics, detailing the power-hungry machinations of Crassus (a sinister Laurence Olivier) and his enemy Gracchus (Charles Laughton, clearly having a ball as the corpulent senator). The actual front-line battles between slave and Roman armies are mostly kept off-screen, at least until the climatic set-piece which is tremendously well executed (I'd take the burning logs over any of Michael Bay's empty explosions).Unfortunately, the film is undoubtedly overlong, with far too many sentimental/repetitive romantic interludes with love interest Jean Simmonds. Kubrick's talent as director is sometimes wasted in the many exposition scenes which are no better than those in your average peplum. Think of this as a film with a great opening, great climax and middling mid section and you'll be right. Watch out for memorable turns from Woody Strode (compelling), Herbert Lom (slimy), John Ireland (tough), Tony Curtis (fey) and Peter Ustinov (hilarious).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the greatest films of all time,"Kirk Douglas is perfect in the lead role delivering an unforgettable performance as the heroic lead. He heads a faultless star studded cast with sublime performances too from Tony Curtis as Antoninus and Jean Simmons as Virinia. Laurence Olivier is a commanding presence as Crassus. Peter Ustinov rightly won the best supporting actor Oscar for his performance of the wily slave owning Batiatus, and Charles Laughton's performance as the wise senator Gracchus would have been equally deserving. They share a fabulous scene together in which Gracchus offers Batiatus a bribe which showcases both two great actors on fine form and the magnificent Dalton Trumbo screenplay. That golden screenplay is exhibited in so many scenes throughout the film. A personal favourite is Spartacus answering ""No more than I was to be born"" to Antoninus' question of ""Are you afraid to die Spartacus?"". I first saw this film some 40 years ago as a child. It was inspiring then and remains so now.

A sharply made biography! A sweeping epic of its time. Gladiator wayyyyy before Gladiator!,"Its too bad Stanley Kubrick wanted no association with this movie. Its dynamite. Granted when you read about all the turmoil behind the scenes of the filming of Spartacus and granted there were ALOT of problems its hard to see it in such a negative light because of how well made it turned out to be. Honestly with names like Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, Tony Curtis, Jean Simmonds and Kubrick himself and not to mention for a brief time even Anthony Mann attached its hard not to hit a home run.The story presented is about Spartacus who was taken from his parents at a young age and sold into slavery in the salt mines of Ancient Rome. One day he finds himself suddenly sold to the Roman businessman Batiatus due to his good muscle tone and sent to train to become a gladiator. During his time there he meets Varinia, one of many slave girls who also serve under Batiatus and they end up falling in love and she bears him a son, one that he vows will never grow up into slavery like himself. A tragedy that ensues also introduces Spartacus to the cruel Roman leader Crassus. Events from this point on spur Spartacus to convince his fellow men that they can travel countryside freeing slaves and recruiting them to their revolution making them believe that they outnumber the Romans 5 to 1 and do the unthinkable and conquer the Roman Empire. This of course leads Crassus and the Empire itself to take action and that brings about some truly spectacular battle scenes. Really well done and full of Kubrick's signature visual style.On top of the lavishly sculpted battle scenes, the other things that stand out to me are the music which chime in well with the scenes involving emotion and tension and the acting. Every big name actor involved delivers here especially Kirk Douglas, what a wonderful choice! Although alot of the issues underlying revolve around him he really came out swinging for this portrayal. Olivier shines as usual, cruel and malicious as Crassus. The set decoration and locations are also very good and deserve mention. It certainly is different watching this Kubrick film compared to the ones I know him for the most but his touches are all over this, quiet atmospheric impactful scenes of built up tension and anticipation are certainly here. Though ignored due to the lack of control he was given its one of the hardest to ignore films in his repertoire. Its a grand epic of a truly fascinating tragic hero. A compelling watch, long but worth the effort.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I don't like Braveheart much either.,"I don't want to come across as a philistine, but Spartacus doesn't half go on a bit and is one hell of a downer. I know that the film is intended to make the viewer feel inspired by the indomitable spirit of man in the face of terrible persecution and oppression, but after three hours of such, I found myself struggling to care. The dull political machinations of the Roman senate and the aimless wandering of the slave army do little to help matters; I've never been so grateful for an intermission (the DVD retains the original mid-movie break, during which I splashed my face with cold water to wake myself up).It all starts off well enough, with slave Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) sent to gladiator training camp, where he gets a crash course in survival before escaping his confines to lead others in revolt. But then it really starts to go pear-shaped, star Douglas doing his utmost to outdo Heston in the historical epic stakes by spouting over-sentimental, moralistic dross about the importance of freedom in countless maudlin scenes that virtually deify his character—after which he lets down his thousands of followers by leading them into battle against the Romans like lambs to the slaughter.The best thing about Spartacus is its impressive cast, which not only includes heavyweight performers like Olivier, Laughton and Curtis, but also includes tens of thousands of nameless extras, allowing for some wonderful vistas of the Italian countryside swarming with slaves, and a brilliantly staged (and brutal) battle scene, proving that, as clever as CGI is these days, nothing looks better than the real thing.

"""Live Free or Die""","A Film Directed by a young Stanley Kubrick that is Unlike the Kubrick We Know and Love.

This movie deserves to be #1 on any list!,"What surprised me was to see this movie #160 on this list... What a shame!!! The taste of public is really rotten to the core! When I compare old Hollywood movies and first of all, Spartacus, with contemporary remakes or new movies about ancient world I feel like I compare pure 100% gold with a fake one where is nothing but color left but essential qualities of good old movies which made them masterpieces are not there... What makes such movies like Spartacus true masterpieces is a combination of everlasting ideals, brilliant performance, personalities of actors, and a strong feeling of LIVING AMONG the characters at the same time when they lived... The idea of slavery and freedom is at the core of this movie and is present in almost every scene and every dialog. These two phenomena do not belong to our past: even in economical sense slavery is still a reality in some countries. And in much wider sense slavery is still a problem among humans: whether it a straightforward behavior of a superior suggesting a complete power over the subordinate, or a mental slavery, a submission to some ideas, noble or false and anti-human... Each word of each character in this movie carries a load which contributes to a powerful effect it produces on an attentive viewer. And if each word is uttered in such a brilliant way by Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, and other great masters against the perfectly designed background, all of it makes this movie an indelible experience... I agree with others who mentioned that K. Douglas deserves an Oscar for his stellar performance. It is, however, neither first nor the last time when injustice has been committed in this world...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Entertaining Spectacle That Also Has Some Substance,"The main reason to watch the epic ""Spartacus"" is probably for its sheer entertainment value, since it offers interesting characters, a great deal of action, and numerous lavish settings and sequences. But it also has some substance as well, even if it is not as noticeable as the rest. Without knowing who the director was, it might come as a small surprise to know that Stanley Kubrick directed it, but then again, his craftsmanship and distinctive style are quite apparent at times.The story certainly lends itself readily to cinema, and with all the battles, confrontations, and tumultuous developments, it's little wonder that they decided to film it as an epic. It makes for an interesting contrast with the movies on which Kubrick put his own stamp, but then again there are times when the subtleties in some of the characters, and some of the less-obvious possibilities in some of the sequences and settings, add some depth. It makes the movie worth re-watching to catch some of the detail, since the action and spectacle tend to dominate your attention at first.The cast likewise is an interesting combination of talent, and most of them work quite well in defining their characters. Kirk Douglas makes a very suitable movie version of Spartacus, and several of the other cast members get the chance to stand out as well. In particular, Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton both steal more than their share of scenes.It's very easy to understand why a director of Kubrick's stature would have been disappointed not to have complete control over a project like this, and given the opportunity he could surely have produced a different version of ""Spartacus"" that would have been worthwhile in its own way. Alternatively, they could have filmed a more strictly historical version of events. But the ""Spartacus"" that they did create is more than worthwhile, as an interesting and often enthralling drama with many memorable sequences, and one that also contains some interesting observations on its subjects and themes.",,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly excellent.,"Surprisingly, because  *Spartacus*  belongs to that awful genre of the sword-and-sandal epic.  (Lately -- and woefully -- revived by that excruciating  *Gladiator*.)  Surprisingly, because the film was born of many fathers  (Dalton Trumbo as screenwriter, Anthony Mann as original director, Stanley Kubrick as replacement about half-way through the production, and Kirk Douglas basically making all of the creative decisions).  In other words, *Spartacus*  should have been an expensive mess.But, while imperfect, it's a generally glorious epic, the  ""thinking man's epic""  so many strived for during the Fifties and Sixties.  Most of those attempts failed miserably, but this one worked out.  Who really knows why. Perhaps it's because this story takes place in Republican Rome, so there are none of those wet-blanket, moon-faced Christians lurking about yet.  Or maybe it's because the movie avoids being a tensionless biopic, and instead focuses on the slave rebellion -- which is clearly enough material for a 3+ hour movie, anyway.  Perhaps it's the performances, all of them very good, with Peter Ustinov managing to outdo everybody as a nouveau riche dean of a gladiatorial school.  In fact, the movie could've used more of Ustinov:  the character is such a true-to-life conception that the actor manages to make mincemeat out of Laurence Olivier's bad guy, and even puts Charles Laughton's pompous Senator in the shade  (no easy feat, that).  Perhaps it's even that infamous scene between Olivier and Tony Curtis.  I still aver that watching Tony Curtis bathe and oil a naked Olivier remains one of the most outrageous things you'll ever see in cinema.  And that's followed by Olivier demanding of Curtis that the latter should  ""love Rome as a mother.  You must serve her!""  (""Rome""  being Olivier's Crassus, of course.)  Perhaps the greatest scene in the movie is the impromptu gladiatorial match between Douglas'  Spartacus and another gladiator played by the ultra-dignified African-American actor Woody Strode.  Exciting in and of itself, the scene then becomes poignant social commentary, as Strode hurls his trident at his oppressors up in their luxury box -- food for thought for an audience in the midst of the Civil Rights struggle.  And it should be mentioned that the love story between Douglas and Jean Simmons as the slave girl from Britannia is performed with unusual sensitivity, backed up by a lovely score.The  ""Kubrick touch""  in all of this is rather hard to discern, except perhaps in the Olivier/Curtis scene and in certain points of visual composition.  Kubrick's ready-steady, static camera style gets the most out of the grand, climactic battle near the end of the picture.  But Kubrick-worshipers would do well to remember that about half of this movie belongs to Anthony Mann, and in any case, ALL of it belongs to Kirk Douglas. A purely Kubrick film would doubtless have been worse.  On the other hand, I also suspect that the marvelously downbeat finale would not have existed without the dour Kubrick's insistence.  *Spartacus*  is probably the only sword-and-sandal epic without the mushy Christian uplift, the  ""spiritual happy ending"", despite the overt Christian symbolism in the final shots. Kubrick's meanness proves to be a bracing tonic in this otherwise sappy genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kubrick can turn anything into a masterpiece.,"Considering what little creative freedom Stanley Kubrick had in the making of this film, he sure did make it into a very memorable film. Sure there are certain scenes were I can say ""that is definitely not a Kubrick scene"", but at other times one can say ""oh yes, that's a definitely Kubrick scene"". it amused me how kirk Dougles (as Spartacus)first the first director and then hired Kubrick, thinking he could manipulate him. Oh, no, if anything Kubrick manipulated him. it is as Dougles said after the release of this film ""Kubrick is a talented sh@t!"", which in it's own way is a way of saying, ""he pisses me off, but he's a damned good director"". And I love seeing what Kubrick can do to a film, on the verge of failing.What more can I say, the cast is excellent. the movie is long, very long! But it serves it's cause. Such an epic can't be told in a mere two hours. And the ending is some of the greatest in all the history of Hollywood epics.

Iconic masterpiece,"It's 1st century BC. Rome is corrupt and functions by slavery. Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is forced to be a gladiator in a school run by Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov). He falls for a slave named Varinia (Jean Simmons). He leads a revolt against his Roman masters as more slaves join. Educated slave Antoninus (Tony Curtis) joins them. They are opposed by Roman armies and Senator Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier).Stanley Kubrick created a masterpiece. It's not only a great movie but it's influential. It's iconic. The acting power is off the charts. The legendary names would easily make it to the pantheon of acting. The scale of production is massive. It's grand in the old Hollywood sense. It fits its ambition. The story is about a gladiator revolt that turn into a slave revolt that turn into an all out war. It has some great iconic movie scenes. When the slaves each claim the name Spartacus, this becomes more than a simply great movie. It is movie history. It is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic cinema at its finest,"Stanley Kubrick essentially disowned this movie, saying it was not really his work.  It's true that Anthony Mann directed the first half, and the movie on the whole lacks trademark touches of Kubrick, who was basically a director for hire.  There's a reason you don't find this in his box sets.Having said all that, this is a movie anyone should be THRILLED to have on his resume.  It's rare you find something that shoots so high and makes a bullseye.  Certain things, such as the extremely long time at the beginning we simply watch a blank screen while music plays, would have come across as pretentious and irritating in most anything else, yet it's okay here because this movie doesn't just act like it's a larger than life masterpiece, it delivers the goods!  The sets and location shooting are breathtaking at many times; the sight of the hundreds of slaves marching into battle made my jaw drop.  And there's plenty of substance beneath the style; the story line is gripping and goes far beyond that of many similar movies in terms of complexity.  As far as the performances, they are uniformly great.  Kirk Douglas, a stellar leading man, suits the title role perfectly, Laurence Olivier is amazingly detestable as the villain, and the supporting cast, which includes Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis, and Charles Laughton, is highlighted by Peter Ustinov's justly Oscar winning performance.  Despite a 3 hours+ running time, Spartacus is never once boring, and despite being a rabble rousing film about a hero, is never once predictable or cliche.  The famous ""I'm Spartacus"" scene towards the end has been parodied many times, and it's easy to see why it made such a huge impression on filmgoers.  Works like this are among the best examples of ""movie magic"" and it should be required viewing for any film school student!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spartacus Review,"When you watch Spartacus with all actors and actress within, you feel not only they successfully convey the true story but you live within the sequence itself.The first impression you think it's from this Millennium but actually it's 45 years ago !The Cinematic effect and the visual effect at that time wasn't supported with advanced technology, and I think because the actors and actress are talented,even the director and the crew are doing the best work to succeed the movie.All efforts from Actors and Actress creating interactive live event, there's originality in this Film and the way the director trying to convey his vision with the reality combined altogether harmoniously !The characteristic of Spartacus defined with integrity, he is a leader a lover and a freeman, Mr. Douglas still have that impression in his daily life, also, the other actors which obviously dominating the movie, each of them doing impressive role.Spartacus Film, is one of the best ever movie released in 60's and compete Millennium era.We send our love to all actors and actress and the crew.by Aras",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wow!,"A slave/gladiator starts a revolt against Rome and incredible odds.  Watch the restored version!This movie was astonishing.  The score was excellent, as were the cinematography and acting.  I wasn't sure what to expect of John Dall and John Gavin but I was pleasantly surprised by all.  Laughton and Ustinov are very good and Olivier's Crassus drips with evil.The drama is so compelling  - you empathize with the characters so much!  I cried during the ""I am Spartacus"" scene.  And at times, Tony Curtis seems like this little boy who needs to be loved and wants so badly to help Spartacus that you just can't help but feel for him.  And I don't blame him for running away from his master.  If Olivier's Crassus came on to me, and told me to serve Rome (an analogy for himself?), I'd flee too.The supporting actors are great too.  Charles McGraw was very hatable, and the Roman ""nymphs"" (Nina Foch and Joanna Barnes) are such a fine example of the vain, idle rich.Although this isn't the most Kubrick-ian of Kubrick's films, probably due to Kirk Douglas' and Anthony Mann's influences, it is one of the best historical epics ever, and is a total treat to watch!",,Anonymous,Biography

This film like ""Gandhi"" wrenches your heart because of the story, not the filmmaking.

"Epic True Story, Excellent Film","This is for once a well made, reasonably accurate film made about a true story.
With True Stories what usually happens when a film is made about them, is either they look good but get panned for not being accurate and taking liberties with real events. Or they are poor but accurate, only on odd occasions do we get true stories and great films in the same sentence, this is one of them.Usually in a true story we know all the details, but by sticking to them it can create a dull movie, The good thing about this story is we don't know all the details, just the main events so Hollywood can do what it does best and fill in the details with drama, and on this occasion it does it very well.Stanley Kubrick is a renowned director, and this proves why, the screenplay by Dalton Trumbo is excellent, the photography also excellent. Kirk Douglas is brilliant as the star, with Laurence Olivier proving what everyone says about his acting in a movie, Jean Simmons is the beauty, and what a beauty. When you hear about who are the greatest beauties in movies, her name seldom comes up ? Marilyn Monroe, Joan Collins, Elizabeth Taylor, Raquel Welch, Vivien Leigh, Hedy Lamarr, Rita Hayworth etc. but Jean Simmons ? To me she is up there, one of the most beautiful and sexy of all time, and also a very good actor, and you can see why I think that with this film. The supporting cast are also excellent, Peter Ustinov easily being next best and almost steals it from Kirk and Larry, Charles Laughton, John Ireland, Woody Strode, Herbert Lom, and Charles McGraw are all very good, John Gavin is a bit wooden and unusually Tony Curtis plays it down, possibly under orders not to distract attention from the other stars, but apart from those 2 all the rest are on form.And that is why it makes a great film, because all (or most) are on the same song sheet, and everything comes together, usually the mark of a great director.With Epic films which last over 3 hours or more they can become a bit boring, but this does not, even after watching it about once a year over the last 40 years when I know the story like the back of my hand, it still is not boring.I have noticed that in films with a good guy and a bad guy, if the bad guy is a great actor it makes for a better film, and this has one of the very best as a the bad guy, also it has one of the saddest endings, other than the usual, these are 2 of the points that made it one of the very best.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Powerful Indictment of Statist Tyranny; Memorable and Vivid,"This is a large-scale movie with fairly good acting, splendid production values and an intelligent script that tends toward socialism and has a few problems at the opening scenes that mitigated its otherwise relentless power Apart from these two problems, it is a film that can be watched many times, it has fine dialogue and is an interesting fictionalized biography throughout. Stanley Kurbrick's direction is generally good, and his habit of mounting historically-accurate sets such as the Roman Senate chamber, Crassus's house, the gladiatorial school of Lentulus Batiatus etc. is a great asset i this case. I found the experience of the film to be quite realistic, despite the necessary telescoping of characters and the introduction of allegorical types. The period of the historical adventure is the youth of Julius Caesar, when Rome was dominated by the party of Marcus Crassus, the mine-owning would-be dictator of Rome; his political opponent in the narrative is the populist Gracchus, a telescoping of the earlier Gracchi brothers who had been executed for trying to end the oligarchy of Rome legally. The other element in the film other than a huge revolt of the slaves of the late Republic, already become totalitarian, is the presence of the Cilician pirate fleets as a thorn in the Republic's leaders' sides. Spartacus, a Thracian, leads the revolt against the empire after escaping with his fellow slaves of the arena from the gladiator school in Capua where they had been being trained; the catalyst for the revolution is a double fight to the death, something they had been promised would not happen to them, staged to please Crassus and his protégé and their two women. Gathering slaves as he goes, Spartacus swiftly hones a gladiator-trained army on the slopes of volcanic Mt. Vesuvius. He takes several cities including the port of Brundusium, but he cannot lay siege to Rome, lacking the machineries to do so; and when he reaches the sea, the pirates with whom he had dealt to buy ships with looted money so he might disperse his men back to their homes have been defeated...there will be no fleet to meet them. The pirate factor offers Spartacus and his leaders escape; Spartacus tells him to go away. Then he leads his men in battle one last time against the army of Crassus. But Lucullus returns from the pirate wars and the slave army is trapped between several forces. They fight bravely but lose a disastrous final battle--and Crassus then offers many men escape from crucifixion if they will give up their leader. Thousands rise up, crying, ""I am Spartacus!"" as their answer. Crassus recognizes the leader from his prior appearance in the arena and forces him to fight a final duel to the death with his protégé, Antoninus. He kills him, and Antoninus says, ""I love you Spartacus--as the father I never had."" ""I love you,"" Spartacus tells him, ""as the son I will never see."" But he does see his son; his wife and Batiatus find him on a cross as they flee Rome, and show him the son who will live free. The music by Alex North is superb, and the cinematography by Russell Metty is very fine. Costumes were created by Bill T, Valles and William Ware Theiss of ""Star Trek"" fame. Alexander Golitzen did the beautiful production design. The script was adapted by Dalton Trumbo from Howard Fast's rather short novel. Among the actors in Kirk Douglas's mammoth production, accolades should have gone to Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton as the marvelous antagonists in Rome's political death throes as a Republic. Instead a good performance by Peter Ustinov was somehow cited. This is not really an actor's movie, however; since it is played mostly on an adventure level so that those who come off best have medium-sized parts or smaller--such as Charles McGraw as Marcellus the sadistic gladiator-master, Herbert Lom as the Cilician ship-factor, John Gavin as the young Caesar, Joanna Barnes and Nina Foch as the two patrician women, John Dall as Crassus' second, and John Ireland as Crixus, Spartacus's second...Jean Simmons is quite good as Varinia, Spartacus's slave wife; Tony Curtis gives an intelligent try as Antoninus, except for his Brooklyn accent. As Spartacus, Kirk Douglas does very good work except for the two set speeches which his lack of classical training defeats. Ignoring the altruistic gesture that mars the film's grim opening, this is a film being better and better appreciated with time both by critics and by film-goers. And deservedly so in my view.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good entertainment,"Due to the fact that the great director himself didn't write it, many film fans don't consider Spartacus to be a part of Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre that is on par with the many great classics that he has given to cinema. While it is true that Spartacus isn't as good as films such as A Clockwork Orange or Dr Strangelove, it's still a fine piece of cinema and it also represents one of the better epics to come out of Hollywood, and despite the fact that he didn't write it and didn't get as much freedom as he usually likes, Kubrick has still managed to inject his own style into the picture, which is at least somewhat responsible for the fact that this is more than just the standard blockbuster. The film seems to be played mainly for entertainment purposes than anything else, and it's lack of themes is testament to that fact; but Spartacus does give the viewer a comment on nature of freedom, and also a comment on what goes into the making of a hero and a legend. The famous ""I am Spartacus"" scene sums the latter part up nicely.In my opinion, Kirk Douglas wasn't the right choice for the lead in this movie. Even when he's covered in grit, he still looks too polished to play the heroic lead and on the whole his performance isn't one of the best things about this movie. Kubrick isn't too good at casting actresses; that was more evident in 1980's The Shining, but you can see it here also. Jean Simmons doesn't do very well opposite Douglas, and in every scene she's in she looks either uncomfortable or incompetent. The acting isn't the most important aspect of this film, however, as it's the history surrounding the story that is. The battle scenes are brought to the screen with the greatest of care and the result is a screen spectacle indeed. The story surrounding Spartacus and his slave army is always going to be interesting, and relevant, as it can be paralleled with a number of historical events. This film may be given a new lease of life these days due to the success of several recent historical epics, but trust me; Spartacus is a hell of a lot better than the likes of 'Gladiator'.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Do I Look Like Spartacus?,"I know Spartacus, and, sir, I am no Spartacus! So, Senator Booker of New Jersey, there will never be a ""Spartacus moment"" for me. That I can assure you.I must say as a skinhead and a bald man for as long as I can remember, Kirk Douglas in this movie sported a crew cut that I could die for, and I was never really focused on male hairstyles before I watched this classic for one more, possibly my last, time. I just don't know why Kirk didn't keep the distinctive look as a long-term trademark because I don't think that he was ever seen this way again. Too bad!Even with a stellar cast including Olivier, Laughton, Douglas, Simmons, and Ustinov, this film ran for about an hour longer than necessary. I suppose that the intention was to produce it as an historical epic, but it would have been much more successful with an additional hour left on the cutting floor. The supporting cast including Charles McGraw, Woody Strode, and John Ireland was also excellent. I admit that I never caught the sexual innuendo behind the oyster and snail scene with Olivier and Curtis until someone explained it to me, but were scenes like this needed to move the action forward?In spite of its excessive length, the film was still often appealing in a visual sense and deservedly won three Oscars in categories that richly contributed to its visual beauty. The fourth Oscar was also very much deserved by Peter Ustinov, who played the part of contemptuous, disdaining Batiatus so naturally and effortlessly.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Nice Look Back On 1960s Technicolor Lushness,"Spartacus is a Roman epic with Laurence Olivier in one of the greatest performances I think I've ever seen. It's also an ambitious early vehicle for Stanley Kubrick. And, it's an important point in cinematic history because it was the first film to openly defy the black list by using the work of blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, and billing him. The most entertaining thing about it, aside from Olivier's fierce, intense, and successfully infuriating performance, is the dated look of the lavish and obviously fake sets, the bright and blown out Technicolor cinematography, the opening slave revolt and the costumes and weapons and firetruck red blood. It's a movie of the times. It also marks my confirmation that Laurence Olivier is a brilliant actor. He draws such an intimidating facade for his prideful and puerile militarist, hiding his weak fear for humiliation in his battle for power against the truly confident Gracchus. I have seen Olivier in Sleuth, in which he gave a wonderful performance, but he didn't shoot to the top of my list as he does here.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A film which actually lives up to its budget,"Made for the then-unheard-of sum of $12 million, and involving 10,500 people throughout the course of production, ""Spartacus"" probably still stands today as the biggest film ever made.  What makes it more than this is a commitment to theme and character too often absent from big-budget Hollywood.It seems trite to say a film is about ""what it means to be human,"" but that is indeed the core, the thread which runs through this magnificent epic. The quest of a man to prove to himself and the world that he is indeed a man.The existence of the character of Spartacus seems almost impossible.  How could a man who was born in bondage, whose family had been mere chattel for generations, who has been treated his entire life as a beast--how could such a man be so SURE that he was more than just a body to be used up, and that freedom was his destiny?It seems unrealistic, but it is not.  Anyone who has read ""The Autobiography of Frederick Douglass"" knows that this strength and pride can burn inside a slave even when there is no external force to spark or sustain it.  Like Douglass, Spartacus is a man who knew, intrinsically, that he and people like him deserved more.There is much, much more to this film than just Spartacus, of course.  But it is his growth into a truly free human being that left the strongest impression of me.  He develops from a man barely capable of articulating his feelings at the film's beginning (""I am not an animal!"") into a true leader who is ultimately a far greater man than the ruthless, privileged Crassus could ever hope to be.  Early on in the film, Spartacus expresses shame to his love Varinia that he cannot read, that he does not understand the forces of nature such as wind and the movement of the heavens.  Varinia responds, simply, ""You know things that cannot be taught.""  Surely enough, near the film's conclusion, the educated and urbane Crassus struggles to understand Spartacus and Varinia's love for him.  ""I want to understand!"" he exclaims in anguish.  But he could never understand what Spartacus knew intrinsically, even though he could not read a single word: the value of each human being, be they rich or poor, free or slave.These grand themes are subtly tempered by the presence of Batiatis and Gracchus, two very flippant, cynical, down-to-earth characters who present a gray area between the grand extremes and dramatic speeches of Spartacus and Crassus.  Peter Ustinov won a much-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar for slimy, wimpy slave-trader Batiatis; Charles Laughton could just as easily have won for the decadant but ultimately good-hearted populist politician Gracchus.  Add on Olivier's stunning performance as Crassus (truly a screen villain writ large--on par with the greatest), and you're left wishing that somehow the Oscar could have been split three ways.  Quite frankly, I'm at a loss to think of another film which boasts THREE supporting performances of this calibre.The film isn't without its weak points, however.  Tony Curtis as Antoninus and John Dall as Glaborus take the viewer out of the world of the film with their unapologetically modern dialects.  In the end, though, these are minor quibbles within a major cinematic achievement.  Easily one of the 100 greatest films ever made--I'm rather disappointed to see it so low on the IMDB top 250.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Has moments that transcend the campiness of the genre of The Hollywood Epic,"Perhaps the most un-Kubrick of Kubrick's films, but his touch is evident, if not always obvious.  (Understandable, since part of the footage shoot by Anthony Mann was used...)Kubrick's films always have a theme of man versus destiny, versus a supposedly insurmountable obstacle.  Things look bleak, but an individual musters the courage to fight against the powers that be...and he usually loses.  Kubrick is a pessimistic -- well, maybe a pragmatic romantic.  He likes to see the little guy fight the good fight, hopes that maybe it makes a difference, even if he knows that the battle is doomed from the start.  Maybe it will make a difference in the long run, but make no mistake, our hero is doomed.About the movie itself...The romance is tacked on, perfunctory, and without any spark between Kirk Douglas and Jean Simmons.  Its only purpose seems to be the final scene, to allow Spartacus to see his free son while he is lashed to the cross, crucified by the state of Rome.  (If you didn't know that's how it ends, you shouldn't be reading this, and you have no one but yourself to blame.) But the politics, the manipulations, the intricate dealings between those with power and those who have been overpowered are FASCINATING!  Both between the powers of Rome and the slaves but amongst the senators themselves! Crassus' rise to power -- seizure of power may be more accurate -- is underplayed with cool calculation by Laurence Olivier.  There is no need to wonder why he is regarded as one of the finest actors to grace the screen based upon this performance.  Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov also turn in first rate characterizations, and any of the scenes in which any combination of the three negotiate, threaten, haggle or barter far surpasses some of the moments of simple moralizing that pop up elsewhere in the film.  This, I believe, must have been what attracted Kubrick to the material, even though he was just a director for hire.  Look at ""Paths of Glory"" or the scene where the President phones the Russian Premier from the war room in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and you'll see how Kubrick regards the negotiations of those in power.  Moments of absurdity as fine as any ever committed to celluloid.Watch it for that.  Watch it for the absurdity of it all.  Kubrick's sense of the epic isn't as developed as, say, Sir David Lean's, but he doesn't give a rat's fart about the grandeur.  Watch it for the struggles between those who have power and those who WANT power.  Watch it with the knowledge of what befalls Crassus (and Caeser, for that matter).  Watch it knowing the tragedy that will eventually befall those who try to defend Rome, and the tragedy that will befall Rome itself.",,Anonymous,Biography
Power to the .. People,"There is a reason why a ""simple line"" just as ""I am Spartacus"" has become infamous in movie history. While the whole story and the character of our main hero here can be discussed and what may or may not have transpired, I think it is quite obvious that this was the most creative freedom/liberty they took by making the movie/story.The fact that this was written by Trumbo, who has his own struggle and oppression he fought and ultimately directed by Kubrick, someone who no one would call an easy director (which has nothing to do with his ability or general craftmanship of course) - to star Kirk Douglas, who also produced it ... there is a backstory there too about where he or rather his parents came from to make something of themselves.And those are just ""side stories"" that have nothing to do with the movie itself. While the TV was amazing and really violent and bloody, this has other strengths. Even nudity can not really be found here (though it gets hinted at), while violence has some minor part in it (just the suggestion of someone biting someone elses foot is crazy enough for my book though).Our main hero has issues .. and he is not a hero from the start. He is more a wild man with no visible goal or direction. Well other than to survive. Even when it comes to the Gladiator ""game"" he openly admits that he would do anything to save his own skin ... but he learns his lesson ... from another slave/gladiator. There are many who ""help"" him along the way - help him become who he'll inevitably become.Great actors round up the cast, with the movie never feeling too long or too stretched - even when we leave our main story/character and involve ourselves with politics. How we get to what possibly happened in reality is really something to behold. The movie begins like it was shown back then ... with many minutes of music ... has a middle piece and an end piece also with music ... epic some would call it.Epic is also the picture quality - I watched the 4k version of this and the restoration work they did ... phenomenal! If I didn't know this was 60+ years old I could not tell! There is a bonus feature that delves into that process and I take my hat off Universal and all the people that made this possible! Great movie that deserves to be seen in the best way possible (4k at the moment, this might become 8k or whatever at some point in the future)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Expansive but not really expressive; Kubrick's spectacular is entertaining but awfully dour...,"Kirk Douglas plays headstrong slave in the Roman Empire who revolts against the tyrannies, forming his own army made up of fellow slaves. Overlong epic directed by Stanley Kubrick and adapted from Howard Fast's book by the prolific Dalton Trumbo; terrifically entertaining for the most part--but, like all sagas, it has its peaks and valleys. Douglas consumes his role with relish, but Spartacus is a one-note character: all dour anger and downbeat proselytizing. Nevertheless, it's engrossing and certainly visually astounding (with Oscar-winning cinematography by Russell Metty). Other statues went to Best Supporting Actor Peter Ustinov for a predictably colorful performance as Batiatus, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and Best Costume Design. Tony Curtis does well as Antoninus (a singing slave!), and has a subtly kinky encounter with ruler Laurence Olivier's Marcus that was deleted at the time but has now been restored (with Anthony Hopkins dubbing Olivier's lost vocal track). **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Kirk Douglas telling a man he has to kill that he loves him like a son, and making you weep as he does it...  _That's_ drama.The whole thing is fine, even the one slave-turned-soldier who apparently was captured in Brooklyn (judging from his accent).  Peter Ustinov does the cowardly hero to perfection.  Charles Laughton makes intrigue interesting. And Olivier is evil.  It doesn't get any better.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
more Kirk Douglas than Stanley Kubrick,"Never mind the supposed parallels between the slave rebellion led by Kirk Douglas against the Roman Empire and the embryonic civil rights movement; the real virtue of this pre-biblical epic today is the nostalgia it holds for the Golden Age of wide-screen entertainment. The film looks fabulous but, rose-colored memories aside, it never was much of a classic. Instead of following the gloriously trashy example set by Cecil B. DeMille, it tries (too hard) to give the sand-and-sandal genre a token measure of highbrow prestige, not an easy task with a cast dressed in togas. But the script is far too dull (to say the least) and except for some lively battle scenes the film moves at a snail's pace. Thank goodness for Peter Ustinov, who alone among the cast of thousands seemed to have enough wisdom not to take it all too seriously. When it was re-released in 1991 the film included a previously cut scene of patrician/pederast Laurence Olivier bathing with body servant Tony Curtis, and also restored the original pre-credit orchestral overture, which added nothing to the film except length, the one feature it already has plenty of.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kubrick's finest hour,"I've got to say that I'm not a massive admirer of Kubrick, but there's no denying that this is a very fine movie. Back in the days when extras weren't computer generated this is very much the film that Gladiator was based on.Kirk Douglas plays the lead and the length of the film gives the actor and director plenty of time to develop the character. Spartacus starts the film as a slave, but is spotted and trained up to be a gladiator. During an uprising he becomes the leader of an army who simply want freedom from the roman empire.Where this film wins over Gladiator is in the character development and dialogue. Olivier, Simmons, Laughton, Ustinov and Curtis all put in fine performances and the ""I'm Spartacus"" is probably one of the most memorable scenes in movie history. 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
No one can take away our freedom,"Everyone is born equal and free, isn't it? Does it apply to today's world or was it never going to be this way? I think every person on this planet deserves to be what he wants of himself to be but this freedom of identification has been constantly compromised throughout all of the times a human existed. It all started when one person thought more of himself than another, superior, better and conquered the weaker because he could; and basically nothing has changed since the beginning of times - there are still people (and many of them) who try and steal or freedom, our rights and our choices - we are all Spartacus.""Spartacus"" is an epic historical drama with an all-star cast of Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov and Tony Curtis, penned by one of the most talented screenwriters, Mr Dalton Trumbo and directed by the perfectionist genius of Stanley Kubrick. As you've probably already guessed the plot revolves around Spartacus, a slave whose only wish was to be free and who wouldn't stop at anything (even death would not be an obstacle for him) or anyone to prevent him from the most precious, righteous and desirable thing in the universe.It's funny that Dalton Trumbo, blacklisted in Hollywood since early 1950s, received a writing credit for this movie with the help of Stanley Kubrick and Kirk Douglas who fought hard to get his name in the film - the very thing that ""Spartacus"" is all about - therefore proclaiming the end of those unjust times.The movie features one of the best performances by all of the lead and supporting actors; I would like to single out Kirk Douglas' and Charles Laughton's as highlights who really stood out above the rest. Sir Laurence's antagonist (in a way) Crassus is the most complicated character and no one could have done a better job portraying him than Sir Olivier - he is the one who has all the power, wealth and respect but lacks love which makes him the poorest man so he tries to steal it from the only man that he fears, Spartacus, a slave; but he didn't know that love, as much as freedom, is given to all of us starting day one, and no one can take that away.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""When just one man says no, Rome begins to fear""","Spartacus (1960) directed by Stanley Kubrick is a masterpiece of epic proportions, filled to the brim with spectacle, history, action, and adventure.The story revolves around slave Spartacus who survives brutal training as a gladiator and leads a violent revolt against the decadent Roman Republic, as the ambitious Crassus seeks to gain power by crushing the uprising. Ultimately, it encapsulates much of what many of the other swords-and-sandals epics have done before it, such as Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments.Particularly, Spartacus is gorgeous to look at with its unparalleled production design, wonderfully realised with its shooting locations, and huge in scope, not least due to Kubrick's masterful eye for cinematography and direction.

Spartacus!,"Spartacus is the story of a slave who became a great gladiator then broke out of the mess hall with the other gladiators and killed the guards and ran out of the town and busted out slaves from farms and slave markets. Spartacus started with a hand full of men and ended up with about 40,000 men and he made a rebel army out of the men. The story is true but not much is known about Spartacus himself. The movie was made without computer effects so the whole movie was filmed with stunt men and extras. The movie would have taken a couple of years to make and the director was perfectionist and he would make everyone do it again and again.

A wonderful epic,"While aside from the awesome big battle, Spartacus may not feel much like a Stanley Kubrick film, it does feel like a moving classic Hollywood epic with great characters and iconic scenes.It's corny at times and it drags quite a bit during its three hour runtime, but manages to mantain its status as a true Hollywood classic and an important, if at times unsubtle criticism of McCarthyism from writer Dalton Trumbo (the main villain literally has a list with the names of all ""enemies of the state"").",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Do you realise how long it takes to die on the cross?""","Spartacus (1960) -Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton really stole the show here, showing up the others for the average actors that they were compared to their skill and genius.I honestly don't know how Laurence Olivier and Kirk Douglas ever got to be so popular. There were trees that performed in a less wooden way than those two.It was possibly the best I've ever seen from Jean Simmons though. She must have taken some time out from her work as the lead singer with the band Kiss.Some things I have learned from watching older films was that you should never trust Herbert Lom. Tony Curtis is too pretty and couldn't sing for toffee. And Larry O. Would have bugg3r3d you as soon as look at you. That was all quite obvious in this film too.Sadly I have found that the old sandal and sword films all tend to become alike after a while, but this wasn't the worst that I've seen, although it was definitely too long and I got quite bored at times. The more recent 'Spartacus' (2010-13) TV series worked better for me, with its shorter instalments and sexier men, full frontal nudity, swearing and other generally modern improvements, although I could appreciate that Kirk's version may have been slightly more factually accurate at times.The soundtrack was very similar to some of the pieces used in the 'Star Wars' saga by John Williams and I wondered if he'd had an internship with the composer at the time? It's obvious and actually well known, that these epics inspired that universe created by George Lucas, who had no doubt given Mr. Williams a note about the soundtrack he wanted, but some of it was almost plagiarism in my opinion.I thought that the message of the film was how noble it was to die for a cause? Or was it all just a bloody waste?I realised that the film was set in more ancient times and allegedly less civilised too, but it was sad to see that the world as a whole has improved very little and only more recently regarding slavery. And it was hard to find an appreciation for dying for a cause, especially on such a large scale and on both sides. It didn't feel like anyone had achieved anything in the end either and the slave trade certainly didn't cease until far too much later after the setting of this film. It did make me wonder what Jesus really achieved with his time on earth, with this film being set so shortly after him.Actually though, it really wasn't a bad film and even Kirk was bearable really, just not as handsome as John Gavin (Swoon), but I would advise watching it in chunks to keep it fresh and prevent easy distraction.552.32/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointed,"I can only guess this is one of those ""classics"" that everyone agreed at some point are great, but don't age well.Some aspects of the cinematography and some scenes are interesting (even in that aspect, being a photographer myself, there was a LOT of inconsistencies and continuity issues), and of course it's a big production, I guess that's worth of respect.But that's pretty much I can count as enjoyment, the story is very simplistic and the character development is very shallow, even though it's 3 hours long, so no excuse for that.The acting in most of the movie felt quite overacted for me. The romantic parts were cheesy, the dramatic nearly funny and the fights clumsily choreographed. The best performance for me was Charles Laughton's Gracchus, which felt natural, most of the rest of the cast didn't.The long peregrination seem like a happy walk for everyone, even if they added a couple scenes to make it more dramatic and show the difficulty of it, everyone was partying with a smile every night, felt fake.Even the music felt quite over the top and poorly placed at some moments.I appreciate the history and the subject, but this movie didn't feel solid at all in its writing and I really feel double disappointed when it's the case in huge productions like this.Kubrick has done better than this.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hit and Myth,"Director Stanley Kubrick was brought in late on this sprawling epic, which is probably why it possesses few (if any) of his touches; nevertheless it still qualifies as one of his better movies and as perhaps the best of the epics from the 50s/60s. Kirk Douglas stars as the eponymous hero, a troll-like biter of Roman's ankles when we first meet him, who is transformed into a svelte and charismatic leader of an army of slaves. Needless to say, this being a Hollywood studio movie, the story told here plays pretty fast and loose with the truth. Major characters, such as Verinia and Antoninus are pure invention, and the film has created something of a myth about the real Spartacus who was apparently a Roman deserter who was sold into slavery upon his capture and sent to Batiatus's gladiator training school. Gracchus (a wonderfully written part played with typical skill by Charles Laughton) did exist  but about 50 years before the slaves' uprising.It's a shame that writer Dalton Trumbo and executive producer Douglas felt it necessary to add these invented characters, as they provide the weakest strands of the story. Jean Simmons is miscast in the part of Verinia: she's too demure and fragile-looking, too much the English lady you'd expect to find pouring tea in the garden instead of wine in the atrium. Her part is not particularly well written, either  too passive, even in her scenes with Olivier after the final battle. The character of Antoninus, played with little distinction by a too-old-for-the-part Tony Curtis  whose occasional forays into historical epics were never successful  is superfluous to the plot, and his only function seems to be to provide the writers with a means of demonstrating the sexual mores of Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier  another strong performance), the political foe of Gracchus, who represents the autocratic alternative to Gracchus's democratic ideal. Having abandoned his position as Crassus's body servant, Antoninus joins up with Spartacus and accompanies him to the very end. It's difficult to understand why Trumbo didn't simply merge the characters of Crixus (John Ireland), Spartacus's fellow gladiator and friend, and Antoninus, and find some other way to convey the nature of Crassus's character and ambition for Rome.The political intrigues provide by far the more interesting aspect of the story, and were probably more important to Douglas than the emotional side, which seems to have been incorporated as a sop to the studio's need for a box office return. The intrigue and machinations of Crassus and the wily old senator Gracchus are never less than completely absorbing, whereas the emotional sub-plots rarely rise above the level of some biblical potboiler. For me, Laughton's performance far outshines that of Oscar winner Peter Ustinov (who nevertheless gives a terrific performance as Lentulus Batiatus, the cowardly owner of the gladiator school in which the slaves' revolt is born) and it's a mystery how he never received even a nomination for any major award for the part. Kirk Douglas, resists the temptation to grandstand for the most part in what could so easily have become a showy role, and works hard to show the man behind the myth. Russ Metty's superb cinematography never fails to do justice to the scale and scope of the story, and Alex North's score is justifiably celebrated.While it's not without its shortcomings  not least of which is its protracted running time  SPARTACUS is deserving of the praise it has received over the years, and its reputation will no doubt continue to be enhanced in years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Undeniably Kubrick,"Spartacus has come to be regarded as something of an unknown entity in the Kubrick canon. He was an auteur who always claimed a writing credit; so on the surface this Kirk Douglas-produced Roman epic might appear to be a simple vanity project for its star after his failure to land the part of Ben-Hur.But Kubrick was clearly able to imprint his personality on the finished product: lengthy tracking shots and static long shots framed like classical paintings; meticulous lighting and chessboard floors. And not every director would pick up on screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's intelligent irony and subtext.Peter Ustinov has spoken of the lack of a Christ figure, and I would say this is to the movie's advantage. How easy it would have been to present Spartacus, self-proclaimed leader of the common man, as a figure to be deified, and the fawning poor as his disciples. But that would have cheapened the message, and patronised his followers to the extent that they become effectively imprisoned once more by blind allegiance. Indeed, religion is rarely mentioned at all; if it had been then the already murky politics would be muddied further and we would be watching a 5-hour cut.The cast is a colourful bunch. Douglas exudes a fierce and believable masculinity as the titular titan. Classical quality is provided by Laurence Olivier (Crassus), Charles Laughton (Gracchus) and the peerless Ustinov, whose Batiatus is the perfect rodent, snivelling somewhere between the stricken slave-world and the sinister senate. (A similar but arguably richer character than, say, Gladiator's Proximo.) The casting of Tony Curtis is less successful: his broad Bronx accent and dark heavy features aren't well suited to Antoninus' doe-eyed, silver-tongued minstrel.Speaking of heavy, Alex North's bombastic score is deafening; triumphant or obnoxious depending on your ear drums. (North would later commission an unused score for Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, before his work was replaced by memorable pieces from Strauss, Ligeti et al.) One could argue that Jean Simmons' Varinia is little more than a pretty plot device for much of the movie - a foil for Spartacus' rampant rage; proof that he is not merely D-Fens in a loincloth - but she comes alive in the final scenes, providing some much-needed hope in the devastating climactic meeting.Intelligent, broad of scope, cynical, horrifying and beautiful: this is truly a Kubrick war movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

THE DEFINITION OF CINEMA,"I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. Besides Kirk, Douglas and Stanley, Kubrick and I have to say I was very pleasant and surprised by the end result of this movie.

Kirk Douglas does an amazing performance and in my eyes my favorite performance of him so far. And every other scene after the opening did not disappoint. I will say yes, it is a bit long but for the length of the movie it makes up with this stellar cast, the beautiful set designs and the amazing acting that Kirk Douglas and cast do in the movie. I absolutely love everything about this movie and I'm so glad that I knew nothing about it, even the fact that it was set in Roman times and not even knowing who sport because was at the time, but. But I'm aware that it is a bit different from the source material that was written. But I still think that this is my favorite version of the character thus far because of the fact that Kubrick than an amazing job with this film. The emotion that the characters play in this movie is why I got into cinema as it is. This is what acting should be and it's a shame because in a movie like this this is the definition of an actor acting and putting on great performances. And this is something that I wish we could see more of in Hollywood nowadays because frankly I feel like it's not there as much anymore. The beautiful wife of Kirk Douglas does an amazing job at playing her role and the effects are fantastic and you can tell that this was a movie that was genuinely done with heart and character.

"An ambitious and well-acted ""historical epic"", but too complex in its ""genesis""!","Spartacus is an ambitious film, with an incredible cast and a troubled story. Kirk Douglas (actor and producer of the film) intended to make this film superior to Wyler's ""Ben-Hur"" film. He therefore hired (not immediately) the great Stanley Kubrick, who however did not have control over all aspects of the film (screenplay, editing and photography). The script was written by Dalton Trumbo, who was able to create a quality screenplay in just two weeks of work. Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov (Oscar winner), Charles Laughton, Tony Curtis are the great actors who give prestige to the film. However, despite many positive aspects (excellent acting, spectacularity, accurate historical reconstructions) this film is a condensation of opposing and irreconcilable ""artistic visions"". K. Douglas thought of the film as a historical epic as an end in itself, Trumbo understood the film as a ""political struggle"" between slave and master (parallel with McCarthyism) while Kubrick felt uncomfortable because he wanted to dominate the entire making of the film, but this was not possible for him. In fact, Kubrick regretted not being able to make an extremely historically accurate film. In essence, Spartacus is an exciting and engaging blockbuster, but too full of structural divergences. However, the performances of Laughton, Ustinov and Olivier are unforgettable. The Kubrickian ""cut"" of the film is also very appreciable. Bloody but true battle scenes and above all the story of the corruption and promiscuity of the Roman patrician at that time (Olivier's character). The scene of the arrival of the Roman legions is chilling. Beautiful is also the ending scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
EPIC!!!,"Though lengthy, and a little sappy in places; it is darn close to being a perfect American movie. Dare I say above Citizen Kane! The politics in this are more relevant today than they ever were. And how Kubrick coordinated and filmed the literal thousands of extras that toiled, journeyed, and fought is simply astounding still. Hard to believe humanity could ever be so crass and barbaric while wearing gold and silk. But has all that much changed over the centuries really? The only difference between a slave and a soldier is the uniform and respect. And even then it all boils down to who wins or loses at the end of the day. Simply a remarkable effort that has to be seen as a rite of passage before ones death.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Classic Epic,"""Sword and Sandal"" Epics were all the rage in the 1950's/early 1960's. Films like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956) were cleaning up at the Box Office - and the Oscars - and producers were clamoring to outdo themselves.Director William Wyler (THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES) announced that he was going to do BEN-HUR and Kirk Douglas (then a MAJOR star in Hollywood) lobbied to play the titular role. When Charlton Heston (the star of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS) was given the part, Wyler offered Douglas the supporting part of Messala (a part that went to Stephen Boyd).Offended by this, Douglas went off to find his own Sword and Sandal epic to rival BEN-HUR. He came across Howard Fast's novel SPARTACUS - a story of a slave revolt in Italy around 75 B. C. and decided that this would be perfect.Anthony Man was tabbed to direct, but after about a week of filming, Douglas had him fired (Kirk felt he wasn't ""up to"" the task) and asked 30 year old Stanley Kubrick, who Douglas had worked with on PATHS OF GLORY, to take the ""job for hire"".It was an interesting mismatch of Director and material. Douglas and Kubrick (who was used to having full control of his films) clashed often (mostly over the script written by black-listed writer Dalton Trumbo) and Kubrick really developed his sloth-like pace of filming as the studio wanted Kubrick to shoot 32 camera ""set-ups"" everyday while Kubrick only wanted to shoot 2. The compromised on 8.Kubrick shot this film using the 35mm Super 70 Technirama format (then blowing it up to 70mm). This was an expensive process but allowed Kubrick to achieve Ultra-High Definition (unheard of at the time because of the cost). This allowed him to capture, clearly, large panoramic scenes (like the climactic battle sequence).Consequently, the budget ballooned from $5 million to $9 million (and, eventually, to $12 million - the most expensive film ever made at the time) and many of the cast and crew complained about the length of the shoot. Actor Peter Ustinov joked that his daughter (who was born right as production started) would be entering kindergarten before they were done. Though, to give Kubrick credit, Spartacus would become Universal Studios highest grossing film of all time (surpassed in 1970 by AIRPORT).In addition, Kubrick really cemented his reputation as a perfectionist as he took over most of the Cinematography work from Russell Metty (who was hired by Mann to be the Cinematographer on this film). Metty complained bitterly about this - right up until the moment when Metty (not Kubrick) would win the Oscsar for Best Cinematography. He pretty much quieted down about this at that point.Because of their constant strife on-set, Kubrick and Douglas estranged from each other and would never work together again.All this is a lead up to the fact that SPARTACUS is one heckuva film. Sharply directed with a focus not only on the EPIC BATTLE SCENES (a must of Sword and Sandal films of the day), but also the intimate character scenes (where such actors as Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, Tony Curtis and Jean Simmons shone).Kubrick would disavow this film - since he did not have final cut rights and disliked the final cut of the film, but this film would go on to garner 6 Oscar nominations, winning 4 (including a Best Supporting Actor win for Ustinov - the ONLY actor to win an Oscar for a performance in a Kubrick film) and the line ""I Am Spartacus"" is listed by the American Film Institute as one of the top 100 lines in cinema history.Though, it must be noted, that Spartacus did NOT garner a BEST PICTURE nomination nor would Kubrick get a Best Director nod.SPARTACUS is overly long at 3 hours and 15 minute - but that is part of it's charm as a timepiece of these types of epic films and it ranks right up there with THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and BEN-HUR as top examples of the Sword and Sandal epic.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Entertaining, glorious film","""Spartacus"" is no doubt the ""Gladiator"" of its time.  Starring Kirk Douglas as the skillful gladiator who escapes from his owner Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) and organizes a massive slave revolt.  Meanwhile Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Grachus (Charles Laughton) try to manipulate the situation to their own benefit.With a movie starring Douglas and Olivier (among others) and directed by Stanley Kubrick there's really nothing to dislike about it.  The direction, action, performances, script are all admirable, an example of great, classic filmmaking.Mostly the acting though.  It would seem that Douglas is rigid as Spartacus, but it's just how his character reacts to the situations he's put in, and as the movie progresses he gets more relaxed in the role.  Olivier's bisexual Crassus is well acted as well, you sense his pride and love for Rome in his presence on screen.What's surprising here is Ustinov...well, not so much Ustinov but his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor.  I'm not saying he did a bad job - it was a great and often hilarious performance, but it's also the kind of performance where you would think it should've won an Oscar, but it would never actually win.  I'm glad it did, though.What surprises me also is how great this movie is for all ages.  It isn't too bloody, or long for children, and it's of course wonderful for adults too.Anyway, this is a great and entertaining film for people of all ages, 8/10.",,Anonymous,Biography
Kubrick Directed; Not His Vision,"(Flash Review)The rise and fall of a strategic slave uprising lead by the famous Spartacus. This epic tale takes place in 73 B.C. where slaves are trained to fight as gladiators (training later used battling for their freedom) to the death for the shallow enjoyment of the upper class. The side story is how Stanley Kubrick was urgently hired to direct this picture and not truly tapped for his renowned creativity so he Kirk Douglas wrestled for final decisions. It is a high quality production with good acting, engrossing pacing and a believable romance with Varinia another person to be bought and sold. When she is sold away from Spartacus, it sparks him to lead a rebellion. Will he have the skills, the manpower and the strategy to take it to the might of Caesar's Rome?",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Spartacus"" verges on war epic greatness","""Spartacus"" (1960) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) were the two great epic war films of the 1960s. That said, the latter is superior, but not for the former's lack of trying. The backstory of ""Spartacus"" explains a lot: Executive producer and star Kirk Douglas fires director Anthony Mann and brings in his ""Paths of Glory"" (a phenomenal film) director Stanley Kubrick. Problem is, the eventually infamous Kubrick really had no experience working with anyone's work but his own, even if the script was written by blacklisted two-time Oscar winner Dalton Trumbo. Basically, Douglas did his best to make the most of ""Spartacus,"" including the corralling of a distinguished cast, but it results in a very good -- not great -- film.For one, Trumbo's script is a crowd-pleaser, and I say that implying that it was for the '60s. Rarely does a war epic focus so heavily on the protagonist's romantic interest. As impressive as Jean Simmons is as Spartacus' lover and wife, Varinia, the subplot of these two slaves falling for each other has too much clout in a story that should focus sternly on Spartacus as the inspiring leader of a slave rebellion against the Roman empire. His love for Varinia ultimately makes him more likable, but it comes at the cost of part of the film's thematic boldness.Sadly, one of the scenes that was most interesting was not part of the film until it was remastered in 1991. In it, Laurence Olivier, playing powerful Senate leader Crassus, tries to seduce a young slave played by Tony Curtis as they are in the bath using a cunning metaphor. Naturally, this was deemed inappropriate by the Legion of Decency. Few scenes are as memorable as that one and only a couple of Spartacus' speeches on freedom are standouts as well. ""Death is the only a freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it"" is one of just a handful of powerful moments in three-hour film.For Kubrick fans, this is that one asterisk in Kubrick's grand career. There's very little director trademark in this film and there is very minimal hands-on work. If anything, the cinematography --namely the shadowy interiors -- is most noteworthy. And interestingly, most of this was Kubrick's doing and not that of Russell Metty because of alleged disagreements.The unarguably great part of this film are the performances. Sir Peter Ustinov won an Oscar for his role as Lentulus, owner of the gladiator school where Spartacus is sold at the film's beginning. He is a comical man just trying to do whatever he can to insure he's buried head out of the sand rather than in. He's the pawn of the Roman powers and he earns much of our pity as the film wears on. Olivier is of course commanding the the Roman leader and Charles Laughton perfect as his rival senator, kind-hearted yet distinctly amoral.It might be Alex North's score that sums ""Spartacus"" up best. It's theme-driven music perfectly suited for an epic film, but feels completely out of context. Whereas Maurice Jarre's epic ""Lawrence of Arabia"" soundtrack captures the greatness of that film, North's is a reminder that ""Spartacus"" was an idea born in Hollywood and shot mostly in California. It just doesn't convey a sense of time or place, only that this film was made to be a head-turning film with thousands of cast members and extras. Once again, it is a film of tremendous talents, but only verges on epic greatness.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com **all facts in this review courtesy IMDb trivia page",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spartacus,"Kirk Douglas had the vision to back the previously black-listed Dalton Trumbo with his excellent screenplay for this epic tale of slavery and the struggle for freedom. He also led a cast with some of the best actors to ever grace the silver screen. Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov, Curtis and a wonderfully tender Jean Simmons who all lift this tale of a slave who rebelled against the tyrannical rule of his Roman masters and inspired thousands to follow him as they strove to escape, then defeat the armies of Rome. The cinematography, colour, costumes are all the stuff of artists and Alex North creates a score that carries the intimate and the grand scenes in equal measure. The principles of struggle against oppression and of brotherly loyalty ring true even now, and this film is so much more than a sword-and-sandals melodrama.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kubrick has been snuffed.,"Make no mistake, Spartacus is a very strong epic and one that deserves to be called one of the best historical epics in American cinema, yet I can't help but wonder what might have been if director Stanley Kubrick was given more control over production. With Kirk Douglas in the starring role as well as producer, he seemed to sort of take over the look and feel of the movie in order to push forth his agenda that he was fighting for. Indeed, because of this, Spartacus has the feeling of more play and light-heartedness than other epics such as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago.The supporting cast is very strong with Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, and Peter Ustinov all giving great performances and bringing these characters to life. However, Tony Curtis as a minstrel-type slave does not feel right and for the most part feels very out of place with this story. It is obvious with this film that Kubrick had his own ideas on how to present it but was snuffed by the studio system that still loomed above in the early 1960s. After this, which made plenty of money but also made Kubrick upset at Hollywood, he decided to move to England and finance his projects independently. Watch his films after Spartacus and judge for yourself whether he made a wise decision or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An Allegory on Life, Freedom, & Humanity","Spartacus is a sprawling historical epic conveying important lessons on freedom, morality and humanity's aspiration to a higher order. A story told literately by Kubrick through the classical Roman period setting, exposing its storied and insatiable use of slave labour. Here, the Romans are at an existential crossroads between Republic and Empire, and Roman future is cast in the shadow of slavery. It is an important flashpoint in human history.The laconic Spartacus (Kirk Douglas), like a maverick Dickensian spectre, gives Laurence Olivier's dictatorial Crassus (aka ""the richest man in Rome"") a lesson on humanity and the irrepressible drive for individual freedoms that comes not just from Spartacus, but from the groundswell of anyone subjected to repression. The materialistic and power-hungry Crassus, try as he may, could not simply kill Spartacus and see the slave revolt die with him; rather, the slave revolt was (and is) a state of mind; a state of human spirit that transcends Spartacus. Summarised as Spartacus numerously declares; ""I am not an animal,"" setting himself spiritedly apart from the banal machinations of tyranny.The film's long runtime allows a gradual tale of emancipation, feeling figuratively as long as the history of slavery itself. Or perhaps the long history before mankind reached its latter freedom of the mind in the Enlightenment. First, humanity needed to break free of the shackles of physical slavery and subjugation. Spartacus was a major figure in this process; honoured here in motion picture form.7.9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well directed by Kubrick with a good cast and good characters it's a nice film by Kubrick,"Spartacus is another Classic By and. Stanley Kubrick whom is a very very good director and he has made a ton to very good movies and this one Joins the list for one of his most amazing films that he made.This movie talks about a slave , a gladiator in fact they trained him to fight and kill but they trained him too well that he made a revolution that consist of a LOT of slave , now talking technical stuff the movie has one of the largest amounts of extras I've ever seen it joins the list for very large extra's in movies similar to Lawrence of Arabia.Now talking about Lawrence of Arabia I feel that this movie is VERY similar to Lawrence of Arabia there's just something about Spartacus that reminds me of Lawrence , the character , the story , the amount of extras , the battles , this movie is definitely very similar to Lawrence of Arabia , both very good movies indeed and that's one thing that I noticed about this film.The first 30-40 minutes of the movie were EPIC they were very well directed by Mr Kubrick and his vision and his style is very good , I really appreciate the tone of this movie a very good Roman theme set in a very long time ago , the set design is very well done , the clothes are also very well done and the sounds and the actors and the soundtrack , the soundtrack was very good indeed in this film I do quite like it.Overall this is a good and probably the longest film by mr Kubrick I think this is a well done biography about Spartacus. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie really gets you--you think that Spartacus is going to defeat the Romans, free the slaves--and he comes so close, yet just doesn't make it!

spartacus,"Stanley Kubrick directed an epic masterpiece of cinema with his 1960 classic Spartacus. Every shot shows the massive scope or the most intimate emotion. He recreates ancient Rome with painstaking detail from architecture, costumes, language, colors, and hundreds of extras. Creative cinematography reveals Kubrick to be a brilliant director early on in his career. Dalton Trumbo's writing is what makes Spartacus shine! Spartacus is a timeless film that demonstrates the inhumanity of slavery and the heart of an ambitious slave. You get villainous monologues that decipher the motivations of even the most heinous of men, long accounts of Roman history, battle rally speeches to bolster morale, and loving conversations that develop the adorably sincere romance. Spartacus persists as a cinema classic for its harrowing tale of freedom and undying love. It is a genius story told in a careful manner. Kirk Douglas delivers his most well-rounded performance of his career as the titular hero Spartacus. He is quiet as the defeated slave, fierce as the brave gladiator, kind as the devoted lover, clever as the military general, and mindful in his curiosity. He is so subtle, showing Spartacus' pain and longing hardly without words. It is a wonderful display of acting. Spartacus boasts one of the most exhilarating ensembles in cinema. Sir Laurence Olivier is devastatingly cruel and clever as the egotistical and ambitious Crassus, whose devotion to Rome leads to atrocity. Jean Simmons is delightful and so strong as the female lead, Varinia. Tony Curtis is so sweet and charming as the faithful Antoninus. Charles Laughton is so deviously clever is his political scheming as Gracchus. Finally, Peter Ustinov is hilarious as the opportunistic slave merchant Batiatus. Everyone plays their part to perfection. The music is very fitting, and Spartacus remains as having one of the most lovely romance themes in film history. Every time you see Kirk Douglas on screen with Jean Simmons, the strings swell into this heavenly symphony you will love. Watch Spartacus and behold a true masterwork of film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The opposition opposing him is made up of slightly frisky effeminate roman leaders who are contrasted with the wholesome masculine Spartacus, I couldn't help but feel this would have gone down well with the US audience of the time.Booming scores burst out of the speakers as we follow our rag tag rebels across Italy in some sweeping cinematography involving thousands of extras, the sort of thing you rarely if ever see on the big screen these days without it being CGI.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too plain to be entertaining and artistic which contradicts Kubrick,"Weirdly, Spartacus is out of Stanley Kubrick's style, a plain epic, visually plain, the content is plain, direction is plain... I don't know why, but I always see Spartacus and Ben Hur as like as two peas, may be so that they come from the same period. I don't compare Spartacus with Ben Hur, but it cannot be another Ben Hur, Ben Hur was much better, if you ask me. Spartacus is not a spectacular epic. The movie is not boring, I did not get bored at all, but it is not interesting enough throughout and as I said, everything is plain, in addition, there was nothing great. Except the final that I will mention later, there is not any scene memorable or impressive that I would talk about. May be I should mention the sword fight scene. There is a sword fight in the movie and it was really engaging and entertaining. However, the rest is like a straight, plain line. As for Stanley Kubrick, he is one of my all time favorite directors, but Spartacus is not like a Kubrick movie at all, you know almost every movie he made was different, extraordinary, but Spartacus is not. As you know, may be he is the most perfectionist director ever lived and his style was not distinguishable, but just impressive. In fact, it would be enough, if I just said perfectionist. However, Spartacus is an exception in his filmography. Kirk Douglas is also one of my all time favorite actors too, but unfortunately cannot save the movie. Before watching, I had known that Spartacus is not a historical action movie, no battles scenes etc. so I did not disappointed on this count, otherwise, Spartacus would have been a bigger disappointment to me.

Stanley Kubrick Reviews #5 - Kubrick still shines under Hollywood's control!,"(No Spoilers) Stanley Kubrick's biggest flex is disowning one of the greatest historical epics of the time. Despite the troubled development and lost footage it still holds up over half a century later! Even without much creative control from Kubrick, and difficulty behind the scenes, this movie is so great and enjoyable, gliding almost effortlessly through its 3 hour runtime. I was a bit intimidated by the runtime at first, but while I wasn't fully engaged for the first half hour, after that I was so immersed and the time flew. Kubrick is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time as he took the reigns of a movie one week into production and still made something truly great out of it.This is definitely Kubrick's most Hollywood film, but it still works and has its charms. For it's time this movie has a lot of solid action. The choreography, especially during this era, looks a bit stilted, but I was still engaged and it still had its tense moments. The action actually had great moments, and a great sense of scale. I loved in particular the little bits of gore in the final fight, like someone's hand getting chopped off and spurting out blood. I really did not expect that but I appreciate that they actually tried to make it fun, tense, and even brutal when it needed to be.Action aside this movie has some depth too, though not nearly as much as most of Kubrick's movies. Some of the characters are quite well developed, and we get to see the politics, some religious aspects, and even homoerotic subtext in one scene! I really didn't expect that, but it shows they actually tried with some characters, and weren't just trying to make the average action historical epic. That being said with the runtime I would've liked to see a little more development, especially from the gladiators. There could've been a bit more time shown how the Gladiators adapt from becoming free because it feels like a very sudden shift. Especially from our main character Spartacus that goes from barely talking to making full speeches and becoming the leader of the freed Gladiators so quickly.Kubrick isn't the only one who deserves praise, Dalton Trumbo deserves praise for the pretty strong screenplay that makes one of Kubrick's only movies he didn't write, as well as all the cast and crew that seemed to have tried their hardest. The cast especially was very good, and made me feel for many of the Gladiators who didn't even have that much screen time. Kirk Douglas is great as Spartacus, and there's a scene in particular that I love before a fight to the death with another fellow gladiator, where both of them just look at each other and you know exactly what they're thinking without a word being said.Overall, Spartacus really surprised me. It seemed like a movie with so much passion behind it, even if it has its drama behind the scenes. It's easy to see why it was such a success when it came out. Maybe some of the sets and costumes and sets look a little fake or dated, but they have a certain quality to it. It almost looks theatrical at points, but it's still beautiful in its own way, especially the surprising cinematography. But If nothing, this movie has magic, awe, and wonder, very little movies still are able to capture. That's the power Stanley Kubrick has, and what made what could've been a pretty basic historical epic something special.(8.5/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An impressive epic drama,"My only real issue with Spartacus is its length.

Roman Slaves' Cry For Freedom Is Clearly Heard Through This Film,"In spite of some historical inaccuracies, the epic spectacle ""Spartacus"" (1960) is a remarkable movie which should be rightly called late Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece (even though he practically disowned it).The cast members are excellent.  Kirk Douglas was perfectly cast as this historical slave revolt leader.  In fact, he was the right age.  (Spartacus was in his late 30's when he revolted while Douglas was about 45 when he made this film.)  Sir Lawrence Olivier is superb as the cocky and filthy-rich Roman politician Crassus.  Other players including Peter Ustinov, John Gavin (yes, Honorable John Gavin, former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico) and Charles Laughton are equally magnificent in their respective roles.  The drama and emotion of this film moved me to tears.The last decisive battle scene between the slave army and Roman legions was magnificently staged. The extras playing the Roman legionnaires marched in formation so precisely, and the whole formation moved like a single organism.  The blinding flash, which was created when thousands of extras simultaneously pointed their shields toward the camera, was absolutely awe-inspiring.  Just before the two armies clashed, thousands of extras playing the Roman army quickly and precisely reorganized the formation to create skirmish lines.  This was a site to behold.   It must have been absolutely terrifying for the foes of Rome to watch the formations of these robot-like, super-precise Roman legionnaires charging toward them.  (No wonder the extras moved with such a precision.  The Roman soldiers were played by 8000 infantrymen from the Spanish Army.) The whole thing was so good it gave me goose bumps.Of course, since this is a Hollywood movie, there are some almost mandatory historical inaccuracies:  1)  Roman historians recorded that Spartacus was sold as a slave as a punishment for deserting from the Roman army.  There is no record of his working in a Libyan mine.  According to Roman historian Plutarch, Spartacus was sold to a gladiator school run by a man named Lentulus Batiatus (played in the movie by Peter Ustinov). 2)  Spartacus apparently did not meet his wife at the gladiator school.  He was already married at the time he was sold as a slave, and his wife was also sold as a slave. 3)  Spartacus' slave army suffered greatly from an internal strife which eventually led to its defeat by Crassus' legions.  (This internal strife was not even mentioned in the movie.)  Spartacus and his followers within the slave army wanted to flee from Italy and disband the army outside the Roman territory so all the foreign slaves can return home.  Others wanted to remain in Italy and keep on looting. 4)  In the movie, Spartacus forbade his men from forcing Roman prisoners to fight as gladiators.  However, real Spartacus apparently made many Roman captives to fight in gladiator fights. 5) Both Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and his brother Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, famous pro-plebian reformers, died decades before Spartacus' revolt.  The film is unclear as to whether the Charles Laughton character is Tiberius or his brother. 6) Crassus' last decisive campaign against Spartacus was more complex and time-consuming than what was portrayed in the movie.  It involved building dozens of miles of fortifications near the southern tip of Italy and decimation (i.e. execution of one in ten soldiers) of his own defeated legions for cowardice.However, these historical inaccuracies did not lessen the value of this movie.  The cry for freedom by Spartacus and other slaves 2000 years ago can be clearly heard through this movie.  All lovers of Roman epic should see this movie!",,Anonymous,Biography
"In comparison with ""Ben Hur"" (1959) less personal and much more oriented on class distinctions","""Spartacus"" is the last traditional Kubrick film. After this film the direcctor stepped out of the Hollywood system and only made auteur films, beginning with ""Lolita"" (1962).In ""Spartacus"" Kubrick succeeded Anthony Mann as director and was, as a young upcoming director, confronted with an all star cast.On top of that he had to handle Kirk Douglas who was both lead actor, producer and angry that he hadn't got the role of Judah Ben Hur in the William Wyler production of a year earlier (played in stead by Charlton Heston).All in all Kubrick didn't manage to make the film he had envisaged and out of frustration broke with the Hollywood system, as mentioned at the beginning of this review.It is however unfair to think that Kirk Douglas as producer only wanted to make a star vehicle for himself. He did take a risk by casting some very fine English actors (Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton) in other roles. On top of that the screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo AND he was also credited under his real name. ""Spartacus"" played a mayor role in getting Trumbo of the black list, on which his name was put in the McCarthy years.I already mentioned ""Ben Hur"" (William Wyler, 1959). Both ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" are movies situated during the Roman empire. In ""Ben Hur"" however the emphasis is on the personal animosity of two former friends. ""Spartacus"" on the other hand is more abstract and is about the class distinction between slaves and masters.In some scenes it is suggested that the Romans saw there slaves as barely human and more like animals. See for example the scene in which a bride as a gift is allowed to choose two slaves of her liking. Or the scene in which the slaves / gladiators are allowed once in a while to receive women in their cells and the Roman guards are secretly peeping to see what will happen.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A bit too long, but still very good","Kirk Douglas plays the slave Spartacus. He leads the slave revolt, probably known by many, against Rome in the time just before Julius Ceasar. It is an epic that still looks very good.

The cinematography is beautiful and although director Stanley Kubrick did not really made the film his own with his wonderful style, he does a great job. Performances by Douglas, Olivier, Curtis, Jean Simmons (who plays Varinia, the wife of Spartacus) and especially Peter Ustinov (as Lentulus Batiatus, who bought Spartacus in the beginning) are amazing. The movie is a little too long but despite that it is a very good one.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fire Over Rome,"In the late 1950s, Kirk Douglas began to plan for a film he had dreamed of for several years. Together with his co-producer, Edward Lewis, the actor intended to tell the legend of the gladiator Spartacus and his fight against the mighty Roman Empire. According to Kirk Douglas, it would be a story about a group of desperate men who finally threw off their heavy shackles. A celebration of how thousands of former slaves broke away from their Roman oppressors and became free citizens. Unfortunately, it wasn't going to be an easy tale to tell.Already a week into the shooting, problems arose. Kirk Douglas was so unhappy with the film's director, Anthony Mann, that he fired him on the spot (he still paid Mann his full salary). Then Douglas phoned Stanley Kubrick and asked him to take over. Something that surprised many Hollywood insiders. At the time, Kubrick had hardly any cinematic experience to speak of. And ""Spartacus"" was an extremely expensive production, with several major stars and over 10,000 extras.Employing the young, inexperienced Stanley Kubrick wasn't the only bold decision Kirk Douglas made. The producer also hired Dalton Trumbo to write the screenplay, even though the radical author had been blacklisted in Hollywood for over ten years. The film's casting was also unconventional. Douglas had the leading Romans played by British actors while the revolting slaves were portrayed by Americans (with Douglas himself as Spartacus, the head of the rebellion).At the ""Spartacus"" premiere, the conservative American newspapers was outraged that the film company had dared to hire a blacklisted scriptwriter like Dalton Trumbo. But most critics fell silent after John F. Kennedy had slipped into a public screening in Washington. And the President wasn't the only one who liked the film. ""Spartacus"" was a worldwide box office success. Sadly, it was also the last time Kirk Douglas and Stanley Kubrick ever worked together.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The most unKubrickian Kubrick project......but it still delivers.,"Spartacus follows the time of the rebel Spartacus' life starting with his life as a slave, then gladiator, then rebel, and finally leading up to his crucifixion. This film was directed by Stanley Kubrick, but if you're a hardcore Kubrick film like myself, you'll have a hard time believing it. Is it beautiful? Yes, the photography of the film is pretty top notch. Is the camera work Kubrick? To a certain degree. It's not full force Kubrick. I interpreted this as a laid back Kubrick style of filming. And the fact that he didn't write the screenplay had a lot to do with it I'm sure. Can I praise Kirk Douglas enough for his portrayal of Spartacus? I don't think so. Kirk gives one of the best performances of his career that I've seen. I still can't place his acting here above his acting in Paths of Glory though. Another great actor here is Jean Simmons, who is a hottie for real. She is absolutely beautiful. Another thing about the movie is that even though, it's over 3 hours long, I found the pacing very well done. I never found myself bored because the film has powerful dialog, which is another big plus.10/10 Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spartacus,"The epic and influential Spartacus was more of a Kik Douglas production than a Stanley Kubrick film. The compromise is plain to see on the screen.Set in first century BC Rome. Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is the slave who is forced to become a gladiator by slave broker Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov.)Spartacus falls for a slave named Varinia (Jean Simmons) and leads a revolt against his Roman masters.Other slaves soon join him including the cultured Antoninus (Tony Curtis) who rebuffs the advances of Senator Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier.)The conniving Crassus is at odds with the more benevolent Senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton.) The former favours a hardline form of governing and uses an iron fist to bring down the slave rebellion.Spartacus is a landmark movie. The 'I am Spartacus' scene has been parodied many times. The movie served as a blueprint for Ridley Scott's Gladiator.There are various subtext to the movie. Ranging from the civil rights movement, hence the important scene of the black gladiator Draba (Woody Strode) sparing Spartacus's life. The restored version added in the 'snail and oyster' line which dealt with sexuality. Tony Curtis acknowledged his bisexuality.The biggest problem with the movie is that it is overwrought and heavy handed. The long running time hampers the story. It has dated badly.It is epic for the sake of epicness. It wanted to outdo Cecil B DeMille and failed.There is a big battle scene here and there but the machination of the Roman politicians gets dull. Many actors get lost with a few like Laughton and Ustinov showing a lightness of touch.I do wonder how different Spartacus would have been if Kubrick was given full reigns to the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Kubrick's best films.,"The Fifties and Sixties saw a proliferation of epic films made around the Bible or the Roman Empire. Based on a precise moment in the history of Rome, the Slave War, this is one of the best despite not having a comma of historical rigor.The film focuses on the historical figure of Spartacus, a Thracian slave who begins by being a gladiator and who will become famous when he takes over the leadership of a huge group of slaves who, in the middle of the Italian peninsula, revolt and desperately fight for their own freedom and the right to abandon the empire's lands. The film creates around it a huge fictional plot and a somewhat sugary romance with another slave, and emphasizes the division of the Romans and political issues. Skillfully directed by Stanley Kubrick, it's one of the most palatable films in his filmography. The film follows the entire trajectory of the revolt until its bloody end.One of the strongest points of the film is the extraordinary performance of the cast, led by Kirk Douglas in one of the roles that would give him immortal notoriety. He is perfect in the way he gave life to Spartacus, although perhaps Kubrick exaggerated the amount of pompous speeches and pouch phrases attributed to the character. Jean Simmons was excellent in the role of the slave he falls in love with and Laurence Olivier is impeccable in the role of Crassus, the famous Roman politician and consul responsible for ending the slave revolt. The film also features John Gavin, Charles Laughton, John Dall and Peter Ustinov in smaller roles, but where everyone did a job worthy of praise.Technically, it is a film full of value and extremely positive grades. Let us start by mentioning the excellent cinematography, the impeccable filming work and the magnificent colors and light that accompany the entire work, which lasts about three hours. It is in fact three hours well spent, where we rarely feel we are seeing a scene that can be removed or shortened until we reach the last half hour... in fact, from that point on, Kubrick seems more concerned with creating a hermetically closed ending in spite of using the dramatic climax for a great and impactful ending. Thus, and as a result of this hesitation, the film drags on for unnecessary thirty minutes. All the sets and costumes were meticulously done and look incredible, although, like much of the script, they are more guided by the visual impact than by the historical rigor of the recreation. As in other epics of this time, many people are involved and the film was an imposing collective effort. The soundtrack, by Alex North, is effective and works quite well.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stan Gets Lucky,"One of those movies which somehow seems to improve as it ages (probably because, between viewings, we forget how many cliches it avoids), Spartacus is a terrific film, and one which, I think, would have been every bit as terrific even if Mr Douglas and Mr Mann hadn't had that little falling out which led to Mr Kubrick getting the phone call.Don't get me wrong, I think Kubrick was a great director, perhaps even the best there has been, but not only had Spartacus been in pre-production for over a year by the time he was told to hop aboard, the actual shooting had already begun (that opening sequence in the quarry is all Mann's, I believe).  On a project of this scale, made in the heart of the Hollywood machine, even the most tyrannous director would be hard pressed to shape it into something that reflected himself, and indeed, some sources suggest Kubrick all but disowned the film.  He certainly wasn't involved with the '91 restoration.The only conclusion is that, whatever contribution he made scene-by-scene, the film's many overall qualities (witty dialogue, an emphasis on intrigue, a political theme, very handsome look) were there regardless of Kubrick, not because of him.",,Anonymous,Biography
My Pick For #1 Movie Ever,"I know it is probably not going to make me very popular here on IMDb where everyone seems to be either a fan of Shawshank Redemption or Citizen Kane or they are all about Star Wars or Lord of the Rings..... well I like all of those movies too but for whatever reason my all time favorite is and always has been and always will be Spartacus! Maybe it is because it is the first movie I remember watching as a kid and I just loved all the action and especially the climactic scene at the end where Spartacus is forced to fight his own friend.... whatever the reason is I always really loved watching this movie and still do. I can't wait to share it with my kids whenever they are old enough for a kind of violent movie like this.Directed by Stanley Kubrick you know it has to be good, and I think this is his best movie that he ever made.1960, rated R but probably PG-13 by today's standards.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Makes Gladiator look like garbage,"Okay, I know a lot of people love Gladiator, and I guess it wasn't that bad, but it was still just a dumb action movie. it also pales in comparison to Spartacus, the original fight in the Colosseum flick. What differs is that it is just so much more interesting, with a great story about a man who tries to fight against the Romans and regain his peoples dignity.There are a number of notable pieces of brilliance that make this such a great film, especially for it's time. Firstly, the script is full of great dialog, and offers some fantastic lines for the Romans. It is the first film to include a Gay scene, though it is done with clever subtlety. And it was one of the first big epics to end in a downer. Yep, that's right!! Goes against what most people want in a big screen epic but it was done well!! There's plenty more to recommend it, but I think it is best just to say it is one of the finest films ever made and well worth watching if you want a film with some brains, as well as epic action.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

That's why this kind of epic is usually not my cup of tea...I'm curious how it got that much money to make it, and with a scene like this in 1960, I'd say it had to be completely after Lolita!zsbs

See the Restored Film on the Big Screen,"On a huge silver screen in a 1,500 seat Italian Renaissance Theater, I viewed the epic film.  Restored in 70 millimeter film, you cannot fully appreciate this work viewing it on a TV screen.While Spartacus is a historically accurate person the movie makes slight changes to his history.  We find Kirk Douglas as Spartacus being taken into slavery at age 13 and now in the rock quarry in Libya, North Africa prior to his being sold to Peter Ustinov as the gladiator school owner, Lentulus Batiatus.  A historical note on an Internet website reports that Spartacus was a Thracian Soldier who was captured by the Romans and sold into slavery. This aside, the drama and telling of the story of slaves wishing to be free men is more compelling than this slight historical inaccuracy.For almost the first hour of this long 190 minute epic, Kirk Douglas has few speaking lines.  Rather, he acts by his eye movements and sheer presence on the film.  The film is heavy with excellent extreme facial close-ups which when seen in 70 millimeters makes for dramatic acting in spite of the lack of dialog.  What is remarkable is the way the film shows and tells the story of how gladiators were trained at ""schools"" to perform in the arenas of Rome.  See this film for the training school sequences alone and you have received your money's worth.Kirk Douglas begins to speak more dialog after he and his fellow gladiator trainees overrun the school and set out to free all slaves being held in Italy.  However, the most dialog and most skillfully acted is the scene stealing performance of Peter Ustinov as Batiatus.Strong performances were made by the great Charles Laughton as the senior Roman Senator, Sempornius Gracchus.  A Roman Republican, Gracchus weaves a web of political intrigue which ends in his not shown on screen, suicide. Sir Laurence Olivier as the power seizing Marcus Licinius Crassus is a believable power behind the throne who wins in the end.Charles McGraw plays the gladiator trainer Marcellus.  Marcellus was a slave gladiator who survived the arena and was promoted to gladiator school trainer by Batiatus.  Watch how he dies during the slave revolt.  Good performance by McGraw.The subplot is a romance between Spartacus and Bratiatus' household slave and slave concubine Varinia played by the lovely Jean Simmons.  Her only flaw when viewing her close-ups is that Hollywood makeup artists gave her overly large black eyebrows which detract from her pretty face.  Spartacus, whom in this movie we are lead to believe has been a slave for more than 15 years or so and obviously ""without woman"" falls in love with Varinia and she with him.  History records, however, that Spartacus had a wife before he was captured and made a slave.  But, without a romance and a pretty face, these ""swashbuckler epics"" would not survive on the sheer weight of the fighting sequences and political twists and turns.Once the slaves escape and run wild liberating 12,000 slaves of Italy, Douglas and Simmons declare their love for each other and become common-law husband and wife.  A boy child ensues.  Watch to see what happens in the end.The final battle scenes using 8,000 real Spanish Army soldiers marching in attack formations becomes too much for the slave army to overcome.  Craccus prevails and the entire slave army is destroyed and the survivors crucified along the famous Apian Way Road into Rome as an example for others not to repeat this again.Tony Curtis a slave poet and magician/juggler, Antoninus, who first resembles a pacifist becomes an able right hand man and Lieutenant to the new General of Slaves, Spartacus.  Despite Mr. Curtis' renowned ""New York"" accent, you seem to forget it due to the action-in-every-scene of this movie.Spartacus lives long enough to see from his Varinia and his infant son being smuggled out of Rome with the help of Batiatus and the money from Gracchus as Simmons hold up Spartacus' son and from the cross, Spartacus knows that his son will grow up a free man.An error was made in naming John Gavin's character Caius Julius Caesar who became head of the Roman Guard.  Caesar is a title meaning Emperor and thus the younger Caius Julius would not have been referred to by the name Caesar until he later became the actual Emperor of Rome.  In fact, it's more accurate to refer to him later as Caesar, Julius rather than Julius Caesar. In the same manner, Christ is not the last name of Jesus.  Rather, Christos in Greek means the ""anointed one"" and thus, it is a title, also.John Ireland plays slave gladiator and Spartacus' lieutenant Crixus, although he has little speaking parts he fights well.  Woody Strode as Draba gave a memorable performance.This movie is a solid ""9"" and should be seen on the widest TV screen you can find, or else watch for a revival showing on a huge theater screen.

"""An animal can fight, but to sing beautiful things""","Spartacus is unique among Kubrick films in that he was never meant to direct it, and he had little influence over it once it reached post-production, something which did not suit Kubrick or his style. As such it's a slightly botched, uneven work.Very little of Kubrick's style  which was actually still developing at the time  remains intact. It does often look like a typical studio job with the director being just a cog in the crew. You can still see Kubrick's sense of contrasting high and low with location. Just as he showed complete changes of tone between the trenches and palatial officer's quarters in Paths of Glory (1957), he here compares the ornate, spacious Roman palaces with the dingy, underground gladiator's cells. In fact, the films best moments come in the first hour set at the gladiatorial school.Taking the few known facts about the real historical figures concerned, Dalton Trumbo has woven a good story, particularly with the complex rivalries and loyalties between the Romans. The dialogue however is pretty poor. Kubrick dismissed the script as being too full of stupid morality, and he was right. There are lots of impassioned speeches about dying free, much of which borders on cliché. While it's a welcome change from the piety of the religious epics of the 1950s, this deal with making such a big thing of the hero being perfectly noble and principled can be almost as bad.In spite of the stellar acting line-up, there are only really three acting performances I really like  the trio of English Romans. Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton are both ideally suited to their roles as Crassus and Gracchus respectively. However best of all is my all time favourite actor  Peter Ustinov who, as usual steals the show as the gladiatorial school owner Batiatus. Apparently Ustinov wrote most of his own dialogue, which explains why he gets all the best lines. Or perhaps it's just his deadpan delivery which gives lines like ""Most exciting. I tingle,"" such brilliance.The musical score is instantly forgettable. In fact I even forget who composed it. Kubrick does make good use of it though, editing to the beat in two key scenes  when Spartacus and Draba are waiting to fight each other, and in the build up to the final battle  building up tension well.There are quite a few moments of sloppiness in Spartacus. There are plot holes big enough to drive a convenient character arc through. There is a hideous backdrop which makes what was supposed to be quite a warm, poignant scene look silly. I'll also point out rather smugly that, if you watch closely in the scene of the gladiators rebelling at the school, Spartacus actually defeats no less than four fully armed Roman guards using nothing more than a wicker basket. Mind you, it's cinema. You can overlook these things, sit back and enjoy.So, it's no small wonder that after Spartacus Kubrick moved to the UK and ensured he had complete control of all his pictures from thereon. You would never guess that it was the product of one of cinema's most stylised and meticulous directors. When there are moments of brilliance they are rarely a result of directorial style. It's not a bad film  it has just enough good elements to hold it all together. But on the flipside it has far too many bad elements to make it a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kubrick's style does not fit this story (or studio interference),"If you like Sword & Sandal films and/or Kubrick this film is worth checking out. But it is not the gold standard in either category. I think there problem is there is an uneasy marriage between the more intellectual story of political gamesmanship of Crassus vs. Gracchus and the more rebel rousing story of the slave revolt. Kubrick seemed much more interested the former while the studio (or Douglas) was more interested in the later. The film would have been better served of deciding on the focus. As it is the story is clunky-the third act is painfully slow-and a little muddled.There are plenty of touches or aspects of the film that stay with you. Douglas gives a restrained, tender performance that is more rounded than a lot of heroes in this genre. The film is darker in its color scheme which is one reason why the film feels more naturalistic than a lot of the 50's (60's) sword & sandal flicks. The battles are not very good technically but Kubrick hides that with some inventive direction.Lastly, the film is weirdly moralistic on homosexuality-some of this might be the Hays code. It has one of the most ahistorical portrayals of the subject I have seen in any sword and sandal film. The film heavily implies that Antoninus tries to escape bondage only because Crassus tries to seduce him. As in homosexuality in itself is what Antoninus considered wrong or a bridge to far. That is laughably Christian for a Roman.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Kubrick's epic.,"Basically all of Kubrick's movie had an epic feel to it, due to the way they got done but with this movie Kubrick perhaps delivers his only true epic movie, in terms of its story and battles.It also at the same time is the Kubrick movie that feels the least Kubrick-like. This is no wonder, since Kubrick got brought in very late into the project by star Kirk Douglas, after he had a falling out with the original first director Anthony Mann. It hasn't really been ever clearly specified how many scenes Mann already had shot but I think its more than most people try to make you believe. Especially in the beginning there still quite a lot of moments that seem Mann-like, mostly with its character handling and interactions between the different characters. It seems as if it only are the last 30 minutes of the movie that feel typical Kubrick like and its no coincidence that the last 30 minutes of the movie are also the very best minutes of the entire movie.Because it really doesn't matter how great or lacking you think the first hours of this movie are, the movie gets made and comes totally together at its fine ending. I can definitely see still the flaws of this movie. The story doesn't always connect and its progress and characters are somewhat lacking at times. Suddenly Spartacus becomes the leader of the slave army, without a doubt or question from anyone else and not only that but he turns out to be a strategic mastermind, despite that fact that he had spend whole his life being chained and put to work in the mines. It are all little things like that that bug but like I said, the movie doesn't fully come together until its fantastic final 30 minutes, when suddenly everything works out amazingly and falls into its place.The true story of Spartacus always have been an intriguing one. A former slave who made the Roman capital tremble and this movie version of famous story is still the very best one of it out there. It captures a lot of its story and it actually tells it from many different perspectives. There are quite a lot of characters in the movie and the movie itself is also a real long one, with its 3 hours+ running time. But no, the movie obviously never bores, which is mostly also becomes of the many different characters and their viewpoints and plot lines.And the movie above most things still really remains an actors movie. It builds heavily on its characters, so it also relies heavily on its actor's performances. But with a cast like this movie had, that hardly was a risky undertaking.It of course has Kirk Douglas in the lead role but the movie its best performances come from its supporting cast members. Persons like Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov for instance. A whole bunch of familiar faces show up in this movie, even for some really minor parts at times.By todays standards, this movie might not be the most exciting one to watch out there but this is something that never bothered me. It always had been a movie to me that was about the story behind the story of Spartacus. Having said that, there are still a bunch of action sequences in this movie, as whole a a couple of really large scale sequences. After all, this movie is still really an epic, that's expensive- and big looking.Still the best, most impressive and the most effective telling of the Spartacus story.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic in every single aspect. Including length.,"Although Kubrick didn't have complete control over this film it still has the ambiance that he later perfects in his other masterpieces. I feel that this is easily his most tender film, which is a rare emotion for him, mostly due to the relationship with Spartacus and his consistent love interest. The factor I appreciated most was Kubrick's control over in front of the camera; every frame is busy and authentic, truly embodying the scale it so desires to be effective. It is a real treat to see Lawrence Olivier, Charles Laughton and (the right-fully award winning) Peter Ustinov, in delightfully developed supporting roles. The contrast between these men is the key factor and ultimately rewards in the climax. The score and cinematography are also outstanding. However, I do discredit it quite a bit for dragging too much in pace.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Epic, But I Have A Few Issues With It","While I love the cinematography on this feature and think the actors did a great performance, especially Kirk Douglas and Charles Laughton, I think the film has a few pacing issues. While I am not the biggest fan of epics, I think that they can be paced right. A film I think succeeds in being a epic and has great pacing is Barry Lyndon, Another Stanley Kubrick film. That film was better and flowed better but that could also be because of he had 100% percent control on that and very limited control on this.The film has a great message and succeeds wonderfully at explaining that message but that leads to another problem with this movie which is the script. It was written without Stanley's involvement in it and the ""comedic"" moments in it are bad which would have been helped if they let Stanley contribute.However in conclusion I think Spartacus is good enough to watch again but it has it's flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kubrick's Hollywood Calling Card,"Kubrick's films are sleepers. Not that Spartacus didn't make money on it's initial release in 1960. It was successful, both critically and commercially, but I had little interest in the film when I first saw it on TV when I was young. Much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick's films, for whatever reason, took a while to grow on me, and I'm not alone in this. Spielberg, Scorsese and other film making legends agree. But my local cinema had a season of Kubrick, playing 2001 and Spartacus. For the first time I saw them on the big screen, with the strident, thundering score, the amazing battle scenes and incredible cinematography, and I now love this film. 2001 as well.Kirk Douglas is great as the title character. Peter Ustinov's performance was fantastic, his Oscar win was well deserved. The most well known scenes are of course, the ""I am Spartacus!"" scene and the gladiator fight. But there's so much more to this film. Is it Kubrick's best? No. Kubrick disliked the film, and later disowned it, citing studio interference and what he considered to be a dumb script as the reasons why. I don't disagree, it is a flawed film, but still thoroughly enjoyable.Is it his most personal? No, but it is better than Ben- Hur and a lot of films from that era, and it's aged a lot better than other sword and sandals epics from the 50s and 60s. And the reoccurring themes in his films where man is made into a killing machine would reappear in Full Metal Jacket. Kubrick's films are in my opinion, some of the greatest ever made, they just take a while to creep under the skin.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""A Tendency Towards Corpulence""","Seeing Spartacus only weeks after Barry Lyndon you can see the similarities in terms of epic landscapes and mind-boggling scale but that's where the Kubrick continuity dries up and the rest of the film is an engaging but strikingly 1950s endeavour. The battles and the intrigue feel fresh and exciting (not to mention some envelope-pushing implications in the 1991 restoration) but the love scenes almost all feel like relics of an age even more bygone than the Romans. Stilted, cheesy and strange.

Sprawling inconsistent epic movie...,"1st watched 12/6/2014 -- 5 out of 10(Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Sprawling inconsistent epic movie directed by Stanley Kubrick with a very good performance by executive producer Kirk Douglas as Spartacus and good cinematography, but a story that has it's good parts and bad parts but not enough of the good to carry it over the top. The story is about a slave in Italy who starts an uprising that eventually rises up to fight against Rome itself. Douglas portrays the main character with passion and a performance where the camera just placed on his face tells his character's story. Jean Simmons portrays another slave that tweaks his romantic interests at a gladiator training facility, which he is transferred to after being bought by Peter Ustinov's character, that trains slaves and treats them like Gods until they are transferred to another facility where they have to fight to their death's for entertainment purposes for Roman citizens. Laurence Olivier's character, who is a wealthy influential person, visits the facility and forces the caretaker to prematurely do a couple of fights to the death including Spartacus. He survives, of course, but then starts the uprising upon hearing that Simmon's character is being sent to another location. This is where the film doesn't do a good job, in my opinion, because it makes it look like it all started over a lover's spat when obviously Spartacus had a bigger idea in mind. Douglas and Simmons carry on a very powerful screen romance but this overpowers the bigger story. He then commands the slave army to try and accomplish the task of freeing all the slaves in the whole of Italy. The political complexities in Rome and the conflict between the Roman characters actually slows down the movie. Olivier's character's motivations are never explored so the conflict between him and Spartacus is not a watchable piece of entertainment. There are some wonderful moments of cinematography especially the initial fight between the Romans and the slaves but these small moments don't sustain a full 3 hours plus. Not a worthless piece of entertainment, but not good enough to keep your full interest throughout the whole length of this long epic.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Only a simple man,"Any qualifying adjective that can be put to this movie will be short. This is not the epic film that many current generations are accustomed to see, but if it is for the time that was made even if it is ahead of his time and even if it break with the way it is accustomed to making this kind of movie, turning it into something more crude, more real, more visceral.It is not a moral analogy of the story of a man as Ben-Hur, nor are the downsides of a gladiator became a hero who defeats an empire, as in the film of Scott, Spartacus is not like any other genre movie or ""Roman-Christian"" theme is the vision, somewhat limited by the studios, of a simple man who revolutionized the movies with his magisterial work (Kubrick), which tells the story of another ordinary man who was not done for its time.Without so many claims Spartacus addresses the issue of freedom trough a clear way, it does so with the intent to make us believe in that principle, not transform us but yes to realize that the whole struggle is not in vain. It does not give hope, or provide answers, but if advised and drew the common man as the most important piece that should start to change in order to find the goal sought.Spartacus, said the prologue, was ahead of his time, like Kubrick and his esthetic and narrative style that can be found in each frame, his struggle as a creator of art is reflected in every scene. Kubrick is the Spartacus of movies, which advocates freedom of style, gender, leaving the stereotype and show something different, something innovative.Spartacus is Kubrick, and that is reason enough to consider this movie as a beautiful work of art ...

GREAT historical epic,"Taking place in ancient Roman times this deals with a slave named Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) who leads the slaves to revolt against their masters.Usually I hate historical epics like this. They look good and may have incredible battle sequences and a cast of thousands. But they also have bad acting, directing and terrible scripts with dialogue that makes you want to cut your ears off! However this one works beautifully. It is a little too long (3 hours and 17 minutes) but it's beautifully directed by Stanley Kubrick and has an excellent script by Dalton Trumbo. Also the acting is wonderful. Douglas, Jean Simmons and Tony Cutis are good in their roles but Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier and Peter Ustinov (winning an Oscar for this) are superb. I saw the 1991 reconstruction which restored the infamous sequence where Olivier tries to seduce Curtis and some gory (for 1960) battle sequences. Also I found the scene where Jean Simmons swims in the nude to be quite amusing. A great fascinating epic. Kubrick didn't like it which was a shame. An 8 all the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Big moments,"Overall, the film is pretty good.  Kubrick made good use of a script that could have turned out to be horrible and created one of the most epic ""Historical"" pictures ever.  It's authenticity is pretty good, although the American accents and glaringly ""Hollywood-ized"" dialog do hurt (as well as Jean Simmons' ""slave-girl-with-the-hour-long-makeup-job"" look).  These burps are more than equaled by the spectacular battle near the end and the engrossing political games played in Rome.  As far as actors go, it's a mixed bag.  While all of the performances were good, I was never able to accept Kirk Douglas and Jean Simmons in their parts (mostly because of the above-mentioned Hollywood corruption).

great story of survival and honor,"This is a rather long film but movies are generally better when long, only since LOTR have movies, mainly historical epics, are coming back to Spartacus like lengths.  This was a politically and socially somewhat radical film for its time.  Political games, power, and homosexuality were present in this film.  This film is generally historically accurate, but if it were exactly accurate, it would have had to show Spartacus as a man who lost 35,000 men because the germans refused to follow his orders and broke off with spartacus and eventually were slaughetred by a roman legion, a man who was trapped by his own men thirsting for roman blood and had a sense of invincibility.  This of course would have made a more realistic but even more of a downer emotionally to the audiances.With strong messages great acting and Quote like ""Id rather be here among brothers than to be the richest citizen fo Rome"" and ""We must stay true to ourselves"" makes this movie one of the best 100 of all time.  Spartacus was actually killed in the battle trying to get to Crassus, in turn killing 2 centurions outright.  His body was never found...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'm a sucker for old sword-and-sandals epics... so this one is right up my alley!!,"Just an all-around classic! Best film of 1960 (no small feat when the competition is Hitchcocks's best film - PSYCHO) and one of the greatest epics ever put on celluloid. Next to BEN-HUR and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS I can't think of another more worthy epic than this one. The cast is to die for! Kirk Douglas is perfect as Spartacus and Jean Simmons has never been better than here as Varinia (although she was also great as Diana in THE ROBE) but the real scene-stealers are the magnificent trio of Sir Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, and Peter Ustinov (who won the Supporting Actor Oscar). Choosing between these 3 is like choosing between your favorite children. Sometimes I really want to say that Olivier is my favorite but it's really difficult. All 3 are great! The battle scenes are some of the best you'll ever see from that time. Heck, there's a scene where a man's arm is hacked off completely. I mean that's BRAVEHEART material right there! But this was 1960! Great stuff. No CGI. Just hordes of men engaging in epic warfare!The interesting thing is that I am not a fan of Stanley Kubrick's. Not at all. But this one is an exception. Probably because it's not really a Kubrick film. Sure he directed it but it's not the type of film that he would normally direct. He was only brought in by Douglas to replace Anthony Mann after Douglas fired Mann. So it's basically a non-Kubrick film directed by Kubrick. And that can only be a good thing. At least for me. Kubrick is a master of the craft but the subject matter he chooses to tackle never interests me in the least. That's why SPARTACUS works so well IMO.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lot of politics and long scenes,"This movie feels very stretched and long for my generation, where we are used to snappy scenes which get to the point. Spartacus is the combination of two movies which is attested by its long running time. One movie is Spartacus very similar to Braveheart in it's portrayal of freedom. The other movie it's combined with is senatorial politics, with good writing but nothing connecting us with the characters. The outcome is a yawn fest in most scenes waiting for something to happen. Also the sound track becomes repetitive which makes it annoying. On the other hand there is grand scenes of spectacle which may have been something in the past, but compared with todays blockbusters, the scenes become drawn out.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Where Splendour Exists within Human Spirit,"Antiguity with its might and power, its mysteries and monuments that have survived for centuries...yes, they all make us believe in human possibilities, human skills. However, we often tend to skip the fact that it was not the splendor nor the power that made nations truly 'civilized' but the timeless spirit of dignity and freedom...In the history of great Hollywood productions, 1960 occurred to be a crucial moment for films, in particular epics set in the ancient times. The period of Cecil B DeMille's lavish spectacles was practically over; yet, the new challenges appeared: What historical figures will turn out to be appealing to the most 'up-to-date' needs of cinema buffs. There was a dilemma what hero to select. The choice went onto making a movie about Spartacus, the leader of slaves revolt during the Roman Republic. After David Lean had turned down the offer to direct the movie and veteran Anthony Mann had been fired, a young director Stanley Kubrick took up the task with the cooperation of Dalton Trumbo (the latter one, thanks to Kirk Douglas' help, managed to adapt Fast's novel to screen).Seemingly, the popularity of the film works like the wide acceptance of Spartacus and his struggle...more convincing with the passing of time. In the long run, people notice more and more merits in the film and, as a matter of fact, SPARTACUS was underrated in 1960 but was fully appreciated a few decades later. What is it if not a work that deserves being referred to as 'ahead of its time'?The major reason why we can consider SPARTACUS as an extraordinary epic is its extensive development of human psychology, of motives that govern human hearts, of reflections. At multiple levels, we encounter this in the main hero - a slave who is free in spirit, a charismatic soul, almost a dream-like hero ('idealized' to a certain extend). Yet, apart from this 'glorification' we clearly encounter a dream of one man which spreads and becomes the dream of many...what dream? The one about brotherhood against tyranny, courageous NO to slavery and to any humiliation. That aspect is executed in images and plots - the most memorable being, perhaps, the plot of Spartacus and Varinia (Jean Simmons)... his journey from ""I am not an animal"" to ""I love you more than life"". The beautifully symbolic scene when Spartacus and Varinia talk about the wind and wonder where the wind comes from occurs to represent this quest for knowing oneself, knowing the other person one loves. What a terrific moment! At the same time, the extraordinary aspect of development is intensified by the notion of justice...that has not been taught to people but the true Justice that is present within any cautious heart. Spartacus believes in Justice, he believes in Freedom and, like Jesus Christ, he ends up on a cross. HOWEVER...while Jesus clearly represents 'Crucified Glory of Love', Spartacus manifests 'Crucified Dream of Freedom.'The great merit of SPARTACUS, therefore, does not lie in spectacle or thrill but in the sophisticated glimpse of many characters. Apart from the main hero, we get the insight into slaves and free Patricians, the poor and the rich. Jean Simmons as Varinia - a woman who finds the love of her life; Tony Curtus as Antoninus - a young boy, a poet, a dreamer who lives his ideals...slaves that deserve to be free---the quintessential characters of the film's message. The wealthy Roman characters naturally appear in opposition to the film's spirit. Here comes Laurence Olivier as Crassus, an ambitious, powerful man of Rome, someone who cannot stand any 'no' meant to subvert the established ORDER. His patriotism equals with superiority of one group. He believes that ""Rome is an eternal thought in the mind of God."" He is, at the same time, a bi-sexual character attracted by Antoninus. Just before the boy runs away, there is a famous scene when the two share a bath together: ""I like both oysters and snails."" Besides, there is the Best Supporting Actor Winner - Peter Ustinov - as Batiatus, the corpulent lanista at the gladiatorial school of Capua, a decent man who rather finds understanding in the warm house of a corpulent womanizer, senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton) than at the luxurious mansion of proud Crassus. Patrician women are portrayed memorably, yet a bit sarcastically, by Nina Foch as Helena Glabrus and Joanna Barnes as Claudia. They are hungry to see muscled men fighting to death. They depict decadence being clearly aroused lustfully by selecting the half naked bodies of gladiators.Another merit is the sophisticated music composed by Alex North. In its uniqueness and meaning, it is comparable to the music by Miklos Rozsa in QUO VADIS? Having extensively researched the historical background and some information on ancient rhythms, Mr North collected the instruments of the time, like lute, mandolin, kythara, dulcimer, and bagpipes and, consequently, created a dramatic effect. The most memorable theme is Spartacus-Varinia love theme.The symbolic moments and visuals lead us to the world of that period and touch viewers. We see the unforgettable images of parents burying their beloved child, nostalgia in the eyes of old people, tears of brotherhood in mutual struggle and horses escaping the horror of war. Except for some historical errors (e.g. the fact of Roman garrisons) the film can boast of a very realistic depiction of the battlefield, the nicely reconstructed every-day life in Rome, including saunas, gladiatorial school and wardrobe. That all makes SPARTACUS nearly a masterpiece.There are many Roman epics but only few can stand alone, as unique and significant ones. SPARTACUS, with the splendor rooted in human spirit, is surely one of them.""...as long as we live, we must remain true to ourselves,"" whispers the voice of freedom. Yet, there is another voice, the voice of tyranny which shouts loudly enough to tread its way of destruction: ""CRUCIFY THEM ALL!"" The whispering voice, however, lives on...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Kubrick at his most commercial.,"Not half as good as Kubrick's Paths of Glory, but at 3hrs and 17mins it's twice as long. Kirk Douglas, superb in Paths of Glory, is not always effective or varied enough here and the film's wayward focus makes for a wearying and sometimes tedious 3 hours. The interior set design is unpersuasive as well as uninteresting. The varied cast includes Olivier and Laughton who seem at home in their roles as well as Woody Strode who cuts a striking figure, a rather embarrassing Tony Curtis, handsome John Gavin and beautiful Jean Simmons who is moving particularly in the film's satisfying last scene.

A 60s epic done correctly,"The late 50s and the early 60s was the heyday of the big screen epic film. many were spectacular, while a few missed the mark.Spartacus was a spectacularly successful epic film in every way. The cinematography is rich and gorgeous. The cast and acting are superb. The story is sweeping and engaging.Spartacus tells, in broad strokes, the true story of a slave uprising against ancient Rome. Of course, the history is so far back that the real details have to be obscured by time, but in general the rebellion went on for a considerable time as the escaped slaves roved around the peninsula making trouble and dealing successfully with the smaller Roman forces sent to take care of things. Once the Romans got really annoyed, however, they got serious and defeated Spartacus' forces.Kirk Douglas gives his average outstanding performance in this movie, bringing the slave/gladiator to life right before your eyes. The deciding battle near the end is truly spectacular.Spartaus is a must see film for true fans of film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Quite possibly the best of the sword and sandals epics but doesn't feel like Kubrick.,"Stanley Kubrick's films from as early as ""The Killing"" to the last, the near miss that was ""Eyes Wide Shut"" all demands that the audience keep their focus on the screen through every scene, through every shot, through every frame of film. This film however feels pedestrian in certain scenes as if directed by an ordinary Joe not the great Kubrick. Apparently Kubrick came in after production had started, even so the majority of the film was his.Two moments that stands out as being Kubrick's happened during the gladiator combat. One when the gladiators were fighting and our focus is on Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Grabus (John Dall). The other is when Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) tries to see gladiators fight each other as he wait his own turn. Some of the battle scenes and scenes of slaves marching toward freedom look nothing special. But the pivotal battle sequence was outstanding. However some of the more quieter moments is nothing special, such as when Antonius (Tony Curtis) performs a magic trick or moments with Spartacus and Varinia (Jean Simmons). They could easily be from any other movie.The main story of course is a slave revolt is started by the slave/gladiator Spartacus. The gladiators free themselves and free other slaves and attempt a mass exodus out of Italy is planned. In Rome however the politicians debate the crisis while jockeying for position of power. Key among the Romans are Crassus who represents the Patrician (who believes that the right to rule is a birthright) and Gracchus (Charles Laughton) who represents the Republicans (who believes in democracy). This is probably the first and only time in the History of Hollywood that the word 'Republican' ever represent something that might be good. Ironic that it was written by Dalton Trumbo a victim of blacklisting. Anyway forget about that, the whole Roman subtext is about how politicians exploit a crisis to gain power.Although this is an epic and the characters are suppose to be larger than life I thought there were very good human moments. Among my favorites are the father-son like relationship between Spartacus and Antonius especially in the end. Some of the moments among the gladiators while they were in the school, when Betiatus (Peter Ustinov) offers to take Gracchus with him as he is about leave Rome. even the controversial snail and oysters scene was very well done.The performances were good especially Olivier, and Laughton, although I think Peter Ustinov gave the best performance although it did feel like it was comic relief. On the whole I thought was very good but is not prime Kubrick.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Bog-standard ""epic"" movie from that period","Almost identical to Ben-Hur, but without all of the out of place christ stuff.The 2 main actors are the definition of ""wooden"", and the totally forced and completely pointless and asinine ""romance"" between them is 45 minutes (at least!) of the movie spent watching 2 puppets trying to have a conversation or being very bad at showing any sort of recognizable human emotion.This movie is NOT about the slave uprising, but about an inept love story between marionettes, conveyed with the emotion of a fly landing on a piece of bread. I cannot for the life of me understand why the movie couldn't JUST have been about the cool, historical stuff, but NEEDED a love interest tacked on for the historical person in question!About the only character whom I could empathize with was Peter Ustinov's character: he was endearing, pragmatic, and most importantly an actual human being that I believe could have actually existed.This movie suffers greatly from ALL of the usual annoyances that kept most movies from before the 1960's (a time when we saw the greatest revolution in cinema since its inception) from achieving greatness and posterity, chief amongst them being the horrendous acting which I have mentioned ad nauseam so far.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Gladiators don't make friends,"This is a review of the 184 minute version; note that this includes the then-typical(for this genre) opening overture and intermission. Being that I love the work of Kubrick, I do what I can to watch all of his work, and thus I was thrilled to finally find a copy of this. In addition to the big part this played in bringing down the blacklisting of McCarthy's reign of terror as it were, this continues to be an important film with an excellent message that ought never to be forgotten. It can be recognized as one of Stanley's pictures, (well, almost as much as any of them can, anyway); we get the long takes, some of them with vast camera pans and dolly trips. He did not get to alter the script, but it is quite good. The women in this are strong(and not merely for the time it was made), and yet credible and not excessive. In general, the characterization is impressive. The acting is marvelous, and the casting is spot-on. Douglas shows that a performance can be amazing even with extended periods of not talking. There is an astonishing amount of extras in this, and the little moments of life seen in the camp scenes help make the cause seem all the more worthy. The visuals are stunning, and the editing and cinematography deliver unforgettable images. This is epic in scope and the music fits this. It feels authentic and realistic, and effectively conveys the atmospheres it goes for. The combat sequences are well-choreographed, exciting, incredible, unpredictable action, driven by the terrific FX and stunts. Dialog is spot-on. There is a lot of moderate violence and disturbing content, a little mild language, occasional obscured nudity, and one brief suggestive exchange. The DVD comes with production notes and a three minute trailer. I recommend this to anyone interested in the story, and any other fans of the director. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kind of lame,"Finally saw it and I've got to say, in a lot of ways it was pretty bad. The Roman power politics, and the final battle scene were great but not enough. Why would anyone follow Douglas' Spartacus? He doesn't appear to have been a very bright general, or even a particularly good gladiator. We keep hearing about the great victories his army wins, why don't we ever see one. Any scenes with Spartacus and Varinia were atrociously get-up-and-rummage-through-the-fridge bad. And the score was deadly, even embarrassing at times. Why put an extended version in the director's cut? I've got to assume Kubrick had little control, the music he chooses is usually fascinating and none of his touches caught my eye.

'Spartacus'...Too Sentimental for Roman times.!,"I have watched this movie maybe a dozen times since I was a kid, why, I do not know? Well, I suppose it's an afternoon entertaining movie when nothing watchable and interesting is on TV. I do find it a long drawn out & dreary movie at times though, focusing too much empathy for Douglas' character in the most cheesy way. I find Kurt Douglas' portrayal of a slave turned Gladiator quite lymp, sympathetic and too emotional.! Far more emotional than one would envisage of a violent and condemned slave! That soft romantic music score is really quite annoying and literally present in almost each and every scene 'Jean Simmons' and Douglas characters appear together in! It takes away the whole ambience of what the movie is really about. A love scene is one thing, but theirs goes beyond belief. Woody Strodes' character is believeable, as is that of 'Oliviers'. Peter Ustinov steals the show (as usual) unlike his performance as Nero in 'Quovadis'...

One of the Greatest Casts You're Ever Going to See,"Spartacus (1960)**** (out of 4)Born a slave and trained as a gladiator, Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) leads a revolt against the Roman Empire and the evil Marcus Crassus (Laurence Olivier) so that slavery can come to an end and his men granted their freedom. This story has become rather legendary due to the power of the film itself and even if you're not a movie buff there are so many sequences in this film that everyone knows. Of course, the biggest is the ""I'm Spartacus"" sequence and while this is a beautifully mounted scene, there are many others that are just as powerful. In this era of Hollywood it seems an epic was coming out every few months and it's my opinion that this here is among the greatest ever made. I mean, just take a look at the cast, which includes not only legends Douglas and Olivier but also Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, Tony Curtis, John Ireland, Nina Foch, Herbert Lom and even Woody Strode has a brief part. So many brilliant actors in one film certainly makes SPARTACUS stand apart but there are many other things that really help this.The epics of the silent era really weren't any different than those made in the 50s and 60s and there really no different than what's being made today. They contain great battle scenes and SPARTACUS is full of them. You can tell where the money was spent as we get thousands of extras and it's really amazing to watch a film with all of these people in real costumes and acting out these battles. One can't help but wonder what producer Douglas and director Kubrick would have to do in order to get everything ready to shoot. These mammoth battle sequences really are jaw dropping and especially the final ones and wait till you check out the burning logs that are rolled down the hill. One wonders how no one was injured or killed. Even the earlier stuff in the gladiator school is perfectly handled as we get some great battles to the death between slaves.Most epics featured these great battle scenes but to me what really makes SPARTACUS stand out are the brilliant performances and the incredibly touching personal stories. The love story to most films kill them because they're often not needed but the work between Douglas and Simmons is beautifully done and it features some of the greatest writing in Dalton Trumbo's career. The fireworks between the two stars really come across on the screen and you can't help but feel their passion as well as their love for one another as they try to gain their freedom. Both actors do a marvelous job as does the rest of the supporting players. Curtis probably wasn't the greatest choice for his role but he gives it his all and delivers a fine performance. Laughton is so lovable in his scenes and his final are incredibly touching. Ustinov is the master that he's always shown to be. Olivier delivers one of the greatest performances from any epic and he also makes this character one of the most hated in film history. If you can feel the love between Douglas and Simmons then you can feel the cold evil that is Olivier.There are a few problems with the film with one being its 197-minute length, which is a tad too long. One other problem is that the music score is often used in places where it would have been better left silent with the actors doing what they're there to do. I think there were a few too many times when the ""LOUD"" and ""BANG"" of the score took away from what was on the screen. The one objection that I've read that I'm highly against is that Kubrick wasn't the right man for this picture. I've heard some call him a ""director for hire"" on this and that he really couldn't deliver ""his type of movie"" but I find these comments laughable. This is very much a Kubrick picture as you can see that in the style and without him who knows how these movie would have turned out. I've heard many people say Kubrick was a cold filmmaker and that he had no heart but I think the final thirty-minutes of this film proves that wrong. The final sequences are so incredibly powerful and emotionally rewarding that one can't help but be brought to tears by their beauty. SPARTACUS, with its terrific screenplay, brilliant acting and strong direction really stands out in a crowded field of epics.",,Anonymous,Biography

Slave Revolution.,"Kirk Douglas is magnificent in director Stanley Kubrick's epic retelling of Spartacus, who was a Roman slave who was drafted into gladiator school, where he learned both the combat and military skills that would later prove to be invaluable to him, as well as hardening his hatred for and resolve against Roman rule, when he leads a slave revolt that grows to astronomical proportions, posing a real threat to the Empire, thus inspiring many political machinations among the Roman senate involving both Senators & Generals(played by Sir Laurence Oliver, Charles Laughton, and Peter Ustinov) that plan to defeat Spartacus' army. Jean Simmons plays the woman Spartacus loves, and Tony Curtis plays his fellow slave and loyal friend.Large-scale production is most impressive and powerfully told, with few lulls in its 3+ hour length.

One of the most intelligent and moving of the epics,"There are of course flaws in this film and they are detailed in other reviews. Some of the exposition is leaden, the women have ridiculously elaborate hair styles, and the dialogue at times is weak. There is a sentimental streak, though it's nowhere near as intrusive as a Spielberg version would be. But its excellent qualities more than make up for this. First the acting. The slaves are not that impressive but the Romans more than make up for it - the Brits Olivier, Laughton and Ustinov make a phenomenal team. Then the action sequences, brilliantly staged and among the best ever filmed. Most important, though, is the handling of the story which manages to be equally moving and thought-provoking. We know hardly anything about the Third Servile War and nothing at all about Spartacus's character and motivations. The overtly Marxist take on the revolt is, well, as convincing as any (freedom for all blah blah) but the way it is woven in with the politics of the day is brilliant. For my money this is the best of all the epics - more consistent than El Cid or Ben Hur, which have dated much more. Incidentally, the novel on which the movie is based, Howard Fast's Spartacus, is awfully heavy going, and I admire the way the script writer Dalton Trumbo gave it the necessary tension and momentum.

Luckily Kirk Douglas knew better than Mel Gibson, and hired the director with whom he had worked in ""Paths of Glory"", a much better film. Imagine both Braveheart and Spartacus with younger actors, playing William Wallace in his late 20s (Gibson was around 40 in 1995) and Spartacus in his middle 30s (Douglas was almost 44 when the film was released). And believe me, a decade does count. The rapport with younger audiences would have been much stronger. But in any case, younger or older actor, the final result was not very good.

"I change my mind, I'm not Spartacus","This film is entertainment. It is very broad and lenient with facts. But why not? No one really knows a lot about a guy who lived 2000 centuries ago. Scholars can't even agree on Jesus, and he had more identified eye witnesses than any character before the printing press. Spartacus leads a rebellion against Rome composed of gladiators. How they are initially formed is hypothetical. Once you get several hundred, it is easy to recruit more and more, however. It isn't a spoiler to say Spartacus eventually gets caught, but not before he has several victories. In this, the film is pretty accurate. Kirk Douglas isn't the epitome of Spartacus. Most gladiators who were slaves from conquered lands were from the East, and would be darker than the Romans, who had a lot of blonde and fair citizens at the time. Their dark skin and hair really evolved later when they began intermingling with what they called the ""Orientals"". However, some slaves were from the North, so it isn't beyond possibility. Douglas doesn't seem large enough, however, to be a leader of gladiators. One would expect a towering figure to be Spartacus. That said, this has a lot of adventure and intrigue. Most of the story deals with Spartacus as an alien force, focusing more on two factions of Roman citizens trying to win control of Rome. Of course, one must mention the famous line, when the gladiators are caught, and Spartacus is told to identify himself. I doubt that when the film was made that they realized this scene would become one of the ten greatest known of all time. A fun movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Lesson On How To Miscast a Movie,"I have watched this film three times in my life. I kept trying to understand why anyone would enjoy the finished product. I can only reason three aspects of the film are appealing. (1) Most of the supporting actors were great including Olivier and Simmons. (2) cinematography (3) set design. So, why do I rate this film a 1 out of 10?Lousy acting and miscast ""actors"" Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis. They are so miscast you think you are watching a satire of some other movie. (Reminds me of a Carol Burnett sketch, except she did it better). I can only guess that with all the millions spent on the production they couldn't afford a dialect coach, or maybe they knew it was a lost cause, so we painfully hear Douglas do this hammy schit speech pattern and Curtis's Brooklyn accent in 25 or so B. C.. They are both such poor actors they can't pull it off and they make the entire movie REDICULOUS. Was Douglas such an egotist he didn't think his 1960s Supercut hairdo wouldn't look as REDICULOUS as his ""performance"". They RUINED this movie in my opinion. My rating of 1 was a sympathy vote for the other actors and their efforts to hold back their laughter and embarrassment at its premiere.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
UK Imperialism Endures despite the evidence,"Peter Morrison writes in a recent review of Spartacus ""Only the ending lets the film down. Do we really believe it was worth all the suffering to free one woman and a baby?""In light of this opinion,  it is no surprise the UK continues to suffer from the ""The Troubles"".  It is amazing that the bulk of the UK continues to be governed in part by a landed gentry whose claim to legitimacy is attributable to an accident of birth. How are the excesses portrayed in Spartacus all that  different than the well documented history of ""The Empire""?Fortunately,  my forefathers 200 and 3000 miles due west of Nottingham believed that ""the suffering to free one woman and one baby""  was indeed a noble cause.  ""Spartacus"" remains relevant, at least for the sentient bits of the free world, nearly 40 years hence.",,Anonymous,Biography
Good,"First off, any movie with Olivier and Laughton in two major roles has to have some redeeming value.  They are two of the finest actors I've seen on screen and they lit it up in Spartacus.  Yes, Gladiator ripped off Spartacus in many ways and then turned it into a melodramatic circus.  For the critics of this film, you have to give it the credit of being realistic unlike Braveheart and Gladiator which were poorly done.This isn't a real Stanley Kubrick film so don't go into it thinking you're going to see something innovative and ground-breaking.  This is just a movie.  Kubrick inherited the movie and the script mid-production (I think the story goes) and wasn't super pleased with the result of this film. Too many people were pulling him too many ways.  I missed the homosexuality references, but that's probably because they were disguised and I wasn't looking for them.  Sadly, I'll probably never watch it again.  Very long film, but worth a viewing.  8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Much more than just ""Kubrick's Hollywood movie""","Though it is now recognized as a classic, Spartacus was notoriously disinherited by its director, the late, great Stanley Kubrick. His hatred for said picture derived from the fact that he wasn't involved with the project from the start (which is why his name is nowhere to be found in the screen writing credits), but hired only after original director Anthony Mann was fired (the only remains of the latter's work is the opening sequence). Given Kubrick always demanded total control over his pictures, it is understandable that he came to despise his only real ""Hollywood movie"". Nevertheless, Spartacus is a great picture, one that, alongside Ben-Hur, has defined the epic genre for years (and if the best they can make nowadays is Alexander, then its position remains unharmed).The film stars Kirk Douglas, one of the few actors to have worked twice with the director (their previous collaboration was the anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory), as the eponymous slave who finds himself in the middle of a political war between Roman senators such as Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Sempronius Gracchus (Charles Laughton). Seeing the chaos that is rising throughout Italy, he decides to organize a rebellion, gathering a massive group of followers, including Crassus' former servant Antoninus (Tony Curtis). As the situation gets more preoccupying, the common people watch as Rome is threatened by thousands of ""inferior"" individuals, led by a charismatic man who believes in justice and freedom.It is probably the aforementioned beliefs that upset Kubrick, famous as he was for almost celebrating misery and decadence in his films. In fact, despite the famous all-but-cheerful ending (brilliantly spoofed in Monty Python's Life of Brian), Spartacus is one of cinema's best representations of free will and courage prevailing over oppression. Much of this is due to Douglas' performance: playing it both ferociously determined (when Spartacus lectures his comrades and prepares for the imminent battle) and touchingly tender (when he meets his future wife, played by Jean Simmons), his performance transcends the character's mythical status and lends him a humanity that makes him instantly likable. Also remarkable are Peter Ustinov, playing slave merchant Batiatus (and winning an Oscar for it), and Olivier, particularly in the now infamous, audacious for the time, seduction scene with Curtis, where food is used as a metaphor for men and women (ironic, if you consider Olivier's part in that scene had to be re-recorded by Anthony Hopkins).The best epics are those that blend the spectacular and the personal, and that is where Spartacus truly succeeds: like Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia, it never sacrifices characterization in favor of action, but lets the mesmerizing (and, as opposed to more recent genre films, bloodless) battle sequences be a part of the protagonists' development, bringing the movie closer to Asian ""wuxia"" movies such as Hero or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than Hollywood blockbusters like Troy.So, in a time where the epic has lost most of its charm, movies like Spartacus are even more essential now than they were before. It may have been dismissed by Kubrick himself, but everyone seems to like it, and for a good reason: there is a heart beating beneath the eye-popping exterior.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Epic Scale, Some Stumbles","Spartacus is a classic epic that still manages to impress with its grand scale and powerful storytelling. Kirk Douglas delivers a commanding performance as the titular character, bringing a blend of strength and vulnerability to his role. The film's battle scenes and set designs are impressive, capturing the grandeur of ancient Rome and the brutality of the era with striking authenticity. The script, with its sharp dialogue and memorable lines, adds depth to the film's historical drama.However, while the film is visually spectacular and boasts strong performances, it does have its flaws. The pacing can feel uneven, with some parts of the story dragging on longer than necessary. The film's length may also test the patience of modern viewers, as some sequences feel stretched. Additionally, certain elements of the plot and character development can come off as melodramatic, which might detract from the overall impact for some.Overall, Spartacus remains a significant and engaging epic with a grandiose portrayal of its historical setting and strong performances. Despite its occasional pacing issues and melodramatic moments, it continues to be a compelling and memorable film that showcases the strength of classic cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
not your typical gladiator movie,"A really great film...not at all like any other ""gladiator"" film.  The film takes its power from the book by Howard Fast (who was an admitted communist) and the writer, Dalton Trumbo, (blacklisted for 15 years as a communist). This relationship must have given everyone on the set another context in which to conceive of the film, considering that this film broke the blacklist, and several blacklisted actors were used as well.  The movie is really about humanity, the joy of freedom (however fleeting) and the tremendous hatred the slaves had for slavery.A lot of the film is made in Spain...interesting considering that Spain was run by a fascist dictator (Franco) at the time.  There are a strange bunch of extras used in the film...elderly twins, dwarves, really elderly women, etc.  It was a good technique to give a feeling of reality....The love scenes between Spartacus and Vorynia are just beautiful, and I love the music which accompanies them.Kirk Douglas' finest film, bar none!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tolerable,"This film is based loosely on the life of the historical figure of Spartacus - however it is based on a novel written slightly before the film was produced and released.The writer was worried about the Mccarthy era witch hunts and were this could lead violating American liberties,
Karl Marx also admired the figure of Spartacus in a similar manner.Now back to the film, it is produced in a very interesting way with great orchestra music and a good cast though I think Jean Simmons was the wrong choice for the female leader who in the original source was German.As said it is not based on the actual historical events which is different and can be found in history books, however there are some minor errors in the details of the film.Thrace was not Greek - Thrace was in what is now Bulgaria and Spartacus himself was most likely an early Romanian, with his fellow gladiators being from what is now France and Germany only.The film portrays Spartacus almost like a prophetic or philosophical figure akin to Moses and Jesus - something he would never of been but rather like Che Girva or the Bin Laden of his time, at the end scene we see him almost like Jesus on a cross "" I pray to a god of slaves"" and Varina like Mary Magdalene he did not die for a social or political cause, he died on the battlefield in historical accounts for his own glory.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautifully shot historical epic that is truly memorable,"(Referring to the Criterion Collection's 192 min. version) Oh man. This film just oozes bigness. Not without a touch of the old school Hollywood over-drama, or camp, but it's almost endearing here where it would otherwise be lame. The cast is certainly something stellar: Lawrence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov and Kirk Douglas all in epic movie mode. Perhaps the most worthy reason to recommend Spartacus is the photography. The word epic gets abused left and right these days but this film IS epic. Stanley Kubrick may not have had much creative control with the film, but his cinematographic work is evident and it is awesome. Huuuuuge landscape shots depicting thousands of soldiers on the move, climbing mountains, fighting, etc. (and filmed in 1960 no less!) yet the vastness is not overwhelming and the focus is steadfast. The grand presentation of Spartacus features an overture and intermission, etc. which showcases Alex North's somewhat bombastic but often beautiful score that is also a constant throughout the film's action. This gives the film more of an operatic feel, likening it perhaps more to something like Eisenstein's Alexander NEVSKY than to Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR. In the end, SPARTACUS more than holds a candle to the historical epics made today and certainly outshines several of its contemporaries. If the length doesn't scare you off (around 3 ½ hours), SPARTACUS definitely worth a close viewing and a good discussion.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Still the Best Freedom-Fighter Story of All Time - Spartacus,"This modest, low-budget film, starring Kirk Douglas and several B actors is OK, if you like that sort of thing. Just kidding. This is one of the finest spectacles ever made. Almost every actor associated with the film made tremendous contributions to the story of a slave that rose against Rome. Tony Curtis, even with his heavy New York accent, is still very good in the film. Laurence Olivier is great, as usual. Jean Simmons is absolutely smoking hot, and a great actress to boot. And Peter Ustinov brings some of the lighter moments to the film with panache. The screenplay is outstanding. There are very few spectacles that can match this film in every area of production and scope. Only Lawrence of Arabia and Ben Hur are its equals. Be sure to see this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Tale of Two Epics,"Two of the most impressive historical epics of the 1960s were released within one year of each other--Spartacus in 1960 and El Cid in 1961. While that fact of itself is not particularly noteworthy, these films have a curious intersecting history that is not generally noticed.The Anthony Mann Connection: This veteran director was the original person hired to helm Spartacus. As is well known, he and star Kirk Douglas had a falling out early in filming. Mann was summarily fired from that production and replaced by Stanley Kubrick. However, shortly thereafter, Mann was retained by producer Samuel Bronston to stay in Spain and go immediately into directing El Cid. Why did he fail to meet Douglas's expectations on Spartacus and then be entrusted by Bronston with the costly production El Cid?The Herbert Lom Connection: The well regarded British character actor best remembered for his bumbling role as Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther comedy series had speaking parts in both Spartacus and El Cid. In the former, he was the crafty agent working with Spartacus to provide ships for his fleeing rebellion army. In the latter, he played Ben Yussef--the North African fanatic bent upon conquest of the Iberian Peninsula and ultimately Europe and the World.The Theatrical Running Time Connection: While different sources provide various answers to this question, the critic Leonard Maltin states that both Spartacus and El Cid at their theatrical release had an identical running time of 184 minutes.The Plot Similarities Connection: Both films feature leading male characters based upon real life persons, whose activities ultimately elevated them to mythological/legendary status. The films also had similar endings and featured a hero who was inspired to accomplish great deeds notwithstanding a nondescript early life.The Cast Similarities Connection: Both films starred male actors then at the very prime of life--Kirk Douglas (44) and Charlton Heston (38). They also co-starred them with considerably younger women--Jean Simmons (31) and Sophia Loren (27). In Spartacus, the age difference was 13 years while in El Cid the difference was 11 years.The Oscar Connection: Both films were considered for multiple Academy Awards. El Cid received three nominations but no wins. On the other hand, Spartacus garnered six nominations and four wins (including Peter Ustinov for Best Supporting Actor).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lord Larry likes oysters and snails,"Sword and sandal epic finds Spartacus (Douglas), rising from servitude to king of the rebellion and the bane of would-be supremo Crassus (Olivier) misled at every opportunity by the wily and politically savvy Gracchus (Laughton). Joined by fellow slave John Ireland, he sets out to escape the continent, emancipating the chained masses along their way, much to the chagrin of the Roman senate. When John Dall's appointment as garrison to Rome fails to subdue the rebellion, Laughton's democratic grip is over-awed by Olivier's potency as a charismatic warlord and purveyor of the romantic ideal of Rome. But the canny Laughton still has one last master stroke to play.The intense rivalry between Olivier and Laughton's characters is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this film. Watching the titans trade barbs and try to out manoeuvre the other as they position to instill their ideology for Rome in my opinion dwarfs Douglas' title role, relegating it to that of virtual bystander. Jean Simmons is radiant as Spartacus' wife and later, Olivier's bargaining chip, while the supporting cast including Ustinov, Curtis, Ireland and Dall, all execute well (sans John Gavin, wooden as Julius Caesar). Special mention to Woody Strode in a silent but expressive role as a gladiator against whom Douglas must fight to the death. His dignified presence and integrity are character defining of both Olivier's psychopathy and Douglas' pacifism.Sharp and sometimes poetic script by Dalton Trumbo, colourful sets, costumes and location work complement the aforementioned acting credentials resulting in a truly grand spectacle that even at three hours remains compelling. The quirky sexual undertones aren't especially subtle (don't miss Olivier's ""I like oysters and snails"" metaphor to Curtis, who promptly high tails it to the rebellion); Nina Foch & Joanna Barnes' apparent interracial fantasies for Woody Strode and Laughton's own chubby-chasing fetish nods to the decadence of ancient Rome, but also adds the unique Kubrick watermark, a signature of his distinct, eccentric style. Worthy of its reputation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Good entertainment that dispatches drama, politics and action in equal measure.","The tale of a Roman man born in to slavery like his father and his before him - but breaks out to lead a rebel army against his former slave masters. Based on a true historical story.My first problem with this review is that I don't like ""swords and sandals"" generally and maybe this is a chance to get of my chest why. Well, for a start I don't envy anybody in these things. What is wealth when you have nothing to spend it on but houses, women and wine - and even then you have to be very lucky. In those days everybody was poor - even the very rich!Given the above paragraph it might surprise you that I actually like this film, although with grave limits. This is Hollywood Rome where day-glow teeth abound and even female slaves look like they have wandered out of the beauty salon. Given that Kubrick (a late replacement director) was an intelligent man he must have been having a laugh when he presents props such as maps that are almost perfect.Like all of these sword-of-justice products the hero (Kirk Douglas in the title role) seems to have wandered in from another age and can point out all the errors, foibles and injustices that those in power perpetrate. Naturally such heroes have few faults themselves and never say anything non PC.Douglas enjoys running, jumping and fighting - so he spends a lot of time doing just that. Tony Curtis fancied himself as a magician (he even did an act on stage) and he shows us that he was quite good at it. Here he plays a rather effeminate man who learns to fight rather than entertain.Lawrence Olivier is often described as the greatest actor in the world. At his peak this may even have been true. He dwarfs everyone as bisexual warrior and diplomat Marcus Licinius Crassus. Years of stage of experience allows him to say things in a way that you believe that something important is being said - but have no real idea why!Peter Ustinov (Lentulus Batiatus) loves playing callous snakes and here he really goes to town as a slave-master. What a trophy cabinet the two of them have! Generally the film falls in to the trap of having the villain doing something interesting - or at least something that looks interesting and political - while the hero does little but fall in love and make speeches to men who seem to hang on his every word. This doesn't make him very interesting and the script seems to know that - happy to push him in to the background until Sparticus is actually needed.Without entering in to spoilers the end is downbeat rather than triumph. A hint at a better world, but little more. This was rare for films of the time and a brave step.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Effective swords and sandals film although not to be taken as history,"Really a film at two levels.  Kirk Douglas and chums clad in designers slave sack cloth take on the might of Rome, while two great classical actors - Lawrence Olivier and Charles Laughton -  grapple politically for control of the Roman state.  Around both sets of characters moves the not inestimable Peter Ustinov as a trainer of gladiators. Implausible as it may seem, the film works at many levels. The writer and director both suffered during the McCarthy communist witch hunts in Hollywood and their experiences are allowed to come out during the film.  Many are not aware of the way most of those persecuted, as well as those who associated with them,  were black listed by Hollywood.  Kirk Douglas showed some guts both in using the duo and in allowing them so much free rein.  This said, the film does not suffer for this input in any way. The suffering of the two gives a strong air of reality to the picture.The film has three action scenes, the Gladiatorial contest being by far the best.  This is an impressive piece of cinema, where two athletic actors stage a fight to the death for a group of half interested Roman nobility. The ultimate battle starts well with the Roman army marching up in a massive chequer board formation which then forms into a great useless square ready for Spartacus to break up with blazing log rollers. This aside the battle is still worth watching and it does finish as it really did. Only the ending lets the film down.

Possibly Kubrick's greatest epic,"Stanley Kubrick was a director of vast talent. And by vast I mean that his movies are really not much alike. Sure, he liked to stick to certain themes, like war, madness and ego, but his genres varied wildly. 2001: A Space Opera is a scifi horror thriller. The Killing is a mobster heist film. Barry Lyndon is a period piece.And in Spartacus he dabbled with the genre of epic historical drama, akin to Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments. The movie is about Spartacus, a real historical figure, who among others led a slave uprising, known in history as the Third Servile War, against the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC, just before the rise of Julius Caesar.And the movie certainly feels like an epic. It's over three hours long, takes place in ancient times, deals with fates of nations and is about a singular figure defining the shape of their time.Yet it moves with effortless grace. It's over three hours long, but it sure doesn't feel like it. The interlude helps, giving a natural place to pause the film and visit the fridge, or what will you. But it's also in the storytelling. Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) goes through many phases in his lifetime and these help break up the story into segments. The acting is also phenomenal, as are the sets and the cinematography in general. Rarely has Ancient Rome looked more alive, grandeur and magnificent.If I had to nitpick, I'd say the ending is a bit of a downer. It's historically accurate, certainly, but that only makes it worse.Still, what we have here is a gem of a movie. Vast in scope with a sense of scope. Definitely worth a watch if historical epics hold a place in your heart.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Kubrick Masterpiece,"Intro:Stanley Kubrick is one of the best filmmakers to ever live. And one of his films goes by the title of Spartacus. This amazing 3 hour epic that details the slave rebellion Spartacus lead, is entertaining from start to finish. Feeling surprisingly short for a 3 hour film. It's basically a masterpiece in every way.The Good:The film's story chronicles the rebellion of Spartacus. As he finds love, and we see it from the sides of the Roman Government and the Slave Rebellion. And this film is epic in feeling, with lots of style, but also good writing to back it up. From the character of Spartacus, really well adapted from the book, and while much is fictionalized, that doesn't mean it isn't well written. We also see the harsh reality of slave life in the Roman Republic. And we see the build up to the rebellion, as we watch, waiting for it to happen. The film also looks spectacular and the musical score is really well done. With sets that are very well built. That also look historically accurate, and gives the film an epic feel and scale. However, that doesn't mean it's flawlessThe Bad:However, I can still find issues, as I think the romance between Spartacus and Varinia is rushed. They fall in love instantly. And some of the acting isn't very good. I remember when I watched the film in 8th grade Social Studies, one delivery was so funny, that the teacher re-winded it, because it was so unintentionally funny. And maybe that's just old school acting, but I think I can tell the difference between old-school acting, and good acting.Conclusion:Even with the issues, Spartacus is still a movie that works really well. Stanley Kubrick is masterful in his directing. The film feels epic, having elements of tragedy in it that I love, the sets are nice, most of the acting is good, and it's simply a classic. It may have some issues, but I still love this film, it was also a little ahead of it's time. And this is easily one of the best works of Stanley Kubrick, and a great piece of history on film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Story of the Roman slave that attempts to lead a slave revolt against the might of Imperial Rome,"""Spartacus"" used the talents of Kirk Douglas and the other members of the cast to invoke a strong message against the ancient practice of slavery. Based in part on an actual time in the history of Rome, Spartacus, the slave portrayed by Douglas, does remain true to the times of this screen epic.Kirk Douglas did have a hand in some of the production tasks of the film, but the major part of the work goes to Stanley Kubrick.  While on camera, Douglas delivered a performance that should have won an Oscar, but did not. However, Douglas did a lot of the physical stunts involved with the film, and delivered a very fine on-screen performance.  Other members of the cast that made this film stand out were Jean Simmons, as his wife, Varinia, Charles Laughton, as a Roman senator, Laurence Olivier, as Crassus, the one that ultimately captured Spartacus, John Gavin as Julius Caesar, Tony Curtis as a friend of Spartacus, John Ireland and in a role that many actors relish, Peter Ustinov, who trained the slave as a gladiator, and then saw him lead the uprising against Rome.  Battle scenes are first-rate, the gladiator contests are well staged, and the viewer is taken back to the city streets and arenas of Rome, when that location controlled all the known world.

"""I AM SPARTACUS!!!"" And I was moved to tears!","A truly moving portrayal of slavery in Roman Times, and one man's self determination to do something about it, against impossible odds!Spartacus is a classic amongst the classics. Not quite so pompous as Ben Hur; not so overdone as Ten Commandments. Spartacus offers a comfortable middleway between being a cultured movie & mass-acceptance movie.Kubrick's direction has never been better, especially during the final battle scenes, and the rather subtle & discreet scene between Olivier & Curtis sharing a bath together - a lot of the cryptic dialogue between  the two probably went straight over the heads of a lot of viewers, myself included initially.But this is the work of Kubrick. Not only can he provide the audience with what they want to see - action, pathos, drama etc; by the same token he can provide us with little hidden delicacies that tease us & tempt us, once we've unravelled their meaning.I was also taken by the wonderful score by Alex North, especially at the very beginning during the title sequence.The actors all take a share of the spoils. Simmons, Ustinov, Curtis, even the cameo from Woodie Strode, play with a certain majesty that is needed for a weighty film such as this. Kubrick knows how to tap the best out of some actors, and here is no exception.Of course the true honours are shared by Olivier and Douglas. In a way the characters they play is like a metaphor of their real acting abilities.We have in the red corner, Laurence Olivier, playing the sweeping & majestic Crassus, leader of Rome (in all but name), who rides his white horse with an air of arrogance & godliness and you feel could crush Spartacus with one hand. And we all know Olivier's true acting pedigree both on stage & on film, be it Shakespeare or a ruthless Nazi dentist, Olivier always has that aura of class about him.While in the blue corner, Kirk Douglas, playing Spartacus, the David to Olivier's Goliath. But a man, a little man, who stands alone in defiance of dictatorship, and almost succeeds. And then we can contrast Douglas' films and see that even though his portfolio is not quite so grand he does & has produced/acted in a great number of memorable movies.It's not often I shed a tear at the movies but after the final battle scene, the victorious Crassus wants to know who Spartacus is amongst the walking wounded. One by one they stand up and declare ""I, am Spartacus!"" while Douglas looked on, the tears rolling down my face!Spartacus is perhaps slightly over hyped, but its a very good & thought provoking movie for all that.****/*****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A classic epic movie,"Spartacus is the definition of an epic Hollywood movie.  It's not a film; it's a movie.  There are no hidden meanings, no tricky camera work, and no brilliant dialog.  It's just a fun, epic film.Now all of that is the exact opposite of the type of films that Stanley Kubrick makes.  Kubrick makes smart, cold, beautiful films that use visuals to tell the story instead of actors, usually.  Kubrick never made popcorn movies.  He never made fun movies (except for Dr. Strangelove, possibly). So it's no wonder that many people do not consider Spartacus to be a Kubrick film.  Well, it's not.  He may have directed, but this twisted Kubrick love child is not a ""Kubrick film"".  It's a Hollywood picture.Now that doesn't mean the movie is bad or anything.  Oh, God no.  The movie is great.  It has great acting, a cool plot, cool action scenes (and for a movie made in 1960, that's pretty good), and most of all, it's just down right fun.  It's a long movie, but it's still fun.Normally in my reviews, I rant for as long as I can about every little aspect of each film.  I do this because I want to make sure I say EVERYTHING I want to say about each movie, because I hate writing more than one review for each movie.

By modern standards some scenes may be slow but overall the pace was appropriate for the sombre story of downtrodden slaves seeking freedom from manipulating Roman overlords.The colours and cinematography are excellent.  Alas I can only imagine how it looked when first released in 1960.   The restorers have worked well but the clarity of the picture has been lost in parts of some frames.  The casting is good with all turning in good performances in their roles.Leaves the modern efforts like Gladiator looking flashy but lacking depth and scope.Given the number of times this has been shown on TV it is obviously still popular with many of the viewing public.  However if you do get the chance to see it on the big screen in 70mm it is still worth the entrance fee.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sincere, optimistic Roman epic","Yes, I know I shouldn't comment on other people's comments, however silly they may be; but sometimes they may represent commonly held falsehoods.  So let me state: (1) No, it is NOT worth killing thousands of people in a civil war in order to free one woman and a child, and (2) The film never claims that it is.  `Spartacus' is, indeed, an optimistic film; with an ending of neither unrelieved gloom nor unleavened triumph; but what MAKES it an optimistic film has nothing to do with the way it ends.Instead the optimism derives from the following ...  The ancient world was a brutal and uncongenial place, and a modern human rights activist, the sort that your average Hollywood director would so glibly plonk in amongst the togas, would be crushed within a week - and it would only take that long because of the lack of attention he would get.  `Spartacus' is a plausible story of how noble aspirations might grow and even flower out of such unpromising ground.  That Spartacus could achieve anything at all is a kind of a triumph.  Of course, it's not enough for the movie to SAY this; it also has to build the world carefully, so that the message I mentioned doesn't seem like a post hoc attempt to wring some hope from the mud - and it doesn't.It's also a grand old epic, obeying all the rules of the genre.  It looks as if it had as many extras as the Romans themselves had.  It has battle scenes.  It has more great actors than you can poke a stick at ... among them Peter Ustinov, who gave his best performance: a caricature of a slave owner, but a realistic and insightful caricature.  It has great photography. (Kubrick couldn't use a camera clumsily if he tried.)  It covers a great deal of ground, with two or three apparently disparate plot strands turning out to belong together, without coinciding too neatly.  It creates its own world.  In every respect (musical score excepted) it towers over every other ancient world epic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

History vs. Modern Politics,"The release year of 1960 is significant. America was still living in the long and shameful shadow of the actions of the House on Un-American Activities Committee. This was followed quickly both by the Korean War (a struggle for freedom) and the Civil Rights Movement (yet another fight for freedom, but this time in a supposedly already free America). It was noted at the time that all these events had parallels to the wars in the period of the late Roman Republic. Howard Fast set his novel SPARTACUS during that time for obvious reasons. It wasn't just a novel of an ancient uprising, but a political statement on his own times. A few years later, novelist Taylor Caldwell would dedicate her 1964 novel of Cicero (""A PILLAR OF IRON"") to the memory of President John Kennedy. She also stated that any similarities between ancient Rome and modern America were intentional.Producer Kirk Douglas' deliberate choice of Dalton Trumbo (a blacklisted American screenwriter) to write the script for SPARTACUS was a bold political move. Douglas' choice of a book source was just as deliberate. Howard Fast was also the author of ""April Morning"" a very patriotic and heroic tale of the American Revolution.For an interesting, and different, take on the story of Spartacus, read Colleen McCullough's third novel of ancient Rome, ""Fortune's Favorites"" which she insists was based on reliable ancient sources. Here, Spartacus is not an ignorant slave but a Roman officer who, found guilty of a crime, must choose between execution or life as a gladiator. Being a former officer, he is thus able to understand the tactics of the legions sent against his slave armies. The conclusion also shows Spartacus and his wife sailing off on a pirate ship into a luxurious exile in a foreign country hostile to Rome.We should be clear, in our praise and admiration of Kirk Douglas' heroic version of Spartacus, that we are not giving in to an idolized legend rather than the true story of the real man. The script's message is simple and straight-forward (or, perhaps too simple?): tyranny must always be fought and defeated by brave warriors fighting for human freedom. Thus the story of SPARTACUS could be set in any age, especially America at the beginning of the decade of the 60s. Such messages raise up heroic figures, composed of unequal parts of truth and legend. It will never be possible to present a true and accurate picture of the ancient past in movies. Movies create images, shadows - legends. They are not historical truth. They are ""movie truths."" We must be certain that we know the difference.",,Anonymous,Biography

Amazing Restored Version,"In Ancient Rome, the rebel Thracian slave named Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) has been working in the salt mines since he was twelve. When he attacks a guard, he is left in the sun to die of starvation. Coincidently, the owner of a gladiatorial school Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) is seeking slaves to buy for his school and likes the ferocity of Spartacus and selects him. He is trained by Marcellus (Charles McGraw) to become a gladiator. When he meets the slave Varinia (Jean Simmons), they feel attracted by each other. When Batiatus receives the visit of the powerful Senator Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and his friends, he buys Varinia and asks four gladiators to fight to the death to entertain his friends. One of them is Spartacus that survives. On the next day, Marcellus provokes Spartacus, and he kills him, initiating a rebellion of the slaves. They flee and begins an uprising in Italy, threatening Rome. Crassus assumes the legions to destroy Spartacus and the slaves.""Spartacus"" (1960) is a fantastic epic adventure based on the legend of Spartacus, the leader of the Gladiatorial War against Rome some decades before Christ. The plot of this movie is indeed an epic adventure in Ancient Rome based on a true name worshipped by the slaves based on Howard Fast's novel and adapted to the cinema by blacklisted Dalton Trumbo using an alias. The grandiosity of the feature is impressive. Yesterday was the first time that I saw the restored version of ""Spartacus"" (1960) on the Universal DVD, and I dare to say that it is an amazing restauration. There are scenes that were not included on the VHS (and the original release); sound on DTS; many Extras with interviews, footage from the premiere and with the lead cast; deleted scenes and others. It is interesting to learn that Anthony Mann has only shot the Death Valley scenes in the salt mines and the producer Kirk Douglas had a quarrel with him and replaced Mann by Stanley Kubrick. There is also the information that it was the most expensive feature produced by Hollywood until 1960. The cast is amazing, with names such as Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, Tony Curtis, John Gavin, John Dall among many others. The number of extras, mostly in the battle scenes, is also astonishing. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Spartacus""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Pre-Lawrence of Arabia epic has naive characterisation of Spartacus, but still, doesn't get enough credit in Kubrick's canon.","Spartacus is a slave... He wants to be a King... There's only one way to go about it...Its love story, and the character of Spartacus, belong to that old-fashioned school of naive epics, where the hero is relentlessly deified and praised as perfect.Its just too damn simple. The revisionist epics, like Lawrence of Arabia, are much more interesting - they are an investigation into the character of the hero. They do not therefore have to be perfect, only interesting. They are more interesting, therefore, and realistic, if they are imperfect.But all the same Kubrick fans don't give Spartacus enough credit. I always figured the most amusing thing in it was Tony Curtis' Brooklyn accent in the middle of this ancient Roman epic. But then I realised many of its characterisations are done with humour: Laughton and Olivier give performances which are tongue in cheek and camp. But best of all is Peter Ustinov, who lights up the screen with a very unique character.Kubrick's mastery at choreographing mass crowd scenes is evident here. It is a gorgeously photographed epic - and, if you're a Kubrick fan, a sumptuous and satisfying experience.Its musical score also has a gorgeous love theme.8/10. Spartacus is without a doubt an accomplished and above-average film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kirk Douglas' movie,"I realise it is the norm to refer to a film as the director's 'baby' as in ""Ridley Scott's 'Alien'"".  However, to refer to ""Stanley Kubrick's 'Spartacus'"" I find ridiculous.  Clearly, it is Kirk Douglas' movie through and through and he employed Kubrick for his undoubted skills as a filmmaker. Not withstanding Kubrick devotees, ""Spartacus"" will be remembered as Kirk Douglas' movie and (IMHO) rightly so.Outstanding performances abound - Douglas, Olivier, Laughton  and Ustinov are all outstanding - whilst, as comparisons with ""Ben-Hur"" are often made, perhaps shares its only weakness with the other great epic in that the love story elements are a little mushy today.  However, the romance between Spartacus and Varinia is more engaging than that of Judah Ben-Hur and Esther.  For Antoninus to proclaim his love for Spartacus - having just been terminally wounded by him - was rather cringe-worthy it must be said.Pushed to it, I still prefer ""Ben-Hur"" and the somewhat maligned ""El Cid"" but ""Spartacus"" remains a classic.I liked ""Gladiator"" very much too - and while it is not a competition - I do think ""Spartacus"" is the better movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
The Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"I have seen well over a thousand movies in my life and Spartacus is the best I've seen by far. Unlike Gladiator which it is compared to, Spartacus does a great job in developing the characters in the movie. While Kirk Douglas did a masterful job, Lawrence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, Jean Simmons, et al, gave masterful renditions. The climactic battle may have lacked the enthusiasm of the opening battle sequence in Gladiator, but the dramatic approach of the Roman legions on the field of battle was breath taking, particularly with the dramatic music score by Alex North.I've seen this movie at least 10 times and intend to see it another 10 or more.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good body with a dull brain is as cheap as life itself.,"This Stanle Kubrick classic appears to have it all. The set decoration, cinematography and costuming are all superior. Also excellent was the editing, score, and, of course, the direction by Kubrick.The cast was superlative. Kirk Douglas (Lust for Life, The Bad and the Beautiful, Champion) as Sparticus really gave us an outstanding performance as the man who took on Rome. Not until Gibson gave us William Wallace do we see a champion of the people fighting for freedom.We cannot neglect mentioning Laurence Olivier as Crassius, Jean Simmons as Varinia, Peter Ustinov as Batiatus, and Woody Strode (The Quick and the Dead) as Draba.The restored version of this film goes 3 and a half hours.

The gladiators revolution,"There are several versions of Spartacus'life, and this drama was made based on the story written by Howard Fast seconded by the famous cinema writer Dalton Trumbo, blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, in the early 50s in Hollywood for his left wing ideas. For a film made in 1960, this is a very educative material and also very provocative for its time. The cast better cannot be, Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis together with the long-experienced and efficient British actors/actress as Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons and Peter Ustinov, simply the best. Probably someone like the Russian director/actor Serguei Bondarchuk (War and Peace, 1968) would have prepared several sequels of this film, but Stanley Kubrick and his group opted for a long film, everything in one shot. Due to its length probably Kubrick could not include some more historical facts. For example, the film starts showing Spartacus already as a slave, when he was first a shepherd in Tracia, then became a soldier of Roman army, he deserted and became slave, and later was sold to an school of gladiators. These sequences are not shown or were not prepared in the film. I do not know either whether Fast included these facts in his book. The other thing is that Spartacus moved with his army up to the Alpes then came back to the South looking for the sea, this was not shown. Crassus had three battles against Spartacus, and he was defeated by Spartacus in the first two. The film only shows the final one. Finally Spartacus body was never found after the final battle, and here you know what the end is. In any case, the material is excellent, useful for everybody to know a bit of history and how things went in despotic Rome at that time. In addition, acting of Charles Laughton as Gracchus and Laurence Olivier as Crassus were certainly the best. The rest did a very good job, but Laughton and Olivier, who were not friendly at all among themselves, excelled in this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Hail, Spartacus!","I must admit I am always taken aback when I see how many negative reviews there are about ""Spartacus"" on IMDb. But of course, I also appreciate that many generations of reviewers have been born since it was made who didn't stare up at that Super Technirama 70 screen as a 12-year old boy in 1960 to be totally overwhelmed by the experience.Nostalgia plays a huge part in the way we remember movies, but I'm obviously not alone in my love of this one. I remember one of the guys who restored ""Spartacus"" for its 40th Anniversary saying that it was one of the reasons he got into movies. I can totally relate to that.There was just something more immediate, more intense, even something more modern about the movie. From Alex North's opening fanfares to Saul Bass's crumbling Roman statue behind the main titles, you knew you were in for something different.Just compare the costuming in ""Ben Hur"" with ""Spartacus"". In ""Ben Hur"", everything had a shiny, glitzy look that almost suggested costumes made by clever parents for a Christmas pageant while ""Spartacus"" had a more muscular, functional look.Then there were the actors. Kirk Douglas as producer had mostly given British actors the parts of the Romans, and American actors the roles of gladiators and slaves to create an interesting language scheme; it worked well. Ustinov and Laughton got the most out of Dalton Trumbo's urbane and often witty script while Olivier conveyed much with just a look. You sense that although his Crassus knows he will defeat Spartacus in battle, he will never defeat his spirit.And Douglas stands up to all those esteemed British actors, gutsy really, but he wasn't outclassed at all and such intensity, I believed him; he was Spartacus.Now this was a pretty adult movie for it's time (some scenes were cut), and the audience went very quiet indeed during the heavily-shaded scene where Jean Simmons took off her clothes in Spartacus' cell. I'm surprised they even let a 12-year old in; it was such a tightly-buttoned era.There have been other attempts at ""Spartacus"". A version with Gorin Visnjic was so lacklustre I don't know why they bothered. Then there's the recent Kiwi mini series. I know some like it, and it does weave more of the real history throughout the series, however, it goes for a graphic novel approach, which I find very repetitious. Along with everyone yelling like they are dealing with strangulated hernias, I didn't see one scene in all its monochromatic, CGI weirdness that remotely approached those sunlit scenes in the 1960 version of the slave army on the march propelled along by Alex North's stunning score.As for all the political criticism levelled at the film at the time; 'Marxists in togas' etc., it just went straight over my head - it still does to be honest.I know there were battles between Douglas and Kubrick behind the scenes; two strong characters butting heads, but between them they achieved something unique even if they didn't go to each other's dinner parties ever again.No, it's the original ""Spartacus"" for me. Whenever I watch it I can still feel its power.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The story of a slave fighting for freedom.,"This is by far the best movie that Kirk Douglas ever made. Douglas plays the part of Spartacus, a Roman slave on death row who is sold to a gladiator school. At the school, he is put through many exercises to turn him and the other misfortanat slaves into gladiators who will have to fight to the death when they are  finished with their training. But before they could get sold to the statium there is a fight in the mess hall and soon the gladiators have broken out. Spartacus has a plan to go and free all the slaves in Rome and fight back against it until things are the way they should be. Another face in this film is Tony Curtus who plays another slave who escapes and becomes a warrior for the gladiators in the war for freedom against Rome. The film was directed by the one and only Stanely Kubrick. This was one of his first films but still one of his best. The film also being executive by Douglas was a way to get back at Ben-Hur for not giving him the main role but merely offering him the role of Charlton Heston's enemy, Messala. Not being allowed the main spot light Kirk found a way to hit back at Ben-Hur with Spartacus.Over all I give this film a 4 out of five.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly an epic...,"Epic is a word that's always brought up when people talk about Stanley Kubrick's 'Spartacus'; and those people aren't wrong. Not even counting the fact that it's over three hours long (making it the longest movie I've ever seen), everything about this movie is grand. The locations, the imagery, the cast, the battle scenes – it is, without doubt, an opus.Spartacus is about, well, Spartacus, a slave during the Roman Empire. Always the rebel, Spartacus manages to escape from slavery and, together with the other slaves, starts a revolt. A rebellion turns into an army, and Spartacus is soon battling the entire Roman army.What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said already? It's a stunning film, definitely one of the best period pieces in cinema history. Don't let the length of the movie fool you: yes, it's a bit of a chore getting through it, but your reward for persisting is a well-written, beautifully-shot, brilliantly-acted film. Deservedly so, everyone points to Kirk Douglas' performance as the titular hero; he is fantastic in it. I'd say, though, that other actors outshine him in the movie. In a small but emotionally charged role, Tony Curtis is brilliant. So too is Peter Ustinov as the greedy Batiatus. And we haven't even mentioned Jean Simmons and Laurence Olivier. This is a film made up of legends.What really resonates for me, though, is the aesthetics of the whole film. It's a visually pleasing film. Whether it's the gladiator training scenes, or the climactic battles at the end, Kubrick shoots them with such majesty and beauty. It's interesting that Kubrick directed this. This is the same man that gave us films like 'The Shining' and 'A Clockwork Orange', where everything is a little bit left of centre. Here, it's all played pretty straight up; it doesn't feel Kubrickian at all.But regardless, it is his movie, and he's made a brilliant one. I don't think it's the best Kubrick movie, but that's like saying 'Come Together' isn't the Beatles' best track. It could be, if there weren't so many other ridiculously good songs. I've seen a few 'epics' in my time during which I've fallen asleep halfway through. Take it for it's worth, but I didn't fall asleep during this.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Historically inaccurate, but just so darn entertaining","This movie does some weird stuff to the Roman time line (the special appearance by the by that time long-dead Gracchus comes to mind), but that's not really the point of the whole thing. It just wants to show you a beautiful spectacle, and it really delivers. From the first minute in this movie is incredibly compelling, mainly because of the portrayal of Spartacus, which strikes exactly the right tone. Kirk Douglas gives him a lot of different aspects, a lot of good and bad points, which really helps showing of his human side. Kubrick directed, but he never really manages to put his own identity into the movie. However he does manage to create some really marvellous battle scenes, which I guess is the next best thing. This movie isn't better or worse than his later works, it's just really, really different from them. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, totally worth the three hours.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Powerful, magnificent","""He'll be back. He'll be back and there'll be millions of him."" Such is Spartacus, an achievement in film, with massive scale and thousands of soldiers, but also moving: several 'manly tears' were shed. Spartacus is inspiring.It's a story that by today you've heard several times before, of one standing against many with impossible odds. But Spartacus isn't about winning, its that even a small person can make change; in this case freedom. Freedom, which the film points out, isn't eliminated for another 2000 years.Leading the charge is Kirk Douglas as the heroic, immortal Spartacus. This is his film- he looks like a revolutionary, he sounds like it, and he acts like it. Kirk shows finesse, as a capable fighter but more often a capable leader. He laughs, intimidates, sheds a few tears, and explodes on a few occasions, but he's completely believable and that is why the film is so successful.I've mentioned how epic the film is: battles, while sparse, are gigantic and all the fights are intense and really well organized. With its Roman setting, the sets are extravagant and luscious, the costumes equally remarkable. It's a beautiful film.Spartacus will get to you- seeing him on his quest, growing stronger, growing happy, seeing the loyalty of the freed slaves. By the time the climax comes, you feel the immeasurable daunt of the challenge. Then, THE scene arrives, and the past two and a half hours become 100% worth it. The ending is excellent, not cheesy and happy or completely miserable, but very fulfilling and satisfying.Spartacus is phenomenal and relevant. It's a great tale with dramatic irony (Caesar!) that shows the cruelty of a superpower. Timeless. 8.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

He leads a revolt at the school and achieves freedom with the other gladitor/slaves. They build an army with the intent of fighting their way out of Rome and going back to the countries of their birth, where they will live as the free men they once were.

"I Finally ""Get it"" After All These Years","I've watched this movie several times throughout my life but it was only extremely recently that I came to appreciate it for the triumph that it truly is. What is the difference? SUFFERING. Forget about the fact that as a smaller child I probably didn't comprehend the entire plot and what was happening, but it's when you start to understand what it means to truly suffer and what it takes to rise above it can you appreciate this film for all that it is. An entire lifetime of living in the ""pit"" of slavery is WAY beyond MY ability to understand. But I've watched several of my closest family members die in the past 3 years. Learned what it meant to not have a home or a friend. And to have sickness take away control over my own body. These elements are all found in this movie. They are all the true attributes of being a slave. Slavery: You own nothing; Not even yourself. Nobody to call your own. No home. Unable to even have a friend. As Spartacus says, ""Death is the only freedom a slave knows"". yet he ends that sentence with, "" ... But that's why we'll win."" Because a slave has no fear of death. And with that one spark of hope, the hope that there is something ""better"" than the life he's living. And that HOPE jumps to a flame when one life is given as a sacrifice. It's not actually Spartacus that starts the revolt. It's Draba! It's his life that is the catalyst for sudden and massive change. Back in the days when Rome was in control of the world and it had a god for everything (probably even a sneeze), Spartacus says, ""I imagine a god for slaves ... and I pray. I pray for a son who will be born free"". His hope isn't even for himself. And in my own ""pit"", my Christian hope burst forth and I finally understood why Jesus had to come as a meek and humble servant. So that we would know that there IS a God for slaves, because each of us is a slave to something. When Spartacus is ""wooing"" Varinia it is the simple touch of their hands and the first person to show concern for her (""Did they hurt you?"") that breaks down the walls to her heart and allows her to give it to Spartacus. Would she have loved him as deeply if he wasn't a slave too? And so I watch Spartacus and comprehend it. Not just because I understand how it fits into history, but how it fits into ME. A God for slaves. Yes. A God who understands my slavery and woos me so I am free to love Him back. Not because He has power over me but because he understands what it means to be a slave BEFORE He came into power. Truly an epic that transcends all that is in the human heart. At last I ""get it"". Watch it again and glean your own hope knowing that someday the darkness will end and hope will reign. That is what makes this story an epic. transcendence. And know that there is most definitely a God for slaves and so ... you are understood. Sincerely, Laura-Lee",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Even not writing, Kubrick still awesome!","Does it possible that the rebel Kubrick could make another masterpiece, even without writing it? ""Spartacus"" was the only film in which Kubrick was hired to direct, but he still managed to make another classic masterpiece for his resume.""Spartacus"", after ""Ben Hur"" is another grand epic in the history of cinema. It doesn't reach his feet's clearly but with Kubrick, the film managed to give a great sense of history and the same time originality. The story, obviously, talks about the slave Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) who was born from a line of slaves under the Roman Empire and one day he came to be a gladiator. But he couldn't take-it anymore so much injustice around him to all the other slaves beginning a gigantic revolution within the powerful Roman Empire that caused major damage into the heart of the empire.While the film can be a good adaptation of the true historical hero that was Spartacus, but what leads to the problem of the film is that with so many characters together, ranging from gladiators to Roman senators, their relationship of them seems to be at the background having little character's developing, even Spartacus himself, but not everything is lost.Dalton Trumbo (script) gives the film an excellent writing and great dialogs between the characters managing to keep the film on a very realistic style (which later served as inspiration for ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator""). But even with Dalton writing the film, it is obvious that Kubrick rummaged around giving an intriguing human philosophy into the film.This is more clear at one scene with the cruel senator Crassus (Laurence Olivier) talking to his slave Antoninus (Tony Curtis) in an indirect way the definition of what is a slave and their obedience to the master and to Rome, with a dark and somber tone with the Kubrick style. But even with the somber tone and the slave and master philosophy, the film also gives a philosophy to the cause of Spartacus. That their fight for freedom its not only a physical victory, but also a moral one.Not only Kubrick gives the film a great philosophy, but also gives a great direction with fantastic and lush scenery. It also delivers fierce and realistic fighting scenes giving the film a certain brutality (very advanced for its time).""Spartacus"" despite the failure on the characters developing it managed to be amazing. A fantastic direction and excellent writing with an intriguing human philosophy alongside with a superb cast full of lecherous performances by Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton, ""Spartacus"" is one of the most beautiful epics ever made in the cinema history.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""They  Were  Just  Slaves  ...""","Along with ""The ten Commandments"", ""Ben Hur"", ""Quo Vadis"", ""El Cid"" and perhaps some other one this film stands as one of the best spectacular epics of the genre's golden age back in the 50's and early 60's. In spite of some inaccurate historical events (Spartacus died in battle and was not crucified, for instance) director Stanley Kubrick clearly succeeds in transmitting the spirit of the Tracian gladiator's famous revolt against the powerful Roman republic in search for freedom, that became a myth.Kirk Douglas if not rendering a perfect performance all along the film deliveries his incredible and magnetic screen personality and fits perfectly as Spartacus. Laurence Olivier handles easily his role as the arrogant and ambitious Crassus in love with Rome and himself. Charles Laughton (as populist senator Graccus), Peter Ustinov (as the gladiators training school owner Bathiatus) and pretty Jean Simmons Varinia (Spartacus woman) conform a really impressive and strong cast. Tony Curtis as the poet slave and Charles McGraw as the tough gladiator's trainer are very convincing too. Perhaps the weak link in this aspect is John Gavin's young Julius Caesar, too wooden and definitely lacking the ""phisic du rol"" (Ceasar was not a tall man and he was bold already in his youth). Nina Foch, Woody Strode, Harold Stone, John Ireland and mainly Herbert Lom as the treacherous sylesian pirate Tigranes Levanto complete a high quality supporting cast.Good action and battle scenes, lots of extras (no computers back then) perfect settings, well designed gowns and armors and a powerful and accurate musical score by Alex North are also highlights in this great movie.A true classic in its genre!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
EXCELLENT EARLY KUBRICK!,"One of the few epics of the time period that is Great! Kubrick and Kirk Douglas didn't get along apparently, but the film is right on the money. Laurence Olivier gives a masterful performance as Crassus, a powerful military man enjoying the fruits of his labor. Kirk Douglas in intense and human, Peter Ustinov (OSCAR winner) is hilarious, Charles Laughton majestic, and Jean Simmons beautiful and touching. The battle scenes are intense and incredible.A 9 out of 10. Best performance = L. Olivier. Except for LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the best epic of the time period. Blows away Charlton Heston's BEN-HUR. Check it out! Excellent cinematography and scope. Don't be a snob by avoiding this one!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Epic Success,"""Spartacus"" remains an epic success even on DVD.  It was released in 1960. This was at a time when the modern computerized imaging was not available. The mob scenes are made up of real people, and this cannot be accomplished any longer because of the overwhelming cost to the studios.  There is truly a need to see this film on the big screen.  However, with a good sound system and big screen there is adequate appreciation for the film.  Kirk Douglas plays the lead role in Howard Fast's greatest novel.  Jean Simmons plays Verinia, the slave woman with whom he falls in love.  Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov give perfect performances as Roman senator and Gladiator school director respectively.  If one has not seen it before, it should be on their must see list.  It is a classic for all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
second half is brilliant,"""When a free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life. A slave loses his pain. Death is the only freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it. That's why we'll win.""Spartacus is widely considered to be one of the best epic films ever made. I had my expectations set pretty high, hoping to see some awesome battle sequences, a great script, and beautiful scenery. Throughout the start of the film (a couple scenes before the intermission), I was disappointed. Sure the movie's beautiful, but it was missing the X-factor of what makes a great movie. Things just weren't clicking. A romance was desperately trying to blossom and the story just wasn't as engaging as I'd hoped.Eventually though, all the pieces of the story start fitting together. We start to see more of Laurence Olivier, and the romance, though cheesy, is developed more. After the intermission, Spartacus turns into an entirely different movie, with brilliant lines and breathtaking shots. I've never seen a movie do a complete 180 as dramatically as this one. I absolutely love the last half of this.Kirk Douglas basically owns this movie, but I'm not as impressed by him as I am with the supporting cast. Laurence Olivier is terrific as Crassus and Peter Ustinov gives some great comedy that isn't cheesy or dated at all. Kirk Douglas is solid, but I feel a different actor could have given a similar if not better performance (I kept thinking Charlton Heston).The last half of the film contains so many unbelievable shots. Kubrick does his best to convey emotion to the audience, showing the happy and the sad. Showcasing this emotion makes Spartacus over three hours long, but I think every minute of the movie counts, and I wouldn't take out anything, though the beginning scenes could be shaved.What I found most interesting is that the overall style is a mix between the trademark style of the Golden Age era and more modern filmmaking. Spartacus has obviously influenced other great movies, and it's interesting to connect later films to Spartacus.I loved the second half of the film, but upon second viewing, I'd skip most of the first half. It's not bad, per se, just unimpressive. To truly be taken away by the beauty of Spartacus start at the intermission.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Truly Great Sword and Sandal Epic,"Spartacus is probably the best of the sword and sandal movies of this era. The film is taut, thoughtful, well-acted and not overly long. There is equal measure of action, love scenes, and Roman political intrigue; therefore the film doesn't bog itself down in any one area or cliché as some of these epics do. This makes Spartacus a well-balanced movie that is really watchable.Great sets, great costumes and great actors compliment a brilliant script. The film is very well produced and effectively directed. The fight scenes are extremely absorbing - especially the fight-to-the-death pairings watched by Crassus (Lawrence Olivier), Glaborus (John Dall) and the Roman ladies; the love scenes are touching (first time around anyway); and the scenes of political intrigue in Rome are an excellent off-set to the plight of the gladiators.By including the political scenes, Kubrick added a tremendous depth to Spartacus. The political play-off between Crassus (an optimate), Caesar (a populare) and Gracchus (head populare) add a great historical flavour to what was going on politically in ancient Rome at the time, and help no end to take the weight off the 'fighting for freedom' motif of the film. These scenes also provide us with a great subplot involving Gracchus (Laughton) and Bataiatus (Ustinov). The research for these scenes was done well, and the script is very intelligent, incisive and sharp.The film fails in some areas though. The good versus evil motif was clearly intended as American Cold War era propaganda. Note the monologue at the start of the film which states that Spartacus was dreaming of an end to slavery ""forty years before the coming of Christ"" and ""2000 years before slavery would end."" The monologue infers that Christianity does not favour slavery, but freedom. This was not the case in the ancient world - bishops kept their own slaves, and Jesus Christ and St. Paul themselves do not denounce slavery, but instead use it as a metaphor for being a 'slave of god.' To the early Christians, and Jesus Christ, the social position you held in life was not important, what was important was if you had been a good person and served your master well, for it was the afterlife which counted.It was also impossible for someone in the ancient world to envisage a world without slavery. Spartacus would not have had the slavery-free world of our own, in which freedom is a right and not a privilege, to compare his own to. Slavery had always been a normal, intrinsic part of ancient society. Slaves may not have liked to be kept prisoner, but they would not have been able to comprehend a world in which such a condition did not exist. This heavy-handed aspect of the movie is an American manufacture - creating a protagonist and antagonist situation to suit the times in which the film was made.Nonetheless, this is a minor quibble that can be overcome by the merits of the rest of the movie. Spartacus is a finely crafted outing that takes the audience along in an involving and sweeping story that is well-acted, well-scripted and which takes the trouble to add a good amount of depth to its otherwise engrossing subject matter. A solid 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
""" When one Slave says  no!  It's a victory.  We were Tens of Thousands who said No! ""","The Slave Revolt of the year 71 B.C. was set to record by several Roman authors. The primary source was said to have been Plutarch, the Roman Historian. Now centuries later a masterful novel, written by Howard Fast and a spectacular film directed by Standley Kubrick, brings the ancient warrior hero "" Spartacus "" to life. Because the sketchy sources of his life and actual military accomplishments are so wrought with inaccuracies and speculation, much of it, serves only as a collection of supposition or historical conjecture. Still, with that as a foundation, the movie makers have done what they could in creating a viable film version of the man's life and death. Like many other Blockbuster movies, this story is packed with Hollywood superstars all jocking to be the most visible on the silver screen. Kirk Douglas plays Spartacus, the ancient Gladiator who refused to accept the yoke of slavery and caused all Rome to fear for it's safety and political republic. Laurence Olivier plays Crassus, the wealthy, autocratic and power hungry General who needed his Triumverate and Eight Roman legions to confront the Slave rebellion. Charles Laughton is Gracchus who tries to prevent Crassus from becoming a Dictator in Rome. Together with Tony Curtis, Woody Strode, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, John Ireland, Herbert Lom and Charles McGraw as Marcellus create a monumental cast and a solid foundation of what has become a True Classic for all audiences. Very little is left to chance when we see the enormous effort which went into this magnificent version of the man and his slave army. Thus, despite the lack of historical accuracy, this movie allows modern audiences the chance at witnessing what would become a creative Tribune to a slave who would not bow to the might of Imperial Rome. Recommended to anyone wishing to see a Historical Classic for all time. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Of His Work, The Least Influence of Kubrick's on Film","Spartacus is Kirk Douglas, and he doesn't mess around. He escapes the Romans and wants to kick their booties. Oh, and he has plenty of slaves to help him. Like, thousands. That's a whole lot of slaves.The film is pretty straightforward as far as the story goes -- slaves escape and return to kick butt. But it's some of the dialogue that is interesting. One man debates the moral difference between eating oysters and eating snails. To him, there is none, and that is analogous to sexual tastes... an interesting and probably enlightened perspective.The film is supposed to be anti-slavery, with Spartacus dreaming of a day where slavery ceases, which the narrator says will take another 2000 years. One wonders if Spartacus was all that concerned about the slavery of other races, or if slavery has truly been abolished. Over the years, it has risen again and again in different societies throughout the globe in various forms. Are we so advanced today we have entirely removed the shadow of slavery?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very entertaining movie,"Stanley Kubrick entered the big time here, being asked to substitute for director Anthony Mann, who was the first choice for Spartacus, in and fact did direct the opening scenes of the movie. Kubrick clearly has to work within certain creative boundaries, imposed by either the studio or Douglas, as the films producer. Some scenes are melodramatic and some of the moralising is a bit too obvious, particularly the scenes with Douglas and Simmonds and Douglas to the masses, albeit Olivier does make his scenes with Simmonds more interesting and less saccharine. In fact Olivier, Ustinov and Charles Laughton are the best performances in the film, with Olivier's Crassus oozing power, but becoming more vulnerable when seeing its impact (or lack thereof) on Spartacus; Ustinov's opportunist who nevertheless evokes sympathy as the 'survivor' character and Laughton's character's clever manipulations of gullible senators and his political sparring with Crassus in the 'Republican v Dictator' duel. Douglas is solid enough, albeit in archetypal Hollywood Leading Man mode, and certainly a role that is not quite as interesting as say for example, his performance in Paths of Glory, his previous collaboration with Kubrick.Despite this, and the obvious flamboyant approach to the design and photography, which was to show ""look at the money we are spending on this"" ($12 million, a lot at the time), Kubrick brings competent direction and more fleshed out (supporting) characters than usual for a film of this size and scope. Editing is first rate, as is Alex North's music, and the action sequences are generally well handled. The best sequences are the gladiator combat scenes in front of the Crassus character early on in the film, and the arrival of the Roman Legions on the site of the films final battle, where image, editing and music come together brilliantly. The films climax is a bold and interesting choice, and works so well partly because Douglas plays his character in a more understated fashion in this part of the film. Its also interesting to see Crassus try many times, and fail every time to get one over Spartacus, even though at first glance it looks like Crassus does.The plot, while loosely based on history, is the best part of the film, and while there are one or two convenient co-incidences, is doesn't mar the film and is no more than in any populist large scale Hollywood Movie. The political machinations that Spartacus becomes involved in are very prescient and still apply to situations seen by holders of power today, and this key subtext was clearly articulated, especially the handing over of more power to a leader in the interests of 'security'.Overall, a very entertaining action film, with an atypical but highly effective climax. It was Kubrick's last experience of the Hollywood System, and from now on Kubrick would work independently out of England, which would give his subsequent films a very different look and feel",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Classic.,"No doubt that, technically speaking, Stanley Kubrick is maybe the greatest director of all time, he can create an atmosphere like no one else, but he tends to ruin his screenplays, like he did with ""A Clockwork Orange"". But there are only two of his movies, that I don't have any complains about the script, ""The Shining"" that, although it's a wonderful movie, didn't scare me at all, and the movie that I'm reviewing now, so I can say that this is for me Kubrick's finest movies, and it was was very hard to choose.With wonderful performances by Douglas and, specially, by Olivier, this is a true classic epic. Now let me explain the real meaning of classic. It's not only a good movie, a classic is a movie that, regardless being a good movie, it's a movie that inspire future movies, it's not that's saying this, it's the real meaning of it. So when you an excellent movie like ""Braveheart"", that took a lot of elements of ""Spartacus"", you see that this movie is a truly classic.It's romance can make the film a little boring sometimes, but without it, we would miss powerful scenes in the movie, like the last one, if there wasn't all that love story, it would take a lot of it's impact, that moving scene would appear fake. But when we're talking about action, this film does not disappoint, considering that I watched ""Ratatouille"" in the same day I watched this one, the rebellion remembered me a lot of the rat rebellion in Pixar's movie, the image of slaves rebelling, and getting away of the training area, like mouses running away from human is very striking, and well filmed, with Kubrick making a wide shot so we can have and idea of the quantity of people were running away is admirable.Verdict: A classic, by one of the best directors of all time, indispensable!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Kirk's best performance,"Better than I remembered, or was led to expect by the ratings on this site, which have Gladiator at 8.5 and Spartacus at 7.9. It's better written than Gladiator, though not quite as well directed. But fairly accurate historically, as far as can be ascertained. The cast list is very impressive, except for the slightly weird presence of Tony Curtis as a juggler and tone-deaf singer of songs. This actor is, for me, forever indelibly memorable as a cookie full of arsenic, equally incredible as an ex-slave singer of songs as an ex-slave Viking. The rest of the cast is excellent. Olivier is Crassus personified, especially when comparing oysters with snails; Jean Simmons is everything she has to be; Ustinov provides welcome comic relief; Lom is highly convincing; and Laughton is both sardonic and ironic. The biblical echoes are strong. The temporary escape of the slaves powerfully recalls an earlier exodus from Egypt, and the mode of execution favoured by the Romans seems remarkably familiar. There's even a suggested future promise in the appearance of the infant son.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best of the ancient world epics...,"Spartacus has just been announced for release on blu-ray May 25th, 2010. The disc is set to have a slew of supplementary material included although whether this is as extensive as on the earlier Criterion Collection release is unclear.There was an excellent article written for the magazine Cineaste a few years back that explored the ""artistic license"" utilized by Dalton Trumbo when he wrote the screenplay for this film, based on a true story. That said, I think it's fair to say that no-one expects absolute fidelity to facts when they watch a historical drama, and these sorts of movies are notorious for playing loose with their particular facts.As a film, it's definitely the most impersonal of Kubrick's works, not that this is necessarily a bad thing given the genre he was working in here. Kirk Douglas gives one of his signature performances (ranking with his Colonel Dax from Paths of Glory) and the subtexts are handled with more directness than would have been allowed if this had been made just a few years earlier.",,Anonymous,Biography

Stanley Kubrick was only 30 years old. He had already made ""Paths of Glory"" (1957). In my opinion, that was 1 of his 2 greatest films: ""Paths of Glory"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971). ""Spartacus"" was a challenge Kubrick met; however, he did not have final cut. Kirk Douglas did, for a very simple reason: Kirk produced ""Spartacus"". Kubrick vowed he would never to allow this after making his next film (""Lolita"" in 1962). After ""Lolita"", Stanley truly had ""final cut"". This would last until the day he died (March 7th 1999).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Historical epic from the hands of a movie mastermind,"(85%) One of Kubrick's non-surreal historic classics which has become the cornerstone of all ancient Roman based epics. And it really is an epic at just over three hours long, but its length does suit the subject matter so it's not really a big issue. Kirk Douglas fits the role of a true hero very well, and the strong supporting cast who actually get a good majority of the screen time add a large layer of clout to the production thanks to the ability of Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis and Peter Ustinov just to name a few, as well as a very well written, richly constructed script.

KUBRICK AND DOUGLAS MADE ONE FINE TEAM.,SPARTACUS is by no means without flaw but behind BEN HUR it is the most powerful Roman epic of all timeThe length of it wasn't annoying because not one second of it was boring.

The musical score is amazing and all of the main characters are played very well.

I'm Spartacus!,"This is an excellent film but that is not at all a surprise considering it is directed by Stanley Kubrick and his movies are all incredible, at least the most famous of his movies are.Kubrick also shot this movie after he took over for his cinematographer but because he wasn't credited that cinematographer took home the Academy Award so that is an interesting bit of trivia and I bet he wouldn't be too happy about that! Ha ha.The fight scenes and ""look"" of the film are a bit dated of course but the writing and acting and direction of course are all still great and the movie holds up almost as good today.Kirk Douglas produced this movie so he could cast himself in the title role of Spartacus and that is probably the main problem of this movie. He is 45 here and obviously too old to be playing the young gladiator/slave Spartacus but if you suspend your disbelief it doesn't matter very much.

But some films don't deserve these chops and back in the day when we had films such as Lawrence of Arabia, the Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, and Spartacus who cared how long they were, they were brilliant films.I'm writing this in 2004 where we are not seeing films such as Gladiator, The Harry Potter Series, The Lord of The Rings Series, Master and Commander from the Far Side of the World, etc., going over that two hour mark and people actually sitting through them -- enjoying the film experience for the entertainment and epic grand tales of these stories.

Epic,"The first 75 minutes of this film are absolutely fantastic. The cinematography at the rugged slave mine in Libya, the intense gladiatorial training, the visit from the aristocrats who want to see a couple of battles to the death (with the ladies picking out the studliest combatants as if they were animals), and then the impromptu slave rebellion led by Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) ... these are all great scenes. Kubrick is brilliant at ending each of them with an emotional wallop, an example of which is the Roman senator (Laurence Olivier) calmly knifing the slave trying to jump out of the gladiatorial ring to attack him, the blood splattering up into his face.The film bogs down a bit during the scenes at the camp of the escaped slaves, regrettably including the romantic angle (with Jean Simmons). Spartacus is too idealized in general, and the tender moments he has with his people, set to intrusive music, felt artistically dishonest and weak. An exception to that was the spoken 'song' of the entertainer (Tony Curtis, ""I turn home""), which was touching. Curtis's more famous scene in the bath, scrubbing down Olivier while the latter tries to seduce him, is funny on the surface (the snails and oysters bit in particular), but insidious when you consider homosexuality is being lumped in with the perversion and evil of Rome, kind of like how it's lumped in with Nazis in other films. It's notable that in the final scene Curtis has with Douglas, they assure us that the feelings of love they have for one another are like father/son, not lovers.The grand sweep of the film continues and the film moves reasonably well considering its 197 minute runtime. Seeing Peter Ustinov (a slaver) and Charles Laughton (a senator) in the same scenes together was a treat, and remarkably neither got overly hammy or dramatic (and the performances in general are good across the board). One of the backdrops to the story are the Roman senators vying for power behind the scenes, Laughton and Olivier's characters particularly, and it's effective. The grand battle scene and how the story plays out is as well. I think if the film had been pared down a bit and less idealized ala its first 75 minutes it could have been a masterpiece, but it's still a good one.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Epic cinema at its best,"Laurence Olivier, Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov... with such an assembly of actors, how could this film not be extraordinary?  Well, it is extraordinary.  I am not going to go into a long history of the slave revolt under Spartacus; see the film and enjoy every minute of it (and if you like that, there are many different academic books on the real life of Spartacus, as well as classic Roman texts to be found). Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is a stalwart, reticent, but bravely rebellious slave-turned gladiator whose spirit cannot be broken, and yet he finds it in his heart to love the lovely British slave, Varinia, (Jean Simmons) with a fierce loyalty and tenderness that really gets the emotions going... Laurence Olivier (Crassus) has never turned in a finer performance in my opinion (a bare description could hardly do it justice), and Charles Laughton (a fine actor virtually unknown outside the acting world of today) *IS* the licentious senator, Gracchus.  Tony Curtis does seem a bit out of place in the cast, but he makes at the very least, a sincere (though somewhat stilted-sounding) Antoninus.  All in all, this is one of classic cinema's best.

I can't think of a thing that I would change.,"Every once in a while, I will watch a movie that just totally blows me out of the water. Spartacus was one of those movies. Everything about it seems perfect to me. I was not bothered by the length, as the story required a lengthy movie. After director Anthony Mann was fired, Stanley Kubrick was brought in to work as director. If he had been the original choice for director, perhaps we would see a Spartacus with the flashy long camera shots and the deep, haunting scores, and the abstract art we have become used to from Kubrick's 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and even Full Metal Jacket. Kubrick's style is much more restrained in Spartacus. The only time when Kubrick really shines through is the battle scene, where the troops of Casuss' army asssemble to make symmetric shapes. But since Spartacus is not really the kind of movie that requires that kind of work, since a ray of hope shines over the entire thing. In the hands of a lesser director (notably Cecil B. DeMille, king of the mindless epics) it might have turned into just that, a mindless epic. But Kubrick saved that from happpening. Critics of the romance between Spartacus and Varinia may be right when they say that there is no passion there. I disagree with this, though. Besides, the love scenes gave an excuse to hear the traditional score. The score (basically consisting of 3 notes being played in the same pattern but in different keys and by different instruments) is perhaps the most touching thing about the movie, and its simplicity drives what is going on on screen home. The movie's screenplay and story takes the best elements from such movies as Braveheart, Ben-Hur, and even the Ten Commandments and gives it to much better actors. Though the story may have many factual errors, it gives the actors a chance to shine in their work. The acting is top quality. Almost every legend of the silver screen had his role that made him one, the role that when one thinks of the actor, they must think of the role also. Marlon Brando had his Vito Corleone, Clark Gable had his Rhett Butler, Orson Welles had his Charles Foster Kane, even Anthony Quinn had his Zorba the Greek. Well, Kirk Douglas has his Spartacus. Although his character required little acting, and he was not oscar-worthy in it, he gave Spartacus an identity. Other acting standouts are oscar-winner Peter Ustinov as Spartacus's former owner, Laurence Olivier as the evil dictator Cassus, and though most people would disagree with me, Tony Curtis as Antoninus.This is a 5-star movie, see it soon.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Proof that the 250 is a list of popularity,"On almost every movie established in the Top 250 I see this one post that claims a variant of ""Overrated, does not deserve it's place"". They feel the movie in question lacks quality. It may be true, it may not be, most often I disagree.However, the list isn't a list about quality, it is about popularity, and ""Spartacus"" along with ""Ben-Hur"" proves it in this genre; The Epics. This does not mean that the list hasn't quality, it has loads, it just means that it must have popularity too. There are loads of evidence, but I have already digressed enough. As long as everyone votes honestly there is no over- and underrating since everyone is entitled to their opinion no matter what the cause. As long as everyone votes honestly the IMDb Top 250 is never anything else than it should be.Now to why they prove it: ""Spartacus"" is a great movie, so is ""Ben-Hur"", so is ""Braveheart"" and so is ""Gladiator"". They all have superior quality, but modern blockbusters will always appeal to more people. That is why the latter two, though not better movies, are 8.4 and 8.5 while the classics clock in on 8.0 and 8.1. And so it should be on a list of popularity.I don't give 10s or 1s, they are repressed when IMDb calculates the weighted rating, and so if I were to give them, I wouldn't have my say about the movies I love and hate the most.

However, the film is too long at nearly three and half hours and, like the director's Barry Lyndon, would have benefited from tighter editing. Some of the scenes in Rome specially could have been trimmed. The early scenes in the training camp are the best although the battle scene is impressive. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
spartacus,"Spartacus is one of best historicly epic movies ever made,i would say that it is on par with ben hur from 59 and even better then more modern films like braveheart and gladiator,Kubrick was able in this movie to put such an inspiring story that it was sometimes hard to watch how will our lead hero ended up ,Kirk Douglas showed a huge rage of his acting talent in this movie,and even if he had great roles in his past,i think that role of Spartacus was his highlight of his carrere,Laurence Olivier was also brilliant as our villain Krasus and he his performance was so convincing that i hated him everytime he appered on screen,look of entire film was also very pretty and battle scenes still hold up today,Spartacus was one great epic film with great and inspiring story with great moral compass and and hateful villain",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fitting tribute to the career of Kirk Douglas.,"Even today it is hard to visualise the scale of this epic or the efforts that went into its production. With all the computer generated effects of todays so-called epics eg Gladiator something stands out about this bench mark film. That Kirk Douglas did not win best actor oscar award for this film probably says more about the judging criteria of the day than it does about Douglas,s performance for when you stack it against that of Russell Crowes in gladiator what you are really seeing is the master & apprentice. There is something about the raw boned straight from the hip performance by Douglas that sets it apart from the rest of the so-called sword & sandal epics both past & present. I consider the fact that Douglas did not win an oscar for that role is perhaps the single biggest injustice in the history of the oscars especially when one considers that the film was largely his own in more ways than. I have never seen such an example of an actor carrying a film as it were on his back as without douglas the film would never have worked. The greatest ever Epic of its kind we will ever see.I would love to meet the man & present him with the oscar he never got before he dies what a coup that would be for the academy.",,Anonymous,Biography
"New-Fashioned Epic with a Touch of the Radical, Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus is a Textured, Intelligent, Sword and Sandals Experience","I've become a bona fide connoisseur of classic sword-and-sandals...and-hooves-and-guns epics in my twenties, and after years of making my way through the hallowed likes of Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur, Braveheart, Gladiator, and a handful of other roadshow giants, I've finally come around to seeing my number one most anticipated movie. Spartacus, the Stanley Kubrick directed, Kirk Douglas produced story of slave revolt in ancient Rome, is a special experience; a classic epic with a distinctly modern sensibility. It's a sharp, subtly risqué piece of work, in line with what I expect from Kubrick. The notion that this is somehow ""not an actual Kubrick film"" is absurd to me. I don't know enough about the behind the scenes story to make an educated comment about what Kubrick's vision was or how it clashed with Douglas', but the final film feels of a piece with Kubrick's other work.My own expectations for Spartacus were altogether too high to be met completely. I love ancient Rome, I love large-scale battles, I love overtures and intermissions, and Stanley Kubrick is one of my very favorite directors. I could only hope for Spartacus to not disappoint. There was no way it could surpass the masterpiece I had in my head. The good news is, it didn't disappoint. My first impression is one of massive appreciation. Here is an epic a class above even the best examples of the genre in many ways. It boasts a smart, poetic screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, a strong heroic narrative, mature, artful direction, and best of all, characters and acting of the highest caliber. And that is where Spartacus captivated me most. The character work is the best thing about the film. There are at least 6 performances worthy of Oscars in a veritable Mount Rushmore of rich, fascinating characters. The rundown: Kirk Douglas as the mythic hero, in a performance of physical power and gentle, boyish charm, Jean Simmons as his slave lover, a paradigm of beauty and grace, Peter Ustinov, sophisticated and fantastically natural as the impish slave trader Batiatus, the impossibly handsome John Gavin as Julius Caesar, Charles Laughton as the veteran Roman Senator Gracchus, with a world-weary understatement that feels as authentic as any ancient Roman I've ever seen in the movies, and finally, the best character and performance of the film, Laurence Olivier as the villainous Roman General Crassus. Crassus is every bit the equal to Spartacus, simultaneously leading his own campaign to crush the gladiator's revolt and restore order to Rome. It's Olivier who ultimately outshines the rest of the players. With a cold, confident strength behind evermore frightening and frightened eyes, he is absolutely riveting to watch. The great pleasures of Spartacus are the character interactions. Where other Roman epics can tend to gloss over political dealings, gladiatorial training, and the daily minutia of life in the ancient world, Kubrick's film revels in its time and place. Just the act of being in the environment, in the detailed sets or lush Italian exteriors photographed by Russell Metty, and listening to the characters talk to each other, is electrifying. You put that feeling together with Trumbo and Howard Fast's momentous story, and it is impossible not to be moved.If there is a tangible let down in Spartacus, and there really isn't (it's more of a byproduct of inflated hype), I'd point to the battle scene(s). This is a story, a la Patton, that is very much focused on battle strategy. There is lots of marching of armies to and fro, preparing transport ships, training legions, basically moving the pieces of the Risk board around the map. And yet, unlike Patton, which showcased many breathtaking scenes of war, we are not privy to much of Spartacus' exploits. A number of battles happen either completely offscreen or we only catch the tail end. The one centerpiece battle is gigantic in scope and surprisingly violent, but even it doesn't last quite long enough to make a strong impact. Narratively, it all works. I have no complaints about what ended up on the screen, but I do get the sense that there was more to show, more spectacle to take in. In any case, the film is not short on action. Gladiatorial fights pick up the slack, and while significantly smaller in scope, these fights are thrilling. I mean genuinely, actually thrilling. Sword fights on film, especially during this time period, can make even the classiest of actors look like kids stick-fighting on a playground. Not the case at all in Spartacus. Here the gladiatorial combat is treated realistically. Early scenes carefully establish the consequences of combat, and once the gladiators enter the ring, the fight choreography is fast, aggressive, and suitably brutal. There is suspense to these sequences, real feeling that these men's lives hang in the balance. I've never seen anything quite as effective, even 40 years later in a movie called Gladiator.Maybe my perfect Roman epic won't come around until I make it myself, but in the meantime, Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus may be as close as I can get. Free of the stodgy, Sunday school aftertaste of some biblical epics, and loaded with more drama and flavor than any of its contemporaries, Spartacus carves out its own niche in this tremendous, extinct genre. Forget what you might have heard, Spartacus is a clear Stanley Kubrick epic. You feel his influence all throughout what is a daring, artfully constructed, thinking man's film. The movie came out in 1960. It has all the hallmarks of the sword-and-sandals picture: the widescreen Technicolor majesty, the heroes, the romance, the sweeping Alex North score. But with Kubrick, what stands out most is the characters, so vivid against the hyper-detailed world of ancient Rome. Like all great epics, this is a picture to savor. Unlike most, however, the feast doesn't end with the scenery.92/100",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"You and I have a tendency towards corpulence. Corpulence makes a man reasonable, pleasant and phlegmatic.

In fact Oscars were given for each of these along with one for Peter Ustinov as Batiatus. Also excellent was the editing, score, and, of course, the direction by Kubrick.The cast was superlative. Kirk Douglas (Lust for Life, The Bad and the Beautiful, Champion) as Spartacus really gave us an outstanding performance as the man who took on Rome. Not until Gibson gave us William Wallace do we see a similar champion of the people fighting for freedom.We cannot neglect mentioning Sir Laurence Olivier as Crassius, Jean Simmons as Varinia, and Woody Strode (The Quick and the Dead) as Draba.The restored version of this film goes 3 and a half hours.

I am Spartacus!,"The fight for freedom is a most honorable fight. Though Stanley Kubrick's 1960 epic, Spartacus, is hailed as a classic, I was skeptical going in. I'd heard that it was Kubrick's worst apart from his first two, which showed little promise compared to his later films. This is only partially true.From the opening scene, I could tell that Kubrick had not written the script. The dialogue was not bad as much as it was blunt. It was statement after statements rather than discussions; I prefer Kubrick's approach to dialogue. In fact, very little of this film felt Kubrickian. The only semblance on Kubrick's directorial flare was the cinematography. Though Russell Metty was in charge of the cinematography, it is abundantly clear in some shots that Kubrick tried to have some kind of control over the way scenes were shot. In fact, this is the least Kubrick out of all of his films. I was initially turned off by this, but I decided to overlook this and enjoy the film as it is instead of what it could have been if Kubrick had full control over the film.I am not too familiar with the structure of epics, though I thoroughly enjoy them. As long as it can keep my attention, I deeply appreciate the extra time to get to know the characters. It adds gravity to the outcome of the story. Every choice and step of the narrative is meaningful because I care about the characters and what happens to them. At the same time, several scenes could have been trimmed up just a bit to get the runtime around three hours at most.Spartacus as a character is someone to aspire to be. He is charismatic, just, and a leader by nature. Conversely, he is faultless. He does no wrong throughout the runtime and consistently makes the right decisions with no hesitation. While this is nice and optimistic, it ultimately detracts from his humanity; his perfection is unattainable. Spartacus's character almost resembles Christ, especially during the final scene. The parallels between Jesus and Spartacus work well considering his flawless nature, though Spartacus does kill at some points. The practical effects and stunt work were spectacular for 1960 standards. It's cliché to say, but it honestly looks better than a ton of modern-day effects.Overall, Spartacus is a classic that delivers a compelling narrative but could have been bettered if it was trimmed down a bit and if Kubrick had complete artistic control of the movie. The legend of Spartacus is one to be remembered and inspired by.Rating: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kubrick's lone director-for-hire is overlong but a rousing Hollywood epic,"As a kid, I was obsessed with this movie, the story of a slave turned gladiator turned rebel army leader taking on the Roman Empire. From the film's opening with an amazing Saul Bass title sequence (he's the guy responsible for title sequences for everything from VERTIGO to BIG, to GOODFELLAS and even Hanna-Barbera ""swirling star"" logo and also AT&T's original globe logo) to the soaring Alex North score, the movie had me excited from the get-go to see it once again on the big screen. I'd watched it many times on TV as a kid and got to see the 1991 re-release of the restored version (adding back the infamous ""oysters and snails"" scene where Laurence Olivier tries to seduce his slave Tony Cutis (Anthony Hopkins did uncredited dubbing for Olivier for the restored scene, who had been suggested by Olivier's widow, Joan Plowright), so it had been over 30 years since I'd last seen this on the big screen when a local art house theater kicked off a Stanley Kubrick film festival with this classic. Kirk Douglas is in full movie star mode as Spartacus, showing off his athleticism as well as his scenery-chewing acting chops and holding his own with some acting heavyweights, including Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Ireland, along with Woody Strode and Charles McGraw. Also in the film are Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis, John Dall, Herbert Lom, and John Gavin. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this is the only film he made where he did not have complete creative control and it shows. It is the least Kubrick-like of his entire filmography. There are touches here and there, such as some great tracking shots or the use of foreground objects, but this is basically a well-made studio programmer. However, it's fascinating to see a true auteur director such as Kubrick working as a director-for-hire. While the film lacks his usual trademarks and interesting subtexts, it's still a terrifically entertaining film. I'd compare it to when Steven Soderbergh decides he's going to make OCEAN'S ELEVEN or MAGIC MIKE. Sure they're not as thought-provoking as TRAFFIC or SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE, but they're reliably entertaining (LUCKY LOGAN, anyone?). SPARTACUS is one of the better Hollywood epics and may arguably be the best. Douglas was reportedly miffed when he was passed over for BEN-HUR and decided to produce and star in this film in response. SPARTACUS does drag in some parts and I never did buy the plot line where Olivier was obsessed with Spartacus' wife. I got that he did it to spite Spartacus, but that he was actually in love with her is just ridiculous melodrama and it is elements such as this, or Curtis wanting to prove himself as a warrior and not just a ""singer of songs"" that drag the film down. Still, even though it's filled with corny melodrama you'd never expect in a Stanley Kubrick film and is painfully overlong, clocking it at almost three and a half hours, it's still a rousing adventure film and a real treat to see on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I'm Spartacus!  He's Spartacus!  We're All Spartacus!,"During the early reign of the ancient Roman Empire, heroic slave Kirk Douglas (as Spartacus) rebels by biting a master's ankle. He will be roundly punished. Believing Mr. Douglas' strength and determination make him a good candidate for gladiator duels, Douglas is saved from a starvation sentence by wily slave-trader Peter Ustinov (as Batiatus), who is often employed by Roman dictator Laurence Olivier (as Crassus). Douglas and Mr. Olivier are attracted to beautiful house slave Jean Simmons (as Varinia). Cracking under the pressure whip, Douglas escapes to begin a slave rebellion...In Rome, proudly promiscuous Republican Senator Charles Laughton (as Gracchus) and his handsome young cohort John Gavin (as Julius Caesar) jockey for political gain. Mr. Laughton and Mr. Ustinov are just plain fun to watch. Meanwhile, Ms. Simmons finds her way into Douglas' slave rebellion, as does Olivier's poetic juggler boyfriend Tony Curtis (as Antoninus). This further irks Olivier. It all climaxes in a battle between the forces representing Douglas and Olivier...""Spartacus"" plays like the story of Jesus Christ without the supernatural elements, which is quite original for a biblical epic. While Douglas' character seems too good to be true, he carries off the characterization with star power. Olivier is strong, as expected. The restored ""oysters and snails"" scene is tame, and tinged with evil. Were they subtle - immoral? Also, Douglas' reaction to Ms. Simmons' delicate condition makes you wonder if he was expecting an immaculate conception. Or, maybe he was counting months.

Tragic story.,"An illiterate non-Roman slave almost defeats the best armies Rome has at her disposal. The same slave, before his ""break out,"" shares his cell with a naked female slave, in full view of his Roman guards. And a Roman general has some kind of relationship with his male slave - in a swimming pool. Now, what does all this have in common? Answer: I don't know! It's all in the movie, however. I don't care about Spartacus's love life nor do I care about whether the Roman general had a special relationship with his male slave. The story is about the revolt itself, which is one of the most famous slave revolts in history. It's about an army of slaves who are fighting for their freedom. But that's not enough material for Hollywood, so here comes the sex, as if that had any bearing on the revolt itself. Kirk Douglas offers a powerful, albeit somewhat hammy performance as the heroic Spartacus and Tony Curtis offers an interesting portrayal as the Greek slave who is Spartacus's adviser, friend and scribe - and his master's lover. Okay, Spartacus rebelled against Rome, but was it really necessary for Rome to crucify thousands of men just to find Spartacus? That is truly tragic.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Kirk Douglas is typically great portraying the movie's namesake, the slave determined to bring down the Roman empire. Laurence Olivieris equally masterful as Spartacus' Roman nemesis, while Tony Curtis and Jean Simmons supply sentimental material as the people closest to Spartacus' life.

The best sword and sandal flick.,"Yes, thats correct, my favorite out of all the movies of this genre. This movie served as the blueprint for movies such as, Braveheart, and Gladiator. Those movies had something in them that came out of Spartacus one way or the other. However, the Direction in this movie was of course by the legendary Kubrick, and when he directs, the acting is always great. This movie has no happy endings, its sad but uplifting. It is a dark fictional story with amazing sets, hundreds of extra's that fill up the screen make this the most realistic of all the movies. Gladiator was great but it was more comic book like. Braveheart was great also but it didn't come close to the movie that set the standard, and that's Spartacus. BenHur is the only movie that is better. 4stars ****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An epic slave revolt,"It's unfortunate, and a little baffling, why Kubrick has openly disowned Spartacus. Admittedly it was not a project that he initiated or had the creative control that he enjoyed on his previous films, but it's an impressive achievement for a director so early in his career, especially having to deal with the likes of Charles Laughton and Laurence Olivier, neither of whom could stand the other, as well as being directors in their own right. It must have been an intimidating and formidable time when he got the call from actor/producer Kirk Douglas to take over after he fired Anthony Mann. One can clearly see signs of Kubrick's trademark style, even at this stage. My own issues are with the scenes between Douglas and Jean Simmons which grind the story to a dead halt. Kubrick's weakness as a director are these ""human"" moments and would be for the rest of his career. The battle sequence towards the end is remarkable. I had the opportunity to see this on a big screen when it was rereleased after being restored and scenes that were censored on its initial released were found, including the infamous ""oysters or snails"" scene between Olivier and Tony Curtis. Being a less than subtle seduction scene between two men it was cut. Unfortunately the sound was lost and Curtis came and dubbed his lines, while Anthony Hopkins did his best Olivier impression. A moment where someone loses his arm in battle was also cut. Regardless if they play freely with the facts of story and embellish it, this is still a great film, whether it has gotten Kubrick's stamp of approval on it or not. I highly recommend listening to the audio commentary by Howard Fast, author of the book which the film is based, Kirk Douglas, Peter Ustinov, and one by screenplay writer Dalton Trumbo that is on the Criterion Collection release.

Disowned by Director Kubrick,"Amongst the plethora of Roman epics that graced/disgraced Hollywood in the 50s and 60s, it's all too easy to overlook Spartacus. But why? and why isn't it considered to be Kubrick enough to be better known as one of his and indeed, as my title suggests, a quick check through the best- selling Kubrick box-sets, none includes Spartacus.Firstly, Anthony Mann was the original director and started off with the project, he's still accredited as co-director in some listings. His set- pieces include the early scenes set in Libyan desert. Star and executive producer Kirk Douglas fired Mann and enrolled Kubrick, from then on. It has been said that Kubrick since disowned the film as he considered himself a hired hand, finishing off someone else's project.Kirk Douglas, does actually have too much control over this movie, to me, the elongated speeches and lingering slushy romance with (admittedly with the very attractive) Jean Simmons bloat both the film's already long length and but also Douglas' ego, a bit. Having said that, like in his role in the excellent The Vikings, he is perfect for the role, physically - like Charlton Heston in Ben Hur, he towers above everybody and everything and takes the film by the scruff of the neck and drags us all the way through.There's more than a whiff of Gladiator in this - more ponderous and talky but the action really does shine - instead of some over-pampered American superstar getting stunt doubles Douglas really does seem to relish the hand-on-hand combats that epitomises what we conceive today as being the Romans at their best - and worst - the Gladiatorial fight to the death, in the ring.For many my age, it's the seeing the greats such as Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis (as a willowy magician) Peter Ustinov, whose part is almost perfectly replicated by the late (great) Oliver Reed aforementioned Gladiator, that of a slave dealer, who first sees the potential of Spartacus, the slave and how he can fight to save himself from his inevitable plight. But mainly, for Charles Laughton, with his chubby cheeks and curly locks - look at any Roman coin or actual Roman artifact and we have the epitome of the well-fed, pleasure-seeking Roman aristocrat.A rousing musical score by Alex North sounds great in the stereo we now enjoy but obviously did not get when seeing this on our parent's TV. The battle-scenes toward the end are exciting and well choreographed, long before CGI trickery, of course. The rolling flames down the hill are particularly effective and whilst being PG certificate, it is often really quite violent - not for small children, this.So, a lot better than many of the Roman epics that Hollywood churned out but not necessarily one for Kubrick fans wanting actual Kubrick. Yes, he did his job supremely well and no-one could have asked more from him, but William Wyler (who directed Ben Hur) could have done it equally well.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Largely enjoyable,"I found this film very watchable, even if it took me a few sittings to complete watching it. Although it is not a genuine Kubrick film it favourably compares with his much-acclaimed body of work, and is indeed preferable to later Kubrick films, ""The Shining"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". It is, I gather, largely Kirk Douglas' film directorially, and it must be said, he does a good job. The effective, humanistic story is given full breadth by the largely unobtrusive, static camera, and is embellished by some effective shots. It is a good thing that the actors are allowed pretty much free reign to entertain here, with a steady script that characterizes well. The Romans are the best played; by Peter Ustinov, Charles Laughton and Laurence Olivier. Olivier gives a nigh-on inscrutable performance as the villainous, but believable Crassus. Ustinov impresses as the slightly out-of-place, deceptively bumbling Batiatus, while Charles Laughton, a quite wonderful actor, gives a typically nuanced and compelling performance. Indeed, it's refreshing that two of the Romans -are portrayed sympathetically. The scene where the hefty pair discuss the merits of ""corpulence"" is a delight, and is followed by the odd, suggestive bath scene between Curtis and Olivier. This middle scetion of the film is perhaps the best, although I like the end passage. Much depends on how successful the romance between Simmons and Douglas is; it works very eloquently I feel, Simmons giving a subtly affecting performance, and the scenes between them well written. The excellent score and cinematography should be noted as major plusses in this epic. The battle scenes are quite well done, although that part of the film feels a little muddled to me. The political and personal themes are quite well linked, both the portrayal of Roman court and in the interactions within Spartacus' army. To paraphrase; ""I think we've just started something that has no finish"" and other such scenes are all very effective. A stately, grand film that draws you in to its drama and romance effectively, ""Spartacus"" impressed, even moved me.Rating:- ****/*****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A great director serves up spear-and-toga propaganda,"Keep your finger on the fast-forward button. The basic story (only sticking with the facts occasionally) is great, but Kubrick added so much boring ""color"" that much of this well-meaning movie is unwatchable. A sappy and implausible love story burdens the movie almost from the beginning. Part of the problem is that the lovely Jean Simmons was utterly miscast as a pretty and prim slave girl in love with ruff n' tuff Kirk Douglas. The other is that these characters, after staring interminably into each others pupils, deliver some of the schmaltziest lines in the history of film.Every time the plot gets going, it's interrupted with hundreds, nay thousands, of quick cuts showing Spartacus' brave and happy escaped slaves enjoying their newly won freedom: men working, cute children playing, women washing, Tony Curtis leading a singalong around the campfire, and so on. Liberal as I am, this stuff has the odor of leftist propaganda. Worse, because it's so staged, it's meaningless as film. You don't believe it for two seconds.Along the same apologetic lines is the seeming beneficence of Spartacus' slave army. In real life, he celebrated a victory by pitting 300 captives against one another in gladiatorial contests. Here, he hates that stuff and will have nothing to do with it. In real life, his troops raped and pillaged, burning farms and slaughtering their occupants. Here, he steals a few trunks of jewelry and other valuables. In this film, there isn't much truth telling going on.And let's not forget the costuming and makeup. In keeping with the 50s provenance of the film, Kirk Douglas wears a ducktail hairdo. (You expect him to pull up in a lowered '50 Merc. The women's rigid, metallic coifs are doused with shiny hairspray. It all looks very un-Roman.Mercifully, the film is saved by some mighty fine acting. The supporting cast is spectacular, especially Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton, who, as far as I'm concerned, is the star of the movie. And Ustinov certainly deserved the academy award he got for his role as a likable trainer of gladiators.Worth seeing, but don't put down the remote.Note to reviewers: This story didn't take place during the time of the Roman Empire, which began with Augustus in 14 BCE.

A screen adaptation of the novel of the same name by the American writer Howard Fast, which is based on one of the key events in world history - the uprising of Spartacus against Roman rule. The respected Dalton Trumbo was responsible for the script (thanks to Kirk Douglas for not allowing his name to be removed from the credits, which became a recognition of the merits of this brave man who was not afraid to challenge the system), so I could not pass by this picture, and even the great timing of me did not stop (three hours sixteen minutes). I looked with pleasure - and did not remain disappointed, and here is my brief opinion - The story of a gladiator who defeated Rome. Despite my delight and well-deserved pluses, I intend to lay a fly in the ointment and paint minor minuses, which could not be done without. With that, let me finish with the introduction and get to the point.So the pros:
1. The story told - now we are not taking the script (which came out ragged and has a lot of other things), but we will take the central story. The picture tells about the life and death of the legendary leader of the rebellious slaves and gladiators Spartacus, who with his energetic actions for several years terrified the Romans in their home and was able to defeat several times the most disciplined and strongest army of the Ancient World - the Roman, using only willpower, cunning, competent management and having managed to turn the crowd of escaped slaves and gladiators into a real army. And to suppress this uprising must Mark Licinius Crassus - the most famous and powerful patrician of Rome, standing at the head of numerous legions. Crassus is a dangerous opponent, because he does not rush into a fight with the zeal of a fanatic. Both personify two opposite worlds that hate each other. Spartacus is the face of numerous slaves and, in part, ordinary people, whom the Roman aristocracy despises, considering them ""dust under their feet."" Crassus is the face of Rome - a colossus that is already beginning to undermine itself, the face of the aristocracy, the rich, the oligarchy, which only wants to increase its wealth, chatting about patriotism and ""the greatness of Rome."" Both enemies are shown as people, with their own strengths and weaknesses, although Spartacus also evokes more sympathy, since his image is more attractive to a common viewer. And despite some reservations (after all, no one knows the true history of Spartacus until the moment when he became a slave, even there is no exact opinion about his death, although it is believed that he died in the last battle), we have a story about a courageous man who accomplished the seemingly impossible - he raised an uprising in Italy and made the Romans tremble with fear from his name alone. And although he lost, his name went down in world history forever. Needless to say, even the Russian football club bears his name. The romantic line was right, and does not look superfluous. As a result, the story told itself turned out to be strong and leaves a deep mark in the soul of everyone who watched it.2. Political intrigues - it would seem that during such an event as the uprising of slaves, Rome should act as a united front against Spartacus, but not. On the contrary, this event further deepened the contradictions between pro-government groups and not only (patricians and plebeians, the Senate and the military, supporters of the republic and dictatorship). And although some of them are very much reminiscent of today, this only confirms the thesis that times change, but people never. And this picture illustrates this perfectly. Here is the answer to why the uprising of Spartacus lasted for two whole years.3. Epic - there are a lot of extras here, so the viewer feels that grandiose scale of this historical event. My respect for the creators, because all the extras are real people, and the fights are real, without the use of computers and other tools. This is especially pleasing during the final battle.4. Battles, fights - of course, now they are not able to cause delight and excitement, as in the year of release, but not to pay tribute to the actors who trained for this, put themselves in shape, honed every movement, I just have no right. The extras and a huge number of costumes and military equipment, which correspond to the historical era, save the day.5. Music - composer Alex North created good music for the picture, despite the fact that it was his debut in a big movie, and the success of the picture contributed to his career. Epic, grandeur, drama, pain, success, hope - all these motives are in this music.5. Acting - not the last role in the success of the picture was played by actors with a capital letter, without whom this picture is simply impossible to imagine. Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis, Gene Simmons and others played at a high level. You believe in their heroes, you worry about them, you become imbued with them.So the cons:
1. The overture and intermission with a black screen is a niggle, but why not add a static picture or frame during playback? Was it that hard to do? Sorry I don't believe it!2. Ragged script - I know that it was rewritten several times and Dalton Trumbo is the best that came out in the end. But still, a lot was thrown overboard. Even the breakthrough of the Crassus Line on the Regian Peninsula was not inserted (maybe the budget was not enough?), And after all, a huge rampart was built there, filled with water, which Spartak overcame with his army. The path of Spartak is still not clear - after all, he, in fact, fought all of Italy, but did not return home with the rest only because he did not want to abandon the brothers who had broken away from his army. Even the lead to the final battle is completely non-existent. I'm not even talking about such a funny thing as the garrison of Rome (which was not there at that time). And Spartak was not the only leader of the rebels, he is just the most famous. Alas, you can't argue with facts!A little about the main characters:
1. Spartacus performed by Kirk Douglas is a former Thracian warrior who raised an uprising against Rome and gathered an army. A brave and courageous fighter for the freedom of his people and all slaves of Rome. A hero for the ages, who from an ordinary person turned into a legend that is still relevant today. An example of justice, although his image was ennobled in the picture, and the charisma of Kirk Douglas played an important role. Bravo Kirk!2. Mark Licinius Crassus performed by Laurence Olivier - a Roman patrician, a powerful politician and an experienced commander who is tasked with ridding Rome of Spartacus. An ambitious politician who seeks benefits for himself, even at the expense of the difficult situation of the state. Laurence Olivier was great as Crassus. In his movement, in his gaze, one can feel genuine aristocracy, which was very appropriate here. Bravo! Moreover, I discovered this actor for myself in the excellent chamber film ""The Game Through"" in 1972.3. Varinia performed by Gene Simmons is the beloved and wife of Spartacus, a faithful military friend who followed him on this destructive campaign across the lands of Rome. The same ""spark"" is felt between the characters, and the actors did their best. Bravo Jean!The famous Tony Curtis, who is also remembered, also played a supporting role here.I am glad that I discovered this picture for myself and it was not in vain that she grabbed as many as four Oscars, although there were some drawbacks. Even in the USSR, the picture was a tremendous success with viewers, and in the USA it successfully came out and became a harbinger of the decline of the era of McCarthyism.As a result, we have an excellent historical drama about a grandiose uprising of a gladiator, with a good script, epic character, great music and great acting.My rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kirk Douglas wows in historical epic,"Spartacus is a very well designed film, the plot is propelled with vigour and has a great pacing. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, who also did The Shining, Spartacus has both style and majesty, the acting is good and the cinematography is great, Kirk Douglas is especially fantastic in the lead role and there's some emotional scenes too.9/10: A great film that everyone should enjoy",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Fun Ride!,"Spartacus is a historical epic that follows amongst the footsteps of prior historical epics such as Ben-Hur and the Ten Commandments. I have to admit this film is not nearly as great as those, but I am certainly not bashing this film. The fact is, the film is a tad overlong and the dialogue does not hold up well by today's standards. I can appreciate the fine performances, especially Ustinov's Oscar-winning performance, as well as the steady direction of a legend, Stanley Kubrick. The film has some great action sequences and as a history student, I can appreciate the historical aspect of this film. I also like, unlike other films of its time, where we are not stuffed the obligatory happy ending. Thus, that makes me appreciate this epic even more.Kubrick's film talks about a slave uprising during the Roman era. Spartacus is a slave who does not take pleasure at the fact he is being used to fight at a gladiator school only to receive spoiled girls. He and the rest of the slaves revolt which causes other slaves in the countryside to do the same. Crassus, who is aiming to become a dictator, decides to meet Spartacus and his men in battle.I really enjoyed the performances in this film. I liked Kirk Douglas's strength and perseverance as Spartacus. I liked the comedic timing in Peter Ustinov's performance as the head of the gladiatorial school, Batiatus. Jean Simmons gives a mighty fine performance as Spartacu's lover, Varinia. Finally, I really liked Laurence Olivier's deep, intense performance as Crassus, who wants nothing except for political power.Overall, Spartacus is a fine, entertaining historical spectacle. It features some majestic battle sequences and many fine, if perhaps a little outdated performances. The screenplay was excellent, as it was written by none other than the black-listed screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo. Compared to today's quality, the film doesn't live up to it. But I had a fun time watching this historical epic. Not Kubrick's best, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun watch.My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the great movies from the past,I saw this movie twice before. Once as a youngster in the 60's and again about 20 years ago. Viewing it again today was a wonderful experience as over time details of the movie have faded from my memory. My memory is refreshed and once again it was marvelous to watch this spectacular film in the digital restoration format with no flaws or streaks. Some of the best movies were made in the fifties and sixties with grandeur and a cast of thousands. Those were the days which will never be repeated in today's environment. The film is still worth a solid star rating of 8.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
simply grand,"One of the best of the post-WWII historical epics. The grandly sweeping vision of the film is matched by few others (Lawrence of Arabia, the deMille spectaculars, etc.) and the movie, in my view definitely sustains its length. The story is so intense and gripping that one cannot help but feel emotionally drained at the conclusion.It's true that a close reading of parts of the script, and of some of the visuals, give indications of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's Communist sympathies (he was a member of the U. S. Communist Party) but that does not deter from the movie's impact.Superb acting all around from the all the leads, and Peter Ustinov especially is wickedly delightful in the kind of role he played so well. It definitely has to be seen in the restored, letterbox version. To watch it in TV size format is to miss half the movie. It is quite possible that battle scenes of such scope as the climactic one here might never be filmed again. Devotees of the score are directed to jazz pianist Bill Evan's treatment of the love theme in his great recording, ""Conversations with Myself"". A classic; yes, even a 'timeless classic'.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mirroring The Brutality Of Today's Post 9/11 World,"WE CONFESS TO being awfully ignorant, but, up until several years ago, we did not know that there was a real life Spartacus; who did lead a revolt of slaves in the Roman Empire. The years in question were 73- 71 B.C., and we read this was the 3rd and last of what have been called THE ROMAN SERVILLE WARS.THE STORY IS a natural subject for a Big Screen, Sword & Sandal epic and also a most desirable role for Executive Producer, Mr. Kirk Douglas to portray. Being what we now call a ""Blockbuster"", the procuring of a top rate, international cast was in order.IN RESPONSE TO this need we have: Lawrence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis,Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Ireland, Nina Foch and Herbert Lom. Rounding out the players' roster are some very talented people; who are perhaps appearing in what may have been their most visible roles. Charles McGraw and Harold J. Stone come to mind and are excellent in their portrayals of brutal Trainer and Slave/Gladiator, respectively.IN CONSIDERING THE screenplay for this huge undertaking, the choice of Exec Producer was Dalton Trumbo. Although the writer had been blacklisted following the House Un-American Activities Committee's hearings for Leftist political leanings, he had continued to work; albeit with the use of Pen Names. Kirk Douglas insisted that he use his real name in the credits.*BECAUSE SO LITTLE is known about the events of that era, the personal lives of those involved and the political climate of Rome, a lot of filling in with supposition and fictionalization was called for.AS WITH SO many other story lines, it became a sort of surrogate morality play for us in the modern world. The behind the scenes conniving in the Roman Senate and the arrogance displayed by the military could all be easily portrayed as pariahs of the United States in the mid 20th Century.THE BEST EXAMPLES of this last hypothesis are the characters of Crassus (Olivier) in the military and Gracchus (Laughton) in the Senate. Mr.Laughton's characterization, in particular seems to be carefully crafted to be representative of a sort of caricature of what we think of as being a ""Politician"" in the worst sense. He makes a beauty of a point in the money statement to support our case.MR. CHARLES LAUGHTON, as Senator Gracchus, states that privately he believes in none of these gods; but publicly he worships them all.NOW THEN, AIN""T that a ""Politician"" for you?NOTE * Contrary to a widespread misconception, the 'Blacklist' was not a governmental edict; but rather a creation of a consortium of the Hollywood Studio Big Wigs.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spartacus (60),"Spartacus the Brave: ""When a free man dies he loses the pleasure of life. Death is the only freedom a slave knows, that's why he's not afraid of it."" Long before the Prophets sowed the seeds of hope and self-determination, there was the ""Thracian dog"" made gladiator, then freedom fighter, Spartacus (73-71 BC).Part romance, part war film (great finale), part seminar in battle tactics and prison escape (Look to the soup!), this Kirk & Kubrick classic offers some of the best of Olivier (Crassus), Laughton (Graccus), Ustinov (Batiatus) (O), Lom (Levantus), Dall (Glabrus), Curtis (Antoninus), McGraw (Marcellus), Ireland (Crixus), Strode (Draba), Stone (David), Gavin (Caesar), Foch (Helena), Bass titles, stunts (64 cast) & Jean Simmons as Varinia of Britannia, Sparty's beautiful, devoted soul mate. Helen of Troy had ""a face that launched a 1000 ships (Marlowe)"" but Varinia, and there most certainly was a love inspiring this man, whatever her name, SHE nearly topples the Roman Empire.Curiosities: 1) a rebellion score (North) to impress the harsh realities of the age with a love story leitmotif and Republican charm (Gracchus Batiatus) to offer some respite; 2) Trumbo writes Crassus a paradox, the Patrician dictator who sells obedience to mother Rome (""grovel at her feet""), yet, in private, gives Antony the choice to stay (snails) or run free, then bargains for Varinia's love; 3) It is well known that Kirk (+ Otto) helped burn the blacklist in Dalton's hire, but add the name of blacklistee Jeff Corey (Little Big Man) who'd serve as Douglas' coach on set; 4) Deemed by voters at the 33rd Academy (61) to be a lesser make than The Alamo, The Sundowners, Sons and Lovers, Elmer Gantry and The Apartment (5), all Best Picture nominees (oy), Spartacus took 4 Oscar (art camera costume support) and the Golden Globe for BP in drama (4/4).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood's greatest Roman epic!!!,"Spartacus has become part of pop culture. Its dialogue, characters and some of its visuals have become almost clichéd, so it is hard to imagine a time when the film was far from a sure bet. It was actually a gamble of significant proportions.Star and project shepherd Kirk Douglas, drawn as he was to martyrs, had had an eye on this story for some time, and now - ""now"" being circa 1958 - at the peak of his fame and power, he decided to wrestle it into existence. Not one to ever take the easy approach to anything, Douglas secretly entrusted scripting duties to blacklisted scribe Dalton Trumbo (adapting a novel by Howard Fast), landing himself a surprisingly rich and sophisticated epic, the first Roman Epic to bear no mention of the character Jesus.He then gathered a dizzying cast of powerhouse names: Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov! Any one of those titans could of headed the bill, thus Douglas promptly lied to each one of them, promising them each the biggest part. With legal action and mutiny within reach before cameras even rolled, he chose to go one further - three being the charm - and fired veteran director Anthony Mann. His replacement? Recent Paths of Glory collaborator Stanley Kubrick.What on paper has the makings of a mad disaster magically morphed into not just a hit and Academy Award Winner, but also the greatest Roman epic of all time. The actors all turned in career-best performances, and while Kubrick was not able to enforce his will as strongly as anywhere else in his filmography, you can argue that having Douglas focusing him on the heart of the story allowed the film to have a heart of its own.After Spartacus, there was nowhere for the genre to go but down, and down it went with alarming speed, straight to a period of hibernation that lasted until Ridley Scott's Gladiator over three decades later. Despite that recent mega-hit, this is still the one to beat.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not Perfect, but better than Ben-Hur","Stanely Kubrick's Spartacus is a good epic of a film, but it is by no means perfect.  Especially because this is Kubrick's only true Hollywood movie. Luckily, Kirk Douglas comes to the rescue as Spartacus.  The gladiator who wants to be free.  With his terrific acting abilities and gets the film going when it lulls.  And even though the film does go over long, Kubrick still makes it work and gets a damn near close masterpiece here.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Spartacus: Always best on the big screen.,"Recently, a local neighborhood theater (I'm not at liberty to name the theater chain for reasons of copyright violation, you understand) showcased a major theatrical road show trifecta: I was able to thrill at the sight of seeing such epic greats of a Hollywood long since passed as ""The 10 Commandments"" (1956), ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), and, of course ""Spartacus"" (1960). I'm given to understand that Kirk Douglas along with others being considered for the title role of ""Ben-Hur"" such as Paul Newman, Rock Hudson, and several unknown hopefuls, were tested for the role, including Douglas, before Charlton Heston landed the coveted role but as consolation, Douglas was offered the role of the Ben-Hur's erstwhile friend, and, later foe, Messala. To counteract his disappointment, Douglas, through the auspices of his own production company Bryna Productions and securing the rights to Howard Fast's bestseller, produced and crafted ""Spartacus"". Displeased with director Delbert Mann's efforts, Douglas discharged him and hired the new kid on the block, Stanley Kubrick (who, was constantly at odds with Douglas, and, it is alleged, disowned the film). The only concession Hollywood was forced to make was Douglas' choice of screenwriter to adapt Fast's novel, the grey and black listed Dalton Trumbo. In point of fact, with all the obstacles presenting a troubled shoot, i.e., choice of acting styles, arguments on the set, etc., it's something of a minor miracle that Douglas was able to pull it off at all. But the net results are truly outstanding. And while I personally own ""Spartacus"" in Blu-ray, seeing it up on the big screen once more was like visiting an old friend.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
There's a Thrace For Us,"Still, for me, the granddaddy of the sword and sandal epics, I wanted to rewatch this, one of my favourite movies, in tribute to the late, great, recently deceased Kirk Douglas. I'm actually not that big a fan of Kubrick, considering his film-work very hit and miss and yet this is the film of his I like most, even after learning, surprisingly, that he disowned it on release.I've read about the supposed disagreements over the direction of the screenplay and the rumoured head-butting of the acting talent, but to me all or any of this is subsumed into the grand sweep and vision of the movie. I try to imagine what it looked like when it first hit the big screen, it must have seemed huge, even after the previous, recent success of the similarly monumental ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben Hur"".Perhaps one of the reasons I like ""Spartacus"" more than ""Ben Ten"" is its lack of religiosity. A simple and stirring story of the uprising of the downtrodden, there are of course possible read-acrosses in Dalton Trumbo's screenplay to the Hollywood Blacklist, or the treatment of the Jewish people in the Second World War and if the allegory fits then by all means wear it, but I prefer to let it stand in its own as a great and involving, if admittedly historically inaccurate tale, brought to life in the grand Hollywood manner by great direction, writing, cinematography and acting.Douglas of course never won an individual acting Oscar for any of his film performances, which I consider ridiculous when I think of ""Champion"", ""The Bad And The Beautiful"", ""Paths Of Glory"" and my favourite of all his roles ""Ace In The Hole"", to name but four. I think he's terrific here as the rebellious Thracian slave, athletic, inspiring and manly but also sensitive and fair-minded. He gets fine support from those two English stalwarts, Lawrence Olivier as the intractable Crassus, although still with an eye it would seem for a young man or woman on the side and Charles Laughton as the seasoned Gracchus, with Tony Curtis and Jean Simmons fine also as Spartacus's young right-hand man and calming partner respectively. Almost stealing the show however is Peter Ustinov, back in the toga, as the weaselly Batiatus.Kubrick directs unhurriedly, letting the grand story develop naturally before the climactic battle at the end and of course the famous ""I am Spartacus"" scene which has entered the lexicon of popular culture. His mastery of composition and the panoramic shot and crowd scenes in particular, assisted by Douglas Sirk's great cameraman Russel Metty, bring the story to life in vivid colour assisted by Alex North's stirring soundtrack.Undoubtedly a massively ambitious cinematic undertaking, Kubrick and Douglas in my opinion certainly pull it off and I personally still consider it a true classic of cinema.R.I.P.

Ben Hur's detached brother...and just about as good!,"This year I'm going through Kubrick's films, and also this year I'm going through the well-regarded Classic Hollywood historical/biblical Epics of the 50's/60's. Spartacus is a neat combination of both. And it's one of the best of both groups too!That said, Spartacus is apparently the only one of Kubrick's films where he had less control than he would've liked. But it is filmed extremely well, on par with Lawrence of Arabia. One particularly outstanding scene is where we get a desert landscape vista with a long train of horses, the camera pulls back atop a mountain to reveal daily life of the community. All in one take. Even more impressive is later on a massive battlefield scene, with a focus on formation. Mesmerising!We also get a strong narrative, with the love story aspect being charming & likeable. Memorable cast, intelligent dialogue, decent pace, strong ending.While I can barely find a fault with this Epic, it still seems to be missing something. A warmth or a connection, maybe. Something hard to define. It feels a little more detached than the emotional rollercoaster that is Ben Hur, or even Quo Vadis or The Robe. The missing element may indeed be the spiritual factor. Without the biblical, without Christ, or without any kind of otherwordly belief system...This isn't necessarily the missing factor, but I enjoyed the extra depth we got from the spiritual-flavour of the other Epics (despite being an agnostic myself). If not the lack of 'biblical', that indefineable detachedness might be Kirk Douglas & Kubrick themselves: the former gamely plays a worthy stoic strong character yet in comparison with Heston's slightly-vulnerable take on Ben Hur it feels like Spartacus the man is almost too perfect. And Kubrick's films famously feel a little colder and more detached than the usual. It might also be the soundtrack, which didn't stir me (was more distracting than anything else).So in a head-to-head I'd just about favour the Ben Hur movie in the all-time rankings. They place 3 & 4 behind Lawrence of Arabia and John Huston's powerful The Bible (1966) in my personal rankings of such movies.Still a few to go: Fall Of The Roman Empire, El Cid, Doctor Zhivago, Barabbas and some others. Having a lot of fun with these types of movies! Next Kubrick will be Lolita.Ps - I watched the 55th-Anniversary Bluray Edition. Excellent picture! Apparently the 50th-Anniversary Edition is poor, with even the Bluray disappointing. The Criterion DVD is the better choice if you can't find the 55th-Anniversary Edition.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A different yet grand piece of work from Kubrick (like every film he does)!,"This movie ended differently than I thought it would for a bit (in a very good and powerful way) and I liked the battle scene with the Romans and how it started, plus the famous ""I'm Spartacus!"" scene. The acting and dialogue were a bit outdated but it was very good for the time, and I can now finally see how so many films copied the material from this one (such as Gladiator and Braveheart). While I liked the 10 Commandments more and while this was an overly lengthy movie to watch, it remained impressive and I was hooked from the very beginning. It's important to watch older films that are actually original for the time that they came out, and Stanley Kubrick will always be the ultimate king of directing movies!

"One of Kubrick's Lesser Efforts, But Still.....","It is really interesting to see why this film, Spartacus was made in the first place. Obviously, historical epics were massively successful during this time period. But this particular film was made as an answer to 1959's Ben-Hur. In fact, it was Kirk Douglas's answer to that movie. Douglas was originally set to star in that movie, but Charlton Heston was cast over Douglas at the last minute, giving Douglas a feeling of bitter resentment. Both films have a very common theme: one man rising against the mighty Roman Empire to fight for their beliefs. I think Ben-Hur is the better film, but there is much to admire about this film.The movie, based off the popular novel by Howard Fast, was written by Dalton Trumbo. Trumbo is a well-known screenwriter, not only for his writing talent but because he was blacklisted because of his associated ties with communism. Kirk Douglas and director Stanley Kubrick stood strong behind their screenwriter and they publicly announced Trumbo wrote their movie, instead of Trumbo hiding behind a pseudonym. I found that to be a very courageous move on the part of Douglas and Kubrick, because that could have easily hurt the movie's chance at the box office. Luckily, the film was a box office smash and was very popular with the critics and the audience alike.This film has a Roman slave named Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) as the film's central character. Spartacus is held at a gladiatorial school ran by the amusing Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov). One day, he starts a revolt because he became angered at the notion of fighting to the death for the entertainment of spoiled women. This revolt soon spread all across Italy, where thousands of slaves joined the cause. Their plan was for Silesian pirates to transport them away from Italy to new lands. Meanwhile in Rome, Senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton) schemes to have the slaves taken down by a Roman garrison. After they failed, his mentor Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) decides to lead his own army against Spartacus's slaves. Now Spartacus must face the might and power of the Roman army.Now compared to other epics of the time, I didn't like this film as much. It's certainly not a bad film, not even close to being so. The problem is the movie is a tad overlong and the story drags at certain moments. Some of the dialogue was cheesy too. By today's standards, the dialogue does not hold up very well and some of the words are laughingly bad. These complaints dragged the movie down, but only to a very small degree.There are many things I did admire about the film. There are plenty of majestic battle sequences and I liked them very much. I loved watching how the revolt started and I was cheering for Spartacus the entire time. I liked the political backdrop of the movie. Obviously, Spartacus uprising has a major political undertone which is revolution, a very appropriate theme. We also get to go behind the scenes and see how Roman politics influenced the war. It's a common fact that Roman senators always schemed against each other. The film also did something different, when compared to other epics. These other epics usually provide the normal happy ending. Well, that is not much the case with this film. If you follow history, you'll know the fate of Spartacus. But I'm not going to spoil anything for those who don't know. But the ending was very powerful and memorable. Speaking of powerful, my favorite scene was when a Roman general asked Spartacus's army where Spartacus was. Each soldier stood up and said, ""I'm Spartacus."" A very powerful scene showing the loyalty the slaves had for Spartacus and his cause.This film was the first big film of Stanley Kubrick's career. He was 30 when he directed the film, but he already had 4 feature films under his belt before this film. He masterfully directed the film, but it is publicly known that he disowned the film. It's his most straightforward film, and it was nominated for 6 Oscars (and won 4 of them). But Kubrick didn't like the film he made. He is one of my favorite directors, and you'll see more reviews of his films down the line.The film features fine performances from everyone involved. One of Kubrick's strengths is getting the very best out of his actors. Kirk Douglas portrayed Spartacus as a strong man driven by perseverance. Peter Ustinov, who won Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars for his role as Batiatus, does a wonderful job. He is consistently funny and he has a great screen presence whenever on screen. Laurence Olivier delivers a deep performance as Crassus, who is identified as bisexual in the movie. Jean Simmons does a good job as Varinia, the wife of Spartacus. She delivered some emotional performances. Just watch the ending of the movie to see why I say so. Also, keep an eye on a meaty supporting turn by Tony Curtis as Antoninus, the man who loves Spartacus like a brother. Finally, Charles Laughton is great as the soft-hearted scheming Roman Senator, Gracchus.Overall, I liked Spartacus, but I didn't really love it much. It runs into some boring stretches and parts of the movie such as the dialogue and costumes don't hold up well. But I liked how the film strived to be more historically accurate than previous epics. This is a nice film to learn something about Ancient Rome. The film does feature wonderful, bold performances, great direction, good production design, and spectacular battles. Not the greatest epics ever made, but good enough.My Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Epic done well,"I am not a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick.  I am not a huge fan of sword-and-sandal epics.  Spartacus is great.  Kirk Douglas is the sort of hero that the likes of Russell Crowe could never hope to be.

Spartacus is an epic tale of a slave and his army of fellow slaves.  The film follows Spartacus in his conquest on the Roman Empire.,"Spartacus is an excellent movie.  It is one of my favorites and a must see. I give it 5 STARS.  I am a big fan of the director Stanely Kubrick.  He's done a lot of brilliant films in the past but, Spartacus shows a special something.  I think that Spartacus is way ahead of its time.  When I first saw the film and looked at when it was made, I thaught it should have said 1980 something.  Overall I beleive that Spartacus is must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best Hollywood epics,"""Spartacus"" arrived in theatres in 1960, a time when epic movie-making was at or near its apex. The film tells the story of a slave who leads a fierce revolt against the might of the Roman Empire.Helmed by the great Stanley Kubrick, the film is naturally chock full of eye candy. However, besides the undeniable visual appeal the film also tells a story that's above average in terms of depth and originality. Yet, surprisingly, neither Kubrick nor screenwriter Dalton Trumbo were honoured with Oscar nominations.Peter Ustinov was more fortunate, snagging an Oscar nomination and then seeing it turn into a win on Oscar night. He gave what is perhaps the best performance in a film that has no shortage of stars. Kirk Douglas ably carries the film in the title role while esteemed British thespians Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton & Jean Simmons all deliver characteristically fine performances. Tony Curtis stood out in a relatively small but memorable role and recognizable faces like John Ireland, Woody Strode, John Dall & Herbert Lom also popped up from time to time.As mentioned before, Kubrick's direction is impressive, as is the Oscar-winning cinematography, art direction & costuming. It should be clear that, visually, the film is a treat while Alex North's stirring, Oscar-nominated score shows that the musical aspect was also skillfully handled.Yet, despite all of the film's strengths (not to mention its 6 Oscar nominations) it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. Luckily, time has been kind to this film and it is justifiably lauded as a classic these days. By all means, see it in order to experience Hollywood spectacle at its best.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A true epic,"Spartacus is a classic sandal and sword epic from the classical heyday of the genre, and it lives up to the reputation set by similar films like Ben-Hur. The settings are expansive and lavish, the crowds are massive and the battles are historic and scope. This setting really underscores what's at stake as we see Spartacus reluctantly leading the slave revolt and the frenzied senators in Rome trying to respond to the threat. At the same time, the story of Spartacus' wife adds a personal touch and makes the stakes work on an emotional level as well. The cut parts of the film are quite apparent in some places like the implied intrigue in the Roman Senate, but we see enough to figure out the hints of what's going on behind the scenes. The dedication of the other slaves to Spartacus' cause is authentic and more compelling than the man himself, as it's the entire movement that's the star of the show. Despite its advantages, there are a few things that let the film down a little: a lack of obvious influence from Kubrick, old fashioned accents and some hokey painted backgrounds.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kubrick's least feel movie,"This movie is lacking for me Kubrick's feel. He didn't have a full control over this one and that shows.

But action and visuals are terrific, acting is strong, story became a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of The Best of Its Genre,"The large scale battle scenes and the number of people involved is something that won't ever be seen in a film again because CGI is far less expensive than doing it with ""real people"". Kubrick's direction of the climactic battle when Spartacus is finally defeated is a cinematic masterpiece. Alex North's score is also equally memorable. The acting performances are good, but the one that stands out as the best is Peter Ustinov's, and Charles Laughton is equally memorable, albeit in a smaller role. The film is longer than it needed to be, and there's too much dead time with the romance between the characters portrayed by Douglas and Simmons, which makes me wonder if this was necessary to satisfy Douglas's well known immense ego. This is the reason my rating isn't higher. However, Douglas deserves commendation for his courage as one of the two people to give blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo screen credit (the other was Otto Preminger) despite extremely vocal opposition, led by the vicious gossip columnist Hedda Hopper.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Little Long But Worth It.,"I only know part of the complex story behind this production.  Thewriter, Trumbo, received his first credit after being jailed by theHouse Un-American Committee.  Some of the most crucialscenes were removed because of the MPAA.  Thankfully, therestored extended version is amazing.  Kubrick came to the projectlate and didn't like the script or the lead actress.  Unfortunately, hereplaced her with Simmons; she's a decent actress, but the plotdepends on her being a gorgeous woman, which she's not.  Thisis Douglas' finest performance (that I've seen).

Memorable and Iconic,"Stanley Kubrick's sword & sandal epic, Spartacus, is a film that should not be ignored as it holds an importance place in the director's catalog. This was not one of the films that introduced me to Kubrick's works and I came into this thinking it may surprise or immerse me that it would rise at the same level as my opinion on Kubrick's masterpieces. Sadly, it did not hit me with much force as I wanted it to.The plot of Spartacus is the rise of Spartacus from the shackles of Rome's slavery. It is a story that I indeed enjoy but since the film, at times, drifts away from Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) and focuses on Crassus' (Laurence Olivier) goal for power and dictatorship of Rome, it took me out as that half doesn't hold up to the strength in Spartacus' story. It doesn't get to the point that the film becomes dull, so it is still tolerable. I felt Dalton Trumbo's script lacked interesting dialogue and sometimes doesn't create that sense of importance in what they are saying. I believe in a film like this, it is dialogue that should keep the audience invested, as it serves in supporting the plot and intentions of the characters on screen. The rivalry between Gracchus (Charles Laughton) and Crassus is very entertaining as it explores the paths of what Rome can become. It is the screenplay that holds most of the issues I have with this film and if it have been maybe revised or spent a little more time on it, this film would have been a masterpiece.2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, Full Metal Jacket, Lolita and Barry Lyndon, are films of Kubrick that I felt were all daring as they have imposed either controversy, antagonizing characters, exploratory themes and risk for low financial gain. Spartacus on the other hand was something of an epic which had extremely high expectations and was easy to market to the public. This film in his catalog definitely seems like an oddball. I felt that Kubrick did not have that creative control in this production as compared to his other projects but he did the best he could with what he had. Kubrick understood the material enough to convey what is needed to tell this tale. He also knew that this film had to be big as the story's themes of hope and freedom had tremendous weight.As I said, this film is large and to convey that, you need to have a cinematographer who can deliver. Russell Metty showed he could handle a project this big. Metty's photography showed the scale of film and, along with Alex North's score, carried significant weight. The battle scenes are example that shows just how big the production is. Metty did not only create beautiful and large long shots but also handled the intimate moments between characters delicately. Scenes with Spartacus and Varinia (Jean SImmons) are captured with such elegance that it is at par with Metty's large ambitious shots. Metty is an important aspect in making Spartacus an epic film that rivals classics like Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.The film's length, 3 hours and 17 minutes, is a stretch and some scenes could have been a bit trimmed. I felt that the pacing was a little on the slow side for me and with the issues of the film's script, it made it a bit more of a chore. To me, the length of a film is not the issue but rather the content within that length is what determines the necessity of longer running time. If the film explored a little more with the Senate and make it very entertaining and smartly executed then I would satisfied with the running time, maybe even longer.The score of the film is conducted and composed by Alex North, who I recall also did the score for Cleopatra. North's score definitely has a presence in the film and screams out to be noticed but it isn't the grand moments like the battles that gets me listening but rather the intricate moments between Spartacus and Varinia that shows off a memorable tune that creates the element of romance between the two. His score definitely goes hand in hand with Russell Metty's photography and delivers something that will be remembered in the long run.For a character to become believable, the actor must be deeply attached and understand the role that they are embodying. Kirk Douglas definitely shows that here and is one of the big reasons that makes Spartacus' cause all the more believable. While Douglas is the strongest aspect of this cast, it is not without the help of fantastic supporting actors like Charles Laughton, Jean Simmons, Peter Ustinov and Tony Curtis. They really connected with their characters and brought their A-game to the film. The downside of the cast is sadly, Laurence Olivier. Olivier brought as much as he could with the character Crassus but the character is written so thinly that it Olivier couldn't show off his abilities. There is one seen which I thought explored the character Crassus for a bit, and that was the restored scene of him in the bath being washed by Antonius (Tony Curtis).The film has it's weak point but it doesn't place the film as the weakest of Kubrick's films or even within that decade or genre as it is solidified it's classic status with it's iconic score and photography, strong story, and a powerful cast.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'm Spartacus!,"Spartacus is a 1960 film directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons and Tony Curtis.
I must admit that I haven't really seen many Kubrick films so far, this is only the 3rd one, however I will say that all of them have been really good experiences.
The film has some great acting by all of the cast and the story is very interesting with a strong ending, also the battle sequence is great and the following ""I'm Spartacus"" scene is very emotional and one of the most iconic moments in film.
That being said I think that this film has sadly been a little overlooked or forgotten maybe because it's less memourable then other Kubrick's works like A Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Shining or Dr Strangelove or maybe because it stays under the shadow of Ben Hur who came out the year before.

The tragic, and yet the somehow best possible, ending was unexpected and made Spartacus emotionally a lot stronger than I thought this movie was going to be.A must watch for anyone who loves the epic classics, or to any fan of Kirk Douglas!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sweeping epic of revoltin' slaves,"Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece - which is saying something, considering Kubrick's work, which includes ""2001,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""Barry Lyndon"" - covers quite a bit of historical ground, but no director before or since has told the tale of the strong slave Spartacus inciting his fellow chained men and women to rebel against the arms of Italy. It's movies like these, along with De Mille's ""The Ten Commandments,"" that really defined the term ""sweeping epic."" Kirk Douglas stars as the resilient leader Spartacus, and gives an unusually commanding and convincing performance. He's supported by an all-star cast, of course, including a magnificent Peter Ustinov, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work. The toughest part for Kubrick probably wasn't filming the movie, it was keeping all of his stars' egos in check - he had Charles Laughton, Ustinov, and Lawrence Olivier, to name three. Such heavyweights in a movie today would provide some amiable gossip column fodder, but it's a testament to Kubrick that there weren't more problems on the set. As for the movie itself, you won't find many movies with the same level of cinematography, which also garnered an Oscar. A must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
a model,"after so many years, it is one of impressive models for theme and important mark for its cast members. not for to be heroic or example of remarkable acting, for costumes, details, different ingredients of a blockbuster but for the courage to be different. Kirk Douglas is Spartacus and that is a certitude, Charles Laughton does a splendid role and Laurence Olivier is himself in the skin of Crassus, the fight scenes, the dialogs are admirable but in middle of a wave of super-productions, it propose not exactly a show but a vision about reality. so, it is not Ben Hur or another sparkle movie but instrument for a noble idea who represents triumph of idea and not the lovely end. a film who must see it after a period, like a good book reading. for its fresh air, for its powerful symbols, as homage for Kubrick genius and for remember of ideals value. a model. not only for cinema art.",,Anonymous,Biography
More Titanic Than Any Story Ever Told,"One of its tagline says, ""More titanic than any story ever told!"" which actually isn't very far from the truth & also notorious for being the only feature in the legendary film career of director Stanley Kubrick on which he didn't have complete artistic control, Spartacus is breathtaking in both scope of its ambition & scale of its production, and just like every other Kubrick film, is an influential example of its genre.Based on Howard Fast's novel of the same name & set in 1st century BC, Spartacus tells the true life story of its titular character; a rebellious slave being trained at a gladiatorial school, who begins an uprising which soon spreads across the Italian Peninsula, resulting in the freedom of thousands of slaves but when his plan to flee the country is disrupted, he decides to challenge the might of Roman Empire.Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film has all the trademarks of this auteur yet feels remarkably different & unique compared to his previous works. The film is the first big-budget production of his career & yet the manner in which the then-young Kubrick handles its huge cast & epic scope is a testament to his skills as a filmmaker. Written by Dalton Trumbo, the screenplay isn't very accurate to its historical facts but it does make the story more relatable with current events.The technical aspects are always gold-standard in Kubrick films & Spartacus is no exception. The set pieces are amazing to look at, locations are elegantly chosen, Cinematography makes fab use of its camera, the panoramic shots are spectacular, colour composition is vibrant & the level of detail is quite extensive. Despite running over 3 hours, it kept me deeply invested in its story & Alex North's majestic score provides an epic feel to its narrative.Coming to the performances, Spartacus features a star-studded cast in Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, Tony Curtis & others. Douglas gives his all in the role of Spartacus & delivers a fantastic performance, Olivier plays Crassus with fine elegance, Laughton as Gracchus ends up stealing every scene he's in, Gavin doesn't do much as Julius Caesar, Curtis is brilliant as Antoninas & Jean Simmons does a good job as Varinia in a film dominated by men.On an overall scale, to know that the screen being filled with thousands of people doesn't have one pixel of CGI in it, to know that each one of those extras was a real person indeed & to know that Kubrick managed to churn out an epic that more than lives up to its word are amongst a few things that makes me admire Spartacus all the more. Grandeur in scale, highly entertaining, very engaging, and covering love, betrayal, corruption, slavery, mutiny, civilization & leadership with finesse, Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus comes strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,Biography

Hollywood epics at their worst.,"Wow if you won't let Kubrick do anything on the set, then what are you doing on the set?  Definately a corrupted film from start to finish, but give it credit, it sure did use a big cast.  I really think this was Kubricks worst, and boy do I mean worst film ever.

Kubrick's Take on the Hollywood Epic.,"Excellent and sprawling epic drama that is one of the most under-rated films ever produced. The titled slave (Kirk Douglas) leads a revolt against the evil Roman Empire, trying to win freedom for himself and all those like him. Laurence Olivier gives a show-stopping performance as Douglas' mortal enemy. Charles Laughton, Tony Curtis and Jane Russell also add great supporting turns. Peter Ustinov took home Oscar gold as he steals every scene as a self-absorbed slave trader who eventually has a change of heart. The massive budget, amazing cinematography and breath-taking art direction are just super. Stanley Kubrick's patented attention to minute details is truly uncanny. A great achievement that is somewhat forgotten on Kubrick's list, but is arguably his finest work. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Biography
A seminal epic,"This epic film was obviously the provenance for later historic-dramas such as Braveheart and Gladiator (in fact the similarities to the former are numerous in both style and content right down to the torturous death scene, alleviated by emotional fulfillment, that ends the movie).  But the makers of both those flicks were prescient in using this Stanley Kubrick classic as an archetypal base. A strong cast consisting of Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis and the enjoyable Peter Ustinov impels the vision of Kubrick, resulting in a magniloquent saga of the slave who fights the good fight.  Of course it's not Spartacus' self-solicitousness that endears us to his plight, it is his struggle for the manumission of all his brothers in bondage.  His dedication to his comrades is reciprocated in a cinematic highlight that swells the soul as his defeated soldiers defy the power of mighty Rome by unifying in impending death (`I am Spartacus' they all shout) rather than condemn their leader to a lonely demise.Kubrick would go on to make more important films, but none as august as this work.  Spartacus stands as a salient film be it for its precursory effluence or its own sublime qualities.",,Anonymous,Biography
worth it,"For some reason, this was the one of the great 1950s-60s classics I had never seen, not to mention the one Kubrick classic I'd missed. But I finally watched it (letterbox, of course) on DVD and have to say, I see why it's considered a classic. From what I've heard and read of the true story of Spartacus, it strays a bit, and some of the stars (Douglas, Curtis) stay a little too well-groomed throughout the movie, but overall, it is an incredible film. It is more David Lean than Kubrick, but there are some excellent touches that remind you it is Kubrick (the snail-oyster thing, of course). And, as with any film in which I've ever seen him, Charles Laughton is just a bulbous, but overwhelming presence. He is in charge of virtually every scene he's in.",,Anonymous,Biography
Not the best story for a movie,"I had high hopes in this movie. I thought since it was so acclaimed and since I liked Gladiator so much, I would enjoy it. Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis are also two of my favorite actors. I enjoyed it up until the end. The movie was very good, but turned out very bad.Director Anthony Mann directed the first hour, which was very good, but then he was fired and the great Stanley Kubrick was hired. For what? So they could push him around. He had no control over the rest of his film and ever since that he has disowned it. Maybe that's why the movie turned out to be so terrible. What is the point of this movie?Spartacus shows slaves escape and it shows how they are determined to fight the Romans for their freedom. They fight and lose.In their agony of defeat they are crucified. As I said, what is the point of this movie? What a terrible ending this movie had. What a terrible movie this turned out to be. This movie is a downer. Not the best story for a movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
The evocati and the spatial logic,"Film, and by extension life, is a matter of ranges of truth, never a single one. Here we have three principals following their idea of what ought to be conveyed by struggle.Douglas at around this time went looking for a stage sufficiently big for his ego to strut. He had campaigned for Ben Hur, when that failed he set out with his production house to make his own. What he demands of the film and gets is by far the least interesting range here, a Braveheart of its time; the lowly hero who revolts against oppression, gets the pure girl, addresses and inspires the crowds with a message of freedom.It's not clear from a little research I did if Douglas set out to make a political statement or if the possibility for one emerged when the option of involving Trumbo landed on the table. Trumbo was still blacklisted at that time and jailed prior so hiring him in the open was a bold move. It's more clear that the film wouldn't have drawn the same attention without it; JFK wouldn't have had to cross picket lines to see the film.The message is that only when you embody the idea does it acquire presence and truth, more interesting this. We can see this in the film here, the one that ended the blacklist. No court decided prior, the film revolted anyway, dismantling it in practice. And why this film? The ground was of course prepared by circumstances but still why this and not any other? Because its own push is against intolerance and oppression written by someone who actually embodied its message in his own story.It's not however a view to really contemplate now; we still have heroes and villains on clear sides, an unambiguous struggle against evil. It's not, only because this particular evil is now, or seems now, to be much more distant than even then.Kubrick was the latest addition to the fold, hired on two days notice and with production already underway (the Libyan scenes had been filmed).It's easy to see what he may have balked at to the point of later disowning the work, and easy to retrospectively think that had it not been for Douglas this would have been a 2001 or Barry Lyndon of epics. But this was still 1960 so just as L'Avventura (and soon Marienbad) were redefining the planes of narrative. My notion is that Kubrick had as much of an ego as Douglas and simply disowned this for not having overseen every single element, it doesn't look 'ruined' in some way.Kubrick does solid work in the classical scenes of the epic, more so for someone so young who came into it so late. I saw it together with Fall of the Roman Empire (by the guy who was fired by this) and there's a clear difference, that one stale, this energetic.His real work however is in the sculpting of a more embodied space to have presence. Trumbo wrote in a more intimate vein, quite apart from the loud overall message. It's closer to how we do things now than say Ben Hur, trying to place us (to an extent) in the unfolding life. Kubrick extends in the eye.During the bouts in the gladiatorial school for the indifferent amusement of Roman visitors, we stay with Spartacus in the wooden box and watch the first pair fight through planks of wood. Another is after Spartacus has amassed his makeshift army, as Douglas gives one of his speeches our eye wanders off among the crowd. The whispered seduction in the bath and that is followed by a view of the legions quietly tiptoeing out of Rome at dawn.All well known scenes, all of them about creating presence. We've taken the next step to where they are now commonplace and perhaps disappear in the spectacle, for the time though they were more forward-looking than usual in this niche. The spontaneity has gone out but the desire to portray in a more intimate way still shows.And then there's the final battle which curiously stands out more. Here it becomes all about arranged space, purely architectural. The shape of the arranged armies on opposite crests of hills that look like calligraphic scrawls on green, the choreographed cuts of far and close, abstract and concrete; it's so good it rivals Welles in his own game. Watching this is to get a sense of what we potentially missed in his Napoleon.",,Anonymous,Biography

Gladiator 1960,"Fans of Gladiator really owe it to themselves to see this movie, which is not one of Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces (at least in my opinion), but still rousing entertainment.  The differences between the two movies are clear:  Spartacus features no posturing by its leading man; no computerized effects; and a script which is a lot more intelligent and has a sly sense of humor (Gladiator just took itself so damn seriously!)  Kubrick came on board after the movie started shooting, and did not have final say in the product (this was Kirk Douglas' baby).  So it doesn't really FEEL like a Kubrick film.  However, movie fans should see it, and on a big screen if they can.",,Anonymous,Biography
