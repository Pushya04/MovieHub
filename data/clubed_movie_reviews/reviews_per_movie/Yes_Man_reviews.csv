Amusing,"Being lucky, I already saw ""Yes Man"" and was pleasantly surprised. Jim Carrey is not really my all time favorite (despite his comic talent and acting skills), but in this movie he seems to have hit the spot.The story itself is really simple: Carl (Jim Carrey), a very negative man, goes to a meeting among the very positive Yes people, whose charismatic leader (Terence Stamp) preaches that one should say Yes to all questions and agree with all propositions. Carl is reluctantly convinced to try it out, and after meeting a girl on a scooter (the ever so lovely Zooey Deschanel) all sorts of things start happening around him. But being 100% positive might be tricky sometimes...It is all very silly, of course - but this feel-good comedy has a small undertone of seriousness as well. And it has a great cast, many delightful scenes, a reasonably relaxed Jim Carrey and a lighthearted style. Y/N? I say Y.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Say yes!,"Yes Man follows the same basic genre comedy structure that we've seen an endless amount of times in the past few years. The main character has a big problem, they work to solve that problem, the problem is solved and happy times are had. Then another problem arises as a result to the solution to the original problem. So everyone is sad. But then that problem is solved and everyone lives happily ever after. And there's a message about how to live your life sprinkled in there. For every single comedy in the past few years with that structure, I've gotten so bored by the time it's over because I just lose interest when the drama comes in during the third act. I either don't care about the characters or I don't care about the message.Every comedy except for this one. Not only did I care about the characters so much (thanks mostly to the performances from Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel who put a beautiful, free-spirited romance at the core of this seemingly typical comedy) that I was emotionally impacted during that predictable turn for the worse near the end, but the message of the film was actually something that I found relatable to my own life which is something I've never experience during these kind of comedies. I'm definitely a man who doesn't really live his life (as cheesy as that sounds) because I isolate myself by making excuses to just be alone and not be with anyone. As a result, I was definitely more invested in this film than I have been with other comedies of the same vein.Add to all this the fact that it's completely hilarious throughout to the point where I have no hesitation in calling it the funniest movie of the year and easily the best straight comedy (not that there have been many good ones; three by my count). Plus, of course, Zooey Deschanel is absolutely infectious in every moment she's on screen (especially her lovely singing). I love her more than air, and this is just another example of why that love is justified. Call it fanboyism if you must, but she's my #2 of the year in supporting actress right now falling second only to the Cruz. In summation, do yourself a favor and say yes to this great comedy.I'm so sorry, I had to say it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Yes Man,"I always get excited about a new Jim Carrey movie. In my opinion, he has rarely done anything unwatchable in whatever genre from The Mask to Liar Liar via Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. Yes Man is an excellent feel-good comedy with an outstanding turn from Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel & Terence Stamp. The movie is unfortunately predictable (like most Jim Carey flicks) but very enjoyable with a hard-to-ignore message about how people should live their lives. Don't be surprised after seeing the film to start saying yes a bit more often and how much of a difference it may have on your daily life. Yes Man is a worthy addition to Jim Carrey's filmography.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Pure joy. A great film, true to its rom-com genre roots. I was uplifted, and grandly entertained!","Yes Man was a delight to watch. Critics had panned it a bit, but unfairly, in my view. Granted, it is formulaic, but it IS a rom-com, and rom-coms have formulas. What made this film so great was the natural charm of Zooey Deschanel. She is beautiful, of course, but not in a ""model-y"" kind of way. She has always had a freshness and honesty about her that makes her appealing. When I first saw her in ""Almost Famous,"" playing the older sister, I wished I had an older sister like that. When she played the girl lead in Big Trouble, she was quirky, but without any of the self-aware conceit that can often accompany quirky young female actors. I will be kind and avoid names, but perhaps you can picture in your mind some of the ""Tragically Hip"" and oh-so-cool young actresses who do quirk with a smirk. Zooey Deschanel has an innocence and a friendly quality that really make her shine, in the way a flower shines.Jim Carrey was also very good in this. He is who he is--- goofy and loopy and elastic. This wasn't a ""Serious Role,"" such as Truman Show serious--- but wasn't over the top like Ace Ventura. Maybe he's mellowed with age. I liked him as a wild kid, but like him even more now that he is a bit ""evened out."" He is still hilarious--- but also a bit more human, and a bit more approachable.This movie runs through its rom-com paces, but each new scene, while a bit predictable, was nonetheless a pleasure. I felt uplifted by the end, and am very glad I went, even in the blizzard occurring where I am now staying. It was worth it!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funnyman Jim Carrey Returns,"After seeing ""The Number 23"" I was beginning to wonder if Jim Carrey had renounced his trademark physical comedy roles he played to such great effect in ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Liar, Liar"", ""Dumb & Dumber"", etc.Carrey is back in form with ""Yes Man"". While the plot was lacking and somewhat formulaic, it was fun to watch the best physical comedy talent of our generation doing what he does best for two hours. Zooey Deschanel was good as the love interest (and she did a nice job singing to).If you liked Carrey's earlier works, you'll find plenty to like in this movie. I hope Carrey keeps on doing these comedies. It's what he was born to do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A very good flick!,"I saw this movie as a early showing and having gotten the tickets for free I said ""what the heck, I'll see anything for free"". So right off the bat I went in with low expectations. The previews made it look like the same old Jim Carrey Schtick. However, I was pleasantly surprised.There was no ridiculous plot line (Liar Liar) or over the top characters (Ace Ventura) but a simple yet humorous story-line that is played to perfection by Carrey. There were plenty of good chuckles to be had and some down right laughs (and yes for those into it, a gross out scene that will make even this amazingly desensitized movie going generation cringe).Overall, Yes Man is definitely worth the 10 bucks or so that movies are now ridiculously priced out now a days. But most definitely worth the trip if its free :-p.*7/10*",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Don't be a no man!,"I went to this film as one of those process-of-elimination things: Valkry had Tom Cruise, my friend had already seen Benjamin Button, Spirit's show-times suck, my local theater is idiotic and not showing Doubt or Slumdog Millionaire, all leaving Yes Man which neither of us were enthused about, but hey! it got us out of the house. We were shocked to leave the theater with our lungs hurting. The movie was well thought, well executed, and the humor was smart, snappy, and so far from the usual toilet humor of Jim Carrey. I was throughly and delightfully surprised with this film. On the note of message: I think this film actually has a very valuable message. Never in the history of humankind has the average person had so many opportunities to live life in ways never before imagined, yet never before have we been so isolated. Our computers; our phones; our mp3s and ipods; dare I say it, our movies all keep us isolated from actual social interaction. We are skeptical and judgmental about those who actually seek social interaction and friendship (site: Norman) that we fail to realize we are the ones who are actually lame--we are the ones not gathering with the people we love and those we have yet to meet. We are the ones spending our nights lulled into lame predictability, sitting in front of our TVs, telling characters in films to ""just snap it off already."" Yes Man is not just a fun filled film. It is a well deserved social critique.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This movie is a fun one has good humor and is interesting until somewhere before the end.,"This movie is a fun one has good humor and is interesting until somewhere before the end. I mean don't expect the best work of Jim Carrey here but it's better than Bruce Almighty in my opinion. The humor is understandable by anyone but not one in a dozen, it is keeps it freshness throughout.Unfortunately there are some problems with this movie as well, the movie keeps strict to the formula of a Rom-Com so you aren't surprised anywhere and can guess the plot from the beginning to the end. This is not to bad if you can switch off your mind and just enjoy the movie.Worse is the need to have a moralistic end. Without telling how or what I will just say that this forced moralistic ending upsets the whole flow of the movie and it would have made a better movie if it had been left out. The moral is to obvious and just bad.The last flaw I really noticed was the enormous amount of products which were being endorsed by the film. It was almost funnier to watch every product which came by then the jokes of the film itself. Anyway it would make a great drinking game if you would drink every time anyone saw a product endorsement. One scene particularly would get you loaded when Jim Carrey shout a brand name at least ten times.Again in short it was a good film but it could have been better. And if you need a drinking game this movie is bound to get you loaded.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The world is a playground.,"I've seen this movie so many times now. It's hilarious and inspiring all at once. Zooey is perfect in her role, as are the rest of the cast. It has a great soundtrack, it's entertaining and never gets boring, it's moving, and it inspires you to get out and enjoy the world. The humour is smart, none of that toilet humour that I detest.
I think anyone can be inspired by this movie, it's not about doing extreme things or expensive things (like learning how to fly), it's about saying yes to life and yes to opportunities. Even if it it's something small.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Say ""Yes"" to ""Yes Man""","""Yes Man"" is surprisingly good, and here the punch line is everything. Jim Carrey is great in Director Peyton Reed's hysterical romantic comedy. Zooey Deschanel is amazingly charming and quirky. In ""Yes Man"" Carrey plays Carl, who has been divorced for 3 years from Stephanie (flighty and hot Molly Sims) and has an uninspired job as a loan officer at Brea Savings in Los Angeles. Carl has pretty much checked out in life. To that end he says ""No"" to all invites. Carl even forgets to attend his best friend Peter's (funny Bradley Cooper) engagement party. An old buddy invites Carl to a seminar given by Tony Robbins-like self help guru Terrence Bundley (charismatic Terrence Stamp). Terrence invites Carl to accept the ""covenant"" to say ""Yes"" to everything in life. Reluctantly, Carl accepts.However, there is a point to the screenplay by Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul, and Andrew Mogel based on the book by Danny Wallace. In a great conversation with Carl and Terrence later in the story Carl asks, ""So this is bullsh*t?"" Carl has been so not present in his own life. Obviously, saying ""Yes"" mindlessly to everything is ridiculous. What if taking on saying ""Yes"" as an operating practice is a way of practicing being enrolled in life. When you are enrolled in life, and become enrolling, you are now open to a new realm of possibility. Reed and his writers present this transformed perspective in both a hysterical and touching manner.Saying ""Yes"" immediately does not seem to make a difference for Carl. Carl ends up giving a ride and all of his money to Homeless Guy (funny Brent Briscoe). With his cell phone dead and his car empty on gas, Carl ventures miles to a gas station where he meets free-spirited scooter girl Allison (Deschanel). Allison gives Carl a ride, and leaves an indelible mark on his heart. In not the most linear or obvious ways, Carl soon embraces saying ""Yes"". Peter asks, ""So you say 'yes' to everything?"" Carl confesses, ""I wasn't open to stuff. Now I am""Carl eventually is fated to meet up with Allison. Carl tells Peter that ""She is so not me."" There in lies the genius. There is a quiet moment at the Hollywood Bowl where Allison tells Carl, ""The whole world is a playground. Somewhere along the way everyone forgets that"" Here Reed is unexpectedly poignant. Carrey and Zooey's sweet and funny chemistry give ""Yes Man"" its big heart.""Yes Man"" is hysterical. Carrey is at his best playing outrageous comedic with an underlying humanity, instead of straight up serious drama. He is amazingly hysterical as he serenades a Jumper (funny Luis Guzman), takes a drunken beating from an angry boyfriend, and jacked up on Red Bull in a jogging photography class. Zooey Deschanel is Carrey's amazing romantic foil. There is a nice scene as she and Carrey walk side by side along a barren Nebraska road. She is cute and has such a radiant spirit and vulnerability. So her Allison must touchingly reconcile for herself whether Carl is just saying ""Yes"". ""Yes Man"" is about what's in your heart and being open to all the possibilities of life. That's not a bad message for a hilarious and outrageous comedy from Jim Carrey and Peyton Reed. Say ""Yes"" to ""Yes Man"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Better than I thought it would be,"When I first saw that my two sisters wanted to see this film, I was not that motivated initially, thinking it would be a substandard and predictable comedy with contrived romance. I don't know why I thought that, despite starring Jim Carrey who is quite likable anyway and an intriguing concept, part of my brain was telling me it wasn't going to be good. But I watched it anyway, as I always give films a chance even if the film turns out utter rubbish. After watching, I was pleasantly surprised; it has its flaws but it was an above average film. The romance isn't as good as Carrey's enjoyably wacky antics though, the pacing is sometimes uneven and there was one scene when Carl's neighbour makes sexual advances towards him that I felt wasn't needed. That said though, the concept about what would happen if you answered every question with the answer yes is very intriguing, and the script is good. Also well done is the pleasant cinematography and very good performances from Carrey and the beautiful Zooey Deschanel, who gives her Allison free spirit and charm. Howver it is Rhys Darby as the geeky, Harry Potter-obsessed bank manager who comes very close to stealing the film. Not to mention Terrence Stamp as Terrence, the quasi-religious seminar leader. Overall, flawed, but intriguing and surprisingly likable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Entertaining and an Encouraging Message,"Although I read many negative reviews of Yes Man, I still decided to go to the theater. That is totally a wise decision."" Yes Man"" is quite hilarious with a deep message about how to live and enjoy life. Some of you may see the trailer and think it is similar to one of Jim Carey's films ""Liar Liar"". Let me say this: it is totally different. Yes Man's plot is not so predictable. In fact, it is quite good. It really amazed me. It is full of funny moments and incredible scenes of Jim and Zooey.This film got some romantic scene between Jim and Zooey. Jim Carrey in this film really impressed me because of his style. His acting is more natural and thoughtful than he was in ""Liar Liar"", reminding me of him in Eternal Sunshine.Zooey Deschanel has got a specially sexy voice and big eyes, which makes me like her so far. She really has a unique style.I really enjoy funny songs performed by two main characters (Jim's and Zooey's) with amusing lyricss.Yes Man delivers a good message about positive living style.

"Jim Carrey returns with full force; if only ""Yes Man"" could keep up","Yes ManDirected by Peyton Reed. Starring Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper.In the late '90s, Jim Carrey decided he'd had enough of playing the silly goofball and started on a path to more serious films like ""The Truman Show."" Ten years later, he's had his share of hits, but for the most part, his comedic efforts have fallen flat. Excusing 2003's fairly enjoyable ""Bruce Almighty"", Carrey hasn't had much recent success with the genre that he once dominated (""Fun with Dick and Jane"", anyone?).In ""Yes Man"", the skilled physical comedian has dusted off the cobwebs and is back in good form. Carrey really seems to be enjoying himself, putting on his best game face and immersing himself in the sight gags and slapstick madness that were so commonplace in his earlier films. He hasn't lost his touch or his talent at making people laugh, and he makes sure that the audience knows it.Truthfully, the plot to ""Yes Man"" is irrelevant. Carl Allen (Carrey), a man afraid of living life, challenges himself to say 'yes' to everything for an entire year. Hilarity ensues and in the end, everyone learns a lesson. It's nothing more than a vehicle to showcase Carrey's ability. But really, which one of his comedies isn't? There are no unexpected twists or surprise endings, just Jim Carrey doing what Jim Carrey does best. Everything else is secondary.The film is rounded out rather nicely by a few of its supporting players. Zooey Deschanel is a cute and bubbly romantic interest who even adds a bit of mayhem to the proceedings, instead of being relegated to straight-man status. ""Flight of the Conchords'"" Rhys Darby shines as Carl's Harry Potter-obsessed co-worker. However, some of the cast feels extraneous. Bradley Cooper and ""That '70s Show's"" Danny Masterson are given little to do, and contribute little as a result. The missed opportunities are irksome, but will do little to affect one's enjoyment of the film.""Yes Man"" is a fun time waiting to be had for those who know what to expect. The movie is generally funny throughout, but not clever or inventive enough to justify a second look. It's the kind of entertainment that leaves you chuckling, but won't be remembered long after viewing. The biggest thing going for the film is that it has re-energized Jim Carrey. He's an absolute joy to watch; one only wishes that ""Yes Man"" could keep up with him.Final Grade: C+",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not Jim's best, but still a nice comedy","Jim Carrey, a man who has delivered some of the most memorable comedies of the 90's: Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, Dumb and Dumber, and the Mask. He used to be one of the funniest men alive, now it's just kind of odd, he's gone into the drama genre in films, which is good, he's actually proved to be a good actor. But with the comedy, it's like he was once the person who you would be first to invite to the party because he was so funny, now he's the guy who invites himself to the party and laughs at his own jokes. I think because he's older it's just awkward watching him trying so hard to make people laugh. Not that Yes Man is a bad film, it's just a different version of Liar Liar, yet he's not even hypnotized into saying yes to everything, he just does so because he thinks it'll make his life better. So instead of feeling bad for him you just go ""ummm, are you an idiot?"". I don't wanna know if a man hit on him if he had to say yes to that too.Los Angeles bank employee Carl Allen has become withdrawn and depressed since his divorce from ex-wife Stephanie. Routinely ignoring his friends, he has grown used to spending his spare time watching DVDs alone in his apartment. His outlook on life has become inherently negative. But when a friend persuades him to attend the ""Yes!"" self-improvement seminar, motivational guru Terrence Bundley publicly browbeats him into making a covenant with himself. Carl reluctantly promises to stop being a ""No Man"" and vows to answer ""Yes!"" to every opportunity, request or invitation that presents itself thereafter. After the seminar he meets Allison, an eccentric young woman who is refueling her scooter. After this experience, Carl adopts a positive mentality and seizes every opportunity that comes his way. He takes flying lessons, attends Korean language classes, learns to play the guitar, and even joins a Persian dating website. Saying ""yes"" constantly works to Carl's advantage. As their relationship blossoms, Carl and Allison meet at the airport for a spontaneous weekend excursion. But while checking in for the flight, Carl is detained by FBI agents, who have profiled him as potential terrorist because he has taken flying lessons, studied Korean, approved a loan to a fertilizer company, met an Iranian mail-order bride, and bought plane tickets at the last minute. Then Allison begins to doubt whether his commitment to her was ever sincere.Yes Man is over all a good comedy, it has a few good laughs here and there. I think the plot just needed a bit of work, because like I said before it's just odd that he isn't hypnotized into saying yes constantly, he just does so because someone told him to do it. Yeah, it brought him to some great moments in his life, but he ordered a bride? He's just a little bit crazy. But over all I'd have to say that this movie is more of a rental vs. a theater experience. Jim Carrey can still make you laugh, but not the same as he used to, it's just time to grow up, how long can you make those stupid faces for without looking ridicules being a grown man? Well, the money helps I guess.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Carrey is back with a bang. Yes! Yes! Yes!,"Being a teenager in the 1990's, I have to say I was never a big fan of Jim Carrey's mainstream performances in the movies that made him the star that he is today. Hits like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Liar Liar left me mostly indifferent to Carrey's rather obscene personality. It was only when he shined in more complex roles like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon and eventually Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that I grew to respect the wide range of characters Carrey is able to bring to life.Over recent years, Carrey continued doing his thing, moving from comedy to dramatic roles and vice versa. The problem is that all of the sudden he wasn't alone in the ring anymore, and countless other comedians have tried to slip into his shoes to various degrees of success. There was no place to deny it; Carrey was in need of a hit to re-establish his place in the Hollywood sky.Cue the brand new comedy Yes Man, that finds Carrey once again in his favorite ""What if...?"" sub-genre. This time around, he plays Carl, a lonely divorcée that has somehow alienated even his best friend (portrayed successfully by Wedding Crasher's Bradley Cooper). Carl is stuck in a dead-end job at a bank, yearns for his ex-wife and spends his evenings watching rented DVDs... all by himself. When an old friend introduces him to a corny self-help program (lead by a hilarious Terrence Stamp) that persuades him to answer ""yes"" to every question thrown his way, Carl's life takes a dramatic turn.As expected, the new approach gets our hero into all kinds of wacky situations - such as spending a steamy morning with his horny elderly neighbor (!); meeting a potential Iranian wife through an online service; partying all night whilst drinking countless cans of Red-Bull and over excessively helping a homeless person. Luckily enough, it also introduces him to the extremely free-spirited Allison (portrayed by the ever-so-cute Zooey Dashnel).If you've seen the average Carrey comedy, you can probably guess how the plot unfolds from here on out, necessary complications included. The format is more or less the same of what we've been used to seeing Carrey perform in his comic outings, with the main idea being a modern moral story urging people to stop going through the motions of life and start seizing the day. But I digress. It seems as though years of perfecting his comic roles as well as starring in more ""grown up"" roles have tamed Carrey a bit. A lot of the arrogance and awkwardness revolving his earlier films seem to be missing this time out, and instead I could actually feel true emotion and heart in Yes Man. It seems as if this fact alone contributed greatly to the fact that most of the punch lines actually worked here and I found myself smiling for the larger part of the film.Some points that still managed to ruin some of the fun are: A. As mentioned above, the film was very predictable, and formulated at that. B. Carrey has definitely aged recently, and it's starting to show. The age gap between him and Dashnel left me feeling somewhat uncomfortable.However, all in all I had a great time with some excellent laughs - and at the end of the day that's what really counts (:",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"The Power Of ""Yes""","In all honesty Jim Carrey sometimes grates on me. He's funny, but far too often his humour becomes too over the top and his characters become cartoons rather than real people. When he keeps that to a minimum, though, he can work very well, and he managed to pull that balance off with ""Yes Man."" Of the Carrey movies I've seen I'd probably compare this most to ""Bruce Almighty"" - not in terms of plot but in terms of the type of character he was playing and the challenges the character was facing. In this, Carrey played Carl Allen, a loan officer at a bank who leads a pretty empty, lonely and unproductive life. One day, a buddy convinces him to attend a self-help seminar, where he learns to start living life by saying ""yes"" to every opportunity that comes up. Terrence Stamp, by the way, was absolutely bang-on as the self-help guru.Thanks to the power of ""yes"" Carl's life moves into overdrive. Suddenly he's involved with everything and everyone: from guitar lessons, flying lessons and Korean lessons to a new job as an executive to a new love - and he's loving his life. Finally, though, his new love interest, played by Zooey Deschanel, reminds him of reality. She tells him that she loves him and asks him to move in with her. Of course he says ""yes,"" but when she finds out about the program she backs out - does he really want to or is he just following the program? Can she believe a word he says to her? The key to the movie in the end is whether Carl can learn to really live his own life rather than just being enslaved to the program that originally seemed to have given him freedom.It's an interesting premise for a movie, very well written and well acted, and, in the end, both thought-provoking and a lot of fun. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Yes, it's worth checking out.","This was a surprising comedy, because I thought I won't like it that much and would end up a below average comedy. Even the trailer didn't seem that good and not very interesting. And even when the film started I just wanted to hate it but as the film progressed I started to enjoy it bit by bit. Most comedies usually have a strong start but start to lose it's flair after a while, this isn't the case for ""Yes Man"". This is a movie to get back to the younger audience for Jim Carrey where the premise is sort of similar to ""Liar Liar""(1997) except he isn't forced by some supernatural powers to say yes to everything. While in ""Liar Liar"" he could not lie because a curse was on him. In this movie he says yes to everything because it opens up doors for new opportunities in his life and it works for the better for him and by saying no he thinks bad stuff will happen to him because he makes a covenant, coincidence or not. But it just isn't something a lot of people hasn't seen before. Jim Carrey's character is one of those guys that stays in his apartment most of the time and hardly has interest in women and says no to just about everything. But that changes when a friend of his suggest he go to a seminar that could change his life for the better. And than his journey begins with random stuff happening in his life when he starts saying yes to everything while being obnoxious and retarded to the point you could tell Zooey Deschanel who Jim Carrey's character falls for is annoyed by him even while trying to act. This is a okay date movie as well since it's actually quite amusing at times and like I said has it's moments while going the romantic comedy direction. Although younger audiences will probably enjoy this movie, it just isn't really appropriate for them. It would have been cool though if they pushed the yes factor and made Jim Carrey do even crazier stuff.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This movie is really good!,"Despite the fact that I am a huge fan of Carrey, I admit a lot of his comedic performances are somewhat ridiculous. But this is legitimately a sensible comedy where he doesn't use a lot of his ""Rubberface"" antics and actually just acts funny. The premise of this film is intriguing and I loved watching it. Both Jim and Zooey are excellent the story is amazing. All the Carrey-haters should give this one a chance, it really deserves it. I think Jim's most recent movies have been great. It's his older movies that people hate him for. But he's becoming a legit dramatic actor who can also be funny. He sometimes goes over the top, but all-in-all he is a multi-faceted professional. This movie deserves a lot of praise because it is excellent. This brings back flashes of his performance in the extremely popular ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". In closing, give ""Yes Man"" a chance. It's good for some laughs but also offers a very optimistic view on life in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I couldn't stop smiling!  Not once through the whole movie!,"That is, except when I was laughing out loud. The movie is more than that though. It gives us some philosophical and even metaphysical potentialities to think about. ""Yes always leads to something good,"" is the presupposition offered to the protagonist. A true statement, but a trick assertion if one believes EVERYTHING leads to something good. ""Let your yea be yea and your nay be nay"" means either way leads to something good. Just be clear about what you want. Its being shifty and/or indecisive that leads to confusion and disharmony. Yet, I think this is just the kind of movie that will get people thinking differently, get people to act apart from habit, to see what happens, and get people experimenting with life. This is when we truly live. And I dare say, this is when we begin to have faith.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Just say ""No"" to ""Yes Man"" unless...","...you're under the age of 25 and uninventive comedy and PG-13 crude sexual humor is what makes you laugh.Seriously, how did this movie rate a ""7.0"" on IMDb?? Maybe they should start requiring an age and/or IQ factor to help normalize the final user ratings for movies...Granted, there was the basic premise of an interesting idea in this movie, but there was so much lameness in so much of the movie that it was just basically (to me) unfunny. Then again, if you just get into stupid mindless gag-type comedy and rather tasteless crude sexual humor, then maybe it might rate a 7.0 or greater for you.There were a few clever as well as a few sweet moments in the movie (i.e., respectively, when Carrey's various ""Yes!""-inspired self-improvement forays come in handy in unexpected ways, and scenes with Zooey's big hound dog eyes doing their best emotive magic), but very few.What a shame, and what a waste of Carrey's comedic talents. Sure, he's been a big commercial success the last 10-15 years, but you would have to be older than 25 to really remember and appreciate how truly comically inventive and talented he was as he became a surprise star in the Wayans Brothers' show ""In Living Color"" on the then-fledgling Fox Network.As for ""Yes Man,"" my advice is to just say ""No"" if you're over 25 or 30.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Worthy of a good laugh or two,"Meet Carl. Carl leads a life on his own. Somewhat miserable because he's always stuck with himself. Carl denies himself all the pleasures of life because he's unable to accept them. With each and every new opportunity arising he turns it down with a firm NO. Luckily for Carl he has a friend, a friend that pulls him along to a seminar where Carl is introduced to the power of Yes. Converted by the power of Yes Carl is now ready to accept life's challenges and chances, saying Yes to every single one of them.And so the film starts running and shooting gags concerning each of the accepted chances and the very most of them work out pretty well. Carrey is on a roll playing the plagued Carl that has to swallow down quite a few odd things during his days of the all-accepter. The pace of the film comes to its final speed when Carl runs into Allison though, who I guess can be considered his final and most challenging opportunity. It works out flawlessly - Deschanel plays her brilliantly and the two characters together work out more than well enough.The story line plays by rather predictable, but that's fine. It's no big mystery of life that is being challenged here after all.

And the fun gets repetitive and ever more tired...In the end, it leaves us with the fateful question: ""And so, what...?"" But, at least, it is some comedy... Mediocre, but still amusing...

Changing Attitude,"The banker Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a lonely man with low self-esteem after his divorce with Stephanie (Molly Sims), for whom he still yearns; he avoids his best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper); he has a boring job, stalled in a bureaucratic position in the loan department of a bank; and he spends his spare time watching DVDs. When he meets by chance his former high school mate Nick (John Michael Higgins), he is convinced to participate of a self-help program called ""Yes Man"" leaded by the guru Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). The basic principle of the program is to say ""yes"" to new situations, leaving the negativism aside. Carl misunderstands the concept and says ""yes"" to every question. While leaving the encounter, he helps a homeless man and in the end of the night he meets the gorgeous Allison (Zooey Deschanel) that helps him with her scooter. His life completely changes with his new attitude: he becomes closer to his manager Norman (Rhys Darby) and is finally promoted in the bank; he experiences the most surrealistic and the weirdest situations, and becomes successful and with many friends, until the day that he discovers that sometime a ""no"" is necessary for an answer.""Yes Man"" is a good romance that highlights the importance of changing attitude in life. Carl Allen is a very negative man that has no progress in his lonely life, but when he changes his behavior and becomes a positive man, he achieves love and success. The story has many absurd situations, but is very funny. I like Jim Carrey and this role is tailored for him. The cute Zooey Deschanel shows a great chemistry with him and the result is an entertaining movie with a good message in the end.

Your typical Carrey film,"""Yes Man"" seems to follow almost the exact same pattern as most of the Jim Carrey movies. We have an every-day-guy, who's life isn't what he would want it to be, then something bizarre happens that changes his life for a moment. During this moment he ends up in unusual events and he meets a girl, breaks up with her and gets together with her again in the end. Hmm...sounds familiar.Although ""Yes Man"" doesn't give us anything new or special by storyline, it is still entertaining and for me at least fun/funny as hell. Carrey doesn't fail in performance, not a chance. Not nearly as good as his best performances (Me, Myself & Irene, for example) but still amusing and, as said before, funny as hell. Carrey has already proved his other side of his acting abilities (Number 23) so I forgive him this slightly overused style of self-expressionism.I would recommend ""Yes Man"" for almost anyone who is not looking for anything ""groundbreaking"" from a Carrey flick, but who is in the need of a cheap laugh and a fun little detach from the boring reality. I give ""Yes Man"" a 7 out of 10 rating for keeping me interested in the life of Carl Allen, the man who has to say ""yes"" to everything. Nice one, Jim!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Say ""Yes"" to this film, you won't regret!","Here's an interesting case of taking two movies of the same actor, trade a few things to create a third one whose result is quite funny. In ""Liar Liar"" where Jim Carrey played an notorious liar who couldn't tell lies after his son's birthday wish. And in one moment of ""Bruce Almighty"" when he was given to right to be God for some time, his character answers ""Yes"" to the prayers of everybody who asked him something. ""Yes Man"" mixed the premise and the moment from both films but this time Carrey has an life changing experience where he'll stop of being an negative person to become an man who answers ""Yes"" to everything that comes in his life. Confusion and some hilarious moments are set in a film that must not be taken so seriously.What would happen with a man whose job at a bank consists in saying ""No"" to people and who also says this same word to his friends whenever they want his company, if he had to say Yes"" for a whole year? What kind of obstacles and/or advantages he would get? After being dragged by an old friend (John Michael Higgins) to an workshop about saying yes to thing and lead a positive life, the dull Carl will see that life might open lots of doors to him but at the same time will put him into an gigantic load of confusion, heartaches, and add things he don't need in his life (or it appears he won't need them but eventually he'll use somehow like learning Corean or learn how to play guitar. Things that only happen in film scripts.)Carrey takes advantage of his enormous variety of facial expressions to compose the troubled Carl while facing lots of misfortunes and disasters in his life, most of them very comical, others a little bit dramatic like when he rescues a man who want to jump to his death. Basically, it's the Jim Carrey we've get used to see, being very funny in ridiculous situations. And the movie comes with an obvious message of knowing how and when to give up from saying ""yes"".Of course a film like this fall into some absurds and some annoyance (like when Carl is arrested by the FBI considered to be an suspect of terrorism) but there is brilliance in this as well (when he's promoted to a higher position in the bank after approving an great number of small money loans or his moments with a girl he meets, played by Zooey Deschanel).It's a nice way to spend the day, there's plenty of good and funny moments. ""Yes Man"" has an great cast that includes Danny Masterson, Bradley Cooper, Terrence Stamp (playing the Yes guru), Brent Briscoe and Fionnula Flanagan.And in last case it might change your life, making you being more open and positive about things. The two first steps for it is by watching the film and by giving me a yes in this review. Then, you'll see how easy is to say yes to things. When you say yes, amazing things can happen. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A very underrated Jim Carrey comedy movie.,"Yes Man is a great movie with great performances from the cast. The movie has a good message, it has funny moments, it's a very fun movie, and the cast all around are amazing. I do understand why many people compare this movie to Jim Carrey's comedy movie Liar Liar, but that doesn't bother me because the movie is still very entertaining and enviable. Jim Carrey gives a great and funny performance in this movie, as he usually does, which is amazing. My only problem with the movie is the pacing can be too fast at times. The movie jumps into stuff real quick and it doesn't take time to develop characters or subplots. Besides that, Yes Man is a great movie that is also very funny and entertaining. I recommend Yes Man if you haven't seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
beautiful movie,"Yes Man follows the same basic genre comedy structure that we've seen an endless amount of times in the past few years. The main character has a big problem, they work to solve that problem, the problem is solved and happy times are had. Then another problem arises as a result to the solution to the original problem. So everyone is sad. But then that problem is solved and everyone lives happily ever after. And there's a message about how to live your life sprinkled in there. For every single comedy in the past few years with that structure, I've gotten so bored by the time it's over because I just lose interest when the drama comes in during the third act. I either don't care about the characters or I don't care about the message.Every comedy except for this one. Not only did I care about the characters so much (thanks mostly to the performances from Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel who put a beautiful, free-spirited romance at the core of this seemingly typical comedy) that I was emotionally impacted during that predictable turn for the worse near the end, but the message of the film was actually something that I found relocatable to my own life which is something I've never experience during these kind of comedies. I'm definitely a man who doesn't really live his life (as cheesy as that sounds) because I isolate myself by making excuses to just be alone and not be with anyone. As a result, I was definitely more invested in this film than I have been with other comedies of the same vein.Add to all this the fact that it's completely hilarious throughout to the point where I have no hesitation in calling it the funniest movie of the year and easily the best straight comedy (not that there have been many good ones; three by my count). Plus, of course, Zooey Deschanel is absolutely infectious in every moment she's on screen (especially her lovely singing). I love her more than air, and this is just another example of why that love is justified. Call it fanboy ism if you must, but she's my #2 of the year in supporting actress right now falling second only to the Cruz.

Jim Carrey should go back to making comedies,"If Stoller, Paul and Mogel (the 'writers') needed toilet paper, they should've gone to their local supermarket for a roll of extra soft Charmins. This 'movie' (to use the term so loosely it's blasphemous), exploits Carrey's comedic talents to make money and possibly tarnish the art of film-making. It's perfectly fine if you go to a movie for laughs, or just to see something light instead of an 'Oscar contender'. What's not fine is how so many mediocre films similar to this seem to come out of a factory instead of someone's imagination.What's bad about it? The story--what is the story? A depressed guy who says ""no"" to everything is encouraged to say yes--only he does it without thinking, making things worse. Cue physical comedy. Things go wrong. Time for moral. Cue montage. More physical comedy. Cue wrap-up scene. If I wanted to see something predictable I would have just stayed home and watched TV. I feel so bad about what I've just seen that I don't even feel like continuing this review. Please, stop supporting bad films. If you wonder at how Aaron Seltzer movies (Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, etc.) get made, it's because people continue to see them. I was coerced into buying a ticket to Yes Man, but I'm no less guilty than the ones who went willingly. Still, I feel I've been punished enough for having to sit through it.Jim Carrey is too talented for trash like this. If you think your brain cells should not disappear and the size of your anus is just fine the way it is, do not see Yes Man because it will feel like a lobotomy and rape at the same time.

"More of a ""yeah"" instead of a definitive YES, but, thanks to Carrey and the other fine cast members, it is still enjoyable","Bank loan officer, Carl (Jim Carrey) is in a self-imposed state of hibernation. Stinging from an acrimonious divorce, Carl goes to work each day but returns home immediately afterward and stays put, watching the boob tube. Even his friend, Peter (Bradley Cooper) can't get him to go out on the town and he is mightily ticked when Carl misses a pre-nuptial party for Peter's coming wedding. Yet, a chance encounter with an old friend leads Carl to an inspirational seminar run by Terrence (Terrence Stamp). With the word ""yes"" as his mantra, Terrence urges his adult attendees to affirm life by dumping negativity, taking some chances, and refusing to say ""no"" in social and work situations. Almost immediately, Carl's life changes. He takes a homeless man back to a city park, where he runs out of gas. But, amazingly, pretty Allison (Zooey Deschanel) is there to rescue him, offering him a seat on her motorbike and a ride to the nearest gas station. Carl likes what he sees and makes plan to get together with Allison again. At work, things change, also, to the delight of his British boss, Norman (Rhys Darby). Carl begins to give out more small loans and the company makes money, as folks gratefully make their payments, with interest, on time. But, in truth, is this a genuinely new Carl or just a temporary impostor, that is, is Carl's optimism real and enduring? This is an enjoyable film, thanks to the splendid cast. Naturally, Carrey deserves a great deal of the credit, for his facial expressions and physical antics are humorous and unique. Just watch him play a corpse, in a dream sequence, or tape up his face at work and you will be howling with laughter. He definitely carries this flick much farther than anyone else would have done. But, the supporting cast is quite fine, too, with Deschanel a treat as the spunky Allison, Cooper a nice second fiddle and Stamp a hoot as the inspirational guru. Then, too, the scenery in so-Cal is lovely, the costumes are inspired, and the production values topnotch. Therefore, the real weaknesses of the flick are its spotty script and direction, for the film has moments of high humor followed by blase bits of nothing. Yet, it still manages to come together at the finale, with gusto. If you are a fan of Carrey's, you will absolutely not want to miss him in action, he is one of American cinema's priceless treasures.

With Carrey in the lead this screenplay should write itself,"Java Man Reviews ""Yes Man"" (PG-13) Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com December, 2008.OVERVIEW:Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a divorced 40-something who lives in LA and works as a loan officer for a neighborhood bank. Depressed at being dumped, he says ""no"" to everything: ""no"" to unlucky loan applicants; ""no"" to his best pal (Bradley Cooper) who wants to hit the bars; and ""no"" to his sex-starved neighbor (Fionnula Flanagan) who wants him to get intimate. While sitting home alone watching a video one night, he nods off and dreams of his demise. When he awakens, he realizes that he has a problem and reluctantly agrees to attend a ""Power of Yes"" seminar conducted by self-help guru Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). After initial resistance, Carl is finally won over and accepts the Covenant of Yes. This means that when he says ""no"" (say, to his naughty neighbor), bad things happen--like being trapped in an elevator. When he says ""yes"" (giving all his money to a homeless guy), good things happen--like meeting gorgeous, free-spirited Allison (Zooey Deschanel). The comic possibilities are endless.REVIEW: 2.5 out of 4 Java MugsWith Carrey in the lead role, a story like this should write itself. Or at least one would think so. The movie is funny enough, but somehow it seems like it should have been funnier. Perhaps the premise has too many comic possibilities for its own good. It ends up being a mishmash of random episodes, some of which are inspired while others should have been consigned to the cutting room floor.It can't be blamed on the cast. Appealing newcomers Cooper and Deschanel light up the screen, while veterans Stamp and Flanagan make the most of their unimaginatively written roles. The talented Carrey is more than adequate, but he is unable to convincingly sell the outlandish premise as well as he did in a similar, better movie, Liar Liar.The film has great production values and is quite watchable. The action scenes and stunt work are top notch, while the location work is inspired. Underutilized LA backdrops such as the Hollywood Bowl and Griffith Park Observatory are used so well that this film's portrayal of the city rivals Woody Allen's love affair with the Big Apple.This movie offers a point to go with your popcorn: that saying yes once in a while can open you up to life's infinite possibilities.

Carrey's back.,"In this feel-good film, Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) challenges himself to say Yes to almost anything and everything. Concept aside, this is a remarkable comedic comeback for Carrey, after the magnificent Michel Gondry art piece ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", the mediocre but dark thriller ""The Number 23"", and the animated ""Horton Hears a Who!"" There are a lot of jokes in the film, and some of them are put to well use. But Carrey blazes above all else with his humor. He's still the zany goofy guy we all like, but not as hypercaffienated as ""Ace Ventura"" or that ''truthful'' lawyer in ""Liar Liar"". Carrey has matured. But he's still very funny. This film may very well be Carrey's funniest film since the first ""Ace Ventura"", and that's saying something.The story is somewhat formulaic and predictable. But it's all good as the jokes and mostly Carrey save the film. Sure, it has a preachy message hidden somewhere in there, but all in all it's a pretty good message: Say yes to (almost) everything and you'll have a better life. I couldn't agree more after seeing this film.Supporting actors are good here, but the standout is Zooey Deschanel. It's her innocence and natural charm that makes her appeal to the audience, and it is refreshing.Overall, it's a very good comedy that will definitely make you smile, feel better, and inspired when you walk out of the cinema.

It is a simplistic plot but when you compare putting away your brain on this to enjoy a good laugh versus the Cruise Fiction & Non-Fiction Valkerie, this film looks like a work of art.The film has a good supporting cast and from what I have looked at of other reviews, a lot of folks didn't see the end of the movie. The film has a strong classic ending which makes you laugh or smile when the credits role. I will not spoil the ending, but if you do not see it, you might feel ripped off.There is a hidden deeper sense of fate in the film. Once he changes from no to yes, every time he says no, fate seems to punish him. While the humor is a little off the wall, the encounter with the shelves and the elderly lady neighbor has a great comedic touch that has nothing to do with Carey.

Yesterday, after finding out that ""The Spirit"" was not playing, I decided to see this movie. And I have to say that my original outline in my head isn't that far off from the actual film. There's no need to bore you with the details of what the film is about, so instead I'll cut right to my opinion: This movie had a lot of potential. It's one of the most unique ideas that I've heard about in years (and yes, I have seen Liar, Liar.) And there are some great scenes in this film. For example, there's a bar fight scene where Jim Carrey completely looses himself in his character. However, for a large amount of the scenes, one of two things happens. Either the scenes don't go far enough or the scenes don't connect at all to the movie. Yes, this is confusing, so let me explain. In some scenes, I felt as if the actors did not go far enough. They simply rushed through an idea, but did not extend enough to give the scene it's full potential. There were also moments when things didn't really connect, and it felt like the filmmakers randomly selected scenarios and copy and pasted them into the movie. My only problem with this is that it's not realistic. Yes, this is a comedy, but I personally believe that movies should still be realistic. My final concern with this film is the lack of a problem. This is the kind of movie where you walk in to the theater knowing that some sort of conflict will occur 3/4 of the way into the film. And, of course, it does. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will simply say that when the conflict does occur, it feels so small that you barely recognize it for what it is. But I've focused too much on the negative part of the film. I must say that all of the actors gave very good performances and got into their character. And, as stated previously, there were moments of comic genius. The plot line is so simple that it's almost daunting to know where to begin, and I applaud the filmmakers. And, out of everything, the message is clear: Live your life to the fullest.---RisingStar12",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
same old same old,"I'm bored out of my skull with these same old half-assed movies being made where you know the story ending within 5 minutes of the opening credits. it almost feels as though someone with a lot of money at warner brothers or whatever says ""we got to make a movie where Jim Carey says YES to EVERYTHING, cause' thats bound to get people in curious to see what happens, cause Jim Carey has a reputation or whatever!"" and sure enough people will go and see it, the movie company makes their money and I'm left feeling ripped off. i think people now know when a movie has been made with heart and passion rather than being made because it has to be made. i guess at the back of my mind i knew it would be like it was but Jim Carey has always been credible in my mind because of his infamous back loge of legendary movies(from the ace Ventura-eternal sunshine) but the latest few movies he has done left me feeling tricked into watching them because of Jim Carey. there was no real character building, i didn't connect or relate to any of the characters (in fact i cant even remember them) forgettable performances, overall borderline boring!!!",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A nice return of jim carrey.,"im a fan of jim carrey so when i saw he was bringing out a new comedy i was extremely exited. although i loved his serious roles - eternal sunshine, number 23 - i think jim carrey should stick to what he knows. and thats making people laugh.the films storyline is simple and with a perfect cast of bradley cooper and zooey deschenel it makes it all worth while.jim carrey is not too over the top like in liar liar but is still funny at at some parts can be hilarious.i think this is a great rom com and is one well worth a watch compared to other rom coms that are coming out these days.if you love jim carrey, there is no doubt you'll love this, even if your not a fan of his, i feel you will still be pleasantly surprised.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Yes Man is Jim Carrey's best film to date and he is back!!,"I saw a free screening of this hilarious movie in my hometown and it was MAGNIFICENT!!! It starts off fast and never slows down (never a dull moment in the movie) and for fans of Jim Carrey (like me) who wants him to be himself, prepare to laugh so extremely hard that will have your sides in excruciating pain from all the laughter you made!! Jim Carrey was at his very best & he made me laugh non-stop till' the end of the movie but it was not a one-man show, the supporting cast threw in some fantastic delivery lines, humor & craziness. Zooey Deschanel was surprisingly very funny (didn't know she could be THIS funny), Bradley Cooper was funny, Terence Stamp did great as well but out of all of the supporting cast, there are two of them that had some of the funniest scenes in movie history: Rhys Darby plays the memorable and hilarious boss of Carl Allen (Carrey), he had some classic and unbelievable delivery lines in the movie that were just funny. And the other person: Fionnula Flanaghan who plays the nasty, sexually & very funny neighbor of Carl Allen and delivers us one of the most disgusting & very funny scenes in years (not giving you spoilers)!! Yes Man is not only a very, very funny but it sends a good message about how do you want to handle your life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A feel good movie that doesn't feel stupid,"Meet Carl. He's the most negative person you've ever met. Only you'll never meet him because he hides from society being terminally annoyed by everyone. Unexpectedly, something happens which makes him say yes to everything.Right in league with other fun & silly what-if plots like ""The Invention of Lying"" (a world where nobody ever lies) or ""Stranger Than Fiction"" (a guy who hears a narrator telling him his own life story), ""Yes Man"" is good clean entertainment that, who knows, might even change your life. Or at least get you out of the house once in a while.""Yes Man"" differs from the other 2 films I mentioned (great flicks by the way) in one important respect: it's not a bizarre alternate reality, nor is there anything really supernatural going on. So it's more down-to-earth and less wacky than you might expect. But that gives the actors more room to give it a personal touch. In other words, what makes this movie work isn't just a crazy story but good solid character development.Jim Carey, who plays ""Carl"", is somewhat toned down compared to his manic ""Mask"" theatrics, but subtlety works to his advantage. (Note: if you want to see Carey in all his insane glory, check out the bonus features where he really lets loose). As he meets quirky characters, it's Carey who plays the straight man, and his deadpan expressions are hilarious. The way he tolerates his overexuberant boss ""Norman"" (Rhys Darby) is classic. Norman himself is something similar to Austin Powers in a business suit. Zooey Deschanel is, well, she's Zooey Deschanel - awesome and cute as hell, playing the role of a photography/jogging instructor by day and by night she sings in an alt band that has a total of 7 fans.What's really fun about this movie is seeing how all the quirky characters converge in a well written story that all comes together with every character contributing. There aren't necessarily any bank capers or high speed chases (wait, actually there are sorta)--what I mean is, there aren't a lot of contrived plot twists and seat-gripping thrills; the film relies on its entertaining script and the aforementioned acting expertise. But it delivers a great story with never a dull moment. Should you watch ""Yes Man""? My answer is.......... sure dude.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

If you look at it as a comedy, you see it isn't exactly Carrey's best, but it's decent enough to rent. If you look at it as a romance, then you see it isn't very fulfilling, what with too much comedy and stupidity. Now I don't see it as one of these things.. I see it as a love story that happens to make you laugh. Two people practically MADE for each other that fall in love, a ridiculous premise involving a cult and a wise old man that sees the whole picture as the leader of that cult, and a lonesome and horny ex-wife. These three are the ultimate romantic comedy- no, no. Scratch that. This isn't a romantic comedy, this is a genuine love story with a pinch of humor. These three items make the ultimate love story, making you j*** in your pants because of the sheer awesomeness.

"Say ""Yes"" to ""Yes Man!""","I am the biggest Jim Carrey fan I know, whenever a Jim Carrey movie comes out in theaters, I have to see it no matter how bad the premise sounds. I was there for his worse (Fun with Dick and Jane) and I was there for his best (Horton Hears a Who, The Number 23 and Bruce Almighty). As far as this new Jim Carrey venture goes, this is one of his best.Besides Jim Carrey, the movie has a good deal to offer. We have Zooey Deschannel, beautiful and talented, singing new age music in the fictitious band ""Munchausen by Proxy."" Zooey was perfect for this movie because the crew could've had someone lame like Maggie Gyllenhaal or Cameron Diaz play in this. Zooey is really one of those new actresses who is daring and free spirited in her roles, thank God she starred in ELF and got noticed.Okay, now on to the story. A lot of people say that this is too like ""Liar Liar."" Now I have to disagree and agree, it's a little similar with ""Liar Liar"" but not too much similar. The story, I find, is more realistic than Liar, as it gives a story we can relate to. I'm sure a lot of us are still brooding over that boyfriend/girlfriend we broke up with, and we just become zombie's after that, avoiding anything fun or exciting. The movie offers a good point, if you don't feel like going back to your old life, try a new and exciting life. The plot is kinda simple, but that's what comedy is about, being simple and taking a break from the serious plots like ""The Departed"" or ""The Dark Knight.""

Jim Carrey in a family-friendly romantic drama-comedy,"The plot idea is pretty hilarious in this movie. The guy has to say yes to everything he is suggested. That reminds me of ""Liar Liar"" where Carrey's character was under a charm that he must always tell the truth. (But I'm afraid it's a little bit more restrained this time; there's no Jim dumping a trash can on his head.)The story starts a bit slow but is pretty entertaining all the way. But it wasn't the explosion of laughs I expected. Its tone is similar to some others 2000s' movies Carrey has starred. Not as crazy as his early films, but more in the realm of drama-comedy.It's not boring but not quite as good as I expected either. The story falls pretty much into a typical romantic drama-comedy mold and doesn't go as wild as you might expect. There's something too sugary and commercial about it. Biggest Jim Carrey fans should check it out. Others, well, if you want a harmless feel-good flick to watch with anybody. But don't expect a huge comedy classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

No one stood out. Jim Carrey looks like he was desperate to film anything, as if his carrier was Pauly Shorish, which I can now imagine it can be if he keeps on doing this.I can't say much about the movie, it's just bad all over, do yourselves a favor and skip it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not bad, but needed more work","This movie is quite good - I love the idea of someone slavishly saying Yes to everything in life. Jim Carey at his best is very appealing and charming. He does try to tone down the slapstick. However his similar film Liar Liar (in which he couldn't lie) had much more of a strong plot. This one is more of a series of sketches in which Carrey tries out different hobbies and lets his heart lead him to wacky situations. Why are these films always about men? But the love interest, Zooey Deschanel, at least is refreshingly cool and intelligent - not just a bimbo. The other actors such as Terence Stamp, Bradley Cooper and Rhys Darby, are great. I like the film's messages like, be positive, make the most of life, don't be too cynical and keep an open mind. The scene where the FBI arrest Carrey is interesting - they're suspicious of someone being spontaneous and edgy. The locations around Los Angeles are fantastically suburban and grungy.The movie didn't quite move me in the way that, say, Groundhog Day did.

"Surprisingly, it works","Like most of Jim Carrey's films, ""Yes Man"" is random, over-the-top, and silly. However, like many of his other films, this one works. It's a simple story about how a guy who always says no to everyone and chooses to spend all of his time alone is convinced to go to a club that will encourage him to say ""yes"" to everything and truly live his life. As a result, he is challenged to say ""yes"" to every opportunity that comes his way, which ends up advancing his job, friendships, love life, etc. No matter how much or little you know about the film, you'll probably be able to predict just about everything that will happen. Nevertheless, it proved to be a tender and uplifting story anyway. Despite the random and corny jokes throughout, I found myself laughing. This film easily stands up to Carrey's similar films (""Bruce Almighty,"" ""Fun With Dick and Jane""), and is in some ways even better than those. I enjoyed the romantic parts of the film as well, with Zooey Deschanel providing a great female companion for the story. Of course this is not perfect, but a Jim Carrey film like this is one we do not (and cannot) expect to be perfect. Not great, but enjoyable, and you won't feel like you wasted your time. By the way, I could relate to Carrey in the film, understanding how he often preferred to spend his time alone.

Not a patch on the book but not bad,"I'm not the most prolific reader of books. in fact I'm lucky if i get through half a dozen books a year . One of the novels i have read recently is the fantastic Autobiographical "" Yes Man "" written by the extremely talented Londoner Danny Wallace . It's a funny , moving and ingenious book that i found hard to put down . So when i heard it was being made into a film i was thrilled. That was until i found out that it was going to be a Rom Com starring Jim Carey.Carl Allen is a guy whose life is going nowhere—the operative word being ""no""—until he signs up for a self-help program based on one simple covenant: say yes to everything...and anything. Unleashing the power of ""YES"" begins to transform Carl's life in amazing and unexpected ways, getting him promoted at work and opening the door to a new romance. But his willingness to embrace every opportunity might just become too much of a good thing.Ten minutes into Yes Man i soon realised that this is very loosely based on the book. In fact it's nothing like it. Sure there are a few moments that happen in the book that are repeated in the film but not many. I'm not a fan of Jim Carey as regular readers of my blog will know. I don't think he's very funny and when he tries straight acting he's even worse. So what I'm about to say may surprise you. I actually quite liked Yes Man!Sure it's not true to the book but once i got my head around that i started to quite enjoy it. Carey is not as annoying as normal and his supporting cast are very good. Zooey Deschanel is delightful as the love interest and ""Flight of Concords "" star Rhys Darby is hilarious. In fact he nearly steals the show from old rubber face himself. It's true that it's a romantic comedy and that's not every one's cup of tea (especially mine) but there are enough distractions to make you forget that. It does lose it's way in the last twenty minutes when it starts to get a bit preachy ( which couldn't be further from the book) but you can forgive it for that.Yes Man isn't the sort of film you need to think about too much. It's a movie that you can just sit back and enjoy....but not too much. There are a couple of really funny scenes. One involves Carl and a role of sticky tape and the other a pensioner who has a special talent when she takes her teeth out. You use your imagination with that one! Having said that there is also an awful scene that made no sense at all involving a man trying to commit suicide and a spontaneous burst of song.

"Yeah, why not?","When was the last time Jim Carrey was really funny? Yep, that would be back in 2004, when he delivered a double mixture of creepy (Lemony Snicket) and touching (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, his best role to date), both paired with his natural comedic talent, which was significantly watered down in the disappointing Fun With Dick & Jane and consistently missing in the excessively weird The Number 23. Yes Man is the perfect antidote, then: a typical Carrey comedy, where the gags abound and the soul department is a little empty. Not that we're gonna complain that much - it's just that the source material indicated the film could have been a little more... you know.The material in question is Danny Wallace's eponymous autobiographical book, in which he recounts what happened to him after he attended a ""Yes Men"" seminar and vowed to say ""yes"" for six months. In the movie, the action is moved from England to Los Angeles, and Wallace is replaced by Carl Allen (Carrey), a bank employee who hasn't had a real life since his marriage ended. Instead of hanging out with his friends (Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson, both criminally underused) or helping his neighbors, he spends his days working or renting movies he subsequently disses during the viewing. Everything changes when an old friend invites him to a ""Yes"" convention where the British host (Terence Stamp, who else?) advises him to greet every offer that crosses his path with the same answer. Any need to guess which that is?From then on, it's just like Liar, Liar or Bruce Almighty: a torrent of gags which stem from the absurd (yet undeniably plausible) premise. The jokes range from predictable (Carl replying to spam messages) to somewhat original (Carl learning Korean) to quite outlandish (Carl preventing a man from committing suicide in a most unusual way; Wallace has pointed out this never happened to him, by the way). Throw in a sweet, enthralling romance with free spirit Allison (the always charming Zooey Deschanel), and you've got a comedy that ticks practically every box. The most important, of course, is the one concerning Carrey, who mixes full-on comedy and heartfelt seriousness with the ease one could expect after his marvelous turns in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine. Too bad he's also stuck with a director who can't give the serious bits the dignity they crave (but hey, what can you demand from the guy who did Bring It On?). And that's without mentioning the obvious contrivance that is used to get to the third act.Still, Yes Man has enough ingredients to make for a nice, though not entirely satisfying viewing: there's a relatively good central idea, Deschanel and Stamp in supporting roles and Carrey going ballistic.

Jim Carrey's roots,"There are always two things going through my head when I watch movies like ""The Truman Show"" or ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"". The first thing is that Jim Carrey is truly a tremendous actor that could do well in a wide variety of genres. The second thing is: ""I'm sad, I'm going to watch an Ace Ventura movie"". What I'm trying to say is that he's really versatile, and ""Yes Man"" definitely caters to the classic Carrey fans. He's everything you expect him to be in this one: he's unbelievably energetic, he's loud, he's wild, and he cracks you up every five seconds or so. In one scene they just make him drink Red Bull and the rest sorta writes itself, it's all as vintage Carrey as can be. Rich man's Katy Perry Zooey Deschanel is also really good in this movie, because at least she manages to rise above being the lame, bland love interest you usually have to put up with in this sort of movie.

An important lesson for life amid in such a comedy movie was a great idea I guess. Everyone should definitely try at least for one day saying yes to everything. I am not sure about others, but I am very much inspired from this movie saying yes.

The humor, thanks to Jim Carrey, turned out to be exceptional - funny gimmicks and quips, ridiculous gestures and sounds are excellent!Before watching, I kept wondering what ""YES"" actually meant in the context of the story.

A Nutshell Review: Yes Man,"It's been a while since Jim Carrey hit the screens, going back to his comedic roots after the rather lacklustre dramatic turn in the thriller The Number 23. But it's a somewhat muted Carrey we get, as gone out the window are the over the top antics and rubbery face, and in comes a fine balance between getting the laughs, as well as having some dramatic flair in crafting a believable working class character who is jaded with work and life in general, opting instead to coast through life almost like a recluse.And when a friend told me that this character was somewhat familiar, I understand his point. I suppose most of us could probably identify with the very routine lives that we're leading, juggling work and whatever effort we can muster to have a semblance of balance, either with family, friends, or spending some quality time investing in oneself. But this means regressing into the tried, tested and safe, losing that spark that comes with the randomness of living, and the gaining of experience that would have been gained. In fact, it brought back some memories that I was once a Yes Man myself, and I won't deny that somewhere along the way I've taken a detour, though it was a conscious decision at that.Jim Carrey plays Carl Allen, a junior loans officer at a bank who spends his time at work, and his personal life, in saying no to everyone and to opportunities, ignoring calls and well meaning efforts from friends to bring him out of his shell. But a life changing seminar (I've been to something similar, even though it was just a preview) with pop music, enthusiastic energizer-bunny type attendees, and an enigmatic speaker, would convince him to take the plunge into make a covenant to say yes to every opportunity that comes by. Not that he has any choice since the self-help guru is played by Terence Stamp, and nobody has the audacity to say no to General Zod. (Curiously, Terence Stamp has been in plenty of supporting roles of late).So begins a series of situational comedies, most of which would already have been captured in the trailer. Carl begins to live life as he wanted to, taking lessons, meeting people, and what I found to be most appealing, would be to convert from a person of negative thoughts, to a positive thinking fellow. His new attitude opens doors, and almost instantly he reaps the benefits of this new found approach, the best of course is the encounter with hot chick Allison (Zooey Deschanel).Besides the philosophy behind the movie, Yes Man is also a romance, with two random people who are totally opposites, coming together because of their spontaneity, and how strongly and positively different a relationship which isn't routine would provide for a couple. I suppose to a certain degree I tasted some form of success at this going where the wind brings approach, though that of course was a long time back. Naturally they fall heads over heels with each other, but like all romances, there's no such thing as smooth sailing, even though this takes place in the last act and rides to the finale fairly quickly.I more than welcome Zooey Deschanel as the leading lady in Yes Man (I would say yes too *ahem*), because in my opinion she hasn't made a lot of films, and still has that refreshing appeal. If truth be told her Allison would be someone whom I'd sit up and take notice, because of her zest for life, and hey, here's someone multi-talented (ok, that might be debatable), coupled with some of her really unorthodox activities that look like fun, and miles from what I am doing anyway. I thought Jim Carrey had a field day acting opposite her, and that chemistry probably rubbed off and made them look like a cute couple who are up to totally crazy antics when they're out on their dates.Based on the book by Danny Wallace, the turning point in the film, which tied up all the random elements pretty neatly for that push toward the final act, was well done and I couldn't help but to guffaw, that if I was in those shoes, I might be connecting the dots in the same manner and asking pointed questions as well. Along with a whole host of supporting cast ranging from Bradley Cooper as Carl's best friend Peter, Molly Sims as his ex-wife Stephanie and Rhys Darby in a hilarious role as his manager (and major geek) Norman, the soundtrack too serves as another highlight in the film, with songs mostly by Eels, and Zooey Deschanel herself lending her vocal chords to a number of songs here, where the lyrics are totally insane (she has part writing credit for those) which left me laughing out loud for the most parts.So while I see the cinematic ways as to how saying Yes could change one's life but only with the intervention of fated coincidences, I guess there's no harm trying and giving the same philosophy a shot, right? So go ahead and say Yes together with me, but of course with some intelligence and common sense, and I'd expect all of us could hope to be in for some surprising change to our personal lives. And please say Yes too to sitting through the end credits - that little skate man idea looks totally awesome!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The power of positive thinking,"Carl Allen (Carrey) a negative no man is challenged to say yes to everything that comes his way, which he accepts in the hope of becoming a better person The concept of saying yes to everything that comes your way is an interesting prospect given that there are so many situations which would normally require a no. Myself, a fairly negative person, was quite thrilled when I first watched this a year ago, being completely transfixed by the apparent ease like Carrey's character. Sadly for me it never materialized because I ruined the film through criticizing the standard formatting of the final stages. Now however I can see past that.Jim Carrey starring in another big idea comedy sets us in motion as we follow him in his life by saying no to everything and anything. When a friend shows him what he is missing out of life he turns up at a positive say yes lecture and the film is set in motion.His first act of positive thinking is to give a homeless man a trip far out of his way, lending him his phone and money. This spells comedy light heartedness and some charming Carrey wisdom which because of his helpfulness leads to something good.Carrey the arguable king of physical comedy is slightly held back here. There isn't as much wide mouthed madness as in The Mask or brilliant cleverness from Ace Ventura. This comedy portrayal feels like his Liar Liar character which allows him some more normal man approach, which is what the character needed given the context of the film. Carrey, performing most of his own stunts including the bungee jump sequence still flies high with some physical comedy, particularly the motorbike sequences.Zooey Deschanel fills the necessary love interest role with some clever contentedness. The best supporting star is Rhys Darby who brings the stereotype of nerd to a new level with some very amusing and elaborate comedy. The Harry Potter party is pure genius.This film boasts one healthy soundtrack with Zooey and her band on particular fine tune with positive springy songs.Characters and performances aside, this is all about the apparent simplicity of saying yes. Carl initially rejects everything then after the lecture starts his yes streak before learning how to control it.There are only a few problems with this film's projection and pitching of using this ideology in your real life.For one Carl is at a very good job and is earning plentiful. Therefore when opportunities arise he is able to take them without worrying about the consequences, which wouldn't necessarily be the case for all viewers. The second is that whilst the film is undeniably feel good and energetic, the descent into conventional story has been tackled too frequently in comedies.However this film has an advantage over other comedies as it is beneficial for the human personality. Saying yes is certainly more encouraging, so say yes and see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Comedy as it should be,"As a few others out there I was also fortunate enough to be able to see this before its actual theater release date and I will admit I am very glad I took this opportunity.As Jim Carrey is well know for his comedy he graciously continues in the film to continually bless us with his acting abilities. Many funny laughing moments they almost have you falling out of your seat. A great little love story behind it makes this comedy not just great for the guys who like laughing but also the woman who like the chick flicks.I personally would recommend this to many. Just don't take your kids along. Even though it may say PG-13 I don't think I would really want my kids to see a little segment in this film. No nudity of course, but just a little to much for the kids. But the scene will have you laughing and talking about it all night.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Awesome movie is awesome,"You don't need a 4 pages review on this one, you just need simply worlds like: This was a brilliant and awesome movie, that's it.

It's just that I think that if you analyze a movie too much - you don't like it as much as you did in the beginning. And yes I am perfectly aware of that this is a review of a movie where your expected to point out your thoughts about details but, I think it's important to understand that's a movie is what you make it. You can say that this movie was so bad. okay, because it's so predictable and it's bad to not use unknown celebrities and oh, that scene with the old lady was so nasty and should not be in it and so on, but DON'T! Because the concept is absolutely brilliant and you should be thankful to this movie instead of hating. Now go on and be inspired, love Jim Carrey and live your life to the fullest!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Heart-warming and more than good for a light hearted chuckle every now and then.,"There are those out there specifically speaking, there are critics out there- who often take it upon themselves to point out that Jim Carrey is an actor who plays the same hand, badly, movie after movie. I, believe it or not, am not one of these people. Growing up as a child, nobody made me laugh half as much as Ace Ventura, and I don't even want to estimate how many times I seen most of Mr. Carrey's movies of the nineties. As far as I was concerned, there was nobody funnier on the big screen.Many years on, I still find at least some joy in watching the man play out familiar routines, but find much greater fun in seeing him stretch out and trying new things. Yes Man is an example of Carrey in mature comedy mode- to some degree. For sure, this isn't The Mask or Dumb and Dumber, and it sure as hell doesn't pull out the laughs as much as those movies, but there's a lot more to be said for the film's value as a substantial, character-driven piece of romantic comedy. I make no pretences, this isn't a masterpiece of any sort; there are numerous flaws to Yes Man's tale, but that doesn't mean that it is without any value. Heart-warming and more than good for a light hearted chuckle every now and then, this is Carrey doing adult, and it's an uplifting, albeit slightly underplayed couple of hours.Taking a rather unconventional approach to storytelling, Yes Man is a feature that, like most feel-good-life-revelation movies, the main focus here is about the main character and how he changes his life for the better. In this happy-go-lucky sphere, there isn't much room for the key ingredient that playwrights will swear by- I'll give you a clue, it begins with c and ends in onflict. As a result, Yes Man can be slow moving I mean, extremely slow moving. Surviving mainly on gags and character-development for the better half of the feature, the writers don't seem too worried that there really isn't much for the viewer to be paying attention for, and yet this is slightly liberating despite its sometimes irksome pacing consequences.In case you didn't know already, Yes Man is a story like this year's The Bucket List, in that our central character realises he must change his life rapidly in order to enjoy it to the fullest. For Carl Allen (Carrey), a meek, always-say-no insurance shark, this comes in form of an organisation or, a more appropriate, but keenly avoided term, cult- that embraces the word ""yes"" as their simple but effective mantra. Extremely sceptical at first, it doesn't take long for Carl to realise the benefits of such a philosophy after his first night living by it ends in him sharing a kiss with the lovely freebird Allison (Zooey Deschanel); from here it's just a matter of agreeing to everything that comes his way- which, admittedly can result in some awkward, but hysterically amusing segments.From here on in, the movie moves from gimmicky comedy to focus more on character and romance. This shift in gear helps break Yes Man away from its early amusing, but largely soulless scenes and develop those who inhabit the screen into characters we care for. Carrey, who adopts a tone here that is similar to his work in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (arguably, his finest film to date), manages to establish a mostly plausible mix of genuine warmth and his usual shtick and slapstick; those who appreciate both sides of the actor will get a lot out of it, though one suspects many will only be distracted by the more zany sides of Carl. On the opposite side of the story, Zooey Deschanel plays a role not that dissimilar from her earlier effort from this year in The Happening, but is certainly given a lot more to breathe here. As a love interest, Deschanel is as alluring as she need be, and counterbalances her softer core with a welcome independent edge.Of course, Yes Man isn't all yes, yes, yes; there are problems here, and one cannot help but be somewhat critical towards the unsustainable premise of the feature. Yet despite the pacing issues, and a lack of drama or conflict that feels natural or warranted, there nevertheless remains an enjoyable, heart-warming core to Yes Man's story that is very hard to refute. There will be moments when you may look at your watch, perhaps roll your eyes at the movie's more over-the-top scenes which clash with the adult-orientated segments, but by the time the credits roll, there's little doubt that you'll be feeling uplifted. As far as comedy or romance goes, Yes Man is by no means perfect either; in fact both elements are lukewarm for a large part of the feature, but as a character-drama, the feature remains compelling to watch unfold. For that reason I simply recommend this to those who seek something a little familiar but at the same time, more contemplated and reserved. There are brash moments in Yes Man, yet these are moments of mere background noise contrasted against sweet melody that is played in the foreground.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Just learn to say ""yes"" and this film gets that much better","The talk that ""Yes Man,"" is Jim Carrey's return to leading role comedy through the reincarnate of ""Liar Liar"" is not off-base by any means, but other than Carrey himself, this movie is completely different. This is Carrey in a much more contemporary comedy, not a product of formula that made him a star in the 90s. ""Yes Man"" is still extremely formulaic when viewed alongside recent comedies, but if you can just say ""yes,"" and not dismiss it too early on, you'll be surprised by how fresh and entertaining this film can be.Carrey stars as Carl Allen, a man whose boring job and divorce have him in a rut so bad that he would rather make excuses and be left alone than do anything. But when he begins to lose the faith of his best friend (Bradley Cooper of ""Wedding Crashers""), Carl reluctantly attends a seminar about the power of the word ""yes."" At the seminar, Carl enters a 'covenant' in which he agrees to say ""yes"" to any opportunity, no matter how strange, that comes his way. By doing this, Carl meets a lot of frustration, but he also meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel)and his life begins changing for the more humorous.It's the right role for Carrey, but it's also a touch odd to see the master of last decade plugged into a film where the writing, the cast and nearly everything around him is hip and current. Director Peyton Reed (""The Break-Up"") and writer Nicholas Stoller (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""), for example, both are well-versed in the recent frat-pack/ Apatow clan comedy mania that has defined the last five or so years. There is some great situational writing from Stoller where every joke or thing that Carl agrees to do is able to come back to make the film funnier later on, but Carrey does fit strangely into it all. After all, he is 46 year old and his love interest, Deschanel, is 28. Carl Allen is clearly written for someone younger, yet without Carrey there is no star power to sell this film. Carrey has that power and beyond, and though it's a bit weird to see a middle-aged man going out with the guys and getting completely drunk, it was still the right choice by the producers because his comedic strengths fit the role in terms of characterization.Sure, ""Yes Man"" is one of those comedies where a guy starts out pretty despicable but wins the audiences favor and gets a girlfriend who finds out he was a jerk and doesn't forgive him though we know he has changed so he has to do something valiant to get her back. However, that's nothing new in Hollywood and ""Yes Man"" deserves to be judged on the meat of the comedy and not its bones. In that respect, it's mostly a very funny situational film though some of the dialog intended to be witty/clever falls flat.The only other things that keep ""Yes Man"" from becoming one of the year's best comedies is the excessive use of product placement and Warner Bros. decision to brag about all the popular movies it owns the rights to (""Harry Potter"" and ""300"") by showing them in various ways throughout the film from actual footage to costumes to DVD cases. But that's all nit-picky because as much as ""Yes Man"" might sell out, it's really got some great stuff buried inside.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Say Yes to life,"At its barest bones this is a movie about saying 'Yes' to life and all the joys it has to bring. An unhappy man played by Jim Carey gets roped into one of those personal seminars where he is asked to start saying ""yes"" to everything instead of 'No"" which he has been doing as of late to the extent that even his best friend is about to cut him off. By saying Yes his life suddenly starts to genuinely improve and he even meets a girl but then just as suddenly his life spins out of control. Like everything else even saying Yes to life needs to be done in moderation. The movie is fun, funny, and heartwarming at times but it is also a little silly so I am giving it a 7. I would still recommend saying Yes to watching this at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Lost in the DVD Store,"The main character here is described to us as someone with no life. As the movie proceeds, our man has a modern redemption: he is enriched. It is important to get this initial notion of emptiness conveyed to us in as economical way as possible because generally it gets in the way of the following endearment-comedy cycle that these things depend on.So our guy is shown avoiding real life and aimlessly drifting through a video rental store, picking through time-wasting DVDs. This film would easily be one of them.Once again, ordinary life is contrasted with a magical world presented in the way that a movie is. People come and sit in an auditorium for an hour or two and their lives are transformed. The people in the ordinary world are hypnotized. I call this simple device ""folding."" It takes that audience and conflates it with us, and we subconsciously adopt some of the characteristics of the on-screen audience. It is a cheap shot, a simple trick. But it works, and this is why we see it so much.Otherwise the thing has a standard form: girl won, girl lost, girl regained in a public display. Since we already have blown the audience effect for another purpose, here we have the audacious plot element that our appealing girl teaches jogging photography in one of the most cinematic urban parks in the country! It is just because of that last scene where a crowd as surrogate photographic voyeurs, can applaud the ultimate kiss.Zoe is appealing.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The toned down Carrey.,"Yes Man's story is fitting for Jim Carrey. It gives him plenty of material to show off his sporadic, eccentric ego. It's astonishing then, to see only flashes of Ace Ventura or Charlie/Hanks from Me, Myself & Irene. Yes Man sits comfortably between them and the likes of Eternal Sunshine and The Truman Show. Carl (Carrey) is a likable man whose lack of ambition is having a detrimental effect on himself and those closest to him. He reluctantly agrees to say yes to everything for a whole year, no matter what it is. From online dating and learning Korean to bungee-jumping and organising his best friend's fiancée's bridal shower, there's nothing he cannot, sorry, will not do. The story is one of redemption, of finding ones-self. Taking part in something that you'd later regret not doing. It's all well and good until Carrey and new love interest Zooey Deschanel get serious. A less formulaic route hits a cliché roadblock. And that's the route it takes thereon. The ending doesn't have the strength that the rest of the film carries. Carl's work partner, Rhys Darby (Flight of the Concords) is a scene stealer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Throughout the film, its basic theme runs about a person committing his each answer with a yes; but not only this its also about how friends stand for you through your tough time and how being optimistic in life can be beneficial for you! It's Jim's acting which takes the movie double the way up to what it actually is,any other actor and the movie would have been flop! Bradley Cooper fans would love him in his supporting role.

Soon, Carl is agreeing to virtually every offer that comes his way, often to surprising and hilarious results.As a generally generic Carrey vehicle, ""Yes Man"" doesn't provide much in the way of a thespian stretch for the actor, who could toss one of these roles off in his sleep if he wanted to. On the positive side, the movie feels less contrived than some of his previous efforts, thanks to the fact that it doesn't rely on some cheap gimmick like a magic spell or a knock on the head to get the plot rolling. The decision to become compulsively agreeable remains an act of volition on the part of the character, thus making the tale more relatable and grounded in the long run. Nobody is better than Carrey when it comes to over-the-top mugging and he is frequently in prime form here. Moreover, there are quite a few genuine belly laughs that are alone worth the price of admission (with a randy encounter between Carl and his aged landlady achieving the movie's high point of hilarity).On the downside, ""Yes Man"" does have a whiff of déjà vu about it that it is never entirely able to shake. Moreover, there is a certain threadbare quality that is almost inevitable when a movie's premise is built, as this one is, on the repetition of a single note. And there are some definite dull patches when the comic ideas seem to be withering on the vine. The compensation, beyond Carrey of course, comes in the form of two noteworthy supporting players: the likable Bradley Cooper as Carl's best buddy, and the winsome and charming Zooey Deschanel as the slightly offbeat motorcycle-riding band singer Carl meets and falls in love with during the course of the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
the message of this movie was....,"get a life, say YES. Jim Carrey plays Carl, a banker at a dead end job that always makes excuses as to why he can't do things. One day he meets an old friend that suggest he attend the YES seminar. Carl does and is convinced by the ringleader, Terrence, that he must say yes to all situations that come up.Soon, Carl is giving rides to homeless guys, approving loans for everyone, and attending band concerts. At this concert, he meets his dream girl, Allison, in which he met a few nights earlier when getting a ride from her. Soon, Carl is hanging out with his friends and going out with Allison, doing all kinds of spontaneous things like taking trips to Lincoln, Nebraska.Of course, we have the whole girlfriend getting mad at the guy and he must win her back at the end.

"If chance come, you need to you say yes . Feels good man","This is the best romantic comedy, what I have ever seen.The film star Jim Carry makes the film one level higher with his actor skills. I am glad when come new comedy film with him.
The story is very simple: Carl is divorced from marriage and he became negative and quiet man. Also, he lost lots of his friends, because he is too lazy to have a fun with them. However, one day he met his old friend, who was as same as Carl, but he changed after visiting a workshop with the charismatic leader Terence. The workshop is visiting by Yes People, which saying yes at all situation or chances. Carl is convince to try it out, when he meet the lovely girl Alison. He began to live a different life than before.Yes Man has a good cast, very crazy and funny character is Norman (Rhys Darby). The best scenes are with Carl and Norman, for example Norman's wizard party.In my opinion Yes Man have the undertone of motivation.

most appalling piece of drivel I have ever seen,This has to be one of the worst ways of spending $14 that I can think of. To sit through this movie was agony. If you like Jim Carrey you would have to be nuts to even waste the petrol let alone the entry fee to see it. Do yourself favor and give it a miss. I have no idea why they are having to make me write 10 lines about it...just writing what i have written and to have to suffer through the agonising memory of the movie is bad enough let alone having to completely remind myself of how bad this movie was is bad enough. The only saving grace for this piece of rubbish was the fact that it did actually finish and I was able to leave the theatre.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Tries to transcend being yet-another Carrey vehicle flick; doesn't quite pull it off,"I actually kind of liked Yes Man. For much of the time, I thought I was watching a movie where the plot and the writing for various characters took precedence over the goal of feeding another body to the Carrey-loving piranhas.It was interesting: It appears that when the plot stopped moving forward, Carrey started becoming his usual buffoon; a kind of cinematic version of nature abhors a vacuum. When the plot again got (sort of) roused from its slumber, the direction of Carrey fell back into the territory where his antics get subsumed under the larger (and surely nobler) goal of delivering an actual story to the viewer.Carrey is capable of doing fine acting. I want to see a flick where, from start to finish, that's what he does. And, of course, with his clout and cache, he can afford to pick and choose a script and role (and director) that will allow him to do this.When you discount Carrey's buffoonery, what's left? Unfortunately, a mixed bag. The overall theme is great: Positivity nets you good fortune. I loved that message! The bit of business at the end of the movie--with the love interest, and revisiting the seminar to reconfront the guru--was sort of cool, but seemed to me not to have been written and directed well.In general I would characterize this as a movie that still relies too much on Carrey's draw, and so thinks it can afford to skimp on the aesthetics. Sad to see it's still like this after so many years!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hilarious and thought provoking.,"Yes Man is a return to what Jim Carrey does best. This film was hilarious. It runs the fine line of down right stupid and genius almost perfectly. Providing comedy for everyone, no matter what your taste.The basic premise is that there is a man who must follow a set of rules. In this case, to say yes to every proposition he is faced with. It follows much of the same premise as Carrey's Liar Liar from 1997. This involves Carrey engaging in a set of hilarious set ups ranging from bungee jumping to learning the guitar. This gives the film a nice pace which never slows down at any point because something new is always going to happen when you say yes to everything.From this comes such a sense of fun. You can tell all members of the film had a lot of fun making this film and I believe that that transcends on to the audience.Aside from being funny, this film has also an unexpected twist. It makes the audience think. About all the things they say no to. And so people think about how their life is (or would be) when/if they say 'Yes'! I'm not suggesting you try this for the rest of your days. But the next time you are presented with a choice, try saying yes. See where it leads you. It worked for Mr.Carrey.Where as I don't believe this is Jim Carrey's best movie (In my opinion that is The Mask) it does a damn fine job of making it's audience laugh. Especially considering it was a winter film. (When people need cheering up the most.) It also puts you in the mind set of everything you could say yes to in the summer.If you do watch this, see it with a large group of people and make a pact to say yes from now on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Light-hearted with a simple message,"This is a fun movie, with a message for all of us. Because life gets in the way of things, can get us down sometimes and sooner or later we find ourselves saying 'no' more and more. If you want to change your thinking, change your outlook or change your life outcomes - then maybe you have to open up to the possibility of saying 'yes' more often. Jim Carey is really good in this. Rhys Darby produces some great giggles. I fell in love with Zooey Deschanel watching this in the cinema on opening day. And who doesn't love Terence Stamp? There's lots of light-hearted laughs and moments in this. And maybe lots of life experiences and questions that might be familiar to you, too. Say YES to Yes Man.

A Jim Carrey Movie - That Kind of Says it All,"Another standard Jim Carrey flick in the same vein as ""Liar, Liar"". It's a little watered-down from his classic manic roles (thankfully), but it's the same Jim. He starts out a boring shut-in sadsack who makes a covenant at a Yes Man! seminar to say ""yes"" to everything, no matter what it was. And semi-hilarity ensued. There were funny parts and there were over-the-top parts that didn't turn out too funny. I have a problem with casting Zooey Deschanel as his love interest, not because I don't like her (love ""New Girl"") but because I think she's half his age (at least in looks). I guess that makes me old as I'm now bothered by that timeless Hollywood caveat. Actually, most of the supporting cast (Bradley Cooper, Danny Masterson, Molly Sims) is at least a decade younger than Carrey. For me, it just stole all the realism out of a Jim Carrey comedy...",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It Just Doesn't Get Creative Enough.,"Carl is a loner who never wants to do anything with anyone. This includes his best friend who is about to get married. After missing a few important dates in his friends life and having a bizarre dream about being dead and nobody caring, he decides to attend a YES MAN seminar. He is challenged to say YES to EVERYTHING, or else bad things will happen to him.This kind of sound like Liar Liar and that is the film most people will be comparing it to, even though both of them are almost completely different. The only similarity is that the main character HAS to do something. One is to tell the truth, the other is to say yes. Well, the similarities stop there. I want to say that this film is funny, and I will, but it wasn't funny enough. I got a few chuckles here and there but not one scene stands out in my mind as the funniest or the most memorable. Which is a bad thing for a comedy.Jim Carrey does his usual and brings the funny faces and physical comedy. At some points it seems unnecessary and forced, like when he is having a weird face making competition with his boss. At other times, it just simply works cause it's Jim Carrey and he's being doing it for years. As Carl, who is played by Carrey, soon finds out that saying yes leads to good things in his life, he embraces the idea. Unfortunately that idea is never fully realized and we never really see where this could take us. It felt like they were playing it safe this time, which is really odd considering the amount of adult material in here.There are a few swear words, I remember hearing the F-BOMB a few times, which surprised me. Also there is a scene in which my girlfriend found completely gross and it involves an elderly lady taking out her teeth to 'perform' on Carl. The scene is used to show that when he says NO, bad things happen to him, but at the same time it seems completely like it should belong in another film.Everything you see in the trailer is pretty much what he says yes to. The Korean, the guitar lessons, the plane lessons. There are only a few that you don't know about but they aren't that funny. Driving a homeless man home is one of them and it never got a laugh from me.The supporting cast helps the film immensely. Zooey Deschanel is wonderful as always. I find her always to be charming and cute with a funny side. Carl's boss and new friend due to him having to say yes to everything is Rhys Darby. People may recognize him from the TV show Flight of the Conchords as the band manager. He steals the show in every scene and is far more funny then Jim Carrey. It's a shame because I always liked Jim Carrey. It seems that the older comedians are losing it while the newer ones seem fresh and hot. Terence Stamp has three scenes in the film, two of which are at the seminars. He doesn't really add too much to the film and the role could have been played by anyone.The film is indeed a romantic comedy, so I warn you. Be prepared for every romantic comedy cliché. This one has them. Boy meets girl, loses girl and races against time to win her back. What makes it not really work is that I can't see Deschanel really hooking up with Carrey. It must be the age gap. Even though these two work well together, I just can't see them romantically involved. Maybe best friends would work better.I wanted more from Yes Man, it could have really done some funny things with it's premise but it plays it safe. I do find the film to be one of Carrey's better ones of late. Fun with Dick & Jane was horrible and let's not even mention The Number 23. Yes Man is a film you want to be able to laugh constantly at, but will only find yourself laughing every now and again. I recommend Yes Man as a rental and nothing to rush to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Unfunny Jim Carrey and charming Zooey Deschanel,"Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is stuck in the same place after being dumped by his ex-wife years ago.

Carl tries to say yes and things start to happen. He gets an unexpected promotion and a new girlfriend (Zooey Deschanel).It's a tiresome start with a tiresome character. The movie bumps along until Zooey gets in. She's the MPDG, and she saves this movie... sort of. The self help group headed by Terence Stamp feels like an annoying cult. It's a terribly unfunny start. Zooey is a very charming girl, but there's a limit to what she could do. And she is limited in her time on the screen. On the other hand, Jim Carrey doesn't have the same presence anymore. They don't have great chemistry together.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Funny in parts, but mostly doesn't work as a film","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningCarl Allen (Jim Carrey) works in a bank, spending his time rejecting most of the loans customers apply for. Outside of work, he has a negative attitude that sees him missing out on a lot in life, including the engagement party of his good friend Peter (Bradley Cooper.) He bumps into an old friend who takes him to a self help seminar where a guru embraces him to say 'yes' to everything-and actually puts a curse on him where saying 'no' will result in something bad. Before long, Carl's saying 'yes' to literally everything, causing complications in his work life and personal life.I've become quite an avid reader of Danny Wallace's '...is a man' column in ShortList Magazine, which I pick up for free every Thursday on my way into work. The man has an undeniable way with words and for bringing fairly ordinary situations he's found himself in during the past week to life in the most vivid and outrageous way possible, I call to mind his experiences in a chip shop with a drunk guy who thought he was mute, sitting behind a guy on a train who talked loudly into his mobile while placing a large order and confrontations with builders outside his home. This is an adaptation of a novel he wrote based on a philosophy he adapted in his own life where he had too much of a negative attitude. I haven't read it (hadn't even heard about it!) but I'm sorry to say Yes Man hasn't translated into a great film.There are some very funny moments (that are uniquely Wallace in their hilariousness), but as a whole the film is very hard to get into and fails to really hold your attention. In the lead role, Carrey seems to have matured and refrains from too much gurning and mugging (except from a scene where he's consumed too much Red Bull!) but he can't work to his best with the weak material. With the current economic climate, a scene where he's reprimanded for granting too many loans may even be seen as tasteless by some. I'm just nit picking now, but the fact is this is a disappointing film that only manages to be sporadically funny. **",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Yes Man is an above-average comedy but not among Carrey's finest.,"My daughter and I recently watched Yes Man (2008). The story follows a middle-management worker who attends a self-help seminar and discovers the power of saying ""yes"" to everything. Embracing this mindset, he finds his life taking a completely new direction.Directed by Peyton Reed (Ant-Man), the film stars Jim Carrey (Sonic the Hedgehog), Zooey Deschanel (500 Days of Summer), Terence Stamp (Superman II), Danny Masterson (That '70s Show), and Molly Sims (The Benchwarmers).The premise has potential, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of Carrey's best comedies. That said, he's fantastic in the role-his facial expressions, quick wit, and comedic timing keep you engaged. His boss is a standout, delivering some of the funniest moments.

"Yes it is a lot like Liar Liar, but it's Better","Yes Man is a very hard film for me to review because it one of those films where the part of me that fancies myself a intellectual film critic tells me I should hate it, and the part of me that is just some suburbia kid that went to see a movie on Friday night tells me I should love it. The reason I'm suppose to hate it is because Hollywood has been beating the proverbial dead horse with films whose premise is almost identical to this one. Yes Man is a Romantic Comedy about a man who recently went through a divorce and is realizing his life is miserable, in order to change all that he makes an unusual, radical, and unrealistic change in his lifestyle that causes him to acquire a new girlfriend. If you can't name at least 5 Romantic Comedies that are carbon copies of that idea then you must live under a rock, Hell I can think of 3 that Jim Carey acted in before this one.But there is nothing inherently wrong with these kinds of films, in fact some are very good, and if Yes Man is the last of this form of Romantic Comedies then the sub-genre has ended on a high note. There are several things that make Yes Man better than Liar Liar (which every critic on planet earth seems to be comparing it to). The first thing they do right is casting Zooey Deschanel as the lead female, since every role Zooey Deschanel touches is pure gold. You see, it's very easy for a director to find an actress with tits big enough that all then men in the audience wants to Do Her, it's not easy for a director to find an actress who is so sweet and likable that every man in the theater wants to snuggle with her for 4 hours then watch her sleep in their arms. I even liked her in Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy despite the fact it sucked. In fact her role in that film was so good that if they just called it ""Zooey Deschanel goes to Space with a British Dude"" it probably would have gotten very positive reviews.Now other than the fact the film has an actress that me and a good number of my male friends have a crush on (for good reasons), it deserves credit for doing something original with an unoriginal thing. It kind of like how Punk ceased to be original at the dawn of the 80's so everyone just started playing Post-Punk, (sorry no more Punk Rock references). Yes Jim Carey makes an unfeasible lifestyle change, but it can't be to unfeasible because apparently some Scottish Comedian actual did it for like six months and then wrote a book about it which this film is based off of. So unlike Liar Liar I could see 90% of the things happening in this movie actually happening.What's really great about this film is the message it preaches. Almost all Romanic Comedies I see nowadays preach the message of ""Responsibility,"" and ""Trust,"" and ""Respect."" Back in the day this made sense since we were living in an age where getting a divorce was considered about as bad as getting a chocolate bar while on a diet, but it seems whoever wrote Yes Man thought this message got pounded into our heads a bit too well. Yes Man encourages couples to be spontaneous and free spirited, which is good because it seems people are so convinced that once you enter a serious relationship that you have to enter a dull routine. The movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall had a similar message, and I really enjoyed that film as well, thought it didn't have Zooey Deschanel. This movie is most likely the best Romantic Comedy about a guy making an unrealistic lifestyle change I've ever seen, there are some genuinely funny times, and some genuinely heartwarming times, plus the Romance between Carey and Deschanel in this film is a creative and oddly believable. And if anything you should probably go see it just cause I think it's Zooey's best role so far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good enough to say yes to,"Yes Man is a movie which can both entertain and surprise you. It's a Jim Carrey comedy so we know what that entails right? Carrey going way over the top, exaggerated physical antics, the rubber face stretching in every conceivable direction. Anything for a laugh, that's a Jim Carrey movie. Except it's not this Jim Carrey movie. Carrey reins himself in a bit. This is less a Jim Carrey movie and more a breezy romantic comedy which happens to star Jim Carrey. Even with a premise, a character who has to say yes to everything, which seems to set the movie up for all kinds of outrageous, and likely juvenile, shenanigans the movie doesn't go in that direction. OK, there's one unfortunate incident with an old lady. But other than that Carrey's character is saying yes to more mundane things. He says yes to guitar lessons and Korean language classes. Nothing uproariously funny there but things which will pay themselves off in smart ways later. That's what this movie is. Nothing to make you bust a gut laughing but enough to keep you entertained.On the surface the plot seems to harken back to Carrey's Liar Liar but the movie and Carrey himself don't go to the extremes we saw in that one. This time there's nothing magical or mystical going on as with the man who absolutely could not tell a lie. Carrey plays bank loan officer Carl who has lost in the game of love and retreated into his own little shell. He says no to everything. He says no to life itself. Until a friend drags him to a seminar run by some weirdo guru-type who preaches the power of saying Yes! Carl vows to begin saying yes to everything. Here you expect the movie to start its inevitable flight off the deep end. But no. Carl's first chance to say yes sees him giving a homeless man a ride. This leads him to a meeting with the exceedingly quirky, scooter-riding Allison, played by Zooey Deschanel. Will Carl say yes to falling in love with Allison. Uh, didn't I just mention Allison is played by Zooey Deschanel? Duh, you don't have to have a yes-saying covenant to fall in love with her. From there it's a pretty formulaic romantic comedy. The movie's got enough humor and, helped immeasurably by the wondrous Deschanel, plenty of charm. The jokes and gags aren't huge, certainly not as outrageous as you'd expect in a Carrey comedy, but the more subtle humor works well for this movie. You're not just waiting for the next big Carrey explosion, this movie actually gives you reason to care about its story and its characters. Carrey and Deschanel have great chemistry and it is oh so easy to root for the Carl and Allison relationship to succeed. As in any rom-com there will be complications in the relationship. But there's never really any great drama, no real doubts as to how the story will turn out. But even if the ending has a tinge of inevitability to it the movie has a good time getting there. Not a great comedy but a good one. Pleasant and charming, likely to bring a smile to the face. A more relaxed, restrained Jim Carrey can still be funny. And Zooey Deschanel can be whatever she wants to be, she's that good. Pair them up and you have a movie worth saying yes to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A lot of likable characters plus a thoughtful story.,"A lot of likable characters plus a thoughtful story. Apparently the movie is everything I didn't expect. It appeared to be a little too stereotypical when I saw the trailer. The protagonist got a dead-end life, and a chance of change just came in the form of a mental seminar. It sounds a lit too alike those ""don't believe the cheap American dream"" style of story. So I was expecting the ""spiritual teacher"" to turn out a cult hierarch who drives people into his whatever-magnitude conspiracy. And Jim Carrey's gonna do something to stop him. How stereotypical I was.The story, implied by the plot outline on this site, was a self-exploration story which is relevant to us, everyone who's in a dead-end status quo on this planet. But it offered more, it's written with heart and the performances deserved many praises. The story managed to pull the brake at perfect timings before it's gone totally crazy for several times. Finally it turned out to be both hilarious and inspiring. It got the message delivered that those straight-minded people really deserved more care, understanding and guidance. Yet it's not really selling any tin-can theory on the big screen. The final moments are very well done. It could be one of the best comedic ending I've ever seen.Carrey's comfortable in the title role, though I am not sure if he was totally comfortable with everything he was asked to do during filming. Zooey did a her part and stole the show every single time she's on screen, not only for her hot appearance, but also for her comedian talents. Anyway audiences could be mislead by the trailer and skip it, but the movie's better than its trailer, and that's a rare thing in the industry today.Well, there are some awkward moments, and all of them are related to an elder woman who tried to seduce Jim everyday. When I watched it, I shook my head and thought that's the only thing overdone. the makers managed to set the tones right and got the movie a PG-13 rating, but IMO that single scene could get the movie an R. Anyway the whole movie's too mature for a 13-years-old.8 stars, if they delete or alter the scene I mentioned I'd give it 9.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Say it a million times. Then say it a million more. And the word you will have said two million times is...,"In 1997, Jim Carrey starred in a wonderful film called Liar Liar, about a lawyer who is forced to tell the truth for 24 hours. Now, in 2008, he was in Yes Man, about a banker who must say ""yes"" to every opportunity presented to him. Sound familiar? Although Yes Man was a decent film, it is nothing compared to Liar Liar. When a lawyer desperately wants to tell the truth, but cannot, it is funny. It provides many opportunities for Jim Carrey to go insane with his facial expressions and such. But when a man says ""yes"" to everything because he wants to Where's the tension? Jim Carrey's comedic talents are practically not employed in this film, which is a terrible shame.Although Yes Man is enjoyable, there is one thing that I wish the film didn't do. Jim Carrey's character, Carl, has an elderly woman as his neighbour. One day, she asks him to come set up some shelves for her. As a method of compensation, she proposes to give him a ""sexual release"". What happens next— I just wish the film hadn't gone this far. There was no need. When Carl refused and fled, the scene was funny. When he returned, the scene momentarily switched from funny to disgusting.Jim Carrey makes gargantuan efforts to carry the film, and he more or less succeeds. He is supported by a solid cast, but none (with the possible exception of Terence Stamp) do nearly as good of a job as Carrey.One more thing about Yes Man that I have mixed feelings about: Carl's boss, Norm, is portrayed as a stereotypical, Hollywood ""loser"", hosting a Harry Potter dress-up party, and later, a similar one in honour of 300. He remains a gawky, two-dimensional caricature. Only in one of his final scenes, at his 300 party, does Norm actually feel like a real character, which is a fantastic, unexpected, and pleasing surprise. However, it's just barely worth the long wait for about 10 seconds of a good scene.The Verdict: The film is enjoyable and entertaining, but far from memorable. A couple of flaws seriously detract from it. For a far better film with a similar premise, I recommend Liar Liar.Overall Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A career low,"""Yes Man"" confirms what you already thought about Jim Carrey's career. It's struggling and it's struggling bad. His movies hinge on him, I get that. He's supposed to be his wild and zany self and the rest is supposed to work itself out but jeeze, in the past he's at least gotten workable premises. Now he's worrying about the number 23 and yelling yes to everything and everyone. ""Yes Man"" marks his career-low, a movie so awe-inspiringly bad at times that I just wanted to walk out and try to remember the good times with Carrey that now seem so far removed.He plays Carl Allen, a lonely, sad-sack whose been avoiding his two best friends (Bradley Cooper, Danny Masterson) and refusing to go out at all since his wife dumped his boring, say-no-to-everything-ass. He works in a bank approving loans, a perfect job for him since he declines all of those people too. But on advice from a friend, Carl is invited to some crazy seminar run by some crazy guru (Terence Stamp) with some crazy ideas about saying yes to everything. Carl buys into it and soon all of his yes's are opening doors to different opportunities, including a date with a free-spirited musician/photographer/exercise teacher/missionary worker (you get it, she's a free spirit) named Allison (Zooey Deschanel).The problem with this movie is that the yeses also open the doors to the jokes. One involves him having to give a homeless man a ride (the homeless man also kills his cell-phone battery, which is the big laugh pay-off I suppose). Another yes gets him into a bar-fight. One more leads to him repeatedly and hyperactively shouting out ""Red Bull."" And the near walk-out moment for me was the old lady who offers him oral sex. And I don't even want to get into his sing-a-long of Third Eye Blinds ""Jumper"", as he's trying to get a man off the ledge. If anyone finds this ludicrous and near desperate material funny, consider getting an MRI on Monday right away.Which brings me to Carrey, who really has to go above and beyond here to even get the few chuckles he does get. He wraps tape around his face, dresses up like Harry Potter, drives a motorcycle bare-assed through the street but not once does this premise allow him the same thing he was allowed in ""Liar Liar"", a movie a lot of others have compared this to. It just looks like he's doing random things for the sake of doing them here, whereas in ""Liar Liar"" his schtick fit in better. I used to be a big fan of this guy but it looks like his great dramatic work in ""Truman Show"" and ""Man on the Moon"" has dissipated into things like ""The Number 23"" and his comedic career all hinges on doing another movie with Charlie Kaufman.And Zooey Deschanel is no help. She looks much younger than Carrey, can't match him in energy at all, and sounds as if she's drowsy. If she's watching this movie, I can understand why.

It's very not ordinary and little dangerous method to be happy, but to be unhappy is more dangerous. Also, I fell in love for Zooey Deschanel's eyes, they have the rare beauty and attraction. If you are frustrated, depressed or just tired of chores you should to watch ""Yes man"" and you will forget your troubles at the moment.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good but nothing special.,"Saw the movie in early 2009, had to re-watch it to give it a fair rating. Definitely a good comedy film that kept me interested in the genre as a whole. Jim Carrey always one of my favorite comedic actors played a good and interesting role on his part. Big ups to Zoeey Deschanel, Have not seen much of her previous work, maybe a film or two, made me interested in catching her other ones. Interesting plot, have not seen much like it before, Jim Carrey certainly made his role unique, which I think he always does, he is just that sort of a character in my opinion. The movie kept me interested in watching the full 1 hour and 40 minutes, which a lot of movies fail to accomplish. My recommendation is to watch the movie but do not have your hopes up too high.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Reflection,"I thought this movie is just a comedy movie without any content before I watched it. But I was wrong, it not just a comedy movie. It showed the something that can encourage people. The main actor was not lucky and able to do thing well. He always refused others' inviting, helping, or something they want him do. But his life got worse and worse, and he felt worse and worse, too. One day his friend introduced a speech, yes man, to make him become more confident. He went to the speech and do truly what the speaker said. And then, he always said ""yes"" when somebody ask him for doing something. Because of this action, he got a good attitude toward his life, and met the girl he loved. I think that the magic is not only say "" yes"" to do anything, but by doing this, you can be more confident to face everything. Be confident is very important. If you have confidence, you can show yourself at your best. Everything changes when you change your attitude toward the way you look the world. So change yourself to be active and confident, everything will be better as you do it!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Yes Man - A Review,"Movie Review By: Y Sathya Kumar Rating: 6.5/10 Say Yes! to Yes Man only in DVDs...If you haven't know, this film is based on a novel by Danny Wallace who actually said 'Yes' for 6 months and how it affected his life.However,the book was not followed closely in the film and have almost completely changed except for the saying 'Yes' parts.Basically, a mundane and uninterested Carl(Jim) meets a zest filled development program and promised himself to say 'YES' to every opportunity that approaches him. He then realizes the power of yes and hops on the roller coaster of life and finally maturing at the end of the story as someone who understands when to say the Yes's and No's.Although, I have to say some parts where Carl says ""Yes"", it's completely unrealistic.Principally, if you looking forward to know about someone who goes through the ups and downs in life through learning valuable lessons; well you will get it but in a romantic comedy style. It started off well, by showing the events of Carls life and showed that this film promises something new like a biography but it actually follows other Rom-com the moment Carl meets his partner. From here, you can actually start predicting the next scene till the end.Another earlier film by Jim Carrey 'Liar Liar' too has similar premises where Jim Carrey is forced into telling the truth all the time just like Yes man who is supposed to say yes to everything.Jim Carrey is as always top-class in his acting and had done justice to his role.Jim Carrey hasn't failed in his attempt to make us laugh.The fellow casts also have done a good job in keeping the attention of the audience.I would have to say the comedy is this film is awesome and leaves you smiling if you recall the funny parts.Basically, the plot does not need any heavy special effects or CGI; also the cinematography must be appreciated. The director had a casual tone and the setting was good as it was a treat to your eyes, hats off to him for not spoiling anything.The chemistry between Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel was rather cute. They kept the audience smiling and not frown at all.The dialogs was also a very strong point of this movie as they were clever and quick-witted. An example would be ""(singing with her band) Don't call me past 11 PM, it won't happen again. You can call me at 10:59 but don't call me at 11 because that's my rule now."" Rounding off, the reason this movie gets a 6.5 is thanks to Jim Carrey's acting and all the funny moments that keeps the audience happy when they leave after the movie.After all,thats what that really counts...The let down would be the plot as it could have been better if it had not turned into a romantic comedy and rather had sticked to its creative idea and followed the book more closely.Say YES! To the DVD and watch this if you have the time and give your funny bones something funny.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Ticked My Boxes!,"Ticked all my boxes, made me laugh out loud many times, which is are for me, especially with American comedy.Either you like Jim Carey or not, but this is a perfect vehicle for his type of humour.Like any comedy, you are either in the mood for it or you may have well go to bed early.I must have been in the right mood, because I really enjoyed it.Some people here have a downer or have disliked this before actually watching it.Ignore them all and make your own mind up, it is very good :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Jim Carrey Comedy Stuck in Neutral,"Jim Carrey's back in familiar territory with ""Yes Man,"" a comedy that feels like a retread of his 1997 film ""Liar Liar."" This time, Carrey plays Carl, a loan officer who flips his life upside down after attending a motivational seminar that preaches the power of saying ""yes"" to everything.The premise has potential, but the humor relies heavily on predictable situations. We can see Carl's fate from the beginning, whether it's dealing with his oddball neighbor or falling for his love interest, played by the always charming Zooey Deschanel. Carrey's signature physical comedy is on display, but it feels constrained by the yes-man gimmick. The movie becomes a string of wacky situations with little room for character development or genuine tension.Despite the predictable plot, Carrey's charisma keeps the movie afloat. He injects energy into the film, and there are moments of genuine amusement, especially when he's allowed to be goofy and free-wheeling. Deschanel is also a delight as the love interest, and her beauty is undeniable.However, ""Yes Man"" feels derivative and uninspired. It lacks the cleverness of ""Liar Liar"" and the outrageousness that Carrey can deliver at his best. If you're looking for a classic Jim Carrey comedy, you'd be better off revisiting some of his earlier works.Overall, ""Yes Man"" is a forgettable comedy saved by Jim Carrey's performance and Zooey Deschanel's charm. The predictable plot and humor hold the film back, making it a passable choice for a light watch, but not a must-see.6.15/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Say Yes Over and over and over again this film is a must see,"Jim Carrey is better then before, this film is a must see 10/10 I went to the cinema to see this on the day of the release and i was like wow this is brilliant, i know Jim is knocking on now what about 47 48 now but he was amazing, Zooey was good too, loved her singing, i was not going to see it on the day, but i was glad i got up and went it really actually cheered me up that day, i would love to tell you the best part in the film that i found hilarious but I'm not everyone should see it, and say YES, Great soundtrack too, the music is so good in the film, and for Jim's singing wow, i knew he could sing but he was better in this, so if you get the chance go see it, but think it's stopped now in cinema but out on DVD soon i think, so that is on my to get list ha-ha, so SAY YES......",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Elevates the term 'adequate', but never rises above it.","Yes Man is yet another Jim Carrey vehicle, trying to cash in on his bankability while also giving him more scope to emote than in some of his earlier films. Plotwise, a forlorn shell of a divorcée finds new direction in life when a self-help seminar convinces him to say 'Yes!' to anything and everything. He meets a girl. Complications arise. Hilarity should then ensue.This film never relies on quick gags and funny faces for comedy. Instead we see Carrey's understated loans manager thrust into a variety of predicaments that would have confronted his original character. When it does descend into Carrey-patented rubber-face, is seems exploitative and not at all funny. Flight of the Conchords alumni Rhys Darby is brought in for comic relief, but in much the same vein as the rest of the film – characters forced into awkward and slightly ridiculous situations. It's amusing, but never hilarious, in the vein of Bruce Almighty rather than Ace Ventura.The supporting cast are admirably adequate, Zooey Dechanel lively if somewhat bland, and Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterton as the obligatory best friends fit the stereotype they are called upon to play. Essentially, the success and failure of Yes Man are that it is standard Hollywood fare. Acting, writing, production values and so on are all adequate, but there is no adventure or risk involved. Terence Stamp enjoys stealing a couple of scenes, but even he seems a little tired by the whole process.Yes Man harks back to Liar, Liar – Carrey's character is forced to do things that he would otherwise avoid, but this is devoid of the family warmth and sense of the ridiculous that made Liar, Liar a surprisingly enduring film, and all seems a bit self-conscious. It's humorous and harmless, a pleasant film to watch of an evening, but nothing that demands repeat viewings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Funny, charming and critically underrated","I thought this looked cute when I saw the ads, so when I saw it was on HBO I decided to have a look. I had no idea if it was supposed to be any good, I hadn't read any reviews (which I learned afterward were generally negative so I approached it blind. And I loved it.This is a very funny, charming movie about a negative guy who tries to become a positive guy through the radical step of saying yes to everything. The results are arguably too good to be true, although I understand the true story this was based on turned out pretty good.I like the message of positivity of this movie. For most of my life I was purposely pessimistic and cynical and had a mildly negative view of the world. A few years ago I decided to try the other side, and with determination and some books on positive thinking I managed to turn myself mildly positive, and my life genuinely improved, even though the cynic in me would have said it couldn't be that easy. So not only is this a very funny movie, but I think if it makes people think about the benefits of being more positive and adventurous in life then it is a movie with real world benefits.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"If It's Mediocre, Blame the Director!","The problem with Jim Carrey is not Jim Carrey...it is the mediocre directors that do not do their homework! This is a movie studio problem. Number one factor is identify what your star does better than anyone else, what makes them unique. Habit one: Begin with the end in mind. This is a thinking skill few seem to possess.What does Carrey do brilliantly? We saw a few Carreyisms which are littered throughout his film and Living Color performances. In Yes Man, it was the scene where he grabs the guitar and sings the guy off the ledge, but it was immediately after he pulls him into the office, he does a British accent of a rock musician. Totally unexpected addition to a scene. That is LOL stuff. That is where his magic takes place.Give him a story to grab hold of, that is a writer's job. Jim could play the role here similar to Norm MacDonald--a goofy guy that has a deeper soul underneath. Jim can stay on surface as Mr Silly, but as the story moves on, show a deeper side, a side that makes connections to soul most people miss and ignore in real life. Compare this to the shallow businessman focused on his portfolio using whomever along the way (the norm) and Jim is in this world, but not part of it--he is actually more courageous but it takes time to see this. That is a story people can connect with, the part that says, ""I really want to have more courage, but truth is, I am a conformist...like everyone else and afraid to take risks.""Look at Jim's life today...where has he gone? He has gone the metaphysical, seeker direction to the point of evangelist for his cause. How could Hollydumb not see this coming?

Yes Man was pretty good...,"Before watching this movie, I thought that it was going to be real funny and very entertaining. It wasn't that funny though, not like Jim Carry's usually gags and jokes. This was alright. Yes man tells the story of man Carl Allen (Jim Carrey)who challenges himself to say Yes to almost anything and everything. There are a lot of jokes in the film, and some of them are put to well use. But then again, some were just plain unfunny and awkward. But Carrey blazes above all else with his humor. He's still the zany goofy guy we all like and admire. Some parts of this film was great. others were weird. I mean, in the beginning his friend tells Carl to go to a Yes Man convention where a speaker tells the audience to say yes to everything and to be committed to saying yes. It starts out pretty weird. The guy tells Carl to say Yes to everything and that he has to. Carl agrees with this and follows his plans. The story basically starts from there. The thing I don't understand is, when Carl was forced to say yes and when he wanted to say ""no"", why couldn't he just say words that mean ""no"" like ""nope, naw, i cant"", and stuff like that...That as wack The story is somewhat predictable. Sure, it has a preachy message hidden somewhere in there, but all in all it's a pretty good message: Say yes to (almost) everything and you'll have a better life. I couldn't agree more after seeing this film.Overall, it's a very good comedy that will definitely make you smile, feel better, and inspired when you walk out of the cinema. Definitely a worth watching, its was great...coulda been better though",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Casting might have been better,"I can see why Jim was chosen, based on his performance in Liar Liar, but this movie might hsave been better suited to someone younger. Whenever I saw him and Zoe together, it just felt awkward, as if she was cringing on the inside - it really took a lot to act like she fancied this guy who's probably 20 years older than her. Chemistry = non existant. Otherwise, the story was fine with some funny scenes. There's a great message, that you can bring with you (I'd say it will last a few days anyway). The flow of the movie was 6/10, it was a bit choppy in parts. The other actors were just fine (espeically Norm (Rhys Darby) +Danny Masterson (unfortunately)).

Carrey's Simply Too Old For These Kind Of Movies,"Jim Carrey is not the man he was. He can't do the Ace Ventura, Dumb and Dumber, or Liar Liar anymore. You can see it in his wrinkled face. He's a great actor, funny and charismatic (and the one and only good point of Batman Forever). But he can't do the same movies forever. Even Tom Hanks moved on from these kind of goofy comedies.Carrey does not fit in with this cast. Everyone seems to be in their late 20s early 30s, and most of the actors are. Carrey looks, and is, past middle age. Yet he's trying to fit in with these people. They say he's been working at the bank for five years, but what has he been doing the rest of his forty years? The whole thing reminded me of that episode of Friends where Bruce Willis dated Rachel, but at least they they acknowledged the age discrepancy played on the idea that Willis was older. This movie keeps trying to pretend that Carrey is a thirty-something again. He's not. He's almost fifty. He should be moving on to more mature characters, something like Truman Show.Zooey Deschanel and Carrey simply don't click. There's no on-screen connection between the two. Maybe it's because Carrey is exactly eighteen years older than her (both born on January 17 but Jim in '62 and Zooey in '80). But it's probably because director Peyton Reed doesn't have the experience for that kind of thing.Maybe they should have gotten a younger actor for Carl. Maybe they should have gotten older actors for everyone else and made it a City Slicker-esquire mid-life crisis movie.Carrey's age is not the only problem. It seems a bit random, like they just threw in a bunch of gags together and tied it with this ""just say yes"" gag. Some of the ""yes"" gags don't pay off. At some points it seems like they created a situation that didn't fit the story at all but would pay off some gag. It doesn't seem very thought out. The side characters are underdeveloped and rather one dimensional. There's no side stories so the movie relies entirely on the one seemingly unplanned plot line.Not that it was a bad movie. It was funny, with plenty of laugh out loud moments. Zooey is cute in every role she plays. I've never seen Terence Stamp do anything less than a superb job. His part is short but sweet. Although Carrey should not be doing these roles, he does have fun with it. Giving it the full nine yards as he always does.In the end it's just a poor man's Liar Liar. It has Carrey. It has a very similar plot. It has most of the gags. It just didn't have the wit. Carrey fans will probably find something to enjoy being reminded of his older, better films. But I can't really recommend it for many others.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

An OK Comedy/Drama,"An OK comedy/dramaIn my opinion, this one was a little disappointing. It had potential to be a hilarious Jim Carrey comedy.

That leads to a lot of hilarious situations. But on the other hand, I think the drama-part of the plot got a little too much attention. Of course it's okay for a comedy to have some serious elements, and there are a lot of very good drama-comedies out there, but in this one I think it got a little uninteresting at times.But nevertheless, it's a good comedy, so don't let my negativity keep you from watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

give an answer,"One of Jim Carrey's many silly movies features him as a man who decides to answer yes to everything, no matter how banal. ""Yes Man"" is essentially a gimmick comedy like ""Liar Liar"" or ""Bruce Almighty"", but it's a funny one. It's one of those movies whose purpose is just to be funny, and it succeeds. I suspect that they probably had a lot of fun filming it, understanding that a few scenes - namely one involving Fionnula Flanagan - were very likely awkward to film.In the end, it's a fun movie.

One of my favorites from now onward!The perspective at which the movie is looked at is plain amazing. The movie starts off with a depressed character who misses out on life a lot who eventually learns that life is not about staying indoors and living a loner life, its about making memories and keeping memories.PERFECT when you are going through a rough time.

"Peyton Reed underscores the importance of opening up to new opportunities, and entertains. The actors have a great charisma script is genuinely funny","Undeniable is the talent of Jim Carrey. The actor began his career in the early '80s, but only consecrated in the early 90s without content in comedies like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), The Mask (1994), Dumb & Dumber ( 1994), Ace Ventura 2 -When Nature Calls (1995), The Cable Guy (1996), Liar Liar (1997) among others. Always having the comedies as a priority, Jim Carrey did not want to just be known as a good comedian full of gestures and grimaces, and ended up doing some great dramatic works, can show its full potential. Starred the great The Truman Show (1998), Man on the Moon (1999), The Majestic (2001), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004).After starring in the thriller The Number 23 (2007), Carrey returns to the genre that made him famous and draws many laughs from the audience. Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is an unhappy man, negativistic and closed to all around him after their separation, and who works in an investment firm refusing virtually all loan applications from customers. After the invitation of a friend, Carl decides to go on a cult of self-help, which is based on say yes to anything that happens to you or offer, in order to make better days and make your life happier .. By following this precept Carl's life begins to change, making it promoted and meet Allison (Zooey Deschanel), a woman who enjoys life, with whom she falls in love. But when trying to seize all opportunities that arise Carl begins to notice that everything in excess can also get tired.The argument used here is the same as other comedies, especially one's own starring Jim Carrey, Liar Liar. In the 1997 film, Carrey who used to tell one lie after another, only begins to tell the truth after a wish his son, causing him to go into the most unusual situations. Here in Yes Man, the premise is similar, and instead of telling the truth, he is a bitter man who went through a difficult breakup, and after accepting attend a lecture, must accept all proposals that arise, not caring who or where it may stop.It's the kind of film that makes the journey is more interesting than the destination. From the moment you know Carl Allison, we already know how the plot will unfold and finish, but still watched. The screenplay by Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogel, is based on the book by Danny Wallace and treats all issues in a light and entertaining. As in earlier comedies starred by Jim Carrey, especially Bruce Almighty (2003) and even Liar Liar, the script displays a character who lives his normal life, and that for some new fact, suffer a major upheaval in the way they live, usually showing him what really matters, making him cherish every moment and this person in your life.Director Peyton Reed (Bring It On (2000) Down with Love (2003)) presents its protagonist Carl trying to avoid friends so very funny. Amid the lessor, it appears trying to get away from friends not answering his cell. When he meets invents an excuse. Meanwhile his friend Peter is on the sidewalk in front of the video store looking for Carl and speaking with him by phone. This hilarious scene already shows what acompanharíamos ahead. Soon after we are introduced to the routine of Carl, by the time a friend tells the lecture Yes Lord. Committed to following the program, further thwarted, he gives a ride to a homeless person that ends the battery from your phone and still get money borrowed from Carl. When your car breaks down, he has to go to a gas station where he meets Allison.From there we have a situation funnier than the other. Interesting is the talk of self-help, which satirizes the churches, full of lights, hi-tech, microphone, amplifiers, sensationalism and show business. Then we have Carl saying ""yes"" to your elderly neighbor who wants to offer sexual pleasures in exchange for him helping her into a chore, ""Yes"" to a website that offers brides Iranian searches; ""Yes"" to the offer for sale mattresses specific; ""Yes"" to bungee jumping, ""Yes"" for theme parties watered a movie marathon of ""Harry Potter"" and ""300"", organized by his boss Norman; ""Yes"" to the races at six cameras morning with Allison. The sequence in which Carrey runs taking pictures under the influence of Red Bull after returning from the club with friends is hilarious.The major attraction of the film is that he achieves with situations in which Carl protagonist at subtly romantic side and placed specially by the cast. The beautiful Zooey Deschanel with her mesmerizing eyes have great chemistry with Carrey and the scenes in which the two are involved always guarantee laughter. The most natural way of interpreting is the perfect counterpoint to the faces and exaggerations characteristic Carrey. Zoey plays a lovely Allison, a woman who enjoys life and do what you will. Is still quiet and sweet just right. Zoey can still do his other passion which is singing. In the film she lends her voice to the fictitious band ""Munchausen By Prox."" The scenes where she sings with the band are one of the best parts of the film.We still have a good presence of Bradley Cooper. The actor, who would devote the next year in the comedy If Hangover! Also exceeds expectations in the scenes in which it operates. But who ends up stealing the show is Rhys Darby building a stereotypical Norman, with his mannerisms ""nerd"" that make the character face a major attraction comedy. All the scenes in which he participates are, without exception, those that are more in the mind after finishing the projection. First we have scenes of him trying to get closer and create greater intimacy to be friends with Carl on the bench. But their theme parties are the highlight of the production. The meeting watered the soundtrack of John Williams, to watch the marathon of movies from ""Harry Potter"" and can still see Jim Carrey arrive dressed in costume child size and the sign on the forehead of Harry Potter and wearing glasses is really sensational. A fantasy party of the movie 300 is not far behind.Terence Stamp as the guru of self-help lecture and Luis Guzmán also appear interesting tips, especially the suicidal character Guzmán that generates an unusual rescue scene.Peyton Reed underscores the importance of opening up to new opportunities, and entertains. Of course there are situations improbable and incredible coincidences (such as business people who had their loans approved by Carl have immediate profit, and all payments being made on time), but must be relieved. Overall, the events are always progressing and is okay synchronized. The actors have a great charisma script is genuinely funny and appeals. Every three minutes and often laughed . It is the film that every time that passes on TV, watch with pleasure. Fun guaranteed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Don't be a Yes Man,"Buoyed by some good reviews, stirred by extensive press coverage, bored by the Xmas holidays, I looked forward to the return to form of the truly funny Carey. Carey seems to have lost his way since his reasonably successful wander into 'straight' acting with Eternal Sunshine, and we all want the real Jim back (same for you Mr E Murphy). Both men have outrageous comic talent, but seem unable to find right now (it's behind you!), so I hoped 'Yes Man' would deliver me the Carey of 'Dumb and Dumber' and/ or 'The Truman Show'.Alas.....picture the scene: A 30 second pitch details nothing more than a man who has to say 'Yes' to everything, Carey is on board and the comic japes he can get up to are endless. It's Liar, Liar circa 2008. Brilliant, let's go. Carey even has points, his heart is in it, can't fail. Dates are set, the screenplay begun. Shooting looms, the screenplay is awful. Constantly rewritten during the shoot. Cast and crew do their best but the premise is lame, cannot be saved. The movie is disjointed, characters lifeless, and the plot written merely to accommodate a feeble joke or two. Post production, let's grab some great Eels tracks and try and paper some cracks, 'they' might not notice. OK, 'si-so', they're gonna notice, only one thing for it.... 1. Release it at Xmas, where the movie going public is at it's hungriest (and when word of mouth is relatively restricted) 2. Grease the tabloids and get some good reviews. 3. Plaster it everywhere, throw even more cash at it, wall to wall on every advertising medium under the sun.It's the oldest trick in the book  well, since the 70's; ""we'll have our money back and more before they even notice"". And they did, I fell for it, they have my money, wasted 90 minutes of my life and I am mortified. Don't fall for it, don't get sucked in, heed my words, and don't be a 'Yes' man like me!

Enjoyable Carrey comedy after ages,"Excellent direction is the glue that holds this romantic comedy in place. The performances, art direction, cinematography, and perhaps most importantly, the score and soundtrack all threaten at some point or another to overwhelm the viewer but are held nicely in check by restraint on the part of Peyton Reed. Which is somewhat surprising to me, since admittedly, I've watched 'Bring It On'.In all fairness, 'Yes Man' may at first be categorized as yet another Jim Carrey ego piece, but on closer examination, the message behind the madness proves stronger. Though he is extremely funny and there are plenty of trademark Carrey moments, equally humorous supporting performances (notably by Terence Stamp and John Michael Higgins) provide ample dressing to this tasty salad of laugh-out-loud hysteria, near-iconic visuals, memorable one-liners and an offbeat, believable romance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Carrey's Best Movie? No.... Funny? Yes.,"Yes Man may not be Jim Carrey's best movie nor is it his most amusing. But I've got to say, this movie is funny and it got a lot of heart.It's one of those light-hearted, feel-good movies.It doesn't have an out-of-mind plot (like Liar Liar or Bruce Almighty) or any over-the-top humour (like Dumb and Dumber or Ace Ventura). It's just a simple story of a guy who hits a dead-end and joined a seminar that changed his life; by saying YES when opportunity presents itself. Simple to understand. But after The Number 23, I'm glad to see Jim back in his natural form; doing comedy. And yes, it is funny.Zooey Deschanel was also amazing and an interesting love interest. And she sings well, too.Yes Man brings nothing new from the long list of Jim Carrey's film, but it does bring humour, love and a lesson to learn at the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Average movie? ... YES MAN! YES MAN!,"Carrey is Carl Allen, a man, who says 'no' to everything after breaking up with his gf (or fiancée? I can't remember). He stumbles upon a growing group of peoplee, who live their lives by not saying YES to EVERYTHING. Carl decides to become a Yes! man.Carrey has consistently made me laugh over the years, but I'm sorry to say, through the whole movie he just looked bored. He just gave off the vibe that he'd rather be somewhere else. While Carrey and many of the scenes are still funny, a lot of the fun is drained out as you realise the script simply exists to throw up as many random slapstick moments as possible without really exploring the idea of a man, who is not allowed to say 'no.' Or, for that matter, an entire wave of people who can't say 'no.' I found myself squirming in my seat before things got even more stale in the final third. On one hand the complications were welcome because the movie had just been going for so long without looking at the consequences of Carl's actions. On the other, it's the same stale, formulaic complications, lines and realisations we knew this movie had to have but were praying for something fresher.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Just say yes to this movie,"Jim Carrey returns to his comedic roots in Yes Man, a movie that tells the story of Carl Allen, a man frustrated with his life that one day decides to say yes to everything and everyone. It is a film that offers a very optimistic view on life in general and shows that you can't be 100% negative but can't be 100% positive either, need to have a balance. Yes man give you an hour and a half of pure comedy with hilarious situations and very funny jokes. But it also has it romantic side without being corny. The cast is very good. Jim Carrey with a performance that makes us laugh like only he knows, Zooey Deschanel is very convincing, She and Carrey make a nice couple, they have very good chemistry together. The secondary roles from Rhys Darby (Norman), Bradley Cooper (Peter) and Danny Masterson (Rooney) give a good support to the leading roles (Carrey, Deschanel) and to the movie. In conclusion, Yes Man is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that will produce you a smile at the end. Fully recommendable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Interestine plot but so boring,I didn't even finish the movie. I just fell asleep. Jim Carrey isn't as funny here as he is in most movies. Like I said I didn't finish the movie which means it might've gotten better at the end but I wouldn't know.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I'm just glad that Jim Carrey is playing in comedies again,"I thought that Jim Carrey quit playing in comedies and now will only do dramas because after Fun with Dick and Jane no new Jim Carrey's comedies were released (exept for Horton Hears a Who! which I haven't watched yet because I am not a big fan of cartoons) until this film came out. I heard that it's based on true story, so I thought that it's ain't going to be funny. I was so wrong. This movie was great. It's very similar with movies Liar Liar or Bruce Almighty, in other words - a typical Jim Carreys comedy. Not only it's funny, but it also has a great plot and a very optimistic mood. I think I'm going to try to say yes to everything at least for one day. It's such an inspiring movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Not one of Jim's best,","I have become a big Jim Carrey fan over the years. I think Me, Myself and Irene was the funniest of all. The Movie (not the TV version ). But this just left me feeling disappointed. Very few funny scenes. It was also very predictable. I could barely come up to a 4 in the rating system. It looked like a good chance for Jim to return to the level that he started, but the movie just falls flat. I guess you have to figure that there is no way you can say yes to everything and have things work out. It just seemed like an excellent opportunity for Jim to create something. I did like his love interest played by Zooey Deschanel, I could not place where I had seen her before, she has one of those familiar faces. Not too pretty, not to plain, just the kind of cute that I seem to go for. The closest thing I could compare this movie to would be Liar Liar.(only not as funny) But the same general idea. Maybe I like his humor to be more crude, but thats just me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Why saying Yes?,"""Yes Man"" is an entertaining comedy movie in which we watch a man challenges himself to say yes to everything for an entire year after he enrolls to a congress which proposes all the people to say yes to everything. So we watch Jim Carrey saying yes to everything and also watch all the experiences which takes from all the yes answering.I believe that this movie makes you think what would happen if where you answered no you had answered yes and this yes answer where it could travel you and what experiences you could had. I also thin that this movie it's a really nice because of the interpretation of Jim Carrey who plays as Carl (our yes man) and Zooey Deschanel who plays as Allison a different girl from all the other and as you can understand between them we have a romance. The direction of Peyton Reed was really great and this is a nice reason with which I believe that you have to watch this movie.Finally I have to say that ""Yes Man"" is a true comedy movie and if you have the need to laugh then you just have to watch this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Meh, Man","I love me some Jim Carrey. The man might live a weird personal life but he is a comedic genius and Zoey Deschanel is a wonderfully charming, quirky actress with an incredible voice. Shame the rest of this movie is so wildly generic. This is a very by the numbers rom-com, following all the tropes and stereotypes of the genre without really diverging at all. The cast is strong, which is great but they're giving so very little to work with.If you're looking for some harmless background noise then this works to fill that spot, it's a fun little movie that neither ventures nor gains in any significant way. Stream it, don't buy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An interesting romantic comedy.,"This film tells of a banking official who, because he is dissatisfied with his life, adheres to a positivist theory that promises to change his life if he stops saying no to everything. The theory, of course, was something to take with discernment, but Carl adopts it in a radical way, which brings him several and hilarious confusions, especially from the moment he meets Allison. The two roles are played by Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel, respectively, and both are excellent in the role, particularly Zooey. Terence Stamp plays the guru of self-esteem.The movie is interesting. It deals with a current theme that is low-self-esteem that affects us quite often at times. The need to face life in a cheerful and positive way. The jokes are good, although it's not a jaw-dropping movie. They are mainly based on situations created by the psychological inability of the central character to say no. The novel intertwines well in history and gives it a rational outcome. It's an interesting movie, especially for those who are accustomed to a crazier Jim Carrey. He is undoubtedly a quieter and quieter character than most of the actor's comic characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The BEST comedy I've seen in a LONG time!,"""Yes Man"" is one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies. This is mainly due to the fact that it just makes me feel good whenever I watch it (even if I'm sad or angry). Not to mention that it's downright hilarious! Sure... it didn't win any Golden Globes, but that doesn't make this any less of a great film. Jim Carrey knows who his audience is and he aims his performance right at us. Lately... most movies that come out I can't watch more than once without getting bored. However... ""Yes Man"" sticks out as one of the very few films I can watch over and over again and NOT get bored with it. Overall... 10 out of 10 for this comedic masterpiece starring a comedic genius!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The most powerful three-letter word in the English language!,"OK, I have to tell you a true story, you're not gonna believe this. I tried this ""yes"" thing a couple years ago, in late 2006. The first thing I did was accept an offer to teach English in China (I'm still here), then I was invited into dozens of Chinese homes, I agreed to an idea to ride a bicycle from my city to Beijing (about 600 miles), I was thereafter featured in the local newspaper, and through no real talent of my own I made an appearance on national Chinese television giving an interview and singing a song in Chinese.It hasn't all been fun and games though. I also accepted a casual invitation from someone I had known for about two hours to visit a nearby city which turned out to be forbidden to foreigners, so I was arrested as a spy and questioned in a Communist prison for 7 hours. Try it!Anyway, I was moved to tell you that story, because you would be surprised at how real the possibility is that the word 'yes' can actually change your life. It's so easy to get stuck in a comfortable rut and just stay there. Not that there is anything wrong with that, a comfortable rut is certainly better than a lifetime of hardship, but I'm going to go ahead and suggest that saying yes for a while is probably going to make the ride a little more interesting.Jim Carrey stars as Carl Allen, a regular guy with a regular job who really just wants to be left alone. He turns down invitations from his friends to go out on the town, he refuses offers and opportunities and invitations left and right, preferring the comfort of his own sofa and a rented video or two. And I can't say I blame him. There are few things as appealing to me as an evening in my apartment by myself watching whatever movie I might want to watch. Even two years after the word 'yes' has landed me in central eastern China, you would be amazed at how often I enjoy that particular situation.Complicating matters is the fact that Carl's wife left him, badly injuring not only his pride but his self0image and possibly even his mental stability. Not only does he reject chances to interact with friends and family, but he's also a loan agent at a major bank, so he says no for a living!He attends a YES seminar, where he learns that saying yes to everything can have brilliant affects on his life, whereas saying no could cause the sky to fall on his head. There is a crucial (and tasteless) scene where he is put into a position where he is forced to say no, and all hell breaks predictably loose.Yes Man is definitely a light-hearted and goofy comedy, but there is a thread of reality that permeates it and really makes you think that it's saying something real, which is something that is generally only true of the best Jim Carrey movies, like The Truman Show or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's not at the same level as those movies, but there is something here that really might make your life a little more interesting, and when was the last time you ever saw a movie with the potential to do that?""The world is a playground.

"Yes Man, 300, Same American Boat","When people make comments like: ""Americans can't even locate themselves on a world map,"" you might think of it as a racist remark. But after 2500 years, Hollywood can't tell the difference between, Persians or Iranians with Arabs. I know you don't care because they're all darn terrorists, right? And it's so amusing to dress an East Indian woman, Anna Khaja, in Arabic Hijab and ask Jim Carrey to locate her on ""persianwifefinder.com"" and name her ""Fernoosh"" who asks for hot sauce with an artificial accent. Just to remind you that Iranians are terrorists, later, Jim is caught by the airport security, because he's been seen with ""Fernoosh"". The movie 300 is on the same boat that animates Persians as blood-thirsty savages who killed for pleasure and it was up to 300 Spartans to protect the world from these beasts so they wouldn't come back again 2500 years later and target Twin Towers with a commercial flight. When did we see Iranian and American commercial flight conflict? Ah, yeah I remember; it was July 4, 1998 that American Navy ""mistook"" a civilian jetliner with a F-14 and shot it down killing all 290 passengers and crew aboard, including 66 children. You didn't hear much about that on CNN, did you? Or perhaps there's not much in history books about Cyrus the Great (a Persian guy) cylinder that was written in 539BC and it has been hailed as the world's first declaration of human rights. Well, for now, the Iranians, Persians are the bad guys so it's OK to dress East Indians, Afghans, Arabs, Kurds, Turks, and pretty much any brown skinned with a funny accent in a movie and make them pay for what Osama did few years back. As an Iranian, I don't have any problem with thatthat's ""how the cookie crumbles"" these days, but for the ones who don't know, please buy a map and find Iran before labeling ""them Iranians"" terrorists.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Absolutely!!,"This is a truly wonderful 'Carrey On' film. The comic genius of Jim Carrey is at full throttle. And smiling at him enigmatically is the fascinating 'cutest thing on two feet' Zooey Deschanel, who is like Meg Ryan when young, but brunette and with more of an edge to her. It all goes like a Porsche, rushing along smoothly and with more fun than a turtle in a sun bonnet. You can't help laughing and then laughing some more. It just all clicks. It is so satisfying when things work, especially comedy, which can so easily misfire. But here everything is in the hands of pros. Peyton Reed has done a terrific job of directing. Terence Stamp, as a motivational guru, is electrifying and so funny. Special comic genius is also shown by Rhys Darby, with his matey New Zealand twang, who is simply hilarious as a nondescript man who is beyond description. For somebody who is 'normal', how weird can you get? This is one of those totally successful comedies that you dream about. And as for Zooey Deschanel, anybody who doesn't dream about her is, well, only interested in boys. She is not a mere zooeylogical specimen, she is a zooeylogical innovation, a creature with only two arms who manages to wrap herself around you with all hundred of them and just won't let you forget her for a minute. At least I won't, anytime soon. But as for Jim Carrey, he is definitely a specimen never before seen, and still unclassified by science, who should be named Hilarius perpetuus and put in a jar to be kept forever, so that in ages to come, they can de-pickle him and say: My God, this is a funny one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Jim Carrey is as fun as he usually is, and the supporting characters are good. it's basically about a man who says NO to everything and therefore has a boring life. Then he is inspired to say YES to everything and his life takes a spin. The main question in the film is, is saying yes to everything such a good idea in the long run.This movie is funny and charming, but that's about it. it has a fun point to make and it's entertaining.

Content Adviser,"I thought the movie overall was great but I though the type of content and humor was a bit too much for my children to watch, which is a real bummer considering that my kids love jim carey and his humor. I think it would have been better without such content and the whole family would have been able to enjoy it. A little out of the norm for Mr. Carey! Rather crude and not needed! However, the idea of the flick I thought was great and promoted a positive way of thinking. The acting was very good and I love the leading female role, she was great! The renting would have been followed by a purchase if not for some of content which was of no importance to get the point across.

Rubberface is back,"I had a chance to see an advance screening of Yes Man last night and I have to say it's one of his best comedies since Me, Myself & Irene. I've always been a fan of Jim Carey, whether he's doing juvenile comedy like Ace Venture or adult orientated drama like the highly underrated Man On The Moon; & Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Making his first live action film since Fun With Dick & Jane, Carey once again shows his talent as a comic. Early trailers have the film coming off as a Liar Liar rehash, but looking deeper the film is more about than belly laughs and one-liners. It's refreshing to see Carey bring freshness to a role he could easily play in his sleep; one particular scene with Scotch tape had the preview audience in tears. Zooey Deshuncaal more than makes up for the debacle that was The Happening and displays the same likable charm she displayed in Elf, and hopefully she continues to play romantic leads in the future. All in all this is a fine film and if you're looking for a break from the profanity filed gross out comedies of recent memory, then say yes to Yes Man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Yes, man, why not?","Yes Man is a loaf of fluffy, inconsequential Wonderbread amidst a career of denser comedic pumpernickel for Jim Carrey. Most of what he does has weight to go along with the laughs, and if it doesn't it still has a raunchy bite that always hits below the belt. This is one of the few times he treaded lighter, a tone which can also be found in Fun With Dick & Jane, but that's just not a good movie. Yes Man has merit in fits and starts, and it's harmless fun for most of the ride. Carrey plays the consummate negative Nancy here, a guy who spends the better part of his time turning down offers, cancelling plans, avoiding people and saying no to everything. This all changes when he goes to a dodgy seminar preached by batty self help guru Terence Stamp. Inspired by his slightly odd teachings, he challenges himself to say yes to everything, and I mean everything, for one whole year. This gets him into all sorts of trouble, and steers him to the obligatory 180 shift in his character arc, and his own enlightenment. Guzzling red bulls after an all night club bender, guitar lessons, sexual favors from his experienced elderly neighbor (Fionnula Flanagan), driving a homeless dude (Brent Briscoe) to the middle of nowhere and giving him like two hundred bucks, life is just more fun when you say yes to everything, as Carrey quickly finds out. He also meets cutie pie Zooey Deschanel, whose initial amusement towards his lifestyle quickly turns to exasperation when his affirmative nature gets just a biiit too crazy for her. It's all in good fun, and while most of it isn't memorable or super noteworthy, there is one particular scene that makes the entire film worthwhile: Carrey has an awkward kiwi of a boss (Rhys Darby) who is constantly inviting him to cosplay parties. The moment he accepts is a symphony of quirky mannerisms, scotch taped facial grimaces and absurdity that is pure Carrey and could be used to sum up his career in half a minute. Watch for work from Danny Masterson, Spencer Garrett and Bradley Cooper. Like I said, it ain't gonna rock your world like many of the iconic, beloved Carrey films, but it's an amusing diversion with some scenes that do bring it home.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Beginning  Bad Ending,"I thought Jim Carey did a nice job portraying the life of a typical businessman. I completely understood when he got used to his work routine and had trouble changing it. It's a shame how many people don't notice how caught up they will get in their work schedule. I will admit that I have missed out on many opportunities because I have not had the courage to say ""yes"". This a great film that teaches someone that there are times in life in which you need to have the courage to try something new and it might be worth the risk. Jim Carey is a very comical actor, so I was not sure how a serious movie would work with him.

Free-spirited fun!,"Yes Man is free-spirited fun! Yes, it's a bit of a romantic comedy between two polar opposites 18 years apart but it wasn't all that gross. Yes, it's formulaic but it's also seriously funny.Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a recently divorced junior loan officer. Wallowing in his misery, his vocabulary is comprised of all variations of 'no'. He meets an old acquaintance, who convinces him to attend a life-changing seminar that is centered on saying ""yes"". Carl gives it a try, and ends up meeting Allison (Zooey Deschanel) as a result of his newfound way of life. Whenever he says no, though, things seem to take a turn for the worse. Or do they really? Deschanel is great for this sort of quirky role, and while the rubber-faced Carrey has aged a lot, he can still deliver the punchlines and play the role of leading man. When Carl breaks into song (""Jumper"" by Third Eye Blind), and the onlookers yell the power line back, ""Put the past away!"" it's priceless.It's uncanny how much I can relate to Yes Man. Even before I heard of the movie (which was only this year) or of the book (a biography by Danny Wallace), I had already tagged the year 2008 as the Year of the Yes for me, which meant accepting all sorts of dates and invites to trips and doing things I would not normally do. Just like Carl, this little change of perspective worked wonders for me. More than a little excursion out of my comfort zone, it opened up possibilities.

A must watch!!,"""Yes Man"" is a marvelous well-written comedy about a man named Carl played by Jim Carrey, who looses the love of his life Stephanie. With a negative outlook on life, Carl ignores all human contact. His best friend, job and personal life are all at hold until one day he runs into an old colleague while at work. The old time friend convinces Carl to attend a say ""Yes"" seminar, which teaches people to say, ""yes"" to very opportunity. Carl stars living unpredictably going from one place to another saying ""yes"" to everything.The literary was good. I thought the scriptwriter 's did an excellent good job on the choice of words for the actors. The humor was monotone but I enjoyed that style of comedy. Of course Jim Carrey helped out a lot with his impromptu such as the ""budgie jump phone conversation"", and it made the movie that much more enjoyable. I thought they could have chosen a better candidate for the role of Norman and giving that role to Seth Rogan.The dramatic was clear and I was able understand the plot of the movie. Again, it was a comedy that had a mild energetic style of humor. Overall the actors did a great job. The location of the movie was very ""relatable."" Most people who have jobs that require them to sit in a cubical can relate to Carl's lifestyle. The costumes were normal everyday clothes. Jim Carrey is the man!The cinematic was great as well. Everything pretty much was n sync. There was one scene where Carl and Norman started to make silly faces at each other at work. Carl went as far as to tape his entire faces with scotch tape making a classic face impression by Jim. The sound effect sounded clear and realistic for the most part.

Comedy Not What It Used To Be,"When Jerry Lewis died Jim Carrey wrote that because of Jerry Lewis he is the comedian he is today. Jerry Lewis was part of a group of comedians who knew how to make you laugh. Your entire family could enjoy a good comedy skit or movie together. Today these comedian-wannabes don't know how to make a person laugh without including trash in their routine. The true comedians of Jerry Lewis's era didn't use profanity, make useless sex jokes, jab at public officials in order to put them down and make them look stupid in public. Don Rickles always made sure if he picked on anyone they could walk away feeling good about themselves and not be offended. All those comedians - Lewis, Rickles, Hope, Kaye, Benny, Martin, Skelton, etc - they didn't use trash talk comedians use today. Any of today's comedians who say they learned from the masters are lying. Comedians today inject their personal religious beliefs or personal political left-wing beliefs in their routine forcing paying customers to listen to them when it's no one else's business what the comedian believes or thinks. Jim Carrey made about 5 or 6 movies I liked and have. This movie ""Yes Man"" turned me completely against Jim Carrey because of the scene where a grandmother gave him a blow job.

One day, whilst eating lunch outside work close friend Nick tells him how he's turned his life around by saying yes to life. Nick throws a rock through the glass-front leaving with a leaflet in his hand to attend a meeting of this.Carl's scepticism leads him still to attend a meeting full of Yes people where upon he says no and meets Terence (Terence Stamp) who immediately changes Carl's mindset bringing home an avalanche of positivity, good luck and romance.The film is brilliant, it's similarity in someway to Bruce Almighty brings home a very positive message to us all.Prepare to say Yes and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A few uncomfortable and unnecessary parts,"An interesting story and some funny moments mixed in with a few uncomfortable and unnecessary parts. It was entertaining though, and it made me think about how much I say ""no"" to things in life just because I'm scared to try something new - and that impressed me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Beautifully captures my own journey,"I used to be a ""no man""-scared of life because I sought comfort in predictability and safety. I lead a careful and cautious existence, blind to any alternative but knowing deep down that something was missing.This movie mirrors the journey I needed to go through to get out of that rut. I had to fake it til I made it and say ""yes"" to opportunities the universe presented even when I had absolutely no desire to or wasn't able to logically understand them.But each one got me a bit further outside my comfort zone until the idea of a comfort zone became meaningless. Comfort is no longer the endgame-it's a feeling that has no place for me anymore. Now, I just live in the moment and welcome each opportunity as a chance to learn and grow more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Terrific Comedy from Carrey!,"Yes Man is Jim Carrey's latest comedy, and I have got to admit I was not too terribly excited before viewing this film, but upon seeing it I was pleasantly surprised.Yes Man's premise is simple and direct. Jim Carrey's character basically attends a self help seminar that teaches its participants to say Yes to everything in life. As Carrey begins to do just that it leads to many funny and endearing sequences, resulting in him not only learning to live life, but also finding love as well.Yes Man was a truly terrific time at the movies and was quite possibly my favorite comedy I have seen in sometime. Jim Carrey was as usual terrific in this film, but the other supporting players, such as Zooey Deschanel, were excellent as well. Thanks to the film's terrific cast the laughs continued to come. My only minor problem was that the film is very slow to the start, it takes nearly 15-20 minutes for it to really have its first good laugh, but once you reach that point the laughs do not stop till the credits roll. Putting it simply, if you are a fan of Jim Carrey's other comedies such as Bruce Almighty and Liar, Liar, you will feel at home here and love this film.I give Yes Man a hilarious 9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Feel good motivational movie,"Jim Carrey is an amazing actor in all his films. I believe this was the very first Jim Carrey film I saw, according to memory and it's safe to say it was a good one.The comedy was good and the romance felt romancy.When I can rewatch a movie multiple times, that's an enjoyable movie. Movies don't have to be perfect to be 10s, I always find this movie when I'm in a dark place. And this movie always pulls me out of the dark. Gives me inspiration to better myself. Imagine saying yes to everything and good things happen to you? The movie isn't unrealistic as it sounds. To me the movie is about having a good perspective on life and always being open to opportunities thrown at you. Saying no to everything is worse than saying yes to everything in my opinion. 10/10 movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Yes Man lazy, predictable and somewhat dull.  Not Jim Carrey's best effort.","Jim Carrey is up to his usual comedic shtick in this lazy, predictable and somewhat dull comedy. Nothing new really goes on that I haven't seen before from Carrey or in other similar movies of this kind.Yes man basically feels like it was put together by committee with little thought put into it. A very run-of-the-mill effort. The one joke premise leads to a mediocre execution.Yes man made me laugh very little. I've seen comedies that were far better than this one.

"Yay, it's a silly happy movie!  90s Jim Carrey for the new age","It feels like a flashback to the 90s, just watch it you'd have to be a grouchy snob to hate it.If you're reading reviews of this on IMDb, which you probably aren't, you'll probably watch this eventually anyways. Nothing but good vibes and silly Jim-Carrey-brand humor.As far as I'm concerned, Jim Carrey is a genius, someone get him the peace prize already.The message in this movie is phenomenal, everyone should apply it to their own lives. I think people become depressed when they cut off the world. More you embrace life, the better you feel, it's science.On the real, though, great movie, great message, and just perfect for dates seriously, watch this movie with someone you want to see naked, it's like magic.While you're at it, watch Truman Show, Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Majestic, Me, Myself & Irene, et al.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Nice flick, Hollywoodism has its charm","I reluctantly went to see Yes Man, imagining - like many others - a bad remake of Carreys' earlier movie Liar Liar. I was surprised that it wasn't, and frankly relieved that it actually was a nice story with some good laughs in it. I would recommend Yes Man to anyone seeking a good laugh and a smile when walking away. It is a Hollywood movie though, so don't expect too deep a storyline (it's a comedy, laugh ;=). The ad placements were at times also over the top. I know it makes the movie cheaper to produce, but why not fake the brands ?But apart from those two, that still makes this movie a ***1/2 out of 5 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Jim Carrey does not disappoint!!,"If you are a fan of Jim Carrey, Yes Man for sure does not disappoint you, specially with his antics, but though, he does look a little older than usual!! His wrinkles on his face are quiet evident in the movie, not only at the time of him smiling, otherwise too!! The philosophy of the movie, where you should always say Yes, and if you say NO, you are losing on to life!! I so love the philosophy, just yes to what ever comes your way, with out pausing for a second to understand how the whole will repercussions on you. Yeah, it is only possible in movies, though!! There all the instances in the movie where Carl (Jim Carrey) just keeps on refusing to everything that comes his way. His ex-girlfriend, growth in his career, invitation to costume parties, and all other fun activities. Until, he he goes and attends this symposium of ""yes"" and always saying to Yes, and if there is a no, then there will be ""bad things"" happening to him.From the philosophy to getting a girlfriend, to having being promoted - even jumping the position of his own boss, bungee jumping, helping the neighbour (watch out for this one), attending costume parties, basically enjoying life.One of my favourite scenes in the movie, is when he is riding the Ducati to meet with his girlfriend and explain her things as to how it went. Why he had to say, yes, when he actually wanted to say yes? Confusing, watch the movie, if you like Jim Carrey, for sure not a disappointment! Rhys Darby reminded of Nigel from So you think you can dance? A very strong resemblance, probably was the character!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The worst Jim Carrey film,"Say Nod to Yes Man. OK, it's got a message, perhaps depth to some people but where's the fun ? Where the big laugh out loud moments ? I didn't see any ? Not a funny film. On the contrary, a yawn to Yes Man. Don't go to the cinemas, wait for the DVD. This movie's just awful. Bad acting, annoying dialogs and little fun.I miss the old funny Jim Carrey. The worst Jim Carrey film in my eyes. I wish I hadn't seen this film. A huge disappointment for me. Was expecting at least couple of laughs during the film. Don't waste your money on this, watch something else.There's nothing positive to write about Yes Man.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Well done,"Jim Carrey shines in this movie as a down trodden guy who finds his life change after saying ""yes"" to everything. In no time his life brightens up and he begins to grow more confident. Even striking up a friendship with a woman (Emily Deschanel). From that point on, things can only get better, or can it?I thought the jokes were funny. Some of them are low brow but many still hit. The kiss scenes are always re-watchable. The things he says ""yes"" to range from skydiving to learning Korean. Just goes to show that the possibilities are endless.I don't have much to say other than it's a pretty good film. Sometimes the characters actions are strange but overall, it still kept my attention. If you want to see something funny with Carrey in it, this may be for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Film,"""Yes Man"" is definitely one of my favorite films and more than a pleasant surprise to me. When I first watched it I was not sure at before if I even should, because I am not the biggest fan of Jim Carry's humor, although he is a lovable actor and the concepts of his films are always actually interesting.
This piece of cinema here is more than interesting - it is a movie with fun, truths and moral. Jim Carrey portrays a sluggish character to identify with, who goes trough a life-affirming transformation that motivates the audience to be more opened for extraneous situations in life as well.
That combined with its humorous elements (which really are funny) and some memorable scenes makes ""Yes Man"" an enrichment for everyone who watches it.
If you do not believe me, go and watch it - I think everyone should!Thanks for reading and happy watching!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Yes man,"Yes man is a hilarious comedy about a man, Carl Allen, who said « No » at everything since his girlfriend broke with him.

"Darn good motivational comedy, yes!","I went to this film dreading the worst, and came out yes, saying ""yes"" quite a bit more often. Bearing in mind the ""meaning"" of it, not saying a monosyllable, and taking it all with a pinch of salt (like the self-help guru Terrence Bundley teaches our man in the hospital), this movie is fun, well made, and doesn't pretend deep meaningful questions. Popcorn movie? Yes, but good one! Only once did I feel I was into another formulaic trap. In my case, it was when Carl was riding the super motorcycle. It felt like The Mirror Has Two Faces (Streisand's), which was copied in (among others), ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"", etc.Moving to the stuff of life: I love Zooey Deschanel's Allison! Of course, I don't know if I'd stand anything like her in real life, but isn't she lovely as a woman living by her own rules, not wanting to be stereotyped ""I've got fears, too!"" near the end, and yes, charmingly out of tune with reality :)? I feel the part suits her perfectly. Unlike another try of Carrey to play something sort of serious: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's Kate Winslet, who's just crass, and totally... uninviting :).Bradley Cooper and his other sex addicted friend are fine, the scenes with the old lady are a bit too much to, well, swallow, andRhys Darby is great. I didn't know the actor, but playing a perfect goof takes guts! I felt pity for old Norman, which is good in such an ""optimistic"" film. Molly Sims is cool as a stupid gorgeous materialistic woman. John Cothran Jr.'s voice is good for a boss. I am having nightmares with it :). The joke on cops being paranoid about yes, ""suspiciously chosen activities"" ""Who goes on holidays to Lincoln, Nebraska"" :)? is fun, if a bit stereotyped Hollywood ""liberalism"" as Americans like to misname it.I agree with IDMB's reviewer bopdog from Cardiff, Wales about a) the film being uplifting b) Carrey becoming ""a bit more human, and a bit more approachable"".

absurd but work very well,"At first, I didn't have high hopes for this film. but after watching the whole thing, I was so impressed with this film. very unique when an idea that is so absurd and very simple like this can make the whole film very funny. The story itself tells of Carl (Jim Carrey) whose short story has to say yes to everything, otherwise he will suffer bad luck. all the objects and subjects that are here are maximized to perfection. over all, i was pleasantly surprised.Thank you and my standing ovation to Jim Carrey. once again he proved that he was very exceptional in the role as a lead actor in comedy films. although the majority of the film's story is comedy, the romance here is also amazing.

A Hilarious and Heartwarming Comedy,"Jim Carrey delivers another stellar performance in ""Yes Man,"" a comedy that will have you laughing out loud from start to finish. Carrey plays Carl Allen, a negative and closed-off man who attends a motivational seminar that challenges him to say ""yes"" to everything for an entire year. What follows is a hilarious and sometimes absurd series of events that will keep you entertained and engaged.Carrey is at his comedic best in this film, delivering his signature physical humor and witty one-liners with ease. His character's transformation from a curmudgeon to a ""yes man"" is both funny and heartwarming, as he embraces new experiences and learns to appreciate the joys of life.The supporting cast, including Zooey Deschanel as Carl's love interest and Bradley Cooper as his friend and mentor, add to the film's humor and heart. The cameos by famous musicians and actors are also a nice touch, adding to the film's overall fun and lighthearted tone.The film's premise of saying ""yes"" to everything leads to some hilarious situations, from Carl's impromptu Korean language class to a wild night of partying with a new friend. But the film also touches on deeper themes, such as the importance of taking risks and embracing change.Overall, ""Yes Man"" is a rally funny comedy that will leave you feeling uplifted and inspired. Jim Carrey's performance is a standout, and the film's message about the power of positivity is both timely and timeless. Whether you're a fan of Carrey's comedy or just looking for a good laugh, ""Yes Man"" is a must-see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great uplifting idea spoilt by completely unnecessary crudeness,"It's a real shame. The premise of this film is about a man who turns his life around for the better. Now normally this can only be a good thing, and Jim Carey does a fine job of portraying the loner and nay-sayer that makes the journey to the eponymous 'Yes Man'. But, and it's a big but, along the way the plot is spoilt by unnecessary crudeness. For example, there is one barely disguised oral sex scene, comments about masturbation and liberally-peppered crude language. Now, I'd have less of a problem watching this film if it had a higher age rating. At least I'd know what to expect, but even my 13-year old boy was looking distinctly uncomfortable throughout. As I said, there really was no need for the crudeness. The story could have stood up completely on its own merits without this tawdry nonsense. A shame, because the rest of it was very good. This family gives it 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Carrey is back with a bang. Yes! Yes! Yes!,"Being a teenager in the 1990's, I have to say I was never a big fan of Jim Carrey's mainstream performances in the movies that made him the star that he is today. Hits like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Liar Liar left me mostly indifferent to Carrey's rather obscene personality. It was only when he shined in more complex roles like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon and eventually Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that I grew to respect the wide range of characters Carrey is able to bring to life.Over recent years, Carrey continued doing his thing, moving from comedy to dramatic roles and vice versa. The problem is that all of the sudden he wasn't alone in the ring anymore, and countless other comedians have tried to slip into his shoes to various degrees of success. There was no place to deny it; Carrey was in need of a hit to re-establish his place in the Hollywood sky.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Average Carrey Comedy,"There's not much to get with a film like 'Yes Man'. It's the kind of vehicle you would have expected from Jim Carrey some ten years ago in the thick of his one-trick pony concept films. It's not a bad movie, and it's actually very entertaining, but it's the sort of movie you forget about ten minutes after walking out of the theater.It's the concept of 'Yes Man' that just screams utter lunacy. A man who says 'yes'. To everything. If he says 'no', awful things will happen. How on earth can a film sustain such a flimsy and empty plot for 100 minutes? Thankfully, 'Yes Man' is so harmless and lofty that Jim Carrey barely has to sell us anything for us to willingly go along with it. He seems right at home here, even if it feels like an attempt to rekindle prior hit machines. Though quite honestly, I'll take this Carrey over 'The Number 23' any day. But after seeing his potential in films like 'Eternal Sunshine', he's better than this.Carrey's routine works well enough to garner a few laughs. Not many, and I really can't recall any gut-busting jokes, but 'Yes Man' will get you chuckling to the point where you won't feel like the money spent was a complete waste. And once again, the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel finds herself in a film that really has nowhere to go. But she makes the best of what the script gives her, and like many of the films she participates in, she's the life of the party. Proving once again that she can also hold a note, 'Yes Man' should have been a better vehicle for her singing career than Carrey's goofball antics.I have perhaps saved the best for last. In case you ever forgot that Warner Bros. does have a stake in this silly thing we like to call Hollywood, 'Yes Man' is practically a 100 minute infomercial advertising their many products. There are no less than a dozen references to all things related to this film's parent studio. And in case you're the subtle type, Warner Bros. doesn't hesitate to hit you over the head with their involvement with 'Harry Potter', '300', 'The Goonies', and yes, even Third Eye Blind. Who were, in case you didn't know, signed onto Warner's music label. So even if 'Yes Man' rings mostly hollow despite its good-natured attempt to teach us a life-affirming message, Warner Bros. has another issue on their agenda. They make movies, and even music, and they hope you don't take the shortcomings of a film like 'Yes Man' too personally.The joke's on us.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Jim Carrey one of the best comedy actors!,"This movie may be one of the 21st-century hits, as Jim Carrey portraits his character in such a brilliant way that, I guess, no other actor can. I think that it takes a considerable amount of talent to play such a significant ""idiotic"" role. Because in essence, Jim's character is dumb and says yes to everything. Well, I know that it is the meaning of the whole movie for him to say yes to everything, but to play such a funny role and to master it is a complicated task. However, Jim Carrey is a great actor as he truly nailed his part, and after this movie, I know that a lot of people remember him by this role.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

If you're a fan of him too and haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you see it as soon as you can. You won't regret it and you'll probably watch it more than once.

Persian people,"To Dear Mr. Reed, I tried to find a direct connection with you, but it seems it's impossible. So I'm writing my comment on this site, hope you would get it and would understand me. I saw the film in it's first night of screen in Pune. It was great, we laughter from the beginning to the end. Actually, I'm a Persian woman, I didn't understand 3 locations in this film. The problem between US and Iran is between the governments not people. Why did you try to make fun of Iranian people. Have you ever seen a common Iranian girl? Or do you have any idea about Persian culture. You know we are against film 300 because it shows such cultural people as barbarian people. and it's not true, even the history of 300 is not true. This is why Iranian blackballed this film, and you used it twice and its hurt us so much. The film was shown on 11pm and the screen had about, let say 40 people in it, watching movie. half of them where Indian, and the rest were from different regions. We were 4 groups of Iranian sitting and watching the film. Without having such idea that it might make fun of us. I think as a director, perhaps you are familiar with the cultures of the different regions, especially, Iran, which is now, in the central point of attention of all the world. I wish I could have your direct email address to send you some picture of the real and actual view of Iran, Iranian, and Persian culture. Anyway, the film was great, I love Jim Carrey, and again he shows his ability on playing on such character again.

Another Jim Carrey Classic,"To put it brief and informative, I'd say ""Yes Man"" is a movie of delightful comedy where there are hardly moments in the film where you aren't laughing. The movie was original or a better word for it would be unpredictable, where humour appears in the most unexpected way. Unlike his earlier comical movies like Bruce Almighty, Ace Ventura and Liar Liar, there is a hint of truth and reality in the storyline where he isn't invincible or abnormal but an average and lethargic pessimist influenced to say yes to anything.In a nutshell, you'll definitely enjoy it if you're a fan of Jim Carrey, and he excels in this role just as he did in the other ones.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An absolute borefest of a movie,"Having just seen this, I can say that this is Jim Carrey at his worst. How he sank to such a low level is beyond me. ""Copper Mountain"" looks like a masterpiece compared to this travesty of a film.I was lucky I got to see this film for free. I was actually dragged along to it by a friend of mine after he scored some free tickets. I really had no intention of seeing it. I kept thinking, what can possibly be fun about a guy who says ""YES"" to everything for a whole year? My suspicions came true at the conclusion of the film. It is obvious that Carrey is struggling in his career (he hasn't had a solid hit for quite some time) and to me, it seems that he sincerely felt that this film would lift him out of ""Washed Up Beach"". I will admit, there was a few funny lines and moments in this film, but they are few and far between.As per usual, Carrey uses his rubber-face and physical comedy for laughs, but it has just the opposite effect. It's sad to see a man pushing 50 prancing around with a big grin slapped on his face.Wait for the DVD - or better yet, wait until it's screened on TV.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Makes you think about yourself.,"The movie itself was fine, had some very funny moments, of course had great actors, especially if you like Jim Carrey. But the thing that really made this movie awesome was the feeling you get afterwards. The whole concept of course was unreal, to say yes to everything, of course in real life that would result in you being in trouble and probably everything would turn worse not better for you. But what you can take away from this movie is the thought of saying ''yes'', when you really don't know what to do, maybe yes or maybe no, made me think about all the opportunities and fun memories i could have had if i said ''yes'' one of those times someone called me or offered me something. How much new people you can meet and how much more new and interesting stuff you can get yourself into if you simply accept the offers you are given.

I laughed until it hurt so much!,"I like Jim Carrey which is a plus anyway, but I laughed almost all of the way through this (it's a love story as well, so there are the usually emotional highs and lows, too, but with Jim's great comic timing, and the inventiveness of the scenarios he finds himself in, make this movie a wonderful piece of comedy genius. It's such a brilliant concept; say yes to everything! Then watch as the comedy unfolds, Carrey style. Try to imagine the things that could happen if you took that vow completely seriously and couldn't say no to anything for a year. At least twice I laughed until I cried and my stomach started to cramp. I personally think that this movie contains some of the funniest scenes ever brought to film. It's definitely a ""see before you die"" movie (if you like Jim Carrey that is); some people might actually die during it if they already have a weak heart or a dodgy vein in the brain, but there are worse ways to go!If you're feeling a bit down in the dumps and need cheering up, then give this one a chance; you won't be down for long! :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Some worst thing happened in this film.,"Unnecessary joke, bad pun, terrible acting, and a lot of cringe moment that pull my teeth onto the gutter. ""Yes Man"" is not the film to worthy for analysed. There something wrong with American culture and its ethic, if you say everything Yes wherever the things you might hate, then you could go on with your life, but the film had some decent message is said Yes or No if you deal something, but in reality, social pressure and some assault will forced you to accept, and that's the film missing this point.Camera angle and editing aren't innovating at the time, the writing wasn't sharp as the knife, couldn't help that Jim Carrey stole the show and makes it better. Some scene were fantastic, but most of them were just play ugly yet unintelligent. If you think this is the factor makes the film unwatchable, then Behold the plot, the and flow makes no sense to me.Why the heck this annoying film could existing, somethings wrong with its screenwriting and the bright attitude for saying ""Yes""?

A Let Down,"I was really hoping Jim Carey would knock this one out of the park and have a really good movie. I understand he actually settled for ""points"" and did not get paid any money upfront for this movie - that's risky, and he should fire his manager. The movie has an interesting concept and good message, but it falls flat for so many reasons. The movie was very contrived, lacked originality, and did not know how far to go with the comedy. Things were conveniently happening just to move the story along even though they were lazily thought up and could have been better. The comedy was not screw-ball enough and failed to capitalize on Carey's strong points. I like Jim Carey, but that's just about all this movie has going for it. This movie is definitely not for the analytical type, because your suspension of disbelief required to enjoy a movie like this would not be met.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You don't have to be a Jim Carrey fan to like this feel-good film,"My wife usually hates Jim Carrey, but she liked this film.

Differs quite a lot from the book, so you can see the film and read the book and enjoy both. The plot isn't too original but the individual episodes are fun to guess about. Watch this if you liked Bruce Almighty ... and stay around for an extra clip during the credits. And take a friend if they stay at home all the time and refuse to come out to have fun ... or at least, buy them this film on DVD. It will do them good ... oh YES!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny and Charming,"Im going to say YES! It's a 10/10.A brilliant movie with such a strong message about how more people should take on life themselves. Jim Carrey, I think, is at his absolute best here. He is his usual self with the comedy side, but also, has the slight more serious role we don't often see.It's a wonderful story with a romantic strong point, but I think it's one everyone can enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Very Funny Movie!,"Yes Man is the last Jim Carrey movie that I feel was really funny. This was the last one that had a great plot to make it an entertaining movie.Carrey plays a man name Carl, who works at a bank and is having trouble saying yes to a lot of things and people. He then joins a seminar that makes him say yes a lot, and he feels this has changed his life. He also meets a beautiful woman, Allison (played by Zooey Deschanel) and they form a relationship. However, later on, things take a turn for the worst as Carl realizes saying yes to particular things get him into trouble.The film's plot (like a lot of people say) is kind of similar to Liar Liar. Liar Liar deals with a guy having trouble being honest and that changes through a son's birthday wish, while this deals with a guy having trouble saying yes and that changes through a seminar. Although the plot is similar and not too original, I still really enjoyed this film.Jim Carrey manages to be funny and had a great performance with Zooey Deschanel, and the pacing for this movie was pretty fast. It wasn't too boring at all.If the plot would of been a little bit more original, than this film would have been a lot better. But, I will say, Yes Man is a great Jim Carrey film to watch for very good laughs and to see Carrey one last time be truly funny and truly rememberable.This is one of my favorite comedy movies of 2008 and it's my 3rd favorite Jim Carrey of all time.

I must say no man,"Okay I'm sorry about the title of my review but I must say no man to the yes man. The first half an hour does a good job setting up the film but then when we finally get to the point where the yes man film is supposed to begin by it doesn't really get going, I mean yes there are a few gimmicks that you would expect from Jim Carey but that's about it. I went to see this film thinking it would be full of the humour Jim Carey's Liar Liar was full of but it's undoubtedly lacked any funniness or when it did they didn't last for very long. So yes man I'm sorry I'm saying no man to this film, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Comedy Masterclass,"Oh gosh this is hilarious. Jim Carrey is at his comedic best, while managing to not be too comedic. He finds the perfect balance between OTT funny and relatable funny, and this is easily one of his best films.The characters are all hilarious, and I was surprised to see John Michael Higgins in this. He's a horribly underrated character actor, and he was pretty funny. Carrey is obviously the best and is just hysterical. Rhys Darby is also too funny as Norman. The movie has a lot of weird comedy moments as is typical of a Carrey film, with just as much unsubtle comedy as subtle.The premise is pretty great. It promises a funny film, and delivers. There's really not much else I can say. It's Jim Carrey, and it's top-shelf comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of my fav comedies of all time!,"This movie is a silly good time, but also has a lot of heart. Jim Carrey delivers another great performance, but you can see how he also has become really good at the dramatic roles too. It has a great supporting cast and wonderful message about how to embrace life and not get caught up in the rat race. I just recently watched it again with my kid (19) and he loved it, that just proves that this film has really held up to the test of time, and the jokes land well with audiences of most ages (probably works best if you have held a job you hate for at least any period of time, definitely not for a younger audience as there is quite a few sex jokes).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Yes and No,"Yes Man is an entertaining movie with a great concept with quality one liners, but lackluster execution. It also has two excellent lead characters thanks to Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel. The problem with Yes Man is that it's a very sloppy movie. There seems to be little basis for a plot, or any direction the movie is supposed to go in general. Some language and scenes were also uncomfortably awkward and unnecessary, only bringing the movie down, leaving a bad aftertaste; Yes Man was clearly borderline rated R.Anyway, the whole movie itself has sparks of brilliance, but may just be too random and ridiculous for its own good, to the point that when its over, you're not quite sure what you just witnessed. It's kind of like the product of an intelligent, creative student starting on a school project the night before its due; there are sparks of brilliance, but they're negated by its own flaws. Yes Man is a weird movie, and I'm not sure whether that's a good or bad thing.My favorite scenes were definitely the ones where Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel are just running around together being spontaneously carefree, because these two actors are great; they clearly carry the movie and are the best and only reasons you should say yes to watching Yes Man. For Jim and Zooey, it's worth a rental, and for them alone.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It's a Carrey Curry,"Some people may find out Jim Carrey is not the same as he was a decade ago but I would say the magic is still there! It's something like you've watched it for at least one and half an hour and you're still expecting something more until the credits start rolling. This Jim Carrey show was no different. Total comedy with a little romantic touch at the end.Now, I would rather prefer not to say anything about the storyline in here, because I believe everybody must laugh at anything Jim Carrey does in this movie without knowing it before. But in a nutshell this movie is about saying ""Yes"" to everything and how everything can fall in place with it (though it's mostly being super lucky!). But again when you ask for laughter/smile/enjoyment for one hour and forty minutes, this movie says the magic ""Yes"" to you.Finally, it is a preparation of Carrey, with Carrey, by Carrey and so it's a perfect Carrey Curry. All the other characters are nothing compared to his.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Plesantly surprised,"When I was thinking about how to fill my evening I stumbled upon this movie and although I wasn't expecting much, I was really surprised.I remember Jim Carrey from his previous well known performances(Ace Ventura...) and although lot of people say that he is already past his acting peak, I disagree. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was a great example of his acting skills and so is this piece. Rest of the cast was great too, Norman actually reminded me of Maurice from IT crowd in a way.Its well worth the time(actually I've seen it twice in a 4 hour time span). I am not saying its especially deep or anything, but it will keep you well entertained through whole duration.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I've been in a slump with films... BUT,"I have been unable to watch films as of late, they just can't grip me enough. Yes Man has changed that and is Jim Carey and a supporting cast working in harmony. It's never going to be a block buster, but the jokes (slapstick esquire/physical for the most part) and feel good factor set this film apart.Zooey Deschanel plays the female lead to a tee, alluring and enticing without it being unsafe for younger people, dad on the other hand...It's a great film, with laughs for anyone that just wants to laugh or just wants to let loose. I could go on about the plot, but, thats not the point of the film, there is one you can follow, and it makes you smile, but some great performances and Carey being his elastic self make this film worth seeing before plot, character development, setting and any other considerations are taken into account.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Concept and Logline,"With an interesting concept and logline, Yes Man is a movie I find myself wanting to turn on regularly. Is it a strong enough movie for multiple rewatches? Not really. Jim Carrey does a good job of playing himself, the supporting cast has some minor standouts and there are a few laugh-worthy moments. Unfortunately, there is a lot of overacting and the plot is very predicable.I would put this movie in the same category as Adam Sandler's Click. An interesting concept with some emotional moments, but ultimately just an immature and forgettable comedy.Best Character: Norman
Best Scene: The Harry Potter party

Formulaic but enjoyable enough,"I wasn't sure what kind of a movie this was when I entered the theater. Based on what I'd heard, I thought it might actually be helpful in finding a new outlook on life, that it might teach new insight, based on the tag line ""One word can change your life.""Well, it didn't. When Carrey's friend tries to introduce him to his new-found freedom by breaking a pane of glass, and the convention guru talks about sexual self-pleasure, I knew the flick wasn't meant to be taken seriously (nor was it well-written. Both scenes were very awkward.).For me, the movie ended when the motor scooter pulled up at the gas station. I felt I knew exactly what was going to happen for the rest of the movie, and I was right. Trouble was, this scene occurs well before the movie is even half over.I sometimes find Carrey's madcap antics annoying, but because he keeps them in check in this film, I found him more enjoyable than usual.

YES MAN (2008) - 18/03/2020,"Jim Carrey is as good and charming as ever, but even he cannot save this film. It's an amusing comedy, but predictable and sluggish, and most of the gags don't quite work. Plus, even though Carrey pulls through with a handful of funny bits, he just doesn't suit the part.

Yes Man: What a Disappointment,"I have always loved Jim Carrey's movies and a good laugh was guaranteed but this movie was so contrived that it was embarrassing. I can honestly say I did not laugh once. If that is what the director calls ""wit"" then he has taken a backward step since ""The Break-Up"" which was moderately funny.The message is a good one but it has been executed so badly that it really becomes cringeworthy at times.

Such a disappointment,"When I see on theaters a Jim Carrey movie, I always get excited 'cause their usually quite interesting and nice, though I haven't seen him yet doing a great performance. ""Yes man"" was just disappointing. Although it could be considered as a good idea, the whole movie ends up failing for having the typical cheap romance comedy structure.There are several elements from the script that are very good (Mocking blockbusters such as Harry Potter and 300, the psychosis of the American government for Carrey's character buying an Arabic wife and learning to fly...) However, it is so obvious that ignorant producers have changed the film, and turned it in a poor romance comedy, a genre that Carrey would have to consider continuing, 'cause the typical character, the single-irresponsible man it's just not for him at his 47 years old. It is time for Carrey to move on and to start doing some real acting.

I Wish......,"I was wishing that Jim would come back to comedy. I wished that YES MAN was gonna be his rise to Comedy King again. My wishes did not come true. Huge fan of the over-the-top Jim of yesterday in hits like Liar Liar, Dumb and Dumber, even Bruce Almighty seemed more on the mark (which I disliked and have since changed my mind after seeing Evan Almighty). Loved him in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Never even bothered with 23. The concept of YES MAN is similar to Liar, Liar but without the constraints that his character had in that movie (which consequently made the humor easier to come by BECAUSE of that) Without a long rant, rave, or negative review....it simply was not that funny. It had funny moments... but with Jim, is that what any of us would really expect? Oddly I do not blame him for this. Hollywood, Jim's agent, whomever....needs to really get a great comedic script that allows Jim to be over-the- top again...something with a great concept or culturally relevant for this time...cause God knows we need at this very time some ""bust at the gut"" laughter. I SOOOOO, wanted this to be good. For Jim to make me laugh to the point where I wasn't worried or thinking about the economy, or jobs, or war.

Most comedies that are aimed to be spirit raising feel-good movies end up promoting some sort of recklessness, risk taking and general individualism. This movie is a prime example. Since when did risking life equal good living?This theme has raised it's head a lot in the recent years, but do these movies really help anyone in the long run?

Had its moments but felt derivative.,"Jim Carrey cemented his reputation as one of the biggest actors in the 1990's with a string of hit comedies. He briefly tried to go serious with dramedies The Truman Show (1998) and Man on the Moon (1999) with moderate success however he tried to branch off with the tearjerker The Majestic (2001) and the dark thriller The Number 23 (2007) however both were not successful. Jim Carrey returns to what he does best with Yes Man. Though Yes Man had some moments, I thought most of the movie reminded me a lot of Liar Liar (1997) in terms of the plot outline thus giving it a very derivative feel.Jim Carrey plays a miserable bank loan officer named Carl Allen who frequently turns down loan applications from clients as well as avoiding his friends Pete (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson) whenever they try to invite him out. Carl has an increasingly negative outlook on life, particularly after divorcing his wife. After being roped into visiting a seminar led by inspirational guru Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp), Carl starts to turn his life around by saying Yes instead of No to things in life. This also leads him to meet a young woman named Allison (Zooey Deschanel) who he also falls in love with.We get to see the Jim Carrey of old in Yes Man however this movie is nothing new here.

It wouldn't kill this guy to say 'no' at least once,"Of all the Jim Carrey films I've seen, I've enjoyed every one, except 'Yes Man'. Here is a potentially good idea for a movie, especially a James Carrey movie, wasted. There are a lot of missed opportunities here. I did enjoy one scene that took place in an airport. But this is an otherwise disappointing movie. Didn't someone have the nerve to tell Jim Carrey to carefully read the script? What the movie boils down to is, that this is just an idea in search of a movie. Jim Carrey (or his character, for that matter) doesn't take any chances. He may say yes, but shouldn't he show it as well? He and Zooey Deschenal exhibit little chemistry (These two have the same birthday in real life, by the way, except for the years). Let's cut to the chase: this guy doesn't look like he's really in a crisis (If that's what he's supposed to be in). It's a mildly entertaining film, but basically, I didn't buy it for a second.

Surely if you turn a book into a movie you need to keep something from the original story, apart from the title?!

I thought it odd to pair him with Deschanel who is young enough to be his daughter, although she at least brings some quirky charm to the proceedings.It's not really a bad film in the grand scheme of things, and there are some funny moments, but for anyone coming to this after reading the book I suggest you prepare for disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The most disturbing part, which is most of the movie, is his relationship with Zooey Deschanel. Jim Carrey is an accomplished actor, a talented and funny guy.

Funny at times but very forgettable overall.,"Yes Man, starring Jim Carrey, is a charming, if unremarkable, story about a man who is unwilling to go out and live his life until he attends a seminar that unveils to him to power of the word yes. Afterwords Carrey is compelled to say yes to every opportunity that presents itself to him. So instead always making excuses and spending his nights alone on the couch watching a DVD from his local video store, Carrey plans an engagement party for his best friend's fiancé, who hates him, learns Korean, takes flying lessons, helps the homeless, hangs shelves for his elderly neighbor, and a host of other things. It's a very similar movie concept to Along Came Polly, A Guy Thing, or Chaos Effect, each tells the story of an unhappy, yet orderly man whose life is turned upside down and eventually improved through comedic spontaneity. The movie is done well enough but there a too few laughs and I found the plot had a great deal of untapped potential. The result is a film that lacks the laughs of other Carrey gems like Liar Liar as well as any real meaning like The Truman Show. Yes Man is watchable but is not very memorable.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Say ""YES!"" but just once for this movie","Yes, it's predictable (extremely.) Yes, it's typical (Carrey.) Yes, it's a rip-off (Liar, Liar.) But, I find the most important ""yes"" is: Yes, it's actually funny and in some scenes genuine and heart-warming.Well, some of it is. It's nice to see Carrey taking on more of an ""adult"" comedy role, not toning down his language humor. So, I found myself laughing a lot in Yes Man.Unfortunately, every time I was laughing, or enjoying myself, it took a dive, whether a very slow-moving scene or an unoriginal idea or just into predictable territory. These were the movie's undoing. Oh, and that the leads (May-December at its best) had zero chemistry. That didn't help either.The nice thing about the movie, unlike Carrey's better movies, Liar, Liar or The Mask, in this one, he's given the ""choice"" to be ""a better man."" So, I liked the so-called realism he finally portrayed.Carl is a definite ""no-man"" in his life or job as a loan officer at a bank. When given the chance to attend a guru's workshop to say ""yes"" to opportunities, he actually attends and tries it out with success. When he does, in fact, say no, coincidentally, bad things happen.There's a lesson to be learned, as in 90% of Carrey's films and predictability, you'll see it coming. Whether in his yes-choices or romance with the typically very good Deschanel (Carl's love interest) but in this case very misplaced. I loved her so much in (500) Days of Summer, but here, she looks so out of place, it's painful on how she tried to be ""perky."" For fans of Carrey's earlier work (Liar, Liar remains my favorite of his comedies) this is worth a viewing. In fact, it's his best comedy since Bruce Almighty (2003) but one of his weakest movies.

The message is better than the movie,"Can you reinvent yourself by saying ""Yes"" instead of ""No""? The movie does not provide a good answer to that interesting question. Most of the time, saying Yes just leads to extreme and nihilistic situations. Would you drive a homeless man at night to his wooden refuge? Why not? Would you give him money? Why not? Would you drive a scooter with a lovely girl? Why not again? With so many opportunities and trusting friends, one can wonder what he (Jim Carrey) was waiting for. Some situations are really charming and insightful, like choosing the first airplane departing the airport. The problem is that leading a life like this is like trying to steer a whirlwind in the proper direction. What is the future of a relationship based on experiencing things, which normally would not happen? Is it possible day after day to do that without exactly leading a very boring life? It is interesting to note that a real engagement, and Jim Carrey is using the word ""Covenant"" in the movie, is a matter of trust and enlightenment. I am personally convinced that being open to life is paramount, but the movie is not about that ""état de grâce"". It is just a collection of funny situations. Basically there is nothing new here, but the simple truth of being a Mensch, that is a responsible and open person in life. And this is a message the movie is delivering with a good purpose.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Yes Man resembles more of a ""Maybe Man"", or a ""Perhaps Man"" leading towards a ""Possibly Man"".","After watching this for the fourth time, one revelation sprung to mind. I miss Jim Carrey's career. Whilst this is not his best comedic outgoing, it's probably one of his most watchable titles. The light comedy paving the way for a predictably mundane romance produces an optimistic outlook on how one should live, but doesn't necessarily exploit its concept fully. A bank loan officer, with an increasingly negative perspective on life, attends a motivational seminar which changes his routinely daily workings to a life of spontaneity, allowing him to meet a new girl in process.How does one obtain the dream girl, you ask? Say ""yes!"" to literally every opportunity. Attend Korean lessons? ""Yes!"". Accept oral sex from an elderly neighbour? ""Sure, why the hell not!"". Drive halfway across the city at the request of a homeless man whilst he drains the battery on your phone and leads you to run out of gas? ""Sign me up!"".The concept of said seminar is to open one's mind at every opportunity presented, not to be a negative Nancy and become an introverted recluse. Let life guide you. Sure, this ethos is somewhat taken to the absurd degree with Carrey instantly shouting ""Yup!"" to all things stupid, but at its core there is a poignant message to be taken from Wallace's memoir of the same name. And that's where this film succeeds in being the eternally watchable comedy that it is. The onslaught of shenanigans that Carrey finds himself jumping into, suits his body comedy. He has always been an exaggerated comedian, and a traditional one at that, who can obtain chuckles from myself by rapidly talking about Red Bull whilst having consumed said beverage. Simple, yet hilariously effective. The hyperactive narrative is perfect for his skittish nature.Where the film falters however, is with the terribly written romance. I have nothing against Zooey ""Look at me, I can't act"" Deschanel, but let's face it, she just cannot express any range of emotion. She is unable to masquerade the one-dimensionality of this forced romance that plagued the story, offering a complete tonal shift from the well-executed comedy. The plot should've focused purely on Carrey's rehabilitation on his perspective on life, not wide-eyed Deschanel. Far too formulaic for my taste. Cooper, despite not being a star back then, was underused. Fortunately Stamp blows everyone out of the negative water with his insatiable positivity. Just him running off the stage and towards the crowd like Sonic the Hedgehog, was enough to make me shout ""Yes!"". Unfortunately, the romance is an overbearing ""No!"".",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Many scenes are laugh out loud funny, especially the first preaching conference. The constant affirmation in the film creates a positive vibe, which is important for a comedy.

"You make me laugh, ha, ha!","The TRAILer of this film made me laugh. That face JC makes, when he's telling the lovely Korean girl (Vivian Bang) that his friend's fiancée hates him, is fantastic and you can tell Vivian is really laughing.A lot of actors/directors believe in letting the comedy of the moment speak for itself via natural acting and that's fine. But it's Carrey's style and gift to make a funny moment funnier by being silly that makes you laugh instead of THINKing about laughing.I like to laugh. I also like to think but I do enough of that on my own. I prefer Jim's comic efforts more than the ""Truman Show"" and ""Eternal Sunshine"" and other more serious efforts. I loved the ""Series Of Unfortunate Events"" which allowed his acting genius to shine, where he could be diverse, dark and comic.Yes, some of Carrey's films are formulaic but whose aren't? It's his ability to break the formula from within the formula that makes him Jim Carrey.Yes, Jim Carrey is getting older. Who isn't? He's still ten thousand times funnier than the geniuses who are saying ""Hey, he's getting older"" as if everyone else is getting younger.The people who made comments about the age difference between JC and Deschanel weren't 20 years old, they were 40 year old female actresses and their beauticians.On the other hand, people are complaining about the octogenarian sex. Was it vital to the plot? No. Did Carl/Jim instigate it? No. Was he a bit repulsed by it? Yes. Was it uncomfortable? Yes. Was it human? Yes. It's unfortunate that old people are still horny, that bankers and governments are corrupt, that humans aren't monogamous- but that's life and life isn't always about the comfortable and politically correct. It's boringly typical that people are upset that an old woman is horny; if it had been an old man, it would have been cliché or ignored. Alan Arkin is horny in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and that's OK but old Tillie is a little bored and randy and it's inappropriate. Old women get horny, too.Zooey Deschanel's anger at Carl's ""yes-ism"" seemed contrived. In a real situation, he should have let her walk and waited till she called him- which she would have in time. Guys- wake up!This is a cute, funny, positive film with a message of life and moderation AND it takes the time to ridicule the terror situation in America. For that reason, if for no other, it should be praised.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Absolute corn ball,"Jim Carry stars in another comedy (what else) that is obviously inspired from Liar Liar, which is was a hilarious comedy released 11 years prior to Yes Man.Jim Carry plays a man named Carl who gets dragged into a convention, full of people who pressure him into becoming a Yes Man. This apparently means that Carl for the good of his life, should say yes to every opportunity in life.This premise leads to Carl saying yes to questions he usually would say no to. Such as giving a homeless man a ride, while also giving him change after the smelly man begged for it.You'd think with Jim Carry there would be comedic energy, unfortunately it's not so. This movie is slow in it's tracks, with Jim Carry acting as if he forgets he's in a comedy.The premise of the movie is tired enough, you'd think an idea like this would lead to funny pay off, but it absolutely doesn't. There's nothing funny about a guy saying yes to an invitation to learn Arabic, which is what happens. Along with other boring scenarios.Like most uninspired comedies, there's a clichéd and very corny love subplot with a woman named Allison. The movie has NO pay off what so ever. Instead, a miserable attempt to patch things up with Carl and Allison as they YOU GUESSED IT, have a misunderstanding.All in all, the movie has only about two laughs and the rest is just boring and dull. The story has every comedy cliché in the book.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
doesn't take advantage of a great opportunity,"Dispirited bank loan officer Carrey is a pessimistic divorcé who never seizes the moment and sticks to his safe, unwavering lifestyle which alienates his friends and virtually everyone around him. Having attended a motivational seminar, he reluctantly enters a covenant to say yes to every opportunity, leading to surprising results (including crossing paths with hip nonconformist Deschanel). You know just by hearing the setup that this creates all sorts of possibilities, and is perfect comic fodder for Carrey (think Liar Liar) who can play zany and outrageous in his sleep, and yet this still lacks a certain spark and never quite takes off the way it should. Director Reed makes a fundamental error by choosing not to fully unleash his lead actor's considerable talents, but it's still pleasing despite the lukewarm results. **½",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Yes! Man!,"Yes! You live your life! That is what this movie is about. If you are already doing it, then you really know your own way to be happy. But there are some people who struggle to find their own freedom, and lock themselves up in prison called Eyes of Society. I am going to give them an inkling that might set themselves free. This is story of Carl who has been living in boredom. He has a negative look on his life, but becoming a ""Yes Man"" changes his life completely. Famous comedy actor Jim Carry played Carl, and he was flawless in the film.Someone like me will have sympathy for Carl because Carl is mirror image of me. Carl has a simple life(such as working every week, buying food, and watching TV then going to bed). Doing the same thing day in, day out gives him ennui. I feel for him. After watching how Carl's life changes I felt the urge to do things that I had in my mind for a long time. Such things like learning how to play piano, taking an acting class, and participating in a tango club on weekend make me feel alive, and satisfied. Money can not buy me these emotions because it never did and never will.I want you to look Carl carefully, and hope that you would feel the same way that I did. If some of you are experiencing this, then I highly recommend you to see this film. If I do something that I want, I always consider what other people might think of me, because I care so much about how people see me. I have been hiding my interests from everyone around me. Apparently I wanted to be a good person. Unfortunately the more I tried, the less I felt happy or satisfied. Carl may have the answer for you, just like he gave it to me.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Say 'Yes' To 'Yes Man'.,"I have been wondering what was up with Jim Carrey. Other than 'Horton Hears A Who' I haven't seen much of his recent stuff. With Peyton Reed's 'Yes Man', Carrey returns to comedy. This may not be among Carrey's best or even funniest movies but it draws enough laughter to keep one entertained. The humour isn't too vulgar (for those who easily get offended). Not surprisingly Carrey does a great acting job. It's quite a mature performance when compared to his other comedic characters. He is brilliantly supported by the luminous Zooey Deschanel, Bradley Cooper, a sensual Molly Sims, a charismatic Terence Stamp and a hilariously horny Fionnula Flanagan. The story idea, about a man saying yes to anything, is amusing and well told but at the same time it's very predictable. Another flaw the obvious age difference between Carrey and Deschanel which is pretty huge. Overall, 'Yes Man' is a lighthearted movie. It remains a feel good comedy that one shouldn't mind saying 'Yes' to.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Yes Man, starred by the famous Jim Carrey -who's not gonna be too comical here -  and the beautiful Zooey Deschanel","Yes Man, starred by the famous Jim Carrey -who's not gonna be too comical here - and the beautiful Zooey Deschanel. Story goes as Carl Allen (Jim Carrey), who was left by his wife years ago, suddenly lost his passion and keep saying 'no' to the world. he even forget his bestfriend's engagement party, take all the chances he got to the garbage can and spend his nights doin nothingbarely nothing'til one day he meet a man who introduce him to a club where all the member just need to say 'yes man' to everything comes ahead. even throwing oneself out of the bridge! Well surrounded by doubt, he simply take it as a nice-treat but not to follow. All of course, before Terence Stamp, founder of 'Yes Man' club makes a 'covenant' with Carl to say YES at every opportunity and Carl hesitantly agreed. So just right after that, our 'no-man' Carl turns to 'yes-man' Carl who'd simply give his money away to a homeless man he met at the street just because the man ask for it.overall i love the way Allison live her life and the way she presenting herself to the worldShe take life as simple as she loves to make a jogging photograph and sing whatever song she likes, going somewhere clueless, just do whatever she likes. my fav Allison quote : ""The world's a playground. You know that when you are a kid, but somewhere along the way everyone forgets it. """,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Maybe to ""Yes Man""","Yes, you have decided to read my film review of Jim Carrey's latest comedy ""Yes, Man"". Good for you, you are taking chances! Because my film reviews are not the standard ones, but they definitely are unique. Jim! Jim! Jim! You are definitely one of my idols! I have been an avid supporter and jovial fan of all your films; including the drama ones. I have said ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" every time in dishing out the admission fee to check out your Carreyisms in your flicks. But Mr. Carrey, almighty Mr. Carrey, it causes me profound pain to say this but ""Yes, Man"" is a No for me compared to your other comedic masterpieces. Carrey plays Carl Allen, a compulsive ""nosayer"" who decides to turn and join the ""Yes Club For Men"" after attending a motivational seminar. Carl then goes berserk with the yeses. He will say yes to just about anything and anyone. He then meets cutie Allison, lifelessly played by Zooey Deschanel, who he desires the most important yes from. For a few initial scenes, the yes scenes were comical; but then Carrey gets carried away with them and it overextends their yes welcome. The plot line of ""Yes, Man"" is similar to Carrey's classic ""Liar, Liar"", but the similarities cease there. ""Liar, Liar"" was a laugh riot contrary to the underdeveloped or maybe one can argue overdeveloped ""Yes, Man""; and that is no lie! Director Peyton Reed did not develop enough creative comedic ingenuity in ""Yes, Man"" to be considered ""The Reeder"" of the comedy directorial parade this year. Screenwriters Nicholas Stoller and Jarred Paul were in ""No Man's Land"" while writing the mediocre script of ""Yes, Man"". However, I must say ""yes, man"" to Rhys Darby's hilarious turn as Carl's colleague Norman. And I also mildly enjoyed other supporting turns from John Michael Higgins playing a ""yes"" motivational recruiter and Terence Stamp playing a motivational speaker. Those aforementioned supporting performances and a few hilarious gags from Carrey, I guess motivated me enough to give ""Yes, Man"" a borderline ""Yes"" recommendation; but not by much. *** Average",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a little of Jim Carrey goes a long way,"I feel really ashamed of myself for going to see this film and wish I could have my money and the two wasted hours back. What was I thinking. It just amazes me that one could get so far on so little talent as Jim Carrey. I enjoyed Ace Ventura, The Mask and Dumb And Dumber, but his act wears thin and gets old very quickly. People have made him out to be a comic genius but this just isn't the case. He breaks no new ground here and there really isn't a lot of laughs. The young actress who plays his love interest does a fine job but they don't have real chemistry. Its like she just cannot wait for the take to be over just to get away from him. I also wanted to mention Patrick Laborteaux's part in this film. He was on Little House On The Prarie as a kid and was Bud on JAG (one of my favorite shows, he and Karri Turner were so wonderful together). Karri Turner has had only two bit parts in films since JAG was canceled and Patrick Laborteaux only has a 40 second spot in this film. What a letdown. To go from being on one of television's most beloved shows to bit parts. How sad. Anyway the bottom line to my review is to avoid this movie like the plague. I think a great way to sum it up is simply ""Say no to Yes Man"".",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
