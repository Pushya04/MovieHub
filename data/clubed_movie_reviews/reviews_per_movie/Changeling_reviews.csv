"Wow, Talk About A Film That Hooks You In!","Wow, is this an involving story. It hooks you in fast and really grabs hold. It's very good in that aspect because it really makes you care about what happens. The story involves a parent's worst nightmare, so I would expect moms and dads to be particularly horrified. The movie manipulates, no doubt being overdone here and there, but it's generally effective.Angelina Jolie does a superb job of portraying a Los Angeles woman (""Christine Collins"") in the late 1920s whose boy is kidnapped. Five months later, the ""proud"" police department brings her kid back, making it a good PR session. Unfortunately, it's not her kid and stupidly, although she's naturally upset about, she poses with the kid and takes him home. (Would that really happen?).Then she begins her quest of finding her real ""Walter."" Further twists and turns make the story increasingly horrifying. In all, you won't be able to keep your eyes off the screen wondering if justice will ever prevail in the end and who exactly is involved in what. It's not particularly a fun ride - you'll have a frown on your face for quite some time - but it sure is interesting and an excellent two hour-plus of entertainment. By the end, you'll be emotionally exhausted.Kudos to all the actors in here for riveting performances and to the production and design team for a great period piece. Where else can you feel you're back 75-80 years in time with the boxy cars and flapper hats than in movies?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting period piece,"Watching this film is like taking a look back in time. Everything is picture perfect, the beautiful automobiles, the red electric street cars, the telephones, the switchboard station with roller-skating supervisors, the house appliances, and the outstanding clothing, from dresses to hats to police uniforms, everything is meticulously detailed. The story, which we are told is true, is complex and multifaceted. Angelina Jolie, who plays Christine Collins, gives an outstanding performance as a single mother who returns home from work to find that her son is missing. This puts into motion a series of events that exposes the reality of what Los Angeles society was really like in the late 1920's. Corrupt Police, uncaring and self absorbed mental health professionals and the basic premise that people left to their own ambitions will do anything to secure their own prosperity. Although this paints a bleak picture of the human condition, the film show that the actions of a few good men can make a world of difference, John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, is determined to expose the corrupt Police in his radio talk show, Michael Kelly as detective Lester Ybarra, although hampered by his superiors, uncovers what really happened to the boy and the unlikely hero, a powerful attorney who takes her case pro-bono comes to her rescue. If indeed this is a true story, then to see these people stand up to the powers that be is a ray of hope to all of us that there were people who were strong and principled. We can only hope that there are still people like that out there today.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Grueling and scary search for truth.,"Changeling - In 1928, Single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) returns home one day to discover her nine-year-old son, Walter, is missing. She calls the police and, after enduring a grueling 24 hours, they search for her son. But the boy they return to her is not her son. After confronting corrupt city authorities, Collins is vilified as an unfit mother and sent to an asylum.This is a grueling film to watch. I have not felt this hideous since North Country, a film which also dealt with misogyny within the power structure. Women are treated as fragile, emotional, and not believable. This film tackles corruption to boot, as the LAPD is accused of being a gang of thugs that answer to no one. Eastwood is old school with the violence, understanding that the mind can fill in the very brutal gaps.Angelina Jolie delivers another great performance. But unlike A Mighty Heart, this film actually deserves her presence. I don't think she really should have so much press coverage, but there is definitely reason for her acclaim as an actress. The situation her character goes through is so surreal and the film captures it perfectly. It gives you chills from the second Christine is given this pretender to raise and rarely lets up. And if for one moment you tell yourself ""It's just a movie"" as I tried to, this s*** actually happened. Characters were composited or changed, a disclaimer at the end states, but the events were the same.An odd praise goes out to Jason Butler Harner, who plays Gordon Northcott, a kidnapper and murderer of many children. He has played one of the monsters of everyone's nightmares to perfection. Also of note is Jeffrey Donovan for his portrayal of J. J. Jones, corruption personified. Jones is a man able to whisk people away to asylums with no need of warrants. Scary indeed.Changeling shares a theme with several of Clint Eastwood's other films. Unforgiven and Flags of Our Fathers come most readily to mind. His lesson concerns truth and lies, and exposing the hypocrisy of falsehoods for want of the truth. The truth is rarely pretty, but generally preferable to lies, and will often come to surface, if given enough time. I doubt I will watch this struggle for truth for a long time to come (it's not one for casual viewing), but it's a very good film.A-",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfection,"Although I loved Clint Eastwood very much as an actor, I have to admit that I appreciate him even more as a director because this man does not use the standard Hollywood tricks. He just knows to tell a good story, using only good a script and great acting. ""Changeling"" is the story woman's battle with the police and the system, and an indeed fascinating tribute to commitment of a person to break the corruption, cover-up and the excavation to find her child that she got taken from her. The film has few explicit scenes and an atmosphere that is really tough to follow. There is really a lot going on in this emotionally difficult and fantastically filmed movie, definitely worth your time and attention. A masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Eastwood and Angeline deliver a strong punch,"There is nothing more reliable than Eastwood behind the camera, with his assured touch his films are never boring or deliberately confusing, hiding technical devices or special effects that detract from the most important part of movie making: a good screenplay, a good story, good acting. For the past 10 years, many films have been unduly praised because they have one or two great performances, unfairly leaving many good and deserving movies without the recognition they deserved. Eastwood has however, given us the whole package time after time, with movies as varied as ""Mystic River"", ""Letters"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and now ""Changeling"". True, there is a link, they are all strong films, with themes that deal with pain and loss, but the stories are different, the settings require an amazing attention to detail, what they all share is a strong focus, and interestingly enough, superb performances.Eastwood has paved the way to acting honors for Penn, Freeman, Swank, Hackman, and others that were continuously ignored by the Academy. There is no denying the power of their performances in Eastwood's movies, and that leads to the center of this film: Jolie. I read recently that her performance has been attacked as being affected and the attempt of a star to look normal. Putting aside those silly and biased remarks, let's state something clearly, the lady has given us a fantastic tour de force, proving that she can be both a star when looking at the other cameras, but that when she is working for a director, she gives her best, regardless of what our perception of her private life might be. If you are a critic with a personal disapproval of that persona, keep it to yourself, concentrate on the film and the work of the performer.As the mother who desperately wants the truth about her child, Angelina is flawless. We can read the pain in her eyes, the determination and the disturbing reality that her obsession might be having unexpected results, but one thing is clear, there is a drive that won't quit, and it's admirable for those of us who want her to be reunited with her child, and it's quite inconvenient for the people who have other interests at hand.Her battle with the folks at LAPD is of epic proportions, and it is amazing that she held on to her goal of exposing the corruption that she encountered as she searched for her missing boy. There are some horrific moments in the film, as we relieve some of the injustices and Gothic horror of places like the hospital in this film. There are also some background scene that might or not reveal what really happen. There are moments when one is a bit exhausted from all the information the film delivers, but every moment is worth it. It is all framed with an expert hand, and it is anchored by the very powerful work by Jolie and the rest of an amazing cast that brings to life emotions such as madness, anger, pain, sorrow, and many times, disbelief that humans can be capable of such terrible actions.The film contains amazing production values, as we are taken back to an era that doesn't exist anymore. The recreation of the time Los Angeles was on its way to being a real city is incredible, as we see it before it fell apart and spread all over a gigantic geographical area, losing its identity. The musical score is a sweet melody that hints at the love and pain themes in the film, and there are some moments bound to become classic, as children tell the stories that adults might not want to face or believe.All in all, ""Changeling"" may be very difficult to sit through, but it is not less impressive, effective or good than any of the last five films Eastwood has made. As a matter of fact, it's just one masterpiece from the man who could teach Hollywood a few lessons.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
WOW......SAD BUT WOW,"Heartbreaking yet captivating, Changeling's story was fascinating all the way through, even if the first half was a little slow. It certainly was a compelling story, shot beautifully, and written well. Angelina Jolie gave a mesmerizing performance as grief stricken Christine Collins, as well as the many young actors in the film. It's certainly worth the time.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Terrific Film!,"Changeling is the new film from director Clint Eastwood. It is based on a true story that takes place in 1928 L.A.The story is about a woman who returns home one day to find her son missing. Then a few months later the police return a child to her, but it isn't her son. The woman keeps on telling everyone that this child isn't her son, but the police keep on claiming that it is her son and are calling the woman crazy.The film is a wonderful study about police corruption in L.A. in the late 1920s. The film is emotionally gripping, and at times disturbing.The film was superbly directed by Clint Eastwood, who was working from a terrific script by J. Michael Straczynski. Not only that, but Eastwood also wrote the film's score, which was very good as well. Of course the acting is what truly stole the show for me. Angelina Jolie delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the mother of the missing child, but what truly surprised me was how good these children in the cast were. All of the child actors were very well cast and all delivered amazing performances.As a whole Eastwood's Changeling is one of the best films of the year, and should be up for some big-time Oscars at year's end.A perfect 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The critics are nuts.  This film is outstanding.,"When my wife and I first heard that another Eastwood film was coming out, we planned to see it. Then we read unremitting negative comments by the critics, so we hesitated. We decided to see the film anyway because we have liked everything Eastwood has directed, and we knew that some of the cast were fine actors. Wow, are we glad we stuck with our first instinct. The film is excellent.The critics panned the script, by J. Michael Straczynski. One critic mentioned that Straz wrote Babylon 5 and suggested that was reason enough to expect this script to be bad. In fact, Babylon 5 was very good, and so is the script for this movie. Critics complained about Eastwood's directing, but the directing was fine. Some of the critics complained about the acting, but in fact the acting is flawless. My general impression of critics has been strongly reinforced: they typically are shallow and self-important windbags trying to show off how smart and sophisticated they are. They should be ignored.The story itself is sad, uplifting, disturbing, and bittersweet all at the same time. It is, sad to say, a true story.The characters come across as real people, as is typical for Eastwood's films. Every single actor delivers exactly the right performance for the role being played. Indeed, the acting is the best part of this movie, though I do not mean to diminish any other aspect of the film by saying that. There are several children in the film who have significant parts, often with lines that must convey genuine emotions of fear or remorse. Not easy stuff for a kid to get right, yet all of them do their jobs very well. That is partly a tribute to Eastwood's directing, showing his ability to elicit strong performances from his actors.There is no point listing every actor here and praising their performances one by one. They were all outstanding. I will single out Angelina Jolie for special mention, though. She is the main character, and her performance is simply superb. Her range of emotions is truly remarkable. What a fine actress she is.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
And the Oscar goes to...,"Angelina Jolie, for outstanding performance in Changeling.Wow, I think I need to calm down a bit. I was skeptic at first to see this movie but I don't regret spending 900 króna's (I'm from Iceland so that's very expensive) on a movie ticket to see the best movie I've seen in a long time. And I encourage everyone to do the same, go see Changeling.This movie has everything; a terrific story based on true events, outstanding acting from everyone of the cast, excitement, tears, blood and it holds you tight until the end. And I won't forget the magic behind the camera provided by the genius Clint Eastwood.Angelina's character is terrific and she fights, what seems to be at first a lost fight, for her son in a world controlled by men. You learn to hate some characters in the movie and love others. You learn to feel for Angelina's character and hope the movie ends well. Changeling will make you cry and when you walk out of the theater after this fantastic film you feel both good and satisfied.Angelina was so good and convincing in this movie that I could not believe my own eyes and ears. And John Malkovich was very good too but Angelina is the rock of this movie. She carries it on her shoulders and Clint Eastwood directs her like...like...I don't know what to write anymore, I'm still calming down. I'm going to stop now and finish the review with these two sentences: If Angelina Jolie gets an Oscar nomination for her acting she deserves to win. Just go see Changeling and Angelina's acting will blow your mind.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
CHANGELING puts Eastwood in the same ballpark as Ron Howard.,"Eastwood doesn't know the meaning of the word ""subtle"". He always makes sure the dimmest person in the audience is never in doubt of which characters are 100% good and which ones are 100% evil. Every single employee at the psych hospital acts like they're villains in a Superman comic book. With the exception of Jolie, the film was filled with MOVIE characters, not real people.The irony is that this is a true story, yet I never believed a minute of Eastwood's film. He had a fascinating story to work with, and I'm glad to know the story, but as a film it was little better than a made-for-TV movie. He seems to be afraid of challenging his audience, so he ends up insulting our intelligence. At the end he spoon-feeds us even our emotional response, making it clear that we're supposed to feel good about the outcome, even though, when you think about it, it's really not a happy ending.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
An interesting story told well.,"Christine Collins: ""The boy they brought back is not my son.""ClintEastwood s knows a good story, and he knows how to tell it on film. Not everything he does is as powerful as his depiction of a dynamic female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, for which Hilary Swank won a best actress Oscar among four for the film. In Changeling he presents another strong woman, Christine Collins, played by the notable Angelina Jolie. Because she is directed to weep at almost every turn and regularly underplay her grit, Jolie won't win accolades, nor will Eastwood rack up the nominations as he frequently does in Oscar season. But his adaptation of the historic Wineville Chicken Murders chills with his perceptions about the capriciousness of crime and the determination of those who choose to fight it.In a Prohibition-era 1928, Collins gets word that the Los Angeles Police Department is returning her kidnapped eight-year old son. When she sees him at the station, a finely directed sequence showing the forces of motherhood and politics clash, she knows it is not her child. LAPD, needing the good publicity, forces her to take the boy overnight with the logic that she is merely in shock. The rest of this overly long thriller carefully traces the discoveries leading to resolutions and disappointments. Along the way, police corruption is exposed, mental institution incarceration of women is laid bare, and grisly serial murdering is slowly detailed.Yet in this discursive narrative, Eastwood indulges himself beyond Jolie's annoying crying by gratuitously laboring over the details of an execution. The stark San Quentin setting is ghastly and the villain worthy except for the film's obvious criticism of false mental institution lockup, ironic here because this murderer is clearly deranged enough to be determined unfit for trial.As in every Eastwood production, the values are first-rate, in this case period costuming and vehicles (those Model T's and trolley cars are beautiful). As in Mystic River, Eastwood knows how to splice family and community together in the struggle against organized crime, from street violence to public service malpractice. The activist preacher Reverend Briegleb (John Malkovich) helps bring the worlds together in his radio broadcasts, Malkovich for once playing good well. Eastwood continues to be the director of choice for depicting crimes and heartaches that strike the common citizen at will.We all should be as productive in our later years. May he extend well beyond his golf-playing days and into our future.",,Anonymous,Biography
This is an underrated gem that's an absolute must see,"Changeling (2008) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a single mother whose son is kidnapped. As she works to discover what happened to her son she discovers she's not the only one missing a child. Meanwhile the government wants the case to go away so they give her a child and claims it's her...but he isn't. How will she convince others the child they gave her isn't hers and what happened to her son?This movie is directed by Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby) and stars Angelina Jolie (Hackers), Colm Feore (Chicago), Gattlin Griffith (The Boys), John Malkovich (In the Line of Fire) and Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone).While this is more of a drama than horror there's definitely horror elements sprinkled in here. The horrors of a mother being forced to care for a kid that isn't hers. The terror of being a woman struggling for a voice within American society. The horrors of having your child taken from you and the mind of someone who would steal children.Everything about this movie is so well done. The acting is out of this world and Jolie delivers an Oscar worthy performance. The era is brilliantly depicted in every way - the attire, settings and cinematography were all perfect. The depiction of the US, which hasn't changed much, is also well done. The film unveils several scary aspects of American society and how we deal with things.Overall this is an underrated gem that's an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Brilliantly executed and finally a performance I appreciate from Angelina. Also stellar performances by John Malkovich, as well as Amy Ryan, Jeffrey Donovan, Michael Kelly, and others. This film drives it home which any parent can appreciate and will remember for some time.This is not your typical drama, but also a suspense filled thriller that had people in the theater crying, clapping, and closing their eyes.Still need to see The Wrestler, and The road, but as of October 2008, CHANGELING best picture, and very possible, Best Actress Angelina Jolie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A tale of two evils...,"Typical Eastwood fare here - serious subject, recent history period drama, bleak outlook with a touch of redemption for the leads at the end, this was nevertheless a powerful, engrossing expose of what passed for good policing in late 20's America.Taking the film at face value, this was a convincing depiction of pre-Depression America, with some great details - the roller-skating supervising in the telephone company by Angeline Jolie's Caroline Collins character in particular was a neat period-defining touch, whilst good use is made of exterior locations, at psychopathic murderer Northcott's ""chicken-coop"" location, the train station where Jolie is ""reunited"" with her supposed son and the recreation of her suburban neighbourhood equally with the interiors at the grisly ""psychiatric hospital"" where Jolie is incarcerated, as well as the courtroom, police station and even the inside of Jolie's house. Atmosphere and realism are inset from the outset.The story, almost unbelievable in its premise, but bolstered by the ""based on a true story"" legend over the opening titles (I'll research its claim later!) makes for tense and at times unbearable viewing as Jolie's Kafka-type nightmare almost fully envelops her and only comes into the light with the aid of an anti-corruption radio evangelist preacher and a cop who finally does his job right and actually listens to the crucial witness testimony of Northcott's unwilling teenage accomplice.The film however suffers a bit from being overlong in places, symptomatic of Eastwood's typical slow-paced style and there appear to be three or four endings tagged on one after the other, each good enough in itself to close the film before the credits roll. I also didn't feel the dual-trial scenes worked together, Eastwood possibly posting the question about just who the bigger villains actually were here, the psychopathic killer who completely believes in Jolie or the back-covering inhumanity of the Chief of Police and his chief officer who think nothing of foisting an impostor on a traumatised mother and then unbelievably throw her into a ruthlessly run psychiatric hospital to hush her protests.The acting is of a high standard. Early on, I did find Jolie a bit showy in her performance but she learns the less is more maxim as the film progresses, particularly as she descends into the bedlam of her psychiatric treatment where she witnesses and suffers almost inhuman cruelty and deprivation, before her release which sees her thence-forward display a telling stoic dignity in her pursuit of the truth. It's very much her film, although the support is strong in almost every other part too.Eastwood is now very settled in his style and any viewer knows they're not going to be jolted out of their seat by anything put in their way. His skill is in story-telling and here again, with the aid of fine cinematography and an effective soundtrack of his own composition, he delivers a shocking story in a credible and persuasive way to keep you rooted, most of the time anyway, in your seat for its 160 minute duration.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Harrowing, poignant, gripping and unforgettable film- Jolie is mesmerising!","From Clint Eastwood comes a harrowing, poignant, gripping and somewhat beautiful and unforgettable film. At 140 minutes or so, the pace surprisingly doesn't lag so I didn't feel bored watching this. The true story about a mother whose son vanishes without a trace, and her quest for the truth is gripping and shown here in an intelligent and thought-provoking way. While some parts are poignant, there are also parts that are truly harrowing, like when Christine is sedated, the tense cortroom scenes, the strong violence shown in the film or the screams of the convicted man when he is approaching the hangman's noose.The direction from Eastwood is assured and attentive, the music is haunting and of true beauty in some spots and the script is nuanced and beautifully written. The period detail is indeed sumptuous, with scenery, costumes and settings making it look all authentic and beautiful, all captured perfectly by the brilliant cinematography. And the performances were nothing short of astonishing, with Angelina Jolie giving possibly her best performance in a mesmerising lead performance, and John Malkovich also very impressive. Overall, a beautiful and captivating film, much better than I thought it would be. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies of 08'!!,"Angelina Jolie gives her best performance of her career. While Jolie shows her beauty and classy looks her, she was absolutely picture perfect for the role of the brave, strong & emotional Christina Collins. I praise Clint Eastwood for making this movie and casting great talented actors for supporting: John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffery Donovan and Jason Butler Harner gives one of the best supporting role performances in a movie. Changeling is beautiful, heartfelt, haunting and amazing brilliant film that captured my heart and made me feel so bad of what happened to Christina Collins. Not only the movie is so amazing, it sends a strong message about how brave single mothers are and would give their life away if their child was found missing or taken. Angelina Jolie did that without overacting, she did everything an actress could do to give the Oscars a hard time and give them some second thoughts of who they would choose. I've seen this three times and I'm very sure that Angelina Jolie deserves the Oscar more than Streep, Winslet, Leo & Hathaway. She was the better of the five, in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
LA Changing,"Clint Eastwood continues his glittering directorial second coming with Changeling. While Angelina Jolie is perhaps better known for her more ""commercial"" performances (with the possible exception of A Mighty Heart), here is a clearly well-deserved Oscar nomination. The movie is about a single mother and her boy that goes missing and her search for that boy. In the course of that search, many wrongs are righted  the LAPD is reformed, laws regarding detention without sufficient evidence are passed, a serial killer is unearthed and executed, a boy returns to his family.

"Not Eastwood's best, but better than most.","Clint Eastwood is one of the legends of the silver screen, from his humble beginnings as the Man With No Name in Sergio Leone westerns to Dirty Harry the kick-butt cop. As a director, he has given us some of the finest stories we could ever see, including the Oscar-winning Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, and the war epic twins Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. With his new film, he explores the dark side of the earlier part of the twentieth century in Tinseltown (Los Angeles). Taken from true events, the story unfolds that a single mother Christine Collins has lost her nine-year old son, Walter. She asks the LAPD to intervene, and about two months later, her son is returned. Then, she says it isn't her son. She never looks back.From the moment the young boy steps off the train, Christine insists to everyone that he is not her son. Unfortunately, the police say she is delusional and just upset. The films leads to the truth of the matter, which is that the corruption in the department has led to them being lackadaisical in their duties. The story moves along fluidly, yet we are never really told the reason that corruption resides.Nevertheless, the film is quite an experience. It looks terrific and really feels like the 1920s in Los Angeles. Angelina Jolie is solid as Christine, yet I felt she seemed more whiny at times than desperate. It just didn't move me as strongly as Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The supporting cast is good as well, especially John Malkovich as the pastor eager to help Christine in the fight against the LAPD. What I really wanted was that emotional pull that Eastwood's other films had. This one seemed a bit cold and ruthless, despite that being its subject material. So, I would say to go and see it; it is definitely worth the 140 minutes. As for Oscar time, I can't say for sure that it will wrap up the big ones such as Best Picture, Director or Actress. It wasn't the strongest campaign I've seen, but then again this has been a weaker year than 2007.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely hard to watch--think twice before you see this emotionally draining film.,"My summary is NOT to discourage you from watching the film--just to encourage you to think before you watch it. If you are easily disturbed or a child--by all means DON'T watch this movie. It earned its R-rating because it is so incredibly disturbing--very disturbing!!I was very surprised to see that this film was based on a real case that I had never heard about and which was apparently pretty much forgotten until the brilliant writer, J. Michael Straczynski learned of the case. A mother (Angelina Jolie) is called away to work and leaves her young son home along back in 1928. When she returns, the child is gone--with absolutely no trace of him. Five months later, a child is located in Illinois and brought back to the mother--but the child is NOT hers!! It seems that the LA Police are so intent on closing the case that they push a child in her lap and demand she accept it--even though the boy is now 3 inches shorter and has been circumcise!!! Insane as it all is, when she complains, the police try to sweep it all under the rug by shoving her into a mental asylum--which is more like a chamber of horrors than anything else!. There is much more to the story than this--a much darker and more disturbing plot than just seeing the inside of the mental hospital. But, because I don't want to spoil the plot, I'll say no more about this.The film excels in almost every way. Aside from a bit of dialog that seemed anachronistic, the film gets very high marks for an excellent script, wonderful directions, a great performance by Miss Jolie and great music--written by the director, Clint Eastwood. One other thing I loved about the film was John Malovich's character. He played a radio preacher who was NOT some hypocritical, evil self-aggrandizer--as so many preachers are portrayed in films. Instead, he was a good man and important to the plot--thanks for a positive portrayal instead of a clichéd attack on ministers! See this film--just be prepared for some horrifying images and themes.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Quite good, if disappointing","After a warm reception at Cannes, the US critics were not nearly as kind to Clint Eastwood's 2008 effort ""Changeling"". One of the most commonly used phrases in attacking the film was 'Oscar bait'. There have to be few dumber labels used by critics than that. I think it does apply to a few movies here and there, but it has become so commonly used for anything which might appeal to the Academy voters, and Eastwood's classicist tendencies happen to fall into that category. That plus the fact that the Academy seems to love Eastwood's recent output made ""Changeling"" the target of countless accusations of Oscar baiting. It's disappointing, and indicative of a genuine lack of quality in American film criticism.If you go into ""Changeling"" expecting a fairly long, nearly completely black-and-white dramatization of real events, I can't imagine why you would be very disappointed. The script by J. Michael Straczynski, the man behind the great ""Babylon 5"", displays his talent for writing great dialogue (albeit rarely very realistic dialogue) and his extraordinary storytelling ability. The film's first half hour is the least interesting, I thought, but almost everything after that was quite enthralling and entertaining, and really all you should know going in is that Christine Collins' (played by Jolie) child goes missing, then the LAPD returns another child to her which isn't her actual son. On the side of good we have the aforementioned Inspector Ybarra, Collins herself, a reverend devoted to fighting corruption (played by John Malkovich), and on the side of bad we have the police chief Davis and the main bad guy (for the majority of the film anyhow) Capt. Jones, played superbly by Jeffrey Donovan in one of his first major film roles.""Changeling"" is very clearly a dramatization. There's plenty of melodrama and the script feels convoluted at times (although Straczynski's storytelling ability had me going along with everything, rarely giving me time to dwell on stuff which annoyed me. Much of the film takes on a feminist feel, something which I hadn't really expected. I really ended up liking this sprawling and admittedly flawed script quite a bit, especially when it focused on Inspector Ybarra and his findings (which I won't discuss in detail). Where I disagreed with many critics and audience members is Jolie's performance. It's occasionally just right, but a lot of the time ends up being hysterically over-emotive or, as I suspected, infected with the typical air of smugness Jolie exudes. If anything's Oscar bait here it's Jolie.Aside from the very good script and generally excellent performances, Tom Stern's photography and Eastwood's direction and music are absolutely superb, along with basically all other technical aspects, particularly the phenomenal design. The film is always great to look at, but there's one or two scenes where it's just beautiful.""Changeling"" is the sort of good vs. bad story we don't get often, and when we do get one it's often poor and ridiculously contrived. There may be contrivances here, some of it might be over-written, and Jolie may have grated on me occasionally, but the film is ultimately worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Biography
As usual... Clint Eastwood as director is a secure bet.,"I have to admit that I've always liked Clint Eastwood as a director. He never lets me down and ""Changeling"" it isn't been an exception. At the same time I'm not a fun of Angelina Jolie but I have to admit I had to like her this time (not sure as everybody say worth an Oscar, but really good acting).Based in real event, and knowing what is this film about, means is gonna be a super-drama and it's.I always said that a good movie, liked or not, makes you feel things. And this one delivers Frustration, rage, impotence and shame and at the same time overcoming, hope and a deserved final justice.Great directing and acting, not just Angelina Jolie, all the cast. Superb recreation (portrait) of LA city and society in the 30-40's.Just mention is 137 min long and under my point of view the last 20/30 min could be taken out. Doesn't contribute at all in the story and the truth is, after the trial, it becomes slower and a bit pointless.Anyway, I can't wait to watch ""Gran Torino"".Overall a fair 7.5/10 and a well worth drama to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Do not Do No listen to the critics,"Although I have to say that this isn't the best movie I have ever seen, I can say that this is a very good movie and one of the best of the year. Clint Eastwood continues to prove that he is a director that is large and in charge, and one can see that in the direction of this movie. In my opinion, there weren't any standout performances except for ANGELINA JOLIE. She made sure that she was the standout and that she is a force to be reckoned with. One could feel her pain and anguish as she goes through the trials of looking for her son. She totally captured the role and trust me it deserves an Oscar nomination. I don't know if she will get the win, but she definitely deserves the nomination. Her compassion and pain can be felt by the viewer and if you can't feel it while watching this movie, then you have no feelings. The movie did get off to a slow start, but once it picks up, it continues to bring on the excitement. Some scenes were hard to watch, but Clint's excellent direction keeps the viewer engaged and one can't help but go through the emotions. Overall, a good film, but there were a few glitches that could have made this movie ""excellently superb."" I recommend seeing this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Very, Very, Good Movie.",You must go see this movie. YOU MUST GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! I'll admit I didn't know what to expect when my wife asked me to go to this movie. And of course having Jolie in it she didn't have to twist my arm to much. We had to go out of town to see it because our local theater wasn't showing it. The acting by Jolie was great. Eastwood's direction was great. And the 20's and 30's look to the movie was so realistic. I learned some things about this time frame by watching this movie. So not only did I enjoy the movie I learned a little bit along the way. This is a Rated R movie so I wouldn't take kids to it because there are a couple disturbing moments in the movie. If this movie doesn't get some Oscar nominations I will be very surprised. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A harrowing and emotional drama that shows corruption, yet it has us all seeing hope in the end.","""Changeling"" is a well done drama that is styled perfect to form as an emotional mystery from legendary Clint Eastwood(who once again proves he's a fantastic director). Based on a real life case that actually happened Eastwood as a director captures the time period just perfect with the backgrounds of the 20's and his musical scores set up each scene just perfect, once again it's fabulous work from Mr. tough guy.Anyway it's 1928 in Los Angeles, California and Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie)who's a single mother who's making ends meet by working as a telephone telegraph line supervisor enjoys life. Her main love of life and reason to live for though is her precious son Walter(Gattlin Griffith). Then all of a sudden her world comes crashing down after she returns home form work one evening to find that Walter has suddenly vanished. This is only the start of a hellish nightmare for Christine, as this film takes on a new path of it's own as the main spotlight showcased is the incompetence and corruption of the L.A. police department. From the way the case is first handled only to really take a tailspin when they claim they have found the son of Ms. Collins only she clearly sees this is not her son.""Changeling"" is also a good spotlight to show how authority does not like to meet questions and provide answers as this is the case when Christine is forced to take a boy who clearly isn't hers. It only worsens when she questions the manner and tries to stand up for answers as we the audience see the film take off on more of a cruel and emotional grind as Christine is subjected to punishment that she doesn't deserve by being institutionalized and at the same time being threatened with more and more intimidation. As you watch you really have to hand it to Jolie her performance is in top form and emotionally heartfelt maybe the best of her acting jobs.Good supporting work is found in local Rev. Briegleb(John Malkovich)who's one of the few to fight for Christine as he knows all about the history of the corruption of the L.A.PD as it's with his help that some justice in a moral sense is obtained. Only the film takes on more of a mystery direction in which we as the viewer see some justice has been served, yet we really don't feel any closure except the fact that corruption and abuse of power has finally been exposed and it showed the real L.A. police.Overall well done film by Clint the setting and mood is emotional and it searches for truth and justice, and Angelina's performance is probably the best work of her time she's really into her role both mentally and spiritually. Really it's how you as the viewer see it sure it provided some justice, yet the closure was somewhat of a letdown only as with the way it ended just as in life many times we just have to hope for hope. As long as we have some hope all good is possible just remember hope can be found in anything.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
About the movie,One of Angelina's best performances and one of the best movies I've ever seen and the music was so movie but what i actually liked the most in this film was Angelina's performance she made me cry . i give it a 10 * and if you liked this movie you should watch GIA . Well when i finished the movie and got back home i gave my mom a big hug . Anyway the directing was a masterpiece and thank to Angelina the movie was brilliant and absolutely strangely moving i would watch it over and over .And Jolie deserved the Oscar for this role that was really a gorgeous and attractive way to see how much a mother loves her sun i wanted to see the movie the minute i saw the trailer,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A must see,"Well we decided to sit and watch Changeling after coming back off our holidays. I didn't have high hopes for it, and expected to go off to bed early in the middle of it. However. This movie totally stunned me. It had me hooked right until the end credits and I found myself wanting more. My eyes were closing because I was so tired, but there was no way it was being switched off! The film is very clever indeed. Rarely I feel in tune with the characters like I was in this film. I felt every single emotion, sadness, desperation, hope, brief happiness, anger, frustration-the list goes on. Clint Eastwood deserves a lot of recognition for this film as I feel it was practically perfect in every way. It delivers everything I like in a movie.The only downside I could say was it seemed a little slow in the beginning, but it really wasn't long before it picked up and I was hooked. The ending is about as powerful and emotional as any film can be. Full of twists and turns leaving you wondering and hoping as much as the mother. My brain was racing round at a million miles an hour, and just as I thought I could relax, it packed another punch.The best feature of this movie for me was the last 45 minutes. So often I have watched films and been disappointed with a rushed ending, leaving me thinking ""is that it?"" This one had me cringing at every scene, dying for it to be over, but watching it glued, desperately trying to piece it altogether. I felt myself crossing my fingers and hoping above all hope for the answers, and that's where the genius of the film becomes reality. Whether it was Eastwood's intention for the viewer to feel that or a bizarre accident, that's what has made Changeling one of the best films I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Winner for Eastwood,"Changeling (2008)**** (out of 4)True life story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a mother whose son is kidnapped in L.A. in 1928. Five months later the LAPD return a kid to her but she claims it's not hers and must fight to try and figure out the mystery along with the help from a Reverend (John Malkovich) who wants to bring down the corrupt police force. Director Eastwood just keeps getting better and better with one great film after another and that trend continues with this haunting and downright dramatic film that has the man doing some of the best work of his career. Once again Eastwood takes his time in telling the story and he plays it out in a rather slow way. I'm not saying slow in a bad way but he does let the screenplay flourish by letting us get to know the central characters and go along with their painful ride. This is certainly true in the case of Jolie's character as we get to see many ups and downs and the actress nails all of them perfectly. Even though she's the biggest ""star"" in the world there's never a problem watching her as this character as this might be the best thing I've seen her do. She perfectly nails all the emotion scenes and you can constantly look at her eyes and see the sadness in them as she tries to find out what happened to her son. Malkovich is also very strong in the type of role that he does best. The supporting players include great work from Jeffrey Donovan, Michael Kelly and Jason Butler Harner. Eastwood's direction is what really keeps the thing moving because he doesn't take any safe ways out and for the most part he just punches the viewer in the stomach with a honest approach to the material. The subject matter of a kidnapped kid is very ugly as is the big twist that I won't reveal but not once does Eastwood shy away from the material. The ugliness of what happens to Jolie's character also isn't looked away from and this is why Eastwood remains one of the most interesting director's out there. His music score is also very good and adds a lot to the film. Another great thing. Another impressive thing is the film taking place in the late 20's and Eastwood perfectly recaptures this world. All the vintage stuff from the cars to the houses look incredibly well so getting into the atmosphere of the time isn't a problem at all. The film's one problem was the final fifteen-minutes when we get a couple spots, which are set up to be endings, which then turn into another ending. I think the screenplay has a little trouble wrapping everything up but outside of this the film is yet another brilliant and impressive work from its director.",,Anonymous,Biography
Crumbles under its own ambition for more,"Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single mother, raising a young son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), while working as a supervisor to a telephone operator agency. She leaves Walter at home when going to work one day, and find him to be lost upon her return. She calls the police, an investigation is launched, and she is reunited with her son months later. Only, she is convinced the child is an imposter, and is not her son.I wanted to really enjoy Changeling. I always give Clint Eastwood a chance with his frequently Oscar-nominated films (having thoroughly enjoyed his last offering, Letters from Iwo Jima), but I am finding that I may be a little too lenient. Yet again, Eastwood gives us a movie that proves he has talent, but lacks the right formula to be considered as anything extraordinary.While the basic story is there (a very interesting true one at that), it gets muddled into a deeper subplot of corruption, scandal and murder. It is not confusing in the least, but becomes frequently annoying. Once the film starts moving and Collins is reunited with her ""son"", it just loses its focus and starts swinging its hands into other things. Sure, they are integral to the film, but they feel so open-ended and thrown on that they look and sound superfluous when they first appear. A meeting between the integral characters Det. Ybarra (Michael Kelly) and Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) is set up as being merely scene filler, but only becomes important much later in the film. It is troublesome in every instance, and plagues the film from beginning to end.What does not help is the film's running time. Clocking in at 141 minutes, Changeling feels about 20-30 minutes longer than it needs to be. When Eastwood is not hammering us over the head with how distraught and confused Collins is, he is packing on the emphasis on the near-superfluous items that become important only as the film draws to a close (or on scenes that were clumsily added in for an effect lacking any subtly). It feels like writer J. Michael Stracynski knew he had found a great story to tell, but had a few too many problems adapting it to screen. Why else would we have a wonky timeline, repetitive sequences, and all-too predictable moments that are meant to shock, but instead induce the audience to rolling their eyes? This is not meant to be a life lesson-style story, but merely a recreation of history. Stracynski, in his attempt to stay true to the source material, cuts very little out of his storyline, and the film suffers under its own weight because of it. Where it needs to be fast-paced, it drags its heels. When it needs to slow down and dwell on something shocking, time just flies by. Is there any real need to not know which way you want to play the film?Jolie, as the main character, has seen better days and far superior performances. Yes, her exquisite acting chops are put to the test in some scenes, but a lot just require her to almost act beneath herself. We saw her as a struggling, very pregnant wife in A Mighty Heart, acting as journalist Mariane Pearl. While by no means a great movie, Heart gave a great means for Jolie to express herself in a depressingly serious role, allowing her to pull on heart strings and prove she is not just a one-trick pony turned paparazzi fodder. But here, where she plays a very similar role, she seems to be merely aping off her old performances. Shades of Pearl are obvious, and shades of her Oscar-winning turn in Girl, Interrupted are even more noticeable. She just seems incapable of giving any real means of attention to the part, and looks like she is merely going through the motions, just hoping for that next Oscar nom. A scene near the end of the film, where Collins acts totally and inexplicably out of character, only makes her role seem that more staged than it already was. Her character goes from somewhat believable to a total fantasy in less than three minutes; which is never a good sign for anyone.Jeffrey Donovan, playing Captain J.J. Jones makes for a great antagonist, but he is very underused. His accent may be a bit wavy, but he beams brightly when he shares the screen with Jolie. Much the same goes for John Malkovich, who plays a local radio-based Pastor who loves to enthrall his listeners with stories of corruption and evil within the LAPD. He too is shafted (much like in Burn After Reading), merely acting as an over-sized prop for Jolie as the film progresses. Both Kelly and Harner do great work for the small roles they are given, but as the films drags almost exclusively around the story behind these two characters. In a stronger film, both of these guys could have been stars.While the film suffers under the weight Eastwood and Stracynski are forcing upon it, it does manage to set the 1920s scenery up quite well. From the costumes to the cars to the sets to even the drab and dark weather, Changeling is a tour-de-force for its technical means. The artists who put together this maverick vision clearly have a grasp on the material, and have an even better idea on where it is headed from moment one. They put a lot of effort into these designs, and it shows in how realistic and authentic they look.Changeling is an interesting movie, but gets bogged down under too much being pumped into the story. It knows what it wants to be, but it makes itself out to be something totally different. Jolie is the star, but the supporting cast does a much better job holding it up than she does. Its watchable, but not more than once.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Chameleon,"There's been a lot of talk about Clint Eastwood, from his early, iconic screen characters through his ups and downs and into his latter career, turning into one of America's best filmmakers. And for all the talk, he really lives up to it and delivers once again. Since 2003's 'Mystic River' the now 79-year old has been on a terrific winning streak, pulling out a double-wham in 2008 with the surprisingly multi-genre 'Changeling' and the harsh, gun-wielding but oh-so-soulful 'Gran Torino'. And for what I know he's shooting a new movie about Nelson Mandela, and let's hope he'll just go on and on, because right now he is making himself one of the most memorable film directors of all time.'Changeling' seemed at first simplistic, obviously mysterious and obviously draining with Angelina Jolie (as Christine Collins) crying her heart out over her disappeared son. But I soon learned that Eastwood and screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski had some unpredictable and hidden tricks up their sleeve. The emotional core (in which the theatrical trailer so boisterously showed) is draining and not shy of coming upfront, there's several page-turnings throughout that keeps Angie's performance natural and vivid. And although the heartfelt stories of both 'Mystic River' and 'Million Dollar Baby' had eyebrow-raising power in its tenderness of the main characters, 'Changeling' takes a different path. The movie quickly develops, not forgetting its spine, but painting roads that gave hints of noir, pure crime-thriller, melodrama (off course) and even horror. Jolie, at the center, gives a great performance loaded with a series of unfortunate events, whether at close-ups in heavy makeup and red-hot-lipstick or fading into the big portrait of City of Angels (fabulously shot by Tom Stern), she can hold this spectacle of corruption, lies, greed, hope & loss together with impressive strength.It's great casting (Jolie is daring and brings down the house, Malkovich feels odd but interesting as a priest-gone-crusader, and among others, Michael Kelly, Gattlin Griffith (as the gone baby gone Walter Collins), Colm Feore and Amy Ryan), the production and costume design brings further depths to characters and environments, and the music by Clint himself is classicism at times, but is full of life.Jolie/Christine going down an almost hopeless line gets needful help by Reveran Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) who preaches that it has become his mission in life to bring down the LAPD. Malkvovich becomes a fresh breath of air, he steps into this with a detective's attitude into slashing the corrupt police down, and becoming a helpful friend in Christine Collins' dog days. And with such a multi-layered film, there will off course pop up several, interesting characters that adds new sides of the story, as in any classic film-noir crime. But ops, be sure not to stamp it, the film's loose and so is Eastwood, never loosing momentum and always have a keen eye on holding the thrills tight, showing a new, but knowingly dark, side of himself, and doing it brilliantly.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The horror of Wineville Chicken Coop,"Despite is age and his Hollywood status clearly emphasizing he has nothing left to proof, Clint Eastwood was one of the busiest directors of the first twenty years of the 21st Century. I nearly haven't seen all the films Eastwood directed, and I certainly didn't like every film he made during this period, but ""Changeling"" is a haunting and unforgettable masterwork.Initially, I didn't plan to write a user-comment for it, as I avoid commercial titles. But I feel it's a must. It's been almost a year since I watched ""Changeling"", but still distinctively remember every tiny detail of the plot and atmosphere, as well as the rollercoaster of diverse emotions it evoked in me. The plot and the historical accuracy are what's most impressive about, but also the authentic late 1920s recreation, the performances, and the direction are stupendous.Angelina Jolie isn't my favorite actress, but she's amazing as the hard-working single mother Christine Collins during the Depression era of 1928. When her son goes missing, and the police doesn't any leads or clues for several weeks, Christine receives the support of a fanatic pastor/activist who's been accusing the LAPD of sheer incompetence since many years already. In an attempt to boost up the public opinion, the police proudly announce they found Mrs. Collins' son and even arrange for a festive reunion at the train station, with many spectators and newspaper photographers. But the boy isn't Christine'son Walter, and when she tries to rectify this - after recovering from the initial shock and mental manipulations - it is Christine herself who gets accused of being a terrible mother and desperate attention seeker. She's even submitted to a psychiatric ward and, meanwhile, in a chicken farm outside of Los Angeles, the real and truly horrifying crimes are taking place.The true story of the frustrating and loathsome injustice that overcame Mrs. Collins is already marvelous drama/thriller material, and then I haven't mentioned yet the linkage to the horrific but factual Wineville Chicken Murders case. I read a lot of articles and books, and watch many documentaries and true-crime movies of authentic serial murderer cases, and but the story of child rapist and killer Gordon Stewart Northcott one is genuinely one of the darkest and most appalling tragedies ever; and all the procedural errors and blunders of the police/immigration service only made it worse. ""Changeling"" is a powerful and uncompromising film, paying a lot of respect to the real-life victims and the nightmarish ordeals they faced.

For Eastwood-groupies only,"Can Clint Eastwood ever make a bad film? Contrary to the innumerable lemmings gushing over his Hollywood recognition and reputation, the answer is ""yes."" This film had the production quality, sophistication, and entertainment value of a tedious made-for-TV flick trying desperately to be taken seriously. It didn't help that none of the characters were well conceived by the script (which is strange, considering this film was inspired by a ""real"" event and ""real"" people), and the actors were clearly bored with their roles.Angelina Jolie could not help but be 'emotionally distraught' in every scene, not only because it was called for by the script and the film, but because she seemed genuinely distraught that more discriminating viewers might not embrace this film on Eastwood's reputation alone. Malkovich doesn't even look like he's awake in most of his scenes, and Feore plays the same bureaucrat bit-role he's played in countless major Hollywood productions that continue to gloss over him. The only component worth mentioning is the score, which Eastwood purportedly composed himself. I guess that's something....",,Anonymous,Biography

The fact that anyone would buy that a mother wouldn't recognize her own son should be ludicrous. Yet, they wanted a good story and she became duped by them. What follows is a series of events that are so hideous and so sad that they energize the story. One drawback is that at some point the whole issue of suspense sort of dribbles away and when the film is over, there is a bit of a letdown.

"Not Clint's best, but fascinating still","""Changeling"" begins with the old-fashioned Universal Pictures logo and it really sets up what's to come. If this story were set today, a DNA test could have ended this movie in 5 minutes but it's set during the late 1920's, which makes it a complicated mess worthy of being unraveled by a big Hollywood movie. The film is based, unbelievably, on a true story about a Los Angeles woman who loses her son. The LAPD finds who they believe to be him, but its not him. It's a strange story and in less competent hands it could have gone way off track but Clint Eastwood is at the helm and a fantastic cast including Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich are out right in front. ""Changeling"" is dense and twisty but it remains interesting nonetheless.Jolie plays Christine Collins, a switchboard supervisor who comes home one day to find that her 9-year old son Walter is missing. It's during this time that the LAPD is already under constant scrutiny for its corruption and incompetence, even being the focus of sermons given by Pastor and radio evangelist Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). Christine is about to get a good look at how they do business when she gets a call that her son has been found. Only when arriving at a train station to see him, she knows immediately that the boy is an imposter. This leads to many verbal sparring matches between her and Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) and to police reports in the newspaper that Christine is neurotic and an unfit mother. Jones even goes so far as to throw her in a mental institution, where more police corruption is revealed to her by an inmate (Amy Ryan). Her only support comes from the pastor and from one good cop investigating murders committed by a serial killer (Jason Butler Harner) at a ranch.The movie is more of a chronicle than an emotional journey. It takes us down one path only to yank us down another one later on, going from the sad loss of a son, to a ludicrously shocking display of how the police use their power, to the grisly and disturbing murders committed at the ranch, and finally to the inevitable trials and calls for justice. This movie has a lot to cover and really doesn't spend much time trying to pull at the heartstrings in between. The timeline of events is shocking, ugly and is pretty much guaranteed to leave you fascinated and disturbed just I wish the story stopped every once in a while to dive into character psyches. But regardless, I liked the sort-of chess match being played between Collins and the police, her move being the constant evidence against this boy being her son and theirs being the laughably awful explanations to the contrary, my favorite being that shock can lead to ""spine shrinkage."" And again this is an uncomfortable yet probing film from Eastwood about the evil that men can do and if you can handle it there is a lot worth watching here.Eastwood's film is also very authentic. The cars, big red trains and drab looking costumes all look very 1920's. And amid all this background and design is Angelina Jolie, one of those old-fashioned Ava Gardner-type beauties who seems to fit into everything like a glove. There hasn't been a lot of talk concerning the Best Actress race this year but that should change with Jolie, who fills the character with fight, determination, and a strong sense of hope. Her best quality though is that she brings a restrained dignity to the role, never falling into a melodramatic trap once. Malkovich is phenomenal, providing us with a character whose rock-solid both in his intelligence and in his resolve. And the villains also shine, Jeffrey Donovan giving a slick and slimy performance while Jason Butler Harner makes for a disgustingly pathetic and sick human being.""Changeling"" works as a report. It's more of a this happened, this happened, then this happened type of movie, with the characters going through motions. But that's really the only thing that keeps the movie from being really exceptional. The cast does fine work and fills the emotional holes the best they can and Eastwood again makes a compelling movie about the evil in the hearts of men. ""Changeling"" could have been better but it's good nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great work Clint!,"There's no jarring wooden dialog here, no overt exposition; Straczynski knows how to show rather than tell, and the powerful script does much to carry the film. As with most of Eastwood's films, it's artfully shot and directed and very pretty to look at. Eastwood wrote the music for the film as well.The part of the story content dealing with a child serial killer is difficult and shocking to be sure, but the film deals with it carefully and does not sensationalize, nor show gory details not necessary to the story (thank you Mr. Eastwood!). Angelina Jolie did a marvelous job portraying Christine Collins and the audience loved John Malkovich's performance as the Reverend. (You know their into it when they applaud during the show!) Being used to seeing Mr. Malkovich in 'bad guy' roles, I was surprised to see him as the good guy, but his performance was amazing, he truly pulled it off beautifully.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Gloom feast,"If this wasn't loosely based on a real life event, you wouldn't believe it. Christine Collins son (Walter) disappeared on March 10, 1928 and after five months, to avoid more negative press, the LA police brought home a boy of the same age, who claimed to be Walter.Christine played along for a short while, bullied by the police, but then - backed by Walter's dentist and teacher - stated publicly that the boy brought back by the LA police was not her son.The police had Christine committed to a mental institution, from which she was freed thanks to public support. In the meantime, a more sinister truth was discovered.Apparently Christine did not refuse to accept the fake Walter from the start because the LA police of the 20s was a misogynist bunch of violent, corrupted cops. Whatever it was and despite the meticulous reconstruction of LA in that period, the film collapses due to Jolie presence and performance.Eastwood is said to have chose Jolie because ""her face fit the period"" but if you check movies and fashion shots from the 20s, you will see women with pencil-thin eyebrows and thin lips, none with full brows or oversize, bee-stung lips. The colossal failure in the makeup department is coupled with Jolie's lack of subtlety and wooden presence. Certainly the real Christine looked nothing like her, but a more naturalistic approach would have lacked star power.Clearly the fans appreciate Jolie regardless of her skills but to me she just looked like ""Jolie-the movie star"" with a bad wig trying and failing to emote and convince you she was an anonymous, helpless, fragile mother.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Hope, U will like this movie. As I did....","After Oscar season, I finally watched this movie.... I've never been into Clint Eastwood's movies... I have seen Million dollar baby which was a very good movie but a bit formulaic but i still rated that 9/10,Gran Torino was good but Story was cheapo flat. I have DVD of Mystic River, Unforgiven and Letter from Iowa Jima...but i haven't still seen any of them..Changeling was different...because of its beautiful concept and interesting well told story.. You will feel this movie especially the Jail and Mental Hospital scenes.Cinematography is the best point of the film but when you notice others, I bet u will definitely praise them.

I started it at midnight was was never once bored.Angelina Jolie, Jeffery Donovan, Michael Kelly, and of course the great John Malkovitch all gave wonderful performances. Clint Eastwood is proving to be a GREAT director as well, I haven't found a movie of his bad since he started directing, I'm hoping he keeps it up.The only thing I can say is the lead cast is great but the one I thought gave the best performance is Michael Kelly. My favorite scene is when he's talking to the 15 year old boy about the missing children. Which is also the most powerful scene in the entire film.I highly recommend Changeling.

Good vs Evil tale for bigots,"MAY CONTENT SPOILERS What is Clint Eastwood's problem? Is the aging Pale Rider getting afraid of Death? Has he not found anything else than religious bigotry to cure his fears? Because that is what Changeling is about. A series of caricatured characters straight out of a Sunday morning sermon, in a story told with absolutely no humor, no irony - always a bad sign - on a pompous solemn TV evangelist tone. Be afraid of going to hell! Be afraid of sitting in front of 132 minutes of a sermonizing movie about good and evil. Add to this: clichés galore, a slow pace (you can go out and buy a drink, being comfortable you are not missing anything), plain camera work and picture compositions, and a very unconvincing performance from A. Jolie. Everything she does is unbelievable. When she takes her child in her arms it looks fake. Her feelings which may be genuine just don't come through. To her credit she has nothing to play: the character is the embodiment of virtue. She's good, good, good, so good, so dull, she should have asked for a rewrite. Only upside to her character: she works on roller skates for a telephone company, which may have sound cool on paper and is simply odd in the movie. Quite unlike her, a series of evil freaks badly try to harm the Virgin Mary who's lost her child. The corrupt cop, excellent performance by Jeffrey Donovan, a baddie who should get more parts, the corrupt and pervert psychiatrist (what else), and of course the formulaic serial killer who just walked out of an episode of CSI, except this time, the TV series plot is served with a sermon, as he finds true redemption owing to a last minute confession to a priest. The content of the confession most certainly holds the secret to the whole plot but nor us nor Mrs Jolie get to know it. The good mother is helped by another good character in her fight against the three baddies and guess what's his job: he's a reverend. Malkovitch looks so evil naturally that he manages to create an interesting character out of another dull part of the screenplay. He's a genius actor this man, Hollywood tends to forget his huge talent too much too fast. You end up wishing the film was about the reverend rather than his simpering protégé. Most of the time the plot is grossly unbelievable. The mother is manipulated by the press to accept a child which is clearly not hers; What made the real mother do it in the real life, who knows; but the film fails to properly account for this keystone to the story. The good reverend walks in the hospital with a warrant to save the good mother from the evil psychiatrist just as she is about to receive electric shocks, just like in a pulp B movie, except this one thinks very highly of itself. I mean come on, this can't be serious, what were they thinking? 2 out of 10 for the recreation of the 1930s LA costumes, props and visual effects.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, not great","One thing I like about films directed by Clint Eastwood is their consistent attempt to depict the shattered American Dream. In this case, the shattered dream is that of justice in the LA of the late 20s and early 30s. Clearly, the dream has suffered at the hands of an LAPD and a judicial system that fall far short of normal requirements, even for that time.Eastwood tells the story well but it is difficult to swallow the fact that the changeling had a mother of his own and yet he was willing to impersonate young Walter and so pass off as Christine Collins' son. I thought at first that it might be because he had run away from harm but, alas, that was not the case. Sadly, that apparently minor detail opens a massive credibility gap in the film's narrative.That aside, praise must go to the effective direction, the generally sound acting, above all to the scrupulous attention to period detail, and the awesome photography. In terms of acting, the duplicitous nature of the murderer is superbly conveyed by Jason Harner but there is one serious minus: Angelina is too ""jolie"" and too stereotyped, a typical beauty down to her hat and clothing with the photography clearly emphasizing that beauty in its time capsule.As the movie progressed I found it hard to detect any real emotion in Jolie. Perhaps Estwood wanted to extract a restrained approach from her but I just do not think it works. As I see it, that is a central weakness in the film but when all is said and done, and in spite of those drawbacks, Changeling is a film well worth seeing especially because Eastwood refuses to provide an easy remedy to a very difficult situation and ultimately to paper over yet another crack in the American dream.Eastwood's honesty I value most of all: He does not shirk the usefulness of the death penalty to rid society of elements clearly unfit to live in it and, most importantly, unable to admit their evil deeds.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Unconvincing Clint,"The truth is a tricky construct. Words are uttered and, depending on who says them, they are afforded a certain level of belief. Sometimes the truth is so entirely outlandish that believing it is a struggle. And sometimes that struggle is worth it because the truth has the potential to enlighten and call for change. The truth in a movie is almost inherently a falsehood. The intention of telling the truth may be genuine but film requires reconstruction and subjectivity in order for its message to be told. So when Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort, CHANGELING, announces at its very start that what we are about to bear witness to is a true story, a certain weight is lent while a certain caution is exercised. The truth here is that a boy by the name of Walter Collins was abducted in 1928 and the boy that was returned to his mother, Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), five months later was not her son, but rather a boy claiming to be her son. The thought that no one believed her truthful claims is a wide stretch to begin with and Eastwood, despite setting a complete scene, did not ultimately convince me that any of this actually happened.Of course, to some extent, much of the story did happen. In the late 1920's and early 1930's, Los Angeles played home to an atrocious set of serial murders known then as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Walter Collins was said to be a victim of these horrible crimes, in which a man by the name of Gordon Northcott (played in the film by Jason Butler Harner), would lure young boys back to his run down ranch, lock them up in chicken coops and torture them before ultimately killing them like helpless animals and burying their bodies in his backyard. At the same time, a boy by the name of Arthur Hutchens Jr. claimed to be the missing Collins boy in order to get a free ride from Iowa to California. When Christine Collins told the police that this was not her son  something Jolie says repeatedly in the film like a beautiful but busted record  they tried to convince her that she was mistaken and confused. She pushed and was eventually incarcerated in the psychiatric ward of the L.A. county hospital for her supposed delusions. She was released ten days later when Hutchens finally admitted he was not Walter Collins.The facts are what they are but yet somehow, when Eastwood tells the story, it seems ridiculous and CHANGELING becomes a disappointing experience because you want for it to be better than it is. Cinematographer, Tom Stern, shoots Patrick M. Sullivan Jr.'s delicate and detailed art direction with a soft sensitivity that births an encompassing sense of nostalgia for a time I never knew. And it always surprises me just how breathtaking Jolie is. As the single mother at the center of this controversy, she is composed and determined one moment and fragile and frightened the next. Sometimes, she is all of these things and more at the same time. Unfortunately for Jolie, she seems to keep picking prestige projects where she outshines the material itself. J. Michael Straczynski's script is overly facile as it chalks up all of Collins' difficulties to her being a woman, that ever-emotional creature that cannot possibly function with reason. And Eastwood has all of her male aggressors adopt that same mentality. So when a doctor tells Christine Collins that of course it is possible that her boy shrunk three inches after this ordeal and that she cannot see this because she is a woman and has no objectivity, we chuckle at how ludicrous this is instead of recoil at the horror.Throughout CHANGELING, you can feel Eastwood's sense of accomplishment. There he is behind the lens, standing up straight and proud. He is the champion of women's rights, exposing injustices and not afraid be the man that does so. What he doesn't see on the other side of his smug sense of accomplishment is that he is actually detracting from Christine Collins' plight by oversimplifying the whole affair. The specific details can never truly be exposed but this truly happened and by trying to tell his limited take on the truth, Eastwood has turned the truth into a bad joke.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Two Thumbs up for Clint Eastwood,"Ladies and gentleman we're in front of one of the greatest movie directors of the 21st century, I certainly cannot judge Clint for his acting, as I have not seen his movies, but as a director, this man has lots to offer, specially when there are hundreds of new movies and mostly no one has nothing to say. This movie features a brilliant performance of many of the actors involved, John Malkovich acts with excellence and transmits a lot of concern in every time he appears on the film, but that's not a surprise as he's one of the greatest actors we can enjoy, besides this performance, Jolie in amazing, and she shows herself as a really concerned and suffering mother, desperately looking for answers regarding what she loves the most, she doesn't overact at all, one thing to point out is that she usually performs a non sensitive sexy man eater, but in this film, from beginning to end, you can feel that she's a really sensitive painful mother. There's lots of great acting in the movie, Jeffrey Donovan does a great job as well as Jason Butler Harner, they definitely got into they're characters with passion . I just can say that this kind of movies are the ones that are worth watching, it's completely beautiful, to your eyes to your ears (wonderful music) and the most important of all. It's a deeply intense experience that will surely touch your heart.Just one more thing to say, and that's all, Thank you very much for your work Mr. Eastwood, I hope that your work inspire young directors and actors, by now you're for me one of the best drama directors of all times.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Clint Eastwood's best Motion Picture of the decade,"Changeling is a painful, realistic, emotionally grabbing and gripping film.This film is so perfectly captured on screen and directed by Eastwood. The story itself is strong, and it is brought into the screen in such a way that the audience really holds on to it. I expected a dull, sappy melodrama, but instead I found it to be very entertaining. I found all the turns that the film takes to suit it well, and instead of all the different challenges it had to overcome, it could have easily failed, but it succeeded brilliantly. The pacing is never slow, it is always on focus, and it does not linger so much as other mystery films. Since this film starts off as a mystery, then turns into sort of a crime and court film, it has a lot to offer in performances. Angelina Jolie is really an underrated actress. I think all her fame sometimes overshadow how good she is, and in this, she gives the best performance I have seen from her. Her pain, her unbearable suffering, her eagerness for the truth and justice, it is all played perfectly. Angelina Jolie deserves at the least an Oscar nomination. John Malkovich and the entire cast are great, even the kid actors. The film is also very beautiful to look at. The atmosphere of Los Angeles in the 1920's and 1930's is perfectly captured. The cinematography is beautiful, and I was also glad it was not too showy, it would not fit the tone too much. The costumes and set designs are also perfect. Expect a lot of technical Oscar nominations, as well as Original Score. It was so soothing and enhanced the story even more.Overall, amazing and brilliant film! It is not flawless, but it certainly is a great film, if not for the gripping story and writing, then for the performances. I really enjoyed it a lot more than the overrated Million Dollar Baby, and the dull letters from Iwa Jima. This is Eastwood's best film of the decade, and one of his best works",,Anonymous,Biography
"Handsomely produced, prestigious, yet excessively didactic drama...Conspiracy 101","True Crime Story out of 1928 Los Angeles concerns working single mother who arrives home one night to discover her young son missing from the house; her heartbreaking story of loss becomes front page news, and when the L.A. police ceremoniously locate the boy and bring him back to her some five months later--she's certain it isn't him. Screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski really stacks the deck against our heroine, with only a Presbyterian minister (and the audience) on her side. With so many villains (corrupt, uncaring, and unfeeling) peopling the cast, one is apt to feel as beaten down as Angelina Jolie's Christine Collins. Producer-director Clint Eastwood feels for her but spares us none of the horrors of her nightmare, which dragged on for years, culminating in two different legal trials (which appear to be happening at the same time). Jolie's acting is finely measured, well-considered, and emotionally felt, however the supporting performances are wildly uneven. From John Malkovich's super-superior Reverend Briegleb to Jeffrey Donovan's maddeningly condescending police chief, everyone seems to have stepped out of an old horror flick. Eastwood isn't subtle--nor does his final edit exhibit brevity--but he knows how to pack a punch when it's called for, and his film has many powerful moments. It certainly looks good, which helps compensate for the over-length, and it's satisfying to a certain degree...yet the picture isn't a rich, engrossing entertainment. It is too intent on painting everyone involved as either completely good or wholly and inexplicably evil. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Eastwood shows no sign of stopping as a director.,"As with Eastwood's film 'Million Dollar Baby' where you begin is certainly not where you end up, shot with 1920's Los Angeles as its backdrop it tells the true story of Christine Collins (Jolie) a mother who son goes missing only to be returned some months later, but is the child the police return to her actually her son? At two and a half hours of mostly Angelina crying some maybe put off but I urge you not to be because if you do you will miss what is essentially a great movie. Filled with shades of The Green Mile, L.A. Confidential, There Will Be Blood and even earlier Jolie outing Girl Interrupted, Eastwood weaves the plot around the cast and the city of angels but it is Jolie's performance that is not only one of her best but quite rightly tipped for an Oscar. Yes at times she over emotes but she also shows us how good an actress she can be and at several times I had forgotten it was her I was watching. The script, apparently unchanged from its first draft, is strong and gives the actors and the director plenty to work with and again deals with empathy, wrath, injustice and revenge. But directing aside it is also the cinematography that excels creating the city streets and making them look so believable for the cast to work within add to that the film stock giving that bleached, washed out effect and the 1920's have never looked so real. It's as grey as the corrupt cop's suits, which is why even the slightest hint of colour like Jolie's red lipstick really stands out. All in all the film is almost perfect; there is a slight bit that is so cheesy you may physically wince but that is a minor quibble, the plot will keep you guessing and at the hands of a master like Eastwood there is never any drag as it reaches its conclusion. Another to add to his unstoppable career and a must see movie that will no doubt be heavily talked about come Oscar time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fascinating story, less fascinating movie","Here is a story which would be impossible to believe if it weren't actually true. In Los Angeles in 1928 a nine-year-old boy, Walter Collins, goes missing. Months later he is found and the LAPD sets up a triumphant, highly publicized, reunion between Walter and his mother Christine. There's a problem. Immediately upon seeing the boy Christine knows that this is not her son. Desperate for good press the LAPD is quick to hush Christine up and prods her to take the boy home on a trial basis. Seriously, that's what they said. Take him home, try him out, maybe you'll like him. Christine has little patience for this charade. She continues to insistently state the obvious. This boy is not her son. She wants answers. What she gets is a one-way ticket to the psychopathic ward.On the surface the movie appears to be about one woman's fight for the truth, her fight for her son. It's also about the incompetence and corruption of the LAPD and director Clint Eastwood unfortunately hammers that angle to death. The LAPD of this time was full of bad, vile characters. We get it. As the cliché of the big, bad police department gets beaten into the ground there has to be the other corresponding movie cliché. That would be the one good, honest cop who wants to get to the bottom of things. And in this case getting to the bottom of things takes the movie to some very dark and horrifying places.The story of the missing Walter Collins ties into a bigger picture storyline. That bigger picture is too awful to even want to contemplate. Here give Eastwood some credit. He didn't exploit the horror. He chose to stick closely to the story of Christine Collins, her quest to find her son and her battles with the LAPD. Eastwood gives us enough information to realize the awful nature of what has been done and to understand the sick, twisted evil of the villain who is introduced into the film. But at its heart the movie is always about Christine Collins. This was a brave woman who, faced with so many obstacles, never wavered in her quest for the truth and never lost hope of being reunited with her Walter. That makes for a great story but there are too many nagging issues here to make this a truly great movie.Angelina Jolie gives a highly-charged performance in the role of Christine. But there are times she goes a little too far. Obviously there are tremendous emotional highs and lows in Christine's story but when Jolie lays it on a bit thick the effect is jarring. One scene near the end is most notable, Jolie hamming it up to such an extent it takes you out of the movie entirely. All you're thinking is ""Angie dear, come back to us."" Many of the supporting characters fall flat, most notably Christine's main LAPD adversary, Captain Jones. He's a bland, boring, rather ineffectual foil for Christine. John Malkovich, playing well against type as a radio preacher, and Jason Butler Harner as the exceedingly eccentric villain have their moments. But other than that it's Jolie's show all the way. And her performance doesn't quite sustain the movie over a rather excessive 140 minute running time. Eastwood's relentless hammering of the LAPD wears thin rather quickly. Yes, the police in this true-life story were corrupt and incompetent and pretty much completely awful. But Eastwood belabors the point to at times tedious effect. All in all, for as fascinating a story as there is to work with, there is the sense the movie never fully ignites. It simmers but never boils. A reasonably decent film but clearly not one of Eastwood's best efforts.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The plot is interesting, convincing and very well developed. It is perfectly set on the late 20's and the early 30's with a very good costume design. The cast is good, Angelina Jolie forgetting for a moment all her sexiness and performing as a desperate mother trying to find her son, she is really good in this role, you can really feel all her sorrow throughout the film and John Malkovich as reverend Gustav Briegleb is very convincing. In conclusion, Changeling is a movie that will take you on a ride of emotions such as sadness and anger. Totally worthy and fully recommendable.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"extraordinary movie. excellent story, director, outstanding performance by Angelina Jolie","This movie surprised me in an extremely good way. I don't know what was the Academy thinking... This movie should have won not only for best actress in a leading role but for best movie too. For me, Slumdog millionaire and even The curios case of Benjamin Button were not as good as this one. Very good drama. Very touching also. Go and see it, you will not be sorry. Angelina Jolie is great in her performance as the whole cast is. Is the kind of movie that gives you a lesson, that teaches you in a way how unpredictable life can be. Extraordinary.

"""That's NOT my son""...what a journey....","Clint Eastwood delivers a very powerful film with Angelina Jolie giving a very strong and emotional performance which should lead to many kudos. CHANGELING reminded me of L. A. CONFIDENTIAL, in a film noir, like CHINATOWN, of the dark side of Los Angeles in the 1920's and 1930's, in a true story which Jolie brings the full power of her acting skills in portraying Christine Collins. The supporting cast is solid, the sets and costumes very real to the period, the court scenes adding to the story, and of course, the forces of ""good vs. evil"" resonate through out the film. I wonder how far from yesterday is the LAPD, and that was my feeling when I left the theater. With CHANGELING, Eastwood, as in MYSTIC RIVER, has directed a film of noteworthy characters and story.",,Anonymous,Biography
Changeling: A child secretly exchanged for another,"(There are Spoilers) Coming home from work at the L.A Telephone Company, where she's a supervisor, Christine Collins, Angelina Jolie, finds that her nine year old son Water, Gaittin Griffith, had gone missing.Going to the police to file a missing persons report Christine runs into the first of many horrors she suffers throughout the film in the police's indifference to finding her son Walter. It's when the police finally locate Walter some five months later in a diner at far off DeKalb Illinois that Christine's problems, instead of ending, star to intensify. The boy isn't her missing son Walter and what's more the L.A police-who took the credit in locating and returning ""Walter"" to her-in wanting to finally close the case insist that he is! So much so that they have Christine committed to an insane asylum when she refuses to go along with them!True story about the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders committed by the deranged Gordon Northcott, Jason Butler Hanner,back in 1928 that stunned the entire nation. The person who unknowingly uncovered these ghastly ax murders-Christine Collins-almost ended up being committed for life in an insane asylum by the very police who's job it was to solve them. It was when L.A Det. Lester Ybarra, Michael Kelly, interviewed this 15 year-old Canadian runaway Sandford Clark, Eddie Anderson, that the truth-about the ax murders- finally saw he light of day. It was Sandford who identified a photo of Walter Collins as one of his crazed Uncle Gordon's victims that cracked the case wide open. Uncovering the victims, as many as 20, at the Northcott Ranch not only leads to the arrest of Gordon Northcott but the indictment of the L.A police in their total incompetence in not chasing down the clues,in the case of the missing Walter Collins, that may have prevent any more murders from happening.****SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT DOWN**** Besides the tragic story about the missing Walter Collins-who in fact was never found dead or alive- and what his mother Christine went through to find him the ""Changeling"" also shows the amount of corruption that existed in the LAPD back then and how it allowed, with the police participating in it, crime to get out of hand in the ""City of Angels"".Gordon Northcott who was sentenced to be executed at San Quentin Prison was still up to his old tricks when he, from his cell in solitary confinement, sent Christine a telegram expressing remorse for his crimes and willing to tell her if her son Walter was in fact one of his victims. This lead to one of the most explosive scenes in the entire movie with Christine, while visiting him in a holding cell with a prison guard present, smacked Northcott silly when she realized that he was, by pulling her leg in what he knew about Walter, just extending her suffering for his own sick and perverted pleasure! As for Northcott he was to meet his maker the very next morning, on the San Quentin gallows, and that, unlike his sickening game of cat and mouse he played with Christine the previous day, was nothing for him to laugh about!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Eastwood Masterpiece!,"An absolutely astonishing true story picture, which gives out probably one of the finest Actress performances by Angelina Jolie, who I personally thought wasn't going to be this convincing as the unfortunate singled mother named Christine Collins, and is a most definite to win Best Actress at next year's Academy Awards. Jolie's character is incredible, not to mention that there was a Christine Collins that draws you into her Trauma's and experiences that she goes through and who stops at nothing to find out where her son has gone when he was reported missing in 1928.But the great Clint Eastwood (who I've been a huge fan ever since his westerns in front and behind the camera) gives us an insight into the corrupt L.A.P.D. during the time when they didn't care and stopped at nothing to hide the Police's force embarrassing state that they were in.Whats starts off as an emotional thriller soon turns into a bloody horror when a Gordon Northcott is introduced into the film, and the shocking truth is barley understandable, and since this is a true story is very shocking. But Jolie isn't the only one who gives out a brilliant acting performance, as does John Malkovich (who else?!) who plays Reverend Gustav Briegleb help Christine Collins uncover the truth and stop at nothing in order for the corrupt L.A.P.D. to be seen as who they are really were during the 1920's, with the odd exception to only one good cop named Detective Lester Ybarra, played well by Michael Kelly.Therefore the conclusion is ended in a very tense courtroom battle. But the term 'hope' is not just for Jolie's character, but for everyone who lived during that time where there was so much horror and depressing times that there was a time to stop and change matters thanks for a Mrs Christine Collins who says during one brilliant sequence, ""finishing the fight.""Once again Mr Clint Eastwood is still directing his finest films still, from Unforgiven (still my favourite!) to Million Dollar Baby, and bringing out memorable acting performances, e.g. Sean Penn, Hillary Swank, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman.Now Hollywood can agree that they have one of the finest actor's/Director's of all time, and has produced yet another Masterpiece.Bring On Gran Torino!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

More casual misogyny,"Is Clint Eastwood on a mission to right wrongs? A number of his directional efforts deal with the casual and unthinking misogyny of men. This is no exception. As an actress, Angelina Jolie is also no stranger to portraying the institutional 'inmate'. In this picture however, she changes sides and portrays, very well I might add, a woman made wrong by the hazing and self interested concerns of a corrupt legal and police system. The film put me in mind of the poor modern day victim of British misogyny Sally Clark who was accused of and imprisoned for killing two of her babies when real medical evidence suggested they likely died of infections. In neither this case nor the Collins case as in the film was the outcome good. Congratulations to Eastwood for producing a period piece with modern day parallels.

The cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac,"Is it possible to sue film companies for a deteriorating IQ in the same way McDonald's is tried to be sued for being a public health hazard?With Eastwood at the helm, I guess I could have known what to expect but I was never so infuriated watching a movie which' obvious intent was not to create something entertaining or authentic, but to secure as many golden statues as possible at the expense of anyone with more than two brain cells to rub together.Where to start? Jolie was miscast, but maybe they wanted to make an action flick when the project started, had her sign up, and by mistake started working of a script for a totally different movie. It might explain the title. Or what about the irritating self awareness of John Malkovich who'd you, at any point in the movie, expect to break the rule of the 'fourth wall', look smugly into a camera and tell the audience that he's really pleased with his performance so far.Story wise: horrible, unbelievable plot turns, starting right of the bat when a seemingly intelligent woman is given the wrong boy back, her supposed son, who disappeared a few months earlier. The boy is not her son, she takes him home anyway...¤¤ Really? ¤¤The story continuous with Jolie trying to explain to the world that the boy is an impostor who doesn't even match her son's height to which a dentist and a school teacher are willing to testify. Why family members, neighbors, school chums, the family physician, the baby sitter and E.T. the Extraterrestrial weren't asked to help resolve the obvious misconception on the part of the police, was conveniently left out of the tale completely. No, in stead of taking the boy into custody and resuming the search for the real son, the police keep pushing her into believing it actually is her son after which the woman finds herself in a poorly copied tale by Kafka.From this point on the movie reveals itself for what it was intended to be. An endless string of manipulative scenes drenched in an Oscar vinaigrette in both the melodramatic writing and the obnoxiously polished cinematography with a fetish-like attention to props. Some movies get Oscar nods, but this one actually nods back.I can only imagine why the livestock would hail these kinds of movies by Eastwood (Milion dollar Baby, Gran Torino) in stead of taking a blazing torch out and scream for something more authentic or at least something less hideously contrived to grace the silver screen for a change. Not to mention featuring characters that are a little more complex than those used in a Donald Duck story.I mean, it 's not like you are going to complain to the manager at the McDonald's either that everything tastes the same, is soaked in grease and that a Euro 3.20 for a sliced and fried potato with vomit sauce is perhaps a little excessive. Especially considering you have to sit in a wretched and all plastic environment where you have to get the chow yourself.But, I was discussing a movie, or was I?0/10",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A mother's pain,"When Changeling was screened in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, a lot of people assumed it was a lock for the Palme d'Or, given none other than Sean Penn, whom Clint Eastwood had directed to an Oscar with Mystic River, was the President of the Jury. Instead, good old Clint had to settle for a Special Award for the whole of his career. While this might not qualify as a proper award (in fact, it was made up on the spot so that he and the female winner, Catherine Deneuve, didn't leave Cannes empty-handed), it's a fitting tribute to a great filmmaker who, at the age of 78, shows no signs of tiredness or mediocrity, as proved by Changeling, another sober yet merciless look at the underbelly of American society.The movie takes us back to that most cinematic of cities, Los Angeles, in the year 1928 (two years before Clint himself was born, by the way). The shockingly true story told here is that of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a single mother whose only concern is the happiness of her 9-year old son Walter. It's no surprise, then, that she almost loses her mind when he disappears without a trace. The real surprise, to the LAPD at least, is that she refuses to recognize the boy they bring back months later: he claims to be Walter Collins, and Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) summons several experts to explain some of the visible changes (the kid is shorter, not to mention circumcised) in a logical way, but Christine refuses to believe those lies, and with the help of a priest (John Malkovich) who uses his radio program to publicly denounce the bad side of law enforcement she sets out to uncover the truth, no matter the cost.Like most masters of today, Eastwood uses the period piece gimmick to really tell a story that concerns our present situation: in this case, as has often been done previously (see L.A. Confidential), corruption within the police and its effect on the general public. Changeling is also a different take on a broader subject - the inefficiencies of the justice system - Clint has handled many times before, as both a star (the Dirty Harry cycle) and a director (True Crime, Blood Work, Mystic River). He takes advantage of the setting to tell the staggering tale, brought to the screen by sci-fi and comic-book writer J. Michael Straczynski (of Babylon 5 fame), and it does in fact look like it had really been made in the late '20s or early '30s: the cinematography, in particular, is reminiscent of what he did with his WWII double bill, especially Latters from Iwo Jima, which was almost black and white. It was made today, but could just as easily have been produced seventy years ago (with the swearing removed, of course), and like most well told period stories it holds up perfectly in our times as well.Then there's Jolie, who constitutes an entire chapter by herself: she was reportedly cast because she was the only actress who had that special something that defined movie stars during Hollywood's Golden Age (in fact, she was attached to the project before it even had a director), something which was visually enhanced with little but vital make-up. She returns the favor with a performance that exudes rare pain and power, a career-topping effort that is, for good reasons, earning her more Oscar buzz than any other actress this year. To say that this is her best work since Girl, Interrupted (for which she won an Academy Award) isn't enough: it is likely that with this and the equally difficult role she had in A Mighty Heart she may have reached the climax of her notable talent, which has been wasted in the past on crap like the Tomb Raider films. Needless to say, everyone else in the excellent cast pales next to her, which is probably why there's no other A-lister in the movie, minus Malkovich who turns out to be a very good choice thanks to his trademark old-fashioned, stage-like acting style.Most people mellow with age. Clint Eastwood doesn't: after the likes of Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby, he delivers another uncompromising, unmissable study of human behavior at its noblest (a mother's attempts to find her son) and at the same time most inhumane (the LAPD's reaction to Christine's ""crusade"")",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Her Search Continues...,"It is no unknown statement that Clint Eastwood is both a versatile actor and director. With 'Changeling' he takes the director's chair again and tells the harrowing story of a single mother desperately in search of her missing son followed by a wrongful accusation by a corrupt system and a lawsuit while her son still remains gone. The film is set in the 1920s-1930s. Eastwood's attention to detail of that time period is noticeable. The sets look real and the costumes are well designed. The makeup department does a good job too.I only thought the language slightly felt more of the current time than of then but otherwise the writing is fine. Given the different themes, 'Changeling' could have easily been a mess but the story unfolds smoothly and the issues are well tackled. I particularly liked the ending which avoids the usual cliché but at the same time stays hopeful of the protagonist's future.Given his strong films, especially of the last 10 years, Eastwood has managed to extract some of the best performances of his actors. Now it's Angelina Jolie's turn and this woman is a knockout. Her acting could have easily ended up whiny and preachy but Jolie stays restrained as she wonderfully displays Christine's dignity, courage and determination and is only explosive in one scene that required it. It is only occasionally that we get to see her do something of note because her glamorous image seems to overshadow her acting abilities but it is good to see that she is becoming more picky (last year she did an equally convincing job in 'A Mighty Heart'). John Malkovich too stands in a supporting role as the supportive minister who helps Christine through her ordeal while the rest of the cast are competent.'Changeling' is an engaging story of a mother in search of justice and her lost son. Unlike most of Eastwood's other films, 'Changeling' is disturbing. There are some gory scenes of murder. Even though they are mostly suggestive, it leaves a chill down the spine. The movie also enlightens about the legal system and how easy it was for the authority to get away with injustice. This is a must see for Eastwood fans but also for those who are interested in 'a different kind' of period piece and a gripping story.",,Anonymous,Biography

"The ""Good Old Days"" of movie making are right now!","There is a hauntingly beautiful song called ""Dark Side Of Your Soul"", sung by the under-rated singer, Kiki Dee. Part of the lyrics say, ""If you never know the darker side, you'll never see the light --- of your soul."" This past week I have seen the dark and the light. The movie ""Australia"" was a clunker. It reminded me of the cloyingly morose songs sung by Celine Dion, who suffocates every line with sobbing, carefully-crafted sincerity. ""Australia"" should have been a magnificent movie, but it lacks any warmth; instead it relies on the kind of plastic, manufactured sincerity that we saw in other clunkers like ""Pearl Harbor"".""Changeling"" is the complete opposite. I was transfixed. What was happening on the screen commanded my total attention. Mrs. Collins' anguish became my own. I wanted her to find her son every bit as much as she did.""Changeling"" is based on a true story about Christine Collins, a California woman whose son was abducted in 1928. Right from the start, you feel her anguish, and the frustration of not knowing where her son is, nor whether he is alive or dead.One of the elements of brilliance in this movie is how plausible everything is. Mrs. Collins is not just fighting the agony of losing her son, but also battling against the incredibly corrupt L.A.P.D. who see her as an embarrassment to the police force. When the public attention becomes too great a liability for the L.A.P.D. they have her sent to a psychiatric ward. This part was absolutely chilling, because it showed how completely helpless she was when everyone is part of the conspiracy of silence. No matter what she does, she cannot prevail.Angelina Jolie has to walk a tightrope of sorts in this movie. She is strong-willed, but she is not some ultimately invincible, puffed up superwoman that can single-handedly take on the whole world, and especially not this world, which is rife with corruption.At the end of ""Changeling"" you learn if there was a happy reuniting of mother and son. Since I have chosen not to write any ""spoilers"", you'll have to see the movie for yourself to know the answer. And that will be time very well spent because this movie truly is like the golden age of film making.**Addition added January 16, 2009** I first started writing these reviews in 2005.

Great Movie but only in pieces,"I am not really sure why Eastwood would ruin a perfectly great script. This is an incredible script ; great acting and a superb cast and still it fails to leave a lasting impact. This is a great movie but only in pieces ; there are some scenes where you can actually get a lump in your throat or a rage against system or utter shock but after that emotions director doesn't build upon it but cut abruptly. Its like snapping a perfectly romantic & emotional scene with a fart. I felt sad because this movie could have been so much great; its an unbelievable story of courage , love & compassion . But the artificial attempts to ""de-melodramatise"" had an adverse impact of missing continuity and broken bonding with the characters of the movie.I think someone like Steven Spielberg could have done more justice to this story ; as in parts it reminded me that this could have been like his ""Schiendler List"" .",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good solid movie.,"It would be hard to live up to the hype that has surrounded this film, but thanks to the excellent job done by Clint Eastwood as Director we get a solid movie that doesn't fall into the all-too-easy trap of being overly sentimental. Angelina Jolie delivers a refreshing performance which proves she does not need action or glamour to carry a starring role. It would be very easy for any woman playing such an emotional part to slip into hysterical over-acting but instead she delivers a beautifully understated study of a mother living through the worst nightmare any parent can imagine. Add a supporting cast of top-shelf talent, and a good period atmosphere, to what is an incredible true story and we get a must-see movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant Performance From Jolie , Eastwood Has Done It Again!","Every actor /actress whether there good or bad has one role there remembered for. Well this is without a doubt Angelina's. She is sensational.The story is great and true which always makes for a much more interesting watch. It hards to believe at times something like this could have gone on and happened but it did.Eastwood portrays the story as only he could and with all round great performances it nails it!.One of the best things i found with the film was it was so unexpected. Ever plot twist they throw at you , you never see any of them coming. It's quick off the mark and leaves you guessing up until the last second it really has been a while before this since i was so hooked to a movie.Do you need more reason/s to see this film?

It's completely believable and so non fake it's hard to believe what your seeing.It's another one for me that i now relate the story to the film. When i think Johnny Cash i see Jauqin Pheonix because he was so great and believable i almost forget he's not Johhn Cash. Samefor all the actors involved in this one.

Changeling,"Changeling is a new film apparently based on a true story that took place in the late 1920's. The story focuses on single mother Christine Collins who lives with her nine year old son Walter. One day after returning from work, Christine can not find Walter anywhere and so she enlists the help of the police department, but the events that follow were to forever go down in history and show the corruption of the police department at that time, or at least in that city. Changeling is technically well made with great attention to detail trying to make everything look and feel like the 1920's, and I think they do a great job with costumes, sets and music, but other than for some technical achievements, I feel that there is little else to recommend with this film. First of all, I know that this film was based on a true story, but the events that take place in the film are so far fetched and unusual that while you are watching it, it feels more unpleasant than compelling. I also found a lot of problems with the script such as the many added subplots in the film that I personally did not think needed to be added. I also do not think the characters were as developed as much as they should have been and I don't think we as the viewer are given a chance to emphasize with the Christine character like we should be able to. Part of this problem comes from the many additional subplots I mentioned that take away from the real story, or at least what is supposed to be the main story that the film focuses on. I also found the acting in the film to be too overly melodramatic and over the top at times, so often it did feel quite unbelievable and forced which a true story film should never do. I also found the last half of the film exposing the corrupt police department went on way too long and the film started to hammer out a message that became repetitive and preachy and it was more tiresome than inspirational. The film could have lost at least 20 to 30 minutes of scenes that didn't particularly fit in the movie, or added much to it. The last half did drag very often and several times I felt like checking my watch to see what time it was and when this film would be over because it's one longer film where you can really feel it's length. I also thought the film gave too many instances of false hope to the Christine character and there was one too many scenes of her on the phone talking to the missing person's department and such that also could have been cut because it gives us the viewer false hope for the character and it just further made the film longer than it should have been. I think the main problem with this film is the script and had it been reworked over a little bit it could have been a very good film, but as it currently stands I can not personally recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Painstakingly touching,"Who knew Angelina Jolie could do such good drama? This came as a serious surprise to me. The whole movie was incredible and you could really see the touch of director/producer Clint Eastwood in this film. I don't even know where to start.The greatest thing about this film is the fact that it doesn't try to be epic. It just tells a story of a desperate mother trying to find her mysteriously disappeared son. While she tries to find her son she gets entangled to a serious web of police arbitrariness and corruption. She is not a heroine but rather forced to take action she is terrified about. Watching a lone mother struggle in historically accurate 1920s L.A. makes your heart want to give in from the amount of sympathy.I can stress the performance of Angelina Jolie hard enough. From the moments of blind rage to the lonesome disbelief she does a marvelous job. There are no weak actors. There is nothing needless in the movie - it just nails you to the chair with its subtle yet dark way of telling a story.Touching subjects from mental health care to fundamental human rights this movie is certainly something else.

uninspired cliché,"This movie is utterly craptastic in every aspect. From the very beginning to the very end it's a never ending plea for Oscar nominations, although not an unusual approach for a movie, this time Clint Eastwood took it too far. It's too obvious that the people behind and in front of the camera thinks too much about the ""oscar"" scenes than the outcome of the movie as a whole.Angelina Jolie does an average appearance in this role, although everyone knows that the role would be perfect for Nicole Kidman. Angelina may be pretty, but her ""fake"" look does not fit the 1930's scenario and her acting is not good enough.Several times during the movie a single line is repeated over and over to the point where it becomes annoying, and it seems to me that the writers just simply where out of good ideas.Sorry Clint, you fail. The movie might be based more or less on a true story, this is a farse of uninspired cliché.I know there will be loads of people disagreeing with me on this one, because if you got names like Clint Eastwood and Angelina Jolie on the cover you can sell people crap and make them eat it.Watch the movie twice and I'm sure you see my points.Tommy",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
An exquisitely accomplished drama,"As with many of Eastwood's other films, Changeling doesn't hold anything back, emotionally or thematically. Eastwood really bares his teeth here, and delivers as disturbing, frustrating, and aggravating a movie as any of his others. The story on display here, from an original screenplay by TV scribe J. Michael Straczynski, is shocking, infuriating and emotionally draining, and the fact that it's based on a true story lends it even more weight. As I mentioned already, Eastwood really doesn't hold anything back and the first half of the film, during which the protagonist undergoes a series of grueling, torturous events that she is powerless to fight against or to resist, including a stubborn and useless police force, lack of support from any authority figure (at least at first), and her eventual involuntary commitment into an insane asylum even though she is perfectly sane  and if anyone has read anything about insane asylums in the 1920's, they'll know that it wasn't a pretty sight.Uncharacteristically of Eastwood's films, which for the most part are inescapably bleak and offer no form of solace, with the second half of Changeling Eastwood offers us a beacon of hope that well-deserved justice has been served. I won't say that in the end the film is a ""feel-good"" movie, because everything leading up to its final act is, in accordance with Eastwood's previous body of work, inescapably bleak and depressing, but Eastwood does provide us with a form of dramatic closure that is rare in his recent body of work.Like all of Eastwood's films, in particular his recent ones, the film looks absolutely stunning; Eastwood shoots in the broad 2.35:1 aspect ratio, not often used in these dramas, and takes full advantage of the breadth it offers him. His cinematography is stark and striking, often utilizing one strong source of light and creating a very chiaroscuro, high-contrast look that really looks absolutely great. Production value is also top notch, and Eastwood captures every little detail of 1920's Los Angeles period with utmost care and attention. The film is also accompanied by a repetitive but very effective score by Eastwood himself that emphasizes the compliments the story and the drama with perfection.Unlike previous films like Unforgiven, Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby, Changeling's cast is for the most part composed of unknowns or character actors. Its only really has two big ""name"" actors, but both of them deliver such strong work that it really makes up for it. John Malkovich has a medium-sized supporting role and is as good as ever, perhaps angrier than usual but overall more strong work from the legend. But at the center of the film is the main performance: Angelina Jolie portrays the protagonist who is on screen throughout pretty much the entire movie, and delivers a performance so incredible, so powerful, so commanding and yet so subdued, so with such presence but also with such restraint and submission, that it really amazes me that there are still people out there that doubt her skills and abilities as an actress. Sure, she won the Oscar for her supporting role in Girl, Interrupted, but that was mostly for show; last year she delivered a far more accomplished and absolutely stunning performance in A Mighty Heart that was for the most part unjustly overlooked; hopefully she'll get her due this year for her amazing, incredible performance in Changeling. It's the best performance of her career, and one of the strongest leading female performances of the year.Overall, Changeling is an exquisitely accomplished drama: It tells a fascinating true story that is compelling to follow, and yet, Eastwood treats it far less like a mystery thriller as one would expect and far more as an in-depth character drama. Eastwood holds no emotion back and lets us feel a wide variety of emotions, from anger to frustration to hopelessness to sympathy, and Angelina Jolie, in the best show of her career, delivers a truly amazing, incredibly well-acted performance, playing her small character with such introverted restraint that it just emphasizes her presence in the film even more. I fail to understand how so many critics were emotionally detached from this film, as I felt it very hard to remain aloof in front of the film's deep emotions. Its mixed critical reaction renders it, in my opinion, as one of the more underrated movies of the year. In the end, Eastwood and co. deliver a fascinating, emotional melodrama while managing to skip over the melodrama and elevate the film to subtler, more naturalistic place.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Seamlessly Persuasive Success of One Rivetingly Acted, Written, Shot and Edited Scene After Another","This brooding film may not acquire as much credit as it should for the same reason that many films with flawlessly attractive stars do not. Angelina Jolie plays a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles who returns home from her job as a telephone operator one day to discover that her nine-year-old son Walter has disappeared. She has no idea why or how. All she knows is that the last thing she said to him was that she promised that tomorrow they will go to the movies. There is a powerful maternal instinct in Jolie which fuels her performance as a woman who goes through so much. She has a look that does not only evoke glamour and sexiness, but also a relative familiarity with the film's time period. Jolie puts on a powerful emotional display as a tenacious woman who gathers strength from the forces that oppose her. She reminds us that there is nothing so fierce as a mother protecting her cub. She inhabits this woman so deeply and persuasively that the camera is hardly conscious of Angelina Jolie, superstar and Goodwill Ambassador. But then again, there is no actor in this film that is anything but entirely convincing. And then, the camera has the same effect, and we are completely absorbed. And angry.Changeling opens as a typical story of a missing child, but it fundamentally stays outside the structure of a family drama to focus on a portrayal of a woman whose self-determination is seen as a menace to a male-dominated culture. The time and place are sketched as a city that acts towards women as if they are out of control, and defective when they have reservations about the reasoning of men. An assessment that the film has therefore been subject to sexist contempt derives contrast with that aimed at the women of this heavily engrossing drama's 1920s setting, suggesting maybe that attitudes towards independent, career-minded women have yet to entirely disappear in the prevailing years. Our protagonist challenges male-bred social beliefs and pays for it.Screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski carefully chooses not to crack down on the atrocious events involved in the story, favoring to tell it from Jolie's outlook. He sticks close to the facts of the case, something I wish more docudramas would do, because if the story is worth telling, it is bizarre enough that supplementing it with too many dramatized or fictitious aspects would call into doubt its reliability. There is just a handful of points at which, due to the lack of information, dramatization is necessary. But I am adamant that one does not read too much about this film before seeing it. Walk into the theater without any knowledge as to what happens. You know about Jolie's character and you know that her son goes missing. That is too much. Let the film take you on its journey in much the same way it takes her. The experience without preconception is that much more absorbing.Eastwood and Straszynski's seamless succession of one rivetingly acted, written, shot and edited scene after another puts on view that psychiatry became a device in the gender politics of the time, no more than a few years after women's suffrage was guaranteed. While women were no longer second class citizens, further upholding their individualism, mental institutions turned out to be major means utilized by the male establishment to lead to female disempowerment.As a director, Eastwood's continually been a classicist captivated by the decay beneath legends, and his films proliferate in a country's ethical drawbacks, in its outlook on a system's refusal to admit to its blunders, his latest film appears more densely linked to the War on Terror than his openly anti-war films. There is ample material for an analysis of maternal-spiritual displacement, though Jonathan Glazer's Birth never gave into elementary melodrama.Eastwood uses a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of security and contentment which incapacitated the movement toward equality throughout the former half of the 20th century. The closing shot in the film is a three-minute take in which Jolie walks off to ultimately grow to be lost in the crowded street. The camera pans upwards to show miles of city blocks, people walking the streets, cars passing and streetcars along tracks. The amount of visual effects, technical logistics and creative cinematography and production design all of this took must have been grueling, but to us, it is simply the atmosphere taken into the periphery of the experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Nutshell Review: Changeling,"J. Michael Straczynski of Babylon 5 fame wrote Changeling, which is based on the true story of one woman's fight against corruption, incompetence, accusations and intimidation, all the while in searching for the truth of what happened to her beloved 9 year old son, who vanished without a trace, only for the LAPD to try and convince her that the boy they found, was indeed her son. But that's just the gist of the first hour with plenty more in store, keeping you gripped to the screen as the story develops.I continue to admire the very human stories under the direction of Clint Eastwood. His films over the last few years have been nothing less than excellent, and Changeling adds to this stellar repertoire of his. There's a certain quiet confidence in the way his films get presented, like a veteran hand masterminding all elements to fall in place perfectly. What more, it's always a treat to have the film's score composed by Eastwood himself, and the main theme is already buzzing in my head already, way after the end credits have rolled.But of course the star of the show here is Angelina Jolie. While we had not the opportunity to watch her dramatic turn in A Mighty Heart on the big screen where she plays a woman searching for her husband and for the truth, we do get to see her here playing a mother searching for her child and for answers. I particularly liked the line where she said she's not here to pick fights, but she sure would finish one, and that practically sums her her fiercely combative character in a film where she doesn't get to literally kick arse.I guess local distributors prefer to play it safe and continue to feed us with the alpha-female roles that Jolie plays, from Lara Croft to Wanted, that it's a rare opportunity to see her in a dramatic role, reminding us that she has won awards before for such roles. This is certainly a chance not to miss, because there are numerous moments where she demonstrated her acting chops. I still cannot forget that one brilliant scene, which was almost the equivalent of Ralph Fiennes' in The Constant Gardener, where she didn't have to say her word, but just her expression alone had painted the phrase ""prepared for the worst, but hoping for the best"". That alone is worth the price of an admission ticket. I suppose being a real life mother, she would have no problems with translating what would possibly be any mother's fear of losing their child suddenly and without explanation.She provides a very solid performance that hinged on everyone in the audience being able to connect with her plight and exasperation, of sympathizing with her, and rooting for her as she faces obstacle after obstacle as she goes about doing sensible things that the authorities frown upon. You'll seethe with rage when others give that can't-be-bothered attitude to a helpless mom, and feel pity that while more could be done, no finger was lifted. You'll share that tinge of hope that things will turn out for the better, and feel sad at the disappointments faced along the way, each time hoping that the outcome would be better than the last.And here's where Straczynski's story excels. There are a number of threads running that converge nicely together, and while the movie clocks in over 140 minutes, you'll never feel time plod, as you get engaged into the story, feel for the characters, and at the same time, enjoy the excellent recreation of the 1920s. There's a little bit of everything that managed to cram itself here, from mystery to courtroom drama, showcasing a variety of story settings, dealing with themes such as justice and integrity.It also contains a very strong critique of authority which is given too much power without proper checks and balances, that such power could be corrupted and abused for personal gain, before it takes those who are resolute in doing the right thing, to push for change. John Malkovich has a supporting role here as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, who has a congregation behind him as he tells it as it is in his weekly radio shows, and provides much needed intervention to assist Jolie's Christine Collins along the way.Changeling becomes the first movie this new year that I would highly recommended without hesitation. Go watch it when it opens on the 15th!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Son if a Jolie,"Changeling- ***1/2 out of **** By Kevin Muller With all the press lately about Angelina Jolie being ""Uncool"" people may have forgotten she is a movie star with a new movie out. With this film, Jolie reminds us why she is one of Hollywood's greatest talents. Seriously, if Jolie isn't nominated for an Oscar come February, it is a crime. In ""Changeling"" she dives so far into her character and displays every emotion with such ease that it will make you glad you spent money on a ticket to this fantastic film.Clint Eastwood, who directed this picture, really explores the dark side of human emotions in this picture. Anyone who has seem ""Mystic River"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Unforgiven"" knows that Mr. Eastwood can easily tell a story about the ugliness of human nature. With ""Changeling"", he goes a step further and really makes us feel uncomfortable because this time the victims aren't a bunch of cowboys, a teen girl or a adult female boxer, but little children.For those of you who don't know, the movie is inspired by true events that took place in 1930's Los Angles, when the cops ran things their way with no questions. Jolie plays Christine Collins, a mild mannered telephone operator, who is raising her son Walter. One day she she arrives home to find her son missing. Like any other mother, she starts to search for her son with the help of the police. Three months later, the police say they have found her son and hand over a boy who doesn't resemble her son at all. Christine keep insisting that the boy isn't her son, but the police keep making up excuses to cover their own tracks; even going so far as saying that the obvious case of her son's shrinking height is due to some connection to distress that he probably went through while captured. I won't give away any more of the plot, but things do get ugly and the only one on Christine's side is a local preacher Gustav Briegleb (John Malcovich) who has a extremem distaste for the LAPD.The movie is quite long, running almost two and half hours, but it is worth it because Eastwood is a master story teller, who doesn't let everything unravel all at once. The time period is perfectly mimicked as are the costumes. What Eastwood and screen writer J . Michael Straczynski accomplish is making a picture that is both filled with both hope and hopelessness. You feel Christine's highs and lows because the movie takes its time connecting you to her. There is a scene where Jolie comes face to face with the suspected killer, pleading him to tell the where abouts of the son, which is so powerful that you just are taken a back how amazing Jolie is in this scene. She throws him around like a doll, slaps him, bullies him and you feel every emotion she is throwing at this man.""Changeling"" is definitely an adult picture, with moments being almost as dark as 1995's ""Se7en."" Most of all, and I can't stress this enough, it is a emotions picture about the undying love and drive of a woman who has lost her son, acted out beautifully by a beautiful and talented actress.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another profoundly moving film from Clint Eastwood,"This film is about a single mother whose son has gone missing. Five months later, the police finds her son, but she insists the police have made a mistake.I have always found Clint Eastwood's film profoundly moving, and I have expected ""Changeling"" to be so. Only ""Changeling"" surpasses my expectations, and moves me right to the core. What Christine Collins has to go through is completely shocking and saddening. Her unwavering struggle for truth is truly inspiring. Angelina Jolie's perfect acting of an anxious but hopeful mother is amazing, she brings her character to life, connecting with the audience on multiple levels. No wonder Angelina Jolie has stated in interviews that during the filming of ""Changeling"" she was so worried about her children that she had to have at least half of her children in the set.The production is also excellent, with the sets and lighting all made just the right tone to fit into the mood of the film. I am also glad the ending is somewhat vague but gives enough hope for people to ponder on. ""Changeling"" is deeply moving, whether or not you have children.",,Anonymous,Biography
A surprising disappointment,"No one involved in this project has anything to prove. The assembling of such talent pretty much assures a positive outcome, yet, there's something missing here, and what's missing is crucial. The director focuses on the surfaces of this story and everything seems glazed and frozen. Particularly, Ms. Jolie who brought such passion to ""A Mighty Heart""; she never convinced me of the desperation a mother must have felt in this situation.But the real fault is in the screenplay by J. Michael Straczynski which has to incorporate some pretty sensational material that the viewer constantly wants to reject. At least 40 minutes of the entire running time of this film incorporates a second story that is absent in the previews. That story belongs in a genre of films like ""Se7en"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" While I'm a big fan of horror films, I was unprepared for where this story went. All the facts here are documented by court and police records, yet as presented it's too fantastical to believe. And given the care of the elements in art direction, it's easy for the viewer to remain focused, say, on how carefully Ms. Jolie's elaborate make-up is applied.Eastwood is capable of masterpieces. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film that any director would have been proud to have his name on. Throughout his career he's been surrounded by the perverse and the extreme, and ""Changeling"" seems only an excuse to wallow in the perverse and the extreme.It's too bad, because the material, in the right hands, would have been electrifying. This, however, is only tedious with a few sequences that show promise, then we get the death thoes of someone shoved in our face while Ms. Jolie stands and looks beautiful; and, we wonder what on earth the character must be thinking (and where on earth is the director besides fussing with some period detail).",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I say this from many, many years of having lived in that city, and having seem firsthand how heavy handed they are, and how hostile they continue to be, to the people of LA.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just A Cut Above Average,"Changeling stars perhaps the most talked about person in Hollywood. Why do I even mention that? Well, I think it has an impact on the marketing for the film. Anything with Angelia Jolie is going to get attention whether it is deserving or not. I think this movie is worth talking about but I'm not so sure that Jolie's performance in the film is one of the best of the year as her Oscar nomination would tend to disagree with me.This is a factual story of a mother, Christine Collins, and her 9 year old little boy that disappeared. The Los Angeles Police Department is running wild with corruption in 1928, when the boy went missing. A few months after the disappearance, her son, Walter, was found alive in Illinois. There was a big problem. Collins said the boy was not hers. The police naturally tried to hold this case up as an example of their good police work. Collins protested and the police were determined to silence her. It was proved that the returned boy was three inches shorter than Walter, he was not recognized by school and classmates, not even the dental records matched. Still Collins was informed that she was crazy and the police had her locked up in a psychiatric ward.This film is directed by legendary Clint Eastwood. He chooses not to structure the film in a thriller type of format and does not keep his audience in the dark but rather tries to educate the audience and engage them. The story is more of a commentary and forthright storytelling in an artfully edited way. Eastwood does some amazing work here. He does it with just the right actress in Angelina Jolie. She is wonderful to watch in this totally believable and just portrayal of Christine Collins.Equally delightful in the film id John Malkovich as Reverand Gustav Briegleb. The Reverand was a radio preacher and used his show to bring attention to the rampant police corruption of the time. The LAPD works to hide their bad reputation. Collins is treated as mentally ill, which is virtually looked at as a crime in 1938 and handled with drugs, shock treatment and restraint. The story is told by the filmmakers, just told as it happened. The story is neatly condensed.Changeling is a good film and Eastwood delivers with a great cast. It is also a story worthy of being told as most stories of this caliber are. This is meat and potatoes story telling and few chances are being taken and while there is certainly commentary in the manner of the film-making and choices made by the actors there just isn't much thinking outside the box and that is what makes the film more ordinary than extra.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"In a time of systemic misogyny, even a mother wouldn't know...","Clint Eastwood's ""Changeling' runs for almost two hours and half and yet there's no scene I would take out. In fact, the more I process the narrative, the more I find it perfect for a mini-series format. IMDb says that writer J. Michael Straczynski intended to make the film for TV, having cumulated a huge documentation on the ""Wineville Chicken Coop Murders"" and the disappearance of Walter Collins and it's true the film has such a dense a rich material that I could count almost five or six cliffhangers.It starts with Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) living alone with her boy Walter (Gattlin Griffith) in Wineville, near Los Angeles. The story is set in 1928 where single mothers were not only rare but rather ill-regarded by the good society. The husband left the house after Walter's birth, but like a modern mother even by our standards, Christine took good care of him, teaching him good manners and toughness and ensuring a comfortable living thanks to her salary; she's a competent manager in a telephone company. One day, the son disappears. First shock.Alerting the Police after a night of research in the neighborhood, she faces her first wall of uncooperativeness when she's requested to wait for 24 hours after the boy disappeared. Days go by, she goes the full support from local minister Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) who delivers a powerful ""J'Accuse"" speech against the Los Angeles Police Department and provides the viewer an interesting insight that will explain the Police's answer to Christine's despair. A boy is found and Police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) happily announces the good news and invites the Press to cover the train station reunion. But Christine Collins is positive: that's not her boy.Marking the most pivotal point of the film, that ""he's not my boy"" statement will be all throughout the first act Christin's plea, repeated as insistently and desperately as Meryl Streep crying ""The Dingo took my baby""... and like for Lindy Chamberlain, the more she'll cry, the more counter-productive it'll be for her and infuriating the experience for us. It's so obvious that a mother would know, let alone when the boy is circumsised and three inches shorter than her son but the patronizing Donovan refuses to believe her, or maybe he does and wouldn't allow that the one meager victory from the Police to be a flop.And so Jones deems her as hysterical and pulls a Code 12: which means pushing women in mental institutes when they became noisy disturbances. And so begins the journey in the 'hospital' where Christine will maintain that she was given the wrong boy, digging her deeper in the mud of insanity. Meanwhile, through a competent cop Ybarra (Michael Kelly), the plot takes us to the path of Gordon Northcuff the notorious serial killer who abducted and killed boys in the 20s. Northcuff (played by the excellent Jason Butler Harner) would have probably escaped the Law if it wasn't for his guilt-ridden nephew who denounced him and himself as the bait used to convince kids into getting into Gordon's car.Once the first bodies are unburied in the criminal's ranch, Christine is free and learns from the reverend the extent of police corruption. Not only cops were using hospital as dumping grounds for ""troublemakers"" but they also wiped out criminals because they were competitors to their own alcohol traffics (those were the Prohibition days). So many things happen in the film that it's a miracle Clint Eastwood could sustain it in a less than three-hour format, but that's due to his straight-to-the-point approach. He doesn't waste time building up characters: actions and reactions speak for them and while the events unfold, we realize the unspoken depths and darkest sides of each, including the kid who pretended to be Christine's son.As for Christine, she goes into every stage ; from trusting the police to pure bafflement and then revolt. In fact if you discount the procedurals part, there are two essential themes that Eastwood harbors in this film: corruption (moral and legal) and vulnerability (physical and legal) whether little boys at the mercy of sexual predators or women confronted to systemic misogyny. Eastwood declared that he came from a time where chivalry put women on a pedestal but indirectly ranked them as secondary citizens, members of the ""weaker sex"". And that's the most infuriating part: where Christine is slowly gaslighted and forced to think that she's troubled by her motherly instinct, or worse, that in the name of it, she would accept a kid who's not hers.There's a whole conspiracy against her that culminates in the hospital when she doesn't even know how to behave. It's a losing game where women are treated in the most condescending way, using the old excuse that they're incapable of rationality; victim of a system that would be labeled as 'toxic patriarchy' in the way it uses mothers and women as scapegoats. Such a shameful legacy that even the town changed its name. With the resonance of a pamphlet, Eastwood still avoids the trap of the political comment, he shows the corruption of the system through an example we can relate to and shows examples of true morality and bravura that allowed Christine to triumph in a never-ending quest for truth.""Changeling"" is a solid film with a rather peaceful theme, it doesn't go for spectacularity because the sight of a distraught mother is spectacular enough and as Christine, Angelina Jolie delivers the kind of performance that would be perfect for an Oscar... if it wasn't a year for a sympathy one. Her emotionality is the key element of the film because it does two things at once: it builds our empathy but it works against her. Ironically, the man who commit these crimes went on sobbing, wheezing like a baby, indirectly proving that good people are indeed sensitive while monsters are simply wimps in disguise.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The anguish of a mother's love.,"I confess that I was not expecting this film to be so interesting. It's truly awesome. Partly based on a true case that took place about a hundred years ago, the film is loaded with feelings that are difficult to digest and absorb. Skillfully directed by Clint Eastwood, who once again presents us with a piece of great technical quality and good dramatic sense, the film is absolutely memorable.The script is the main strength of the film, and it's really worth highlighting. I think it is really difficult to remain indifferent to a story so fraught with suffering and where the police are so deserving of censorship. The whole story revolves around the disappearance of a child and the incessant search for its mother, against all expectations and against the will of the authorities themselves, who presented a child to her as their child and never took it seriously when the mother said not to be the right child. It is a well-written and skillfully developed script.Another aspect that deserves positive mention is the colossal and talented work of Angelina Jolie in the main role. She has, on several occasions, already shown us her talent, this is nothing new, but it is always pleasant to see a great actress giving us another excellent performance. Here, the actress was perfectly able to clearly express that mother's mental anguish and psychological torture. In addition, the film also has an excellent contribution from John Malkovich, in the role of a religious pastor who is determined to help that mother by seeing her as a victim of arrogant and cruel police, and Colm Feore, in the role of the Police commander, ultimately responsible for their mistakes and negligence.Technically, it's a film that has excellent production values. The film is not long and the pace is excellent, allowing each point of the plot to get its best development. Being a period film, the sets and costumes take on greater relevance, and were excellent in the task of contextualizing the audience and the story in time and space. Finally, a word of appreciation for the great soundtrack.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The whole movie keeps you guessing and waiting for the mother to find her child. When she finally gets her boy back and finds out it's not her child she begins to wonder what happened to her child. The movie was riveting and suspenseful. It was extremely slow moving and didn't pick up at any point in the movie. The scenes you thought it would pick up at it slowed back down. It was sad and a very inspiring and emotional movie. It wasn't that hard to follow just pay attention and you will understand everything that happens.

"A True story of the cruelties of mankind, expertly portrayed by all involved","Changeling is considered a Biographical Crime Drama, but to me it is a character study based on true events, that depicts the cruelties that people in power either political, law enforcement, or criminal power commit on the rest of society.

The climax of the film is saddening and heart breaking.This film is undoubtedly a must watch film for all the age groups and if you are parents then you should watch this film with a tissue box.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Why it is not in Top 250??????????,"I saw this film and it disturbs me in several departments. How many it says...1) It says the mother's love and what she would do for her son..She would bring down the whole world for him.2) A murdering psychopath of different style. Other than the style he is sick and horrible.3) The trust of the mental hospitals,asylums are no longer exist for me after seeing this movie, One flew over the cuckoo's nest. We should do something about that.4) The police are not god and they will make mistakes too...The trust with their department too ripped away.5) What would be a man's reaction in his final five minutes..beautifully portrayed by eastwood.This film definitely deserves its place in the TOP 250 and Oscar win too...Mistakenly something happened i think. 9/10 for me and must see...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A cracking release from 2008,"Dark!'Changeling' is a cracking release from 2008. Angelina Jolie gives a superb performance in the lead role, in a plot that is rather harrowing whilst also being actually incredibly infuriating - as in, the film does a great job at making the antagonists the antagonists.The cast, spearheaded by Jolie, are excellent. No-one is on her level per se, but there are very good performances from the likes of John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan and Geoff Pierson; kid actor Eddie Alderson also impresses.I will say that the story wraps up in a quicker manner than I thought it would, though the pacing of the 142 minute run time is in fact one of its positives - even at that length, I feel it could've drawn out the court trial stuff longer; though that may have hindered the pacing, so it's not really a noteworthy criticism of mine at all.One worth recommending, no doubt!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A truly Great Film and a Great Cast Too.,"I just saw Changeling and I have to say that the movie is very good. I think that Clint Eastwood did a good job directing the movie. The movie star Angelina Jolie, Michael Kelly, John Malkovich , Colm Feore, Jeffrey Donovan, Jason Butler Harner, and Geoff Pierson. The cast a great job in the movie. The movie is based on true events that took place in 1928. The movie is about is about a boy Walter Collins who goes missing on March 10, 1928 and Christine Collins who is trying to find her son. When the La Police Department tells her that they have found her son only to get there and find out that the boy they found is not her son and the police department trying to convince her that the boy they found is indeed her son. The movie deals with the corruption that was going with the police department at the time. This is a movie that you will be talking about soon after the credits roll. Both Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich really shine in this movie. They both should get Oscars for their performance in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Felt long, but in the end I understood why","I've been waiting to see this movie since I first saw a trailer and then I read some of the critics reviews when it opened; I was concerned. But never one to listen to critics (thank God) I went to see for myself and I was pleased. This is a good movie with a good story. Angelina Jolie is good in the role of Christine Collins, even though I find it hard to look at her blown up lips. John Malkovic and Jeff Donovan (Officer Johnson) were also good, though I couldn't find Donovan's name in the IMDb character list.I was a little annoyed as the movie seemed to go on and on but then I understood why Clint Eastwood wanted to finish the story.

An excellent film! Congratulations to all who made this!,"This is a well crafted film and a very moving story. Mr. Clint Eastwood's directing is, as always, superb - his deft austerity of style finely balanced with the patience to capture the emotional depth and integrity of the performances. He clearly understands the needs of actors and also knows how to remain creatively open to capture the brilliant moments as they happen.Ms. Angelina Jolie is impeccable and truthful as Christine Collins. Her performance is visceral in emotion yet subtle. It is wonderful to see her become the character to the point where we forget we are watching Angelina Jolie but instead are captivated by her character. That is the mark of being more than a star, but being a true actor.Mr. John Malkovich also achieves this, never wavering from the truth of the scene. His performance in this film is heartfelt and real, his acting without pretense. Pure, focused, and most importantly, authentic. It is a refreshing reminder of why he is so revered.The other actors in this film stepped up to the plate and gave commendable performances. Colm Feore is, as always, engaging in his charm (practiced without seeming so), Jason Butler Harner natural and upsetting (as the character should be), Jeffrey Donovan riveting and precise (like a finely tuned instrument) Michael Kelly edgy and honest (an honest cop without ever being cliché) Amy Ryan exciting and unwavering (always real in each moment). The list goes on.Critics often criticize rather than critique. I am not a critic. I am a filmmaker, thus it is rare that a film will engage me to the point where I am no longer dissecting it as I am watching. This one did, so I felt compelled to write something. For what it is worth, Bravo to everyone involved, to the Writer for bringing this story to light and to the Producers who believed enough make it happen and to the Cast and Crew for what is clearly a successful collaboration. Let us hope that Hollywood takes the time to make more films like this one.Regards, David Krae",,Anonymous,Biography
"A great film, but some questions","I am NOT an Angelina Jolie fan, but found this movie engrossing nonetheless. However, crime solver that I am, there were a couple of loose ends in the film that left me wondering. First, when Ms. Collins goes to the train station to get her 'son' and realizes it isn't him, and then is bullied into taking him home, why doesn't she think to have the kid's fingerprints taken and compared to her son's? Also, at the end, when the boy is being interviewed about the escape and said he didn't know what happened to Walter, why did the police not talk to the nephew of the killer, the boy who told the story initially? He was with his uncle (or was it cousin) when they chased the escaped boys, and surely he would know if Walter was caught and then killed. It seems that the answer would have been easy to obtain, rather than have her wait years and years with no closure.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Eastwood Masterpiece,"No question about it, ""Changeling"" will be up for several Oscars. Cint Eastwood for Directing; Angelina for Best Actress, John Malkovich for Best Supporting Actor, best costume, best choreography and the film as Best of the year. I found it riveting beyond belief. The fastest 2:21 imaginable. An incredible story of murder, corruption and redemption. Never before had I been impressed with Mrs. Pitt's acting skills but I am now. I never thought that any female actress would ever approach the performance of Hilary Swank in Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" but Clint sure as heck was able to draw on and embellish every bit of talent in Angelina's being.And in conclusion may I say that anyone writing a spoiler for this totally amazing film deserves no better than a Lizzie Borden-- 40 whacks of an axe. Enough said.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good film with interesting plot, but with flaws and bad performances","Most actors are unknown (at least to me), and they are NOT good enough. The acting of all the kids is AWFUL!, especially so the most crucial character of all, that has to do with the disclosure of the mystery. (There are lots of great kid-actors all over TV, how come they were not casted and hired?!) Jolie's performance is not good, though not dreadfully bad. All characters are poorly depicted and cartoonized, and in a simply unbearable fashion the doctor at the Psychiatric Hospital! (and that is, unfortunately, Eastwood's responsibility.) The film is well paced, well directed, well photographed, as should be expected from any good director such as Clint Eastwood is. However, somehow he does not convey the proper tension and terror in those moments that the script required such elements (I felt the same in ""Mystic River""). I did pick the line that includes a word for a certain type of felony only coined decades later than the one portrayed by the film (the 30s), and it puzzled me as a flaw by the writer.I am a pro composer/arranger/producer/pianist from Paraguay (jazz-oriented), and knew right away from the first piano notes that that was Clint's musical statement. Very simple, somewhat corny, but effective melancholy-wise. Great composer-arranger Lenny Niehaus did not need to sweat too much throughout this movie. All in all:",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solid adult alternative to the latest superhero flick,"Another mature and thought-provoking film from Eastwood the director, this one based on a real-life incident.The movie is subtle, reflective and pleasingly mature, focusing on the emotional side of the story throughout, and this allows leading actress Angelina Jolie to give her best performance to date (although that's not difficult, considering the type of lunk-headed blockbusters she's used to making - TOMB RAIDER anyone? I thought not).Coming from Eastwood, it's a technical marvel, with flawless attention to detail (the 1920s-era fashions are particularly commendable) and a wide reaching story that's drip-fed at just the right level. I did find it slightly overlong, though - the first hour is more than a little repetitive with all the ""he's not my son"" dialogue - but once the police corruption angle becomes highlighted it really picks up.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Clint Eastwood is a mediocre director.,"I don't know why he's praised so much. His movies all look the same. Muddled. And the problem with this one is it's overrated, through his and the actress he picked for the main part's success. Angelina Jolie. I never thought she was bad, but this movie proved me wrong. Here again, I can't understand the rage, and how she won awards for this part. She was so bad it almost made me laugh. The storyline in itself, is not very captivating and a little disjointed at times. The commitment and trial parts, looked rushed, yet I still managed to find the film too long. Or simply focusing too much on minor details, when it ends abruptly. It was amateur at best. Fortunately the rest of the distribution was good, very good even (Malkovich comes to mind), and the depiction of 1920s America, was not too typical of film noir. Which is something I appreciated, and prevented me from completely losing interest, when the main investigation was struggling...",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Clint Eastwood film to date,"""Changeling"" is a film encompassing multiple plot elements: L.A. police corruption during the '20s, gender politics of the '20s, and power-hungry public figures. However all of these elements branch from the spine of this plot in which a single mother, (Christine Collins played by Angelina Jolie) comes home one day to find that her young son Walter, has disappeared. After some investigation the police return a young boy to her custody whom they claim to be her son. Collins however, believes this boy to be an impostor, and on her search to find the son she feels she's lost, she finds herself up against a web of corruption, and the gauntlet of a very public crusade against it.The plot devices of the injustices of police corruption, and a society that believes women to be fragile of body, mind and character; are compelling and empowering to say the least. The bleakness of Eastwood's tone (the cooler color schemes, the sparse soundtrack, and the seemingly endless roster of selfishly driven archetypical characters) make Christine's struggle appear to be an impossible one. However if you are a parent or have parental instincts you feel emotionally obligated to go on this journey with her.The characters are interestingly portrayed. The bad guys are REALLY bad, and the sympathetic characters are all afflicted in some way; Hardly the hopeful message this film drives towards. The film continues to get even more morbid than expected when it delves into a sensitive subject that has been navigated by Eastwood with both tact, and brutal honesty; and that subject is that of child predators. Much of the violence against children is psychological as opposed to graphic, but it is disturbing to sit through nonetheless. However this plot element is so effective due to brilliant casting. Jason Butler Harner, who plays Gordon Northcott (a child killer who might've killed Collins' son) was particularly good in his role; not just for his portrayal of Northcott's tortured motivations, but for his cowardice, (because let's face it; the only killers capable of preying on the most innocent and defenseless members of society are cowards.) Also quite notable was the child actor Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark: Northcott's young accomplice.And yet as you continue on this dark, disturbing journey with Christine Collins, although the triumphs are few and far between, you understand her unwavering vigilance. You come to understand that although she may never find her son, the small victories she did accomplish wouldn't have happened without her undying sense of hope in the face of despair. I recommend seeing ""Changeling"" for the dramatic portrayal of a true story of hope. However, be prepared to have your heart broken a few times along the way.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"If You Want to Ensure Your Film Won't Be a Masterpiece, Cast Either Half of Brangelina","Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are perfectly matched, as both boast beautiful faces and a painful lack of serious acting ability.However, in an acting face off, I'd put my money on Jolie. She did much better with her 2008 Oscar-bait outing, ""Changeling,"" than Pitt did with his, ""The Curiously Boring and Pointless Case of the Blank-Faced Benjamin Button."" Jolie plays Christine Collins, a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles whose son goes missing. When the corrupt police department return the wrong boy to her and she tries to raise a stink about it, they have her committed to a mental institution rather than admit their embarrassing mistake. But eventually, a grisly discovery becomes too large a story to ignore, and the LAPD is brought to task for its dirty dealings.""Changeling"" is a solid accomplishment from director Clint Eastwood. It's not anywhere nearly as good as his other 2008 film, ""Gran Torino,"" but it's not nearly as bad as its critical reception had led me to expect. But the film succeeds largely in spite of Jolie's performance rather than because of it. Jolie is simply not able to make sense of this character. Maybe the fault is with the casting in the first place. We have to believe that Christine Collins is timid and mousy enough to allow herself, even for a moment, to believe that the boy returned to her is in fact her son, even though she's convinced he's not. But there's not a timid bone in Jolie's body, and that part of the film never makes an ounce of sense. The Christine Collins we see humbly bowing to the whims of the police doesn't match up with the Christine Collins we see in the workplace, barking orders in her role as a manager, or the flirty, glamour puss Collins that emerges toward the film's end. Pick a character, any character.There are some quite disturbing scenes involving violence toward children (violence seems almost too mild a term for what's actually done to them), scenes that are only slightly less disturbing than the ones in which John Malkovich appears, playing a pastor who aids Collins in her fight against corruption. Malkovich, by simply appearing in a film, brings it a healthy dose of ""ick"" factor, but I liked him here probably more than I ever have, just because he's one of the only characters in the movie who's not a slimeball. Jeffrey Donovan, of ""Burn Notice"" fame, plays the chief of police and decides for some reason to use an Irish accent that never quite materializes completely. Amy Ryan also appears as a fellow inmate in the institution, and looks and sounds like she should be starring in a women's prison film set in 1987.However, the film itself looks good, and though it meanders a bit, it's always engaging. Because Eastwood chooses to give it an old-time Hollywood movie feeling, some of the more histrionic and heavy-handed elements go down smoother than they might otherwise. Let's face it, the man knows his way around a movie set, and he's probably incapable of making an outright bad movie.But next time, I might suggest that he check to see if Julianne Moore is available.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fine movie - but a tough watch,"This is the latest movie from Clint Eastwood and it's fair to say that it's a showcase for a director who's at the top of his game. One of the trademarks of Eastwood is the slow delivery, but this shouldn't be confused with a movie that is boring. The pace of the movie gives you time to empathise with the characters and consider the events that are unfolding.I don't know how well known this story is in America, but it isn't something I was familiar with. I'm not sure how much artistic license was taken, but it is based on the true story of a 1928 child abduction in LA. Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins who is the unfortunate Mother. I watched the story unfold with amazement as the trials and tribulations of Christine are played out on the big screen. This is a fine performance by Jolie although I think it's also fair to say that this must have been a fairly prized role for actresses around the world. I for one certainly wouldn't be surprised if she nabs the Oscar for it.The film is quite a tough watch at times and there's very little feel good factor. Probably not for the adrenalin junkies or a first date, but a great film for those who love character based films or real life tales. Definitely one of the top movies of 2008.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
a mother searching for her son,"I hesitated quite a bit before deciding to dedicate 2 hours and 20 minutes of my time to watching Clint Eastwood's 2008 movie 'Changeling'. One of the reasons is Clint himself, I'm not one of his enthusiastic fans, and every time I face a film of his, the result is that I appreciate the film, including his talent and professionalism as a director, but I can't say I like it. There is something in his subjects and in the rigidity of his approach that keeps me at a distance. In addition, this film strongly desires to warn the audiences starting from the poster and from the introducing titles that it is based upon a 'true story'. Paradoxically, this kind of aggressive marketing makes me pay close attention to the artistic authenticity of the film, which depends on many other factors that have nothing to do with the anecdotal detail that what we see on screen is faithful or very faithful to events that happened in reality. Some of my fears were confirmed by watching 'Changeling', but fortunately there are many other reasons why at the end of watching the viewers have a chance to be satisfied even if they are not among Clint's fans.Most of the story takes place in Los Angeles in 1928, with an ending that lasts until 1935. That was the year before the Great Depression and the end of a period of expansion in California. Angelina Jolie (Angelina Jolie) is what today we call a 'single mother'. Her husband left her on the birthday of their son, Walter, and she works hard at the telephone company to ensure a decent living. One day, on a Saturday when she was called to work, 9-year-old Walter disappears. Kidnapped? Murdered? Strange events took place in California at that time, including the disappearance of children. After a few months, the police announce that Walter has been found on the other side of America, but when he appears, Christine is convinced that the boy police brought to her is not her son. From here the action branches into two parallel threads. One is a social drama about the single woman facing a corrupt system that refuses to admit mistakes and goes so far as to lock her up in a psychiatric institution to make her accept the official version. The other is a police investigation into the abduction of children, possibly related to the boy's disappearance. Spectators will judge the extent to which the two threads of the story merge and clarify each other.Clint Eastwood seems to love so much the cinema of the 60s and 70s, the timewhen he was at the peak of his acting career, that even now, when he is a well-known director, some the films he directs have a flavour that belongs to that era. The 2008 'Changeling' is a film about the late '20s that seems to have been made in the' 70s. The screenplay written by J. Michael Straczynski has an interesting idea, switching over two cinematic stereotypes. Unlike a few other Hollywood movies that retrospectively forgive the LAPD and its officers of any guilt in connection with the violent methods used to fight organised crime, in 'Changeling' the police plays the role of the 'bad guys', while to the help of the single woman fighting the system comes as the 'good guy' a preacher with a radio audience, the kind of those who would gain a much worse reputation, at least in movies. John Malkovich seems a bit over-cast in the role of Pastor Gustav Briegleb. I greatly appreciated the acting performance of an actor I didn't know, Jason Butler Harner in the role of a criminal the kind that Peter Lorre was undertaking in the 1930s in the films of Fritz Lang and Alfred Hitchcock. Angelina Jolie didn't convince me here either that she deserves her acting fame. Tom Stern's cinematography, on the other hand, is remarkable, with scenes filmed on location appropriately enhanced by computers to reconstruct the topography of the period, plus an impressive parade of cars of the time. I also liked the music, chosen and composed by Eastwood himself - discreet enough not to bother and expressive enough to emphasize the mood, with a main theme that deserves to be added to the playlist of famous musical themes. For me, 'Changeling' - like other Eastwood-directed films - failed to engage me emotionally, but many of its artistic qualities are to be appreciated and make the film worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great 2008 film found!!!!!!!!!,"Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood does not change much does he? He continues his non-changing hot streak of directing emotionally powerful films in his twilight time. His latest ""Changeling"" stars Angelina Jolie as Christine Collins, a single mom in 1920's Los Angeles whose son goes missing and then found by the L.A.P.D., but it turns out that the boy located is not her real son. The film is based on a true story, but I guess Clint did have to make a few changelings for dramatic enhancement touches. 'Changeling"" channels itself into such themes as: police corruption, despicable murders, and mental institutionalism. Jolie's performance should not be missing from the list of top female acting efforts of the year. It would be another case of corruption in L.A. if Jolie is not nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award. The supporting thespian performances of the film were the right ones found for Oscar consideration: Me gusta John Malkovich's work as Rev. Gustav Briegleb, an advocate on fighting police corruption; Jason Butler Harner was monstrously amazing as the loathsome Gordon Northcott; Amy Ryan is not yet ""gone baby gone"" from strong acting with her wicked performance as psych ward patient Carol Dexter; Jeffrey Donovan as ""bad cop"" Captain Corrupter J.J. Jones was commanding; and Michael Kelly was solid as ""good cop"" Detective Lester Ybarra. OK, I will stop playing ""good cop, bad cop"". Hey, but you know what ""Kids Are Good Actors Too"". The child actors in the film were phenomenal and should have plenty of ""changelings"" in their pockets and bling-bling on their necks & wrists for years to come! So acting kids' kudos goes out to: Gattlin Griffith as Walter Collins, Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark, and the rest of their child thespian colleagues of ""Changeling"". Let's change the subject of ""Changeling"" and get technical! Because the cinematography, art direction, costumes, sound, sound editing, and score (by none other than Eastwood himself) of the film are all worthy to be found and not missing from the Academy Awards nomination list for their respected categories. Scriber J. Michael Straczynski effectively put the word out on ""Changeling"" with sturdy emotional pathos that will leave you uneasy but in tuned. Lastly, one cannot ignore that Hollywood God Eastwood was the proficient main orchestrator of ""Changeling"" and I think the Academy will ""make his day"" once again by nominating Clint for Best Director. So change your plans today and allocate some time to locate ""Changeling"" at your nearest theatre. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very odd and not in a good way!,"Having heard good things about this film and read much about the background to the case I watched 'Changeling' with high hopes. The film opened well, wonderful attention to detail and an unearthly quality which I felt added tension and unease to the film. In fact, unease was my overall reaction to this film. This unease might have been positive, in that it was engendered by the unpleasant deaths of the children or the suffering of Walter's mother or that of the 'patients' at the institution. However the unease was I think caused by the oddly detached performance of Jolie and the clinical nature of the CGI and sets. Everything appeared as though shot through a thick slice of glass. The main, very obvious fault with this film is one neither cast nor director could hope to fully overcome. That is it's breadth. It attempts to cover aspects of the abduction and murder of children by a serial killer and his trial and execution. The systematic mistreatment of patients in an institution. The (undisclosed) relationship between a radio preacher and whistle-blower and the mother of the abducted child. The corruption endemic in the LAPD during the period and it's treatment by the press and eventual prosecution. Unfortunately the film doesn't venture in any depth into any of the above themes, it merely scratches their surface. Without doubt, I would have liked the film to concentrate near exclusively on Collins and the pastor and the ambiguous nature of her search and their relationship. Two further things omitted from the film were Collins culpability, having left the child unattended and secondly the glaring absence of any father or extended family. Perhaps if Eastwood had narrowed the films scope, combining that with the ambiguities inherent in the story and the claustrophobic camera work a more satisfying product may have emerged. Despite it's many faults this films' oddity, if anything serves as a mild recommendation, even if the complex story behind it proves more interesting.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
'I Want my son back!',"The line above is what dragged me to the movies on a rainy night on Halloween (i mean the 3:50pm show, almost night-time eh, had to be home for supper). I found it extremely absurd for a corporation like the widely known LAPD to return a wrong child and insist on his upbringing. One can't help but laugh and think is this for real or what? But when I learned of the true events behind this picture my heart just shrank. The humor just flew out the window...This is not a laughing matter not when the disappearance of a child and his possible homicide are feared. My heart goes out to anyone who has lost a child in similar circumstances to that of Christine Collins.I was very impressed with the film's cinematography which made me delve in the late 1920's era. Also with Jolie's performance as been very alive on screen as the victimized mother of the missing child. You feel for her after all all she wanted was her son returned. Not a big story that would be made into a picture more than half a century later so people can see it nominated for an academy award.

jaw-dropping true story,"If ""Changeling"" didn't tell us right up front that it was based on a true story, one might be easily forgiven for dismissing it as nothing more than far-fetched and implausible melodrama. But since truth so often IS stranger than fiction, we can but sit back in openmouthed disbelief as this most bizarre of bizarre scenarios unfolds before us.Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins, a single mother living with her nine-year-old son, Walter, in 1928 Los Angeles. When Walter goes missing one day, the frantic mother pleads with the police to find him. After five long months of grueling suspense, Christine is finally reunited with her child. Or is she? For while the police, eager to close the case for publicity purposes, insist that the boy they've found is indeed her missing son, Christine knows otherwise and spends the next few months attempting to convince anyone who'll listen that her real son is still out there somewhere and that the boy living with her is an imposter. John Malkovich co-stars as a crusading radio preacher who takes up the cause of this understandably distraught mother against the increasingly disreputable and malicious LAPD.Written by J. Michael Straczynski and directed by Clint Eastwood (who also wrote the musical score), ""Changeling"" is a gripping human drama that keeps us on tenterhooks every step of its narrative-shifting way. Going well beyond the surface fascinations of the plot, the movie broadens out to become a compelling study of police corruption and of one woman's battle for justice against a totalitarian, bureaucratic system. Throughout, the audience is buffeted back and forth between utter frustration and heartwarming uplift and just about every other emotion in between. It's true that the movie does have a few too many false climaxes towards the end and there are individual moments when it veers dangerously close to exploitation, but, for the most part, this is a first-rate, riveting drama, solidly directed by Eastwood and beautifully acted by Jolie, Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan, Amy Ryan and many others.Director Eastwood triumphs again.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent Eastwood and Awesome Angelina Conjure cracking Changeling,"When Christine Collins' (Jolie) son goes missing, she waits for months and when receiving a phone call her life is changed by a boy claiming to be her son.This is the reason Angelina Jolie is famous. Forget all the rubbish in OK magazine and remember her acting career. Oscar performance in Girl, Interrupted aside, this is a sublime piece of acting and her finest to date. Jolie makes her character passionate, determined and opinionated and one of the most memorable mothers of 2008. An Oscar should be on the cards. Her performance was so good she made my arm shiver in a roasting cinema. Not only is Collins a memorable protagonist, she is a beacon of hope, she never gives in and presents herself in the face of adversary. Outstanding.The supporting cast of Malkovich, Donovan, Griffith, Conti and a particular terrifying turn by Jason Butler Harner help make this a solid cast in a solid consistent drama.Based on a true story, Clint Eastwood brings the dramatic events of 1928 alive with a simple but highly effective use of direction. The high shots and slow moving sequences help cement the story to the gritty ground.This film isn't afraid to tell it like it is with a sharp depiction of mental hospitals, electric execution scenes and a shivering concept of murder.The costume design and settings help depict the time the narrative is based. Juxtaposed with the issue driven storyline and you are watching a sharp and dramatic period film that makes you feel as though you are right there in the heart of all the controversy.The issues regarding the representation of the police are unbelievably articulate. Not only does this film raise a valid point about how the force went about their business, it is written in such a way that is entertaining and exciting, and this is a period drama which turns into a gritty crime thriller come the end.Changeling is a fine representation of the late 1920s which is helped by a fine central performance, a realistic and dramatic narrative that makes you think about law and the way lives were lived 80 years ago, and a consistent sophisticated style of direction by Eastwood, who is becoming a legend behind the screen as well as in front. All praise Clint Eastwood.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best films of 2008,"Eastwood's ""Changeling"" tells the true story of a kind and strong woman struggling against the paternalistic and allegedly corrupt male establishment of the Los Angeles Police Department and a mental hospital in the nineteen-twenties and -thirties. The contrast between the good and the bad is black and white, but the tale is told in a matter-of-fact way, and so the feminism of the film resides in the bleak whole and there are no preachy moments.Beyond the likely fact that Christine is being treated more paternalistically by the authorities than a man would be in a comparable situation, there are some universal reminders of the frustration, disbelief, and pain that can be caused by people having power over you: a doctor who interprets your every word as a sign of a possible mental-health problem, twisting your words if necessary (and who can still keep his job in the end); and a policeman who condemns your behaviour in a noble language of 'responsibility' and the like, which corresponds no doubt to public stereotypes and certain typical cases, but which is simply wrong and hypocritical in your case.Angelina Jolie was good in ""A Mighty Heart"" (2007) and is Oscar-nominated here. At the time of writing, she suffers a bit from a similar celebrity stigma that has long attached to Tom Cruise: when Jolie appears on the screen, the viewer sees Angelina Jolie, not a character in a film. That this impression lasts no longer than five minutes here is a sign of a very good actress and film. And Jolie's face does look awfully attractive, as her pale cheeks, red lips, and eyes half-covered under a twenties style hat stand out amidst the muted colours of this beautiful film.Still, half an hour of its two-hour-plus running time could easily have been cut from here and there.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
As Engaging and Powerful As It Can Get!!,"Changeling has Clint Eastwood donning the director's hat and Angelina Jolie in the lead role. The movie is set in the year 1928 and is based on a true story. Being a Clint Eastwood fan, it is with great expectations that I went and saw this movie. A couple of hours later, the movie ended and there were a plethora of emotions inside of me. Yet another film by Clint Eastwood had had a deep impact on me! The struggle of a woman to find her lost son is a long grueling search that turns into a fight against a corrupt police force and an immoral establishment of the city of Los Angeles in the year of 1928. The film highlights the grave injustice the ordinary citizens had to face during that time by the very establishment that was meant to serve and protect them.If you thought that L.A Confidential showed the dark side of the Los Angeles Police Department then Changeling shows it as a living hell where the words - justice and morals didn't exist in the dictionary. That such travesties happened in the most powerful democracy in the world is both shocking and shameful.Changeling is as engaging a drama as it can get! An interesting story is brilliantly executed. The effort put in by the screenplay writer is clearly evident when during the run time of 139 minutes, not once do you feel that the plot is dragging and saying anything too much or too less. Clint Eastwood's school of cinema is often conventional and focuses on the story. Changeling too is a story well told. On one hand Clint shows the shallowness of a corrupt system and on the other hand he shows the strength and perseverance of a mother which serve as a wakeup call to set things right in the system.It is the toughest challenge to base a movie in the 1920s and make it seem real and the last time it was done well was in the 2001 Tom Hanks starer 'Road to Perdition'. It is the brilliant cinematography in Changeling that gives the film that highly authentic feel in which you are submerged and lost in those 2 hours, witnessing first hand, the mystery unfolding. The backdrop of the city of Los Angeles is after Angelina Jolie, the most important character in the movie. Changeling is high on production values! The film is A + on production values be it the artwork, the cinematography or the costumes and makeup of the characters. It says a lot when you drape the sexiest woman in the world with loose fitted garments and make it seem real!And let's talk about Angelina Jolie. I, for long have maintained that she due to her sexy body and those luscious lips she has got more than her due and is overrated as an actress. But now, after having watched this movie, I eat my words! From frame to frame Angelina dominates with her intensity and her subtlety. One feels the excruciating pain and desperation of her character. Like in that horror of a scene when you jump out of your seat crying for help when she is about to get the electrical shock at the asylum or in that scene where she screams and asks the convict whether he indeed killed her son or not! Her performance is highly deserving of an Oscar.The supporting characters of the comforting Reverand, the menace that is Captain Jones, the heinous killer - Northcott, and the morally upright Detective Ybaraa are played well by the different actors and deserve a high amount of praise.""Changeling"" is a rather depressing movie but it inspires tremendous courage in you. Courage to stand up the next time you face injustice!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Masterpiece from Eastwood,"Clint Eastwood has established himself as master of modern cinema. His films are always interesting and effective and have the benefit of his years of experience, including his work with some of the world's finest directors. Eastwood rarely falls into the bombast. He is a master of control and can do emotionally heavy stories without resorting to worthy sentiment.His masterpiece, ""Million Dollar Baby"", showed all of Eastwood's subtle expertise and quiet brilliance. It set the bar high for his next films, and ""Flags of our Fathers"" and ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" understandably struggled to live up to expectations. With ""Changeling"" Eastwood moves away from the more epic scope of the Iwo Jima films and returns to the arena of the person in crisis. It is the astonishing true story of Christine Collins, whose son was kidnapped in 1928. The subsequent investigation, carried out by an LAPD desperate for results and good news, returned a boy who was not her child, and her protests led to her incarceration in a mental asylum before she was eventually, and tragically, proved to be right.Eastwood gambles somewhat in his central casting choice. Angelina Jolie is a superb actress, but her problem is that she is Angelina Jolie. Her fame can prove to be a barrier to her performances. In other words, it's really hard to forget that it's Angelina Jolie and believe in the character. Here however, she triumphs. It is a magnificent performance and the driving force behind the film. Not only do you believe in Christine Collins but you utterly empathise with her. Jolie deserves an awful lot of recognition for this piece of work.Jolie's tour-de-force is excellently supported by the rest of the cast. John Malkovich deals with a part which is actually fairly under-developed well and manages to make him an effective character. Jeffrey Donovan is excellent as the corrupt policeman, Captain Jones. However, the second-half of the film moves away from Collins a little and considers the horrendous crime which is associated with her case. At the heart of this are three terrific performances. Michael Kelly is splendid as the film's only good cop, Detective Ybarra (and even he has his dark side). Eddie Alderson is excellent in a brief but impressive appearance as Sanford Clark, a crucial character in the tale. However, one of the most memorable and haunting performances comes from Jason Butler Harner, who brings a chilling depth to Gordon Northcott.That second-half of the film contains some of the film's real strong points. There is a staggering scene between Alderson and Kelly where the former's Sanford Clark tells the latter's detective about the horrible crimes he has witnessed and been coerced into. During this highly effective scene, Eastwood cuts from horrendous flashbacks to a simple shot of the detective's cigarillo, still in his hand, now more ash than tobacco. It is a brief example of Eastwood's subtle brilliance as a director.The film, although it is lengthy, is never dull and merits every scene. Having said this, Eastwood missteps slightly toward the end when there is a scene in a prison where the determined but quiet Collins suddenly becomes uncharacteristically violent. This scene is immediately followed by a hanging scene which shows a bit too much of the event and could be called gratuitous. The slice of closure which is achieved in that scene is necessary; the manner in which the scene is carried out is not.However, this is a small complaint in light of the rest of the film. The delicate score (composed by that man Eastwood again) and the subtle photography in themselves make up for those small errors. Added to that, Eastwood has crafted a superb drama which tells a gripping and shocking story well, and has a lot to say about the state, ordinary people and freedom. But at the core, this film is a heartbreaking and moving tale about a mother separated from her son and the selfish and horrible forces which acted against her and those good men and women who fought with her. It's a triumph for Jolie and another masterpiece from Eastwood.5 Stars out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Very Enjoyable Film!,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I expected it to be cliché and dull, and Angelina Jolie to be completely out of place. Boy, was I wrong.The film's story is its strongest point. It is based on a true story (always a plus for the makers and the audience) and never do we forget that through the movie- there aren't any cheap Hollywood aspects that would make The Changeling unrealistic. I felt that the direction did somewhat lack creativity (i.e. I expected a bit better from Eastwood) and the storytelling did consist of pretty ordinary and unremarkable flashbacks. Overall, however, it is very enjoyable to watch and the story-telling is very coherent.The acting was another pleasant surprise. It was hard for me to imagine Angelina Jolie as a grief-stricken mother in the 1920s, but she nailed the role and proved her worth as one of the best actresses around today. And there are not many big stars who can play a character so far from their Hollywood image. The rest of the cast was very good as well- particularly John Malkovich and Michelle Gunn. The characters were deep and never boring.One complaint I have is the depiction of the time period it was set in- some of the dialogue just took me out of the '20s/'30s and I never really felt like the movie took place in that decade.However, any complaints I have are minor compared to how well-acted and written it is. I recommend this film to any film-lover (and anybody who thinks Jolie is not a talented actress). Consider my score an 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a film!!!,"This is a film that you just can't take your eyes off. It has everything a good film should have and moves you in ways that may surprise you. Angelina Jolie is excellent and you totally believe she is experiencing these things. John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, is very good and believable, Michael Kelly as detective Lester Ybarra, is also perfectly cast. But the honour should surely go to Clint Eastwood who directs this film with such pace that what would normally be too long for a film seems too short. At the end you may feel a little cheated and wish it could have continued, I know I did. The young actor playing the child accomplice is also really good and you feel his emotion. I cannot recommend this film enough and despite some errors and artistic licence it tells what must have been a truly harrowing story of this poor woman's plight.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another outstanding work from Eastwood,"We've long known that Angelina Jolie was more than a (very) pretty face - after all, besides Lara Croft and Mrs Smith, she has given us the Academy Award-award winning performance in ""Girl, Interrupted"" as well as the more recent ""A Mighty Heart"". And we've known for many decades that 78 year old Clint Eastwood is an exceptional producer and directer who continues to build up an amazing canon of work including recent and immensely sensitive films such as ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". Working together for the first time here, Jolie and Eastwood have created an outstanding work that sears into the soul.'Changeling' is not a word I've come across before this movie, but its definition - a child exchanged for another - tells you all to need to know before seeing the film. It is based on a true story: the disappearance in 1928 of nine-year old Walter Collins in a Los Angeles badly served by a deeply incompetent and corrupt police force.This abduction became one part of the wider case of the infamous Wineville Chicken Coop Murders and, if the details of the case depicted so graphically in the film were not a matter of public record, one would never believe them. The recreation of the period is brilliantly done and the cast of actors is uniformly excellent, including John Malkovich playing (for once) a force for rationality and justice. Real credit should go too to screenwriter and former journalist J Michael Straczynski for telling an horrific story in a compelling and measured manner.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Has merits, but overdone and in the end unconvincing","Now, Clint, you really had me on board for much of this movie, but as it moved ever so slowly to its conclusion, the points started to peel away. The story is affecting, the settings and costumes great, and the suspense terrific. My main gripes are that progressively you become sensitive to the probabilities being stretched, bad behaviour being laid on with a trowel, and the audience being teased with false conclusions. I have to say that while we have plenty of opportunities to admire Angelina Jolie's chiselled bone structure, the consciousness that this is a star vehicle is to the detriment of the movie. She really doesn't look that good, with dark ringed eyes and improbably swollen and pouty dark lips. John Malkovich manages to keep the hamming down to a reasonable level, and everyone else is pretty good. I can give some credence to the bullying the heroine experiences at the hands of the police. You do wonder, though, why she has absolutely no family or friends in her personal life. As credibility seeps away, more doubts creep in. The behaviour of the child is unconvincing and his motivation never accounted for, which is a major weakness. The depiction of characters behaving really badly, but things then going to the other extreme with saviours stepping in to turn the tables, happens pretty much to formula. In fact it's childishly exaggerated and improbable, but you do see it so often in American movies. All in all, the pudding is pretty much ""over-egged"" and I was left feeling guilty at having wasted so much time watching the film. I was left with sore eyes too, as virtually all of the film is extremely dark, including ridiculously under-lit courtroom scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Does good film-making, make a good film?","This is a difficult film, both in subject matter and in pace.In 1920s America, a woman returns from work as a telephone exchange supervisor to find her young son missing. Five months later, the police re-unite her with her son; only, it is not her son. From this premise, we dive into a dark world where bad things happen to good people on a whim, where the police are corrupt, and where, good exists only in the individual.This is an America trapped by 'the system', where conformity is the only route to freedom.Clint Eastwood is a masterful story teller, but this movie is overly dense. It is literally 'bursting' with heaviness. Every detail, every nuance is ruminated on, every close-up is a study in Actors working hard. It is as preponderant as the word suggests.Don't get me wrong; everything about the film is very accomplished. The high-contrast photography. The measured editing. The throaty, horn-dominated symphony, lurking dangerously below the surface.The thing is, it takes itself far too seriously. And there is a gaping plot-hole concerning the boy's involvement that you must suspend in order to access the story.The actors are brilliant as is to be expected, but by the middle of the film one can't escape the feeling that they have all been tragically mis-cast.Even for those of you for whom verbosity is not a problem, this film will leave you cold. Any number of other films have done this sort of thing before and made it work.Watch Doubt, or Capote before you dive into this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

It is probably 98% 30's LA which is good enough for me.Ms Jolie played her part extremely well along with all the young cast, although the bad guy might of been a small bit more creepy. Having said that it was not all about him , but about the emotional journey ridden by a mother who doesn't know which way to turn. There are questions answered some not answerd,however the unanswerd questions keep the movie charged.There is a good mix of good cop bad cop and knight in shining armour, good friends bad friends. It is defenatly a roller coaster of a journey to be fulfilled and enjoyed by all who can appreciate a good story",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Period Film...Eastwood's Best Film,"Simply put, although it is like a Hollywood-styled melodrama, this film is superior to Clint's other masterpieces Million Dollar Baby and The Unforgiven which both won Best Picture and Best Director. Those films were more original and I think Unforgiven was his best, but in terms of film-making, not originality, Changeling is better. Great period-piece without CGI or other modern technologies require meticulous attention to details on sets and style of the period. This film succeeds in re-creating the 1920s (even if some details are not quite accurate) with terrific sets and cinematography. The script was excellent and acting was very good. Angelina isn't a great actress but she pulls off convincing scenes such as when she shows her discomfort, confusion and despair when she is alone with the boy Arthur or facing the corrupt psychiatrist. John Malkovich often seems forced and superficial in his acting, but here he plays a convincing role as a driven anti-corruption clergyman. There are plenty of films with missing children, murders, and abused women, but this film climbs a notch above an ice floe of penguins: films that are alike. The film strength is really drawn from its sense of hope. It gives and it takes like an action film with plenty of twists. You draw hope with the child off the train and then feel let down. You draw hope when Christine Collins (Angelina's character) gets a phone call from a friend and again, you feel her disappointment. Even though it is easy to know how a Hollywood-style melodramatic thriller ends, this film scores big with the idea of a mother's hope.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Changeling: A Solid Offering,"Clint Eastwood, in recent times, has returned again and again to my mind as a director of considerable prowess, the (modern, at least) films of whom offer consistently powerful stories with a deeply dark tone resonating throughout. The recent Warner Brothers release of 35 Eastwood films prompted me to begin a further exploration of his catalogue, a task I began with Changeling, itself—a Universal release—not included in the aforementioned collection.Apparently taken from real events, Changeling presents the story of Christine Collins, a single mother newly promoted to supervisor in a telecommunications firm. Forced to leave her son alone for a few hours when she is called upon to cover a shift, Collins returns to find him gone. The eventual discovery of a child she is resolutely convinced is not her own leads her to conflicts with the obdurate police force as they refuse to resume the search for the boy they insist is now returned.Following on from the intriguing companion piece projects that were Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, and released less than two months before Gran Torino, Changeling is a work from a man churning out films of a high quality at an extraordinary pace. From the beginning Eastwood's fondness for shadows is seen, the director's thematically synonymous usage of lighting among his most recognisable trademarks. Also apparent from the onset is a surprising modesty in Jolie's performance. Truth be told, I daresay I'd not have noticed who was on the screen had I not already known the cast. She blends perfectly into the well created period setting, her performance subtle in the film's beginnings. A minor hiccup encountered at an early stage is the film's pacing; the child has been lost and returned within approximately thirty minutes. Whilst the story that follows is of course the film's centrepiece, the rapidity of the earlier scenes is somewhat diminutive in communicating Collins' emotional response. The film—and we along with it—are given insufficient time to appreciate the loss, the lack of a decent plaintive scene portraying a mother's loss the evident problem. Once the primary narrative arrives, however, the film picks itself up and delivers a series of political messages alongside a succession of emotional scenes. Jolie begins to shine as the woman determined not to be silenced, Malkovich's supporting role adding a fiery criticism which works well to reinforce the damnation of public office corruption. What seems a side-plot integrates itself proficiently into the main narrative with a number of eerily fascinating scenes and a trio of fine supporting performances. The nature of this is perhaps a tad familiar in manner, not quite as original as we might have hoped for, but a fair excuse for Eastwood to indulge himself with replete darkness as he does so well. The film's finale is suitable, working quite well to replicate and maintain the overall tone of the piece.An atavistic portrait, Changeling is not without its flaws. Jolie's performance, though more impressive than ever I'd expected of her, falls short of brilliance through its stoicism, a little too neat emotionally. The character's strength is not—in this case—the film's. Aside from this, it is effective in what it attempts to do, delivering an enthralling story with a world-weary realism conveyed as much—if indeed not more—through its lighting as through its narrative. Though not quite as strong as many of its neighbours in the Eastwood library, Changeling is a solid offering from a man who is doubtlessly one of American cinema's finest working directors.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Remarkably Frustrating and Brilliant Film,"19 February 2009. ""Changeling"" is easily the most ambitious and dramatic movie of the year (2008) in which the subject matter, the plot all conspire to make this movie almost unwatchable but captivating at the same time. Watching the movie is almost like having to sit through two solid hours of the emotionally intense but upsetting television action-thriller ""24."" The frustration of the disbelief that ""bad"" guys get away with so much, that the primary female protagonist comes across, especially for the first two-thirds of the movie, a wimp, a weakling that the movie becomes almost unbearable to watch. ""Changeling"" raises a fascinating conundrum of whether the unsettling feelings about a movie, particularly this movie are because of its inferior weak qualities or whether it is in fact the fascination of the authenticity of the plot and characters. There are a few problems with the movie, the first having to do with the two week jump between Angelina Jolie's character's son's disappearance and the next scene that skips over the initial behavior and reactions of Jolie as a mother and the police department, supposedly crucial moments in any kidnapping incident. The second is after the movie is over, Angelina Jolie's character is strangely still underdeveloped in that the audience never really is provided much in the way of who this person is, no background, no backstory, no real understanding of who and why this person does specifically what she does. This absence serves to somehow distance the audience from the primary character of the movie. Finally, one of the musical selections that keeps getting played over and over towards the end of the movie just doesn't seem to fit in the the emotionality of the scenes, almost a happy, reminiscent tonal quality instead of the more melancholy melody. Nevertheless, this movie presents several major and fantastic plot sequences each and any of which could have easily been devoted to a single movie themselves. The kidnapping, the police cover-up, the mental health institution - with flashbacks to another movie Jolie starred in ""Girl, Interrupted"", 1999 where she won an Oscar for best supporting actress - the criminal search, the trial, the continued search. What was also amazing was Angelina Jolie's performance, that felt real (no superhero antics), the set design, and even several of the musical melodies were just set on period perfect. Clint Eastwood's moody direction was haunting, scary, thrilling in the right moments as well as uplifting (the last hour) without getting gaudy. Overall, this movie was an incredible, if not complicated experience - one of the most difficult emotionally and logically to judge as a movie because the line between the performances and story entered into one's own emotional beliefs and feelings and investiture.

Eh.,"Well, first of all, the sets are pretty great for this movie. Costumes and props and suchlike are all done well. John Malkovich is always fun to watch, too, and the dark twist that things took up at the ranch was unexpected and added some interest. For the most part, though, this felt like an overblown TV movie: a mother searches for her son, and in so doing stands up to evil men. Except for two - possibly three if you count the protagonist's boss - good male characters, the rest seem to be one-dimensional forces of oppression. Likewise, the other main female characters are gutsy (if hastily-drawn) women who are being oppressed. I know that the 1920s were a time in which women were oppressed - there's more than enough misogyny to go around even today - and I have no problem with films that deal with these things, but this portrayal just seemed melodramatic and a bit shallow.The characterisation was a bit thin overall: we learn that the heroine is a single mother, that she works at a switchboard and that her boss has a crush on her, but not much more - and she's the most detailed character in the film. I also found the movie's pacing to be uneven. There were at least two points before the end of the movie at which the credits could have started rolling, and we would still have seen a satisfactory (if not great) film. At one of these points they even seemed to hint that it *was* the end, by mirroring some of the opening scenes. As it is, though, the point at which the film ends doesn't add much to the preceding scenes and felt rather limp.Apparently lots of people love this film, but best of 2008? Even The Dark Knight had more detailed characterisation, and that's about a billionaire in a bat costume for goodness' sake. This is a true story, and potentially engaging if handled well, but the only character I really had sympathy for was the Canadian kid. Re-watch LA Confidential, or Girl, Interrupted, or even The Forgotten. They've covered most of this ground before, and better.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Vastly Overrated & Flabby,"Very interesting story, but one goes away wondering what all the fuss was about. Angelina Jolie is normally hard to watch for any extended period of time (and here you have to watch her for 2.5 hours); there's a way in which she can never seem to wipe a certain smirk or sneer or leer out of her facial expression, which renders her acting always slightly false. Meanwhile, her decidedly 21st-century botoxed lips don't help much with her depiction of a woman in the 1930s. Jeffrey Donavan, in fact is about the only one who looks like he belongs there; most of the rest, including John Malkovich, seem slightly embarrassed by their clothes and their hairdos. In general, the film is marred by a lot of hammy overacting (the children overall but especially Jason Butler Harner, who becomes nearly unwatchable). Indeed, Eastwood seems to lose control of his actors or, alternatively, to be letting them flounder around without a rope -- but Michael Kelly is memorable in a fairly small role.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jolie is magnificent,"A little boy is taken from his home in 1928. His mom enlists the LAPD to find him, and five months later they come up with a lost child. The mother quickly grasps that the kid isn't her missing son, but the LAPD will have none of it. Outraged, Christine Collins takes on the entire police department in an effort to get them to look for her son, much to the detriment of her own welfare.Oh, the arrogant LAPD! They foist a boy, obviously the wrong child, on poor Mrs. Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) and practically force her to shower affection on the kid. Then they wash their hands of the matter, even when Collins protests that the kid's not hers. This attitude gets her thrown into a women's sanitarium, because you just didn't talk back to the LAPD in 1928, especially if you were a woman. Especially if you were a single woman who was pointing out a huge mistake on the part of the LAPD.Luckily, Christine has a powerful ally, the Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who broadcasts a weekly sermon excoriating the police for corruption and other misdeeds. Briegleb is instrumental in winning Christine's release, but the battle's only just begun: the cops are still crooked, and she is still without her son.Concurrent to Christine's problems, we also follow the story of the real kidnapper and of the upper management of the LAPD. What begins as a slight cover-up on the part of the all-powerful police in order to placate a testy public and press turns into a disaster, all because Christine Collins wouldn't give up.The movie is never lacking for emotional realism. First of all, you completely empathize with Christine Collins, a woman who refuses to be a victim. Her goal isn't to bring the police department down, and it's not even to exact some kind of vengeance (which might just be a way for her to get over her son's kidnapping). Her goal is simply to get her son back.Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins and is, in a word, outstanding, and she earned a Oscar nomination for this movie. Jolie's Collins is not homely - you can't completely lose that beauty, even if you're playing a somewhat dowdy 1920s mom - but her looks don't get her anywhere in this movie. To tell the truth, her looks are never even mentioned, not even in a snide comment by the cops (""Just sit over here, cutie, while we men take care of things""). When Collins comes home to find her son's gone, we feel the anguish she feels. It doesn't feel forced, and we don't feel manipulated, and that's at least because of Jolie herself.One odd little complaint, though - why is everything so dark? Was the sun dimmer in 1928? Even in broad daylight, everyone seems to be half in shadows, which made me squint most of the time, thus giving me a headache. Was director Clint Eastwood trying for some kind of period moodiness? It's not needed for most of the scenes, although the mental hospital should, by definition, be poorly lit.As Christine Collins tenaciously clings to the idea that her son may still be alive, the movie also grabs a hold of your heartstrings and never lets go. But neither does Eastwood try to manipulate us toward an inevitable conclusion; he doesn't pluck those heartstrings so much as gently caress them, ambiguously leading us in multiple directions. Collins' predicament feels terrifyingly real: the aching loss of her only child and her own violent incarceration in a sadistic ""hospital."" Changeling is frightening not only because of the blistering account of evil cops and doctors but also, and most hauntingly, because of the horrible anguish and despair Collins feels as she fights the system while maintaining her resolute belief that her boy will be found.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
by far the best work of Clint Eastwood,"This is, reportedly, a so called ""true"" story. That probably means that it at least is somewhat true. That little truth stretches a long way, however, and the story finds relevancy even today. It points out the simple truth, that if you are criminal it's much easier to be that if, at the same time, you are the police. In fact, it is such a nice set up, that all of us should always be on the lookout for it, regardless of which country we live in or, expressed somewhat differently, we ought to suspect foul play if the police is never accused, because that means that the crooks have expanded their realm and have the media in their pockets as well. Not so in this picture. There is a reverend here that has broad access to the media, seemingly even better access than the police. That's always a good thing. In a country in which the police is often accused in the media and occasionally brought down, there is always hope for at least some justice. You see, this is what this good film makes me think of. We may look at this film and say ""yes, these were the dark ages"" (the story takes place in the twenties and thirties) but we might just as well say ""yes, these were the days of justice, when the police could be convicted"". And there is a good swift kick at psychiatry as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A powerful, harrowing true story which makes your blood boil","Having overcome my reluctance to watch this movie (as I thought it would be profoundly depressing), I must say how rewarding and informative it was. Based on a true story of a mum (Christine Collins, played by Angelina Jolie) who is convinced to work on her day off, leaving her young son (Walter Collins, played by Gattlin Griffith) at home, alone, only to return later that night to find him missing. The rest of the story is an absolute nightmare. Christine must deal with a corrupt police force which is more interested in good press than good outcomes for victims of crime.Set in 1920's Los Angeles, attention to period detail is excellent, it seems to me. One of the ways that this movie is informative is in how it shows Los Angeles to be a spitting image of those present day, corrupt South American cities where the only thing worse than gang violence is...police violence. The revelations about police conduct in this era is jaw-dropping. Other revelations about civil institutions are also frightening.The cast in this movie is uniformly strong and effective. One of my reasons for being reluctant to see this movie was seeing excerpts on movie review shows on TV where John Malkovich's character, Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb was shown. He seemed really weird in excerpts, but watching the movie, he comes across a lot better, being a staunch ally of Christine in her dealings with the L.A.P.D.In the header, I mentioned that this is a movie which makes your blood boil. The main reason for that is just glimpsing how the city's powerful and elites function. Of course, your blood can boil so much that you don't give credit to the actors who push all your buttons and make you fume with outrage. Actors like Jeffrey Donovan, who plays Capt. J.J. Jones, and Colm Feore, who plays Chief James E. Davis. Other sundry characters who Christine encounters are similarly infuriating. As someone who lives in somewhat more enlightened times than Christine did, it's shocking to see how her case was handled, back in the day.Captain J.Jones is perhaps the most ghastly specimen of humanity in the movie. He is so narcissistic and selfish that his own incompetence (at best) does not register with him. It's doubtful I've ever seen a character who is more of a man-child than him.My blood hasn't boiled this much since I saw ""Capturing the Friedmans"", a docu which also deals in crime and justice. The subject of that docu is morally ambivalent in a way in which Christine Collins isn't, but the conduct of the police against him is just as troublesome. There is also a brilliant Australian mini-series with similar themes of crime and justice in ""Through my eyes"", which was also based on a true story.No doubt the facts of the story have been embellished and even fabricated no doubt, to increase the drama, but I have no doubt that the real facts of the case are sufficient for a powerful movie. It would be a pity if some fabrications have been made in order to make the Collins' family seem more heroic than they actually were-I do not think that they would be lesser subjects for a movie if they hadn't done half of what they are depicted of doing in this movie.Director Clint Eastwood has another movie out around the same time as this one, ""Gran Torino"". ""Changeling"" is the superior movie in my view...""Gran Torino"" is just average. Am not sure if ""Changeling"" was up for Academy Awards in 2008-if it was released in time for that year's awards, I feel that it was definitely a contender for ""Best Picture"" amongst other awards. If it was released after the cut-off date for that year's awards, then I feel that it must be a contender for ""Best Picture"" in 2009, along with ""Watchmen"".Although the movie does not go into the ultimate fate of the 'changeling' of the title, the last we see of him just increases the number of unanswered questions the movie raises. A post-script to this aspect of the movie would have been appreciated. A meeting between Christine and a man with knowledge of her son's fate also seemed a proper subject for a footnote...I mean, I'm not sure that this meeting really took place, so this man's story could have been dealt with by a post-script to the story.A great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Gripping, immersive, though maybe too dark","I really enjoyed (well...) this film, it was very well shot, great cinematics in there. I believe that Clint Eastwood does a great job in directing when it comes to showing the human side of a story, but sometimes I think can be a little too much. Too dark, almost. Theacting was solid all-round, Angelina Jolie gave a very passionate performance as Christine Collins. The acting in general is quite powerful in many of the scenes and matches the tone of the film. The film does well to contrast the dark tone with brighter, more positive ones during the film. Overall I believe the film was an interesting watch and definitely one that lingers in my head for a while.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Strong, compelling performances are the main thing that drive this typically great Eastwood production","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningBased on the true story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) a single mother in 1920s Los Angeles whose young son goes missing. When she gets a call to say he has been found safe and well, she is overjoyed...only to find the boy is not her son. When she brings this little matter up with the chief of police, she finds herself thrown into an insane asylum. The outraged Rev. Briegleb (John Malkovich) begins a campaign for her freedom, and when she is free, she continues her fight to find her son and expose the corruption and shame of the police force.Fact, as they say, is often stranger than fiction. If Clint Eastwood's true life justice drama were a work of fiction, there would be numerous plot holes that could be brought up, such as the mother not being able to prove the boy was not her son with a photo or other people not being able to verify her claims. But if the front cover says it's based on a true story, who am I to argue with it? A real 'you couldn't make it up' plot line, this story served as the wake up call that changed LA's mental health policy forever.Aside from being an unbelievable story, it's also an uneasy and disturbing one, and an air of disturbance and unease hangs over it through out. Long and drawn out, the smooth pace and expert story telling never make it feel a drag. Of all the stars, Eastwood gets his best work out of lead stars Jolie and Malkovich, who both deliver strong, powerful performances, but that's not to say the supporting cast aren't on fire either, including Colm Feore as a police captain and Devon Conti as the oddball accused of unspeakable crimes.It's a story that had to be made into a film and in the hands of a pro like Eastwood, it didn't go wrong. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Changeling is a perfect balance between reality and emotions brought out in a splendid manner.The motherly desire and love for her only child is portrayed beautifully. Angelina Jolie has done a great job as Christine Collins as she stands against all odds and continues her search for her lost son. The movie gives us the message that sometimes one ray of hope is enough to live our entire life. The movie leaves us with a lump in the throat and a positivity. It reminds us of The Shawshank redemption with its hopefulness. It is definitely a must watch and if you are missing it then you are missing out on something.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Angelina Jolie has Changed....,"Clint Eastwood has mastered another very intelligent, captivating piece of cinema. Again, his style is as potent as ever with his use of colors, sharp editing, and shading contrasts. The story is as crisp as any but needs some heavy lifting to get off the ground. Angelina Jolie is the answer to that problem in her most powerful portrayal to date, Ms. Jolie is absolutely incredible.John Malkovich's role doesn't demand much of him rather than a few intense faces but as always, he's the dependable actor. Jason Butler Harner takes on the ""villain"" role and utterly transforms it a la Jackie Earle Haley in Little Children.The rest of the cast is great especially Jeffrey Donovan who shackles the corrupt cop role and takes on arrogance and certainty to a new level.Script. OK. Story. Not bad. Direction. Seen better from Eastwood. Oscar worthy? Maybe just for Jolie.***/****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb Treatment of Difficult Material,"No need to recap the plot. The movie's a superbly woven screenplay that rivets interest for full two-hours plus. I've read accounts of Northcott's killings, which the screenplay follows factually, but in a very general sense. However, I wish I knew how many of the aspersions cast on the LAPD and city government are true. The script is pretty unsparing in it's portrayal of official misdeeds. So I'm really curious. Then there's that psychiatric hospital where if you're not unhinged going in you will be coming out. Apparently that's where the authorities sent people in need of help. Thus, thanks to officialdom, it seems Christine (Jolie) has no chance of either finding her boy or surviving the experience.As a result, what starts out as a missing boy mystery turns really into an expose of LA government and related institutions. That the two themes are interwoven so effectively is a real tribute to scenarist Straczynski.Also, it looks like producer Eastwood spared little expense recreating 20's fashions and street scenes. These help lend flavor to the proceedings. Then too, I really love the cloche hats the ladies wear. And check out all those black flivvers cruising around town. I guess only jokers went into the showroom asking for a black one. In terms of cast, wisely they are largely unknowns except for Jolie and Malkovich. As a result, we're not distracted by name players in supporting roles, which allows the storyline to remain uppermost. Also, actor Harner (Northcott) strongly resembles pictures I've seen of the real serial killer.Kudos to Jolie for a carefully calibrated turn without milking the part. Likely the temptation was there given the mother's emotional strain. And big time kudos to Eastwood for assembling a crew that turns difficult material into a compelling gem.",,Anonymous,Biography
Mr. Eastwood has done wonders with this flick,"Mr. Eastwood has done wonders directing, producing and scoring this flick, especially his work with Angelina Jolie; she kicks ass in this movie. Even the repeating of the same lament doesn't detract, because after all, what mother would NOT become a broken record about her missing child, even if the powers that be were not treating her like she and her lost child were unimportant. This is based on a horrendous true story about the vile transplanted Canadian serial killer, Gordon Stewart Northcott, who moved to LA and environs and used the farm his mother bought him to carry out his atrocities in secrecy, jailing his victims in the chick coop. When our heroine mom gets word that the police have found her son she is overjoyed. That is until she greets her returning boy only to find that he isn't even her son. On top of that the authorities disregard her when she informs them of the fact.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Thank you Mr. Eastwood, thank you Ms. Jolie!",I watched this Movie yesterday and I'm still impressed. It moved me emotional and touched me. I was very curious about CHANGELING because I like the Work of Clint Eastwood he did as Director. The Story is about a Mother who lost her son. Something like that must be terrible for a mother. The Mother never stopped to looking for her kid and I thought the same would have done my Mother too. I lost my mother some years ago and this movie reminded me a lot of her and touched me. Angelina Jolie is wonderful as Mother and she was perfect as young self confident woman around 1928. Her acting surprised me; she was totally believable and moving in her role. Maybe one of the best acting in her career.The second thing I admired was the scenery and the photography of CHANGELING. I really thought that it was like a Window to another Time long ago. The supporting cast around the all time great John Malkovich was also very convincing in their roles. I enjoyed CHANGELING for me it's a movie with Grit and strong performances. The slow music which sounds sad but also hope was a good choice. It might have a slow start but soon I was in the powerful story and not a single moment bored or annoyed. I couldn't take my eyes of this carefully photographed Movie.Thank You Mr. Eastwood; thank You Ms. Jolie for these wonderful and suspenseful two hours.

Clint and Angelina's collaboration is very good,"Clint Eastwood continues to broaden his artistic horizon and with Changeling he again delivers a great feature film of depth and complexity. I recommend this film to anyone who just wants to watch a really interesting, true dramatic story. Though some of the subject matter may be a bit intense for the faint of heart, it needs to be that way in order to convey the horrific events surrounding the case of Christine Collins and her son Walter. Like nearly every Clint Eastwood project, whether acting, directing, or producing, this one will have you thinking about its events long after viewing. A word of mention to Angelina Jolie who is in fine form here. Great film.",,Anonymous,Biography
Exaggerated Story but Great Portrayal of the 20s,"Changeling tells the story of Christine, a single mother whose little boy, Walter, is missing. After a few months of search, the LAPD finds a boy with a similar description to Walter's and reunites him with Christine, only to discover that she is stating that he is not her boy. What follows is a battle between the LAPD, not wanting to admit that they found the wrong boy and, therefore, be embarrassed further, and Christine, who wants her boy back.The story and the characters have both their strengths and weaknesses. While the main character's relentlessness is the driving force of the story and is entertaining, her lack of courage and passiveness in some scenes makes it hard to root for her. However, Angelina Jolie's performance of Christine, depicting a concerned mother, is impactful and emotional, which makes up for the character at some levels. The other thing to note here is the clever way of expressing oppression against women in the story; however, the plot and the overall theme can seem exaggerated. For example, the behavior of staff at the mental hospital was over-dramatic, in my opinion.Changeling is an OK movie with some enjoyable traits. I can not say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and there were times in which fast-forwarding seemed like a good option. However, the visual theme of the film and their depiction of the 20s was entertaining. For instance, every street shot is reminiscent of the good old days. Also, the costumes help
build up this atmosphere.To conclude, I can say that Changeling is not a bad movie; if you are into the 20s period and enjoy drama with a side of mystery, chances are you would enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Mrs. Collins, if that boy's your son I'll eat my yard stick.","In late 1920s Los Angeles, single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) returns home from work to find her 9 year old son Walter has gone missing. Several months later she is overjoyed to be told by the LAPD that Walter has been found alive and well. However, when she is reunited with the boy she categorically states that this boy is not her Walter. Persuaded to take the child home by pressure tactics and mind games by department Captain J. J. Jones , Christine becomes ever more clear that the boy is not her son. Refusing to accept what the authorities are telling her, she begins a public crusade to find the real Walter. This however opens up a can of worms that involves corruption and murder.Based on real life incidents that occurred in in Los Angeles and Riverside County, California, in 1928, Changeling sees Clint Eastwood direct after Ron Howard had to step aside and J. Michael Straczynski adapting the story for the screen. From his first directing assignment in 1971 with Play Misty For Me, Eastwood has grown into one of the finest and most respected directors around. His choice of topics may not be across the board appealing, but, certainly with his work from Unforgiven onwards, he has an easy on the eye style that belies some of the dark material he chooses to work from. Such is the case with Changeling, a magnificent film that asks you for your undivided attention so as to make you angry, upset and even repulsed in equal measure.Driven by a powerhouse performance from Jolie (is this really the Tomb Raider and Wanted girl?), the film niftily puts under the microscope a number of issues that existed around the time of this two handed story. There's the treatment of women, well, more society's attitude to women at this time, while the LAPD, already pinpointed as a discredited organisation in the 20s, firmly get the barrels aimed straight at them thru the station doors. There's also the ugly spectre of how mental health patients are dealt with, this point in the film signifying a change of mood, it no longer being a film about one mother's quest for the truth. There lies the trump card in the piece, after being fully engaged with Christine's black and blue world (the story is too strong to not be involved with it), it turns to black horror with the arrival of Sanford Clark, and more tellingly, his uncle, one Gordon Northcott (a fabulously twitchy Jason Butler Harner).The production is top dollar, from the costumes (those wonderful hats) to the rattling streetcars and jalopies, this is rich 20s period detail. While the rest of the cast turn out good work for their relaxed director. John Malkovich is perhaps a little under used considering he is the film's moral backbone, but in true Malkovich fashion he leaves a lasting impression and proves once again what a fine visual actor he is. Geoff Pierson pops in with a potent turn as lawyer S.S. Hahn, while Colm Feore, Jeffrey Donovan and Michael Kelly are the coppers of the piece and they round out what is a well casted motion picture. Nominated for three Academy Awards (winning none), the film made a Worldwide profit of nearly $58 million. That profit doesn't do justice to how good the film is. After enthusiastic reviews from Cannes the piece received mixed reviews on its general release. Some complaints lean towards the film apparently being over melodramatic at times. Not so! This is just real adult drama produced with like minded adult precision. There's a small gripe that it has one too many endings, thus stretching it to being over two hours long, but it's not enough to stop it from being the tight and emotionally involving picture that it is. Keep up the good work Clint, Hollywood needs you now more than ever. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Oscar worthy act & direction of the year,There are two surprises I found in this movie. # 1- It's not always that Hollywood's glamour dolls are for steaming the screen. This is the movie in which we can cherish Angelina Jolie in the most accomplished role of her career & I'll be surprised if I won't see her name in Academy nominations for the Best Actress category for this year. # 2- The movie was directed by none other than forever cowboy Clint Eastwood and this is again Oscar worthy film of the year in direction. Again a superbly crafted period thrilling drama from this genius actor turned director. The movie is based on true incident occurred in 1928 Los Angeles. A single living mother's son disappeared. She lodged a police complain & they returned her boy after few months. But he's not his child. The child was just fabricated face of corrupt LAPD & now the mother is threat. Next police declared her as insane & delusional & sent her to mental asylum. What happened to boy & the mother in this case??? Better you watch this slowly gripping drama of the year. Perfect sets & production of 1930's L.A. & soothing camera work by Eastwood's stalwart camera man Tom Stern made the film more intense & original with minimalist touch of Eastwood film. Jolie's period look & convincing mature acting simply gain the empathy of the audience. All the supporting actors have done realistic act including small but significant role of John Malkowich. It's period film belong to the time of 1928 when women in US were not entitled to vote & they were treated as third class citizens & women liberalization & rights were far on horizon. It's also the time of corrupt police & politics in US. So the film is a true case document of how a desperate mother struggled hard & turned the tables of corrupt LAPD & get the fair justice not only for her nut for whole society. Kudos to Eastwood for his brilliant theme & direction. Must Watch of the year. (This film will sweep the Oscars next year in many categories.)Ratings-9/10,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent ...,"This movie takes its time to give you the full story of an amazing child disappearance case from 1928. I really appreciated this because I often feel cheated at the end of a good story when the ending is wrapped up in about 30 seconds.Angelina Joli does a very good job of portraying a determined lady in the midst of extreme psychological police pressure. They are trying to convince her that a child they found (and have given to her) is her missing child of 5 months, while she claims he is not. It's very effectively done, because sometimes you just want to reach through the screen and take matters into your own hand!The sets and visuals do an outstanding job of getting you into the feel of the late 20s ... the rollerskates of telephone operators, trolley cars, big box of Frosted Flakes and very old style cars are images not soon forgot.At 2h 20min, this movie is almost an hour longer than most movies - but it is time well spent.

Clint Eastwood Rocks,"Just when you watched the Million Dollar Baby (for those who liked it at least) and you thought Clint is a great director but with him being on his 70's can he deliver again as a good film or to push one's luck can he do even better? Let's face it the chances of that are slim. Changeling proves overwhelmingly that yes he can.The story itself is very powerful and the delivery is a constant assault to the viewer's emotions where the plot though it evolves constantly, does so in a pace that whilst you are kept engaged it does not give too much out too soon.Furthermore another reason I believe this film stands out is the fact that despite being a drama there is a beacon of hope that always shines.A movie with distinction, class and quality.

A tedious tale that loses direction,"From the beginning of the movie, i had high hopes. The storyline was both fascinating and intriguing. However, towards the halfway point, I began to lose interest and this only deteriorated further throughout.Starting with the positives:The acting- I'm rather confused by the negative reviews of Angelina Jolie's tragic portrayal of a mother in search of her missing son. I've always admired Jolie's performances in many films and this one was certainly no exception. She captured the emotional turmoil of the protagonist exceptionally.The cinematography- the landscape of the USA during the 1920's was captured stunningly throughout this period piece which transports the viewer back in time.The negatives:The pacing- As previously stated, this movie had a strong start but rapidly became tedious after the first hour. I definitely think it should've been shortened by at least 30 minutes.The lack of direction- This movie explored various themes and storylines which ultimately lost a true focal point. Particularly due to the rather rushed and inconclusive ending.Overall 6.5.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Film That Could Have Been A Masterpiece...,"Christine Collins is called in to work on her day off. She leaves her son at home and promises to take him out tomorrow to make it up to him. When she returns, he is missing, nowhere to be found. 5 months later the LAPD claim to have found him, but when they present the boy to Christine, she refuses him, saying he is not her son. Instead of making the department look embarrassed and admit failure, they throw her in a mental institution.What makes Changeling even more depressing is that this is all based on true events.Eastwood has yet another winner under his belt with Changeling. Some might find it a hard film to enjoy, but I was engaged throughout, due to the performances, art direction, story and Eastwood's talented directing. It's Eastwood's eye to detail that brings this 1920's era to life. I was really impressed with the design of this film and it felt completely real to me. From the set design to the costume design. Normally you can see through the fabric and know that it was made for the film, but here it simply fits.A lot of the film rests on the shoulders of Angelina Jolie, as the mother of the lost child. I believed her in this role. Her eyes do most of the acting, subtle and honest. Yet at times her overbearing yelling distracts. At first it's believable, but near the end it seems more of the same and irritating at times. It's a strong enough performances to garner attention from Award ceremonies. On the supporting side is John Malkovich, who kicks all kinds of ass without doing much. His presence is enough to make you cheer. He is in command and you can tell by simply listening to his tone of voice. Colm Feore is someone you can count on to play any man with questionable morals. It's all in his face, perfectly cast here as the Chief of police. I have to say that a weak link in the acting is Jeffrey Donovan. I enjoyed him to a degree, but his voice/accent is just too annoying to get use to. I squirmed in my seat a couple of times, not from his characters actions, but from the accent.One person to watch for here is Jason Butler Harner, who plays a serial killer. He takes a slightly different approach to the subject matter. He isn't too crazy, he isn't too weird, he's a mix of both. But what makes it a more horrifying performance is that he is human. We are not seeing Hannibal Lector up on the screen, we are seeing a human being. I wouldn't be surprised if a Supporting Acting nod went in his direction. Also, Amy Ryan makes a small appearance, nothing too big, but her scenes are well enough to make a mention of.The story is strong, and it is strengthened by the fact that it is based on a true story. If it were fabricated, then the emotion might not have been there, at least not as much as what this film delivers. Jolie delivers a performance that is heart wrenching, at times, and it is heightened by that small little fact that someone in this world went through those emotions, those barriers and heartaches.Yes, this film is depressing. Eastwood knows it, and uses it to his advantage. Throughout the entire film I found myself just wanting to punch some people in the face, to yell at them and help Jolie in her cause to get her son back. Malkovich does this for the audience, which is why I think his character kicks ass. He does what we as the audience want to do. The tension in this film is high, not from thrills, but from the horrible things that these characters do to Jolie. She stands her ground, we cheer, and they throw more rocks at her, we tense up. Great flow for this film.Although, with all it's greatness, it does have a weakness. It's too freaking long. I thought the film was going to end, then it went on for another 20 minutes. I think with a bit more editing and tightening up, you can easily shave off those 20 minutes. Even though I was entertained and engaged in the last little bit of the film, mostly the trial and the bits in between the trial, I couldn't help but think that the film should wrap up soon. Real soon.Much like Eastwood's Oscar baby, Mystic River, Changeling deals with a missing child. Only this time it's the feminine aspect and the time period is drastically different. The film is strong enough to stand as one of his better works and if it were a bit tighter and shorter...I might have been able to call it a masterpiece.Too bad.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Eastwood goes through the motions but Angie Works up a storm.,"By this point we all know what to expect when you walk into a Clint Eastwood movie. It's going to be upsetting, it's going to be authentic and its going to be a beautiful movie, these no doubting that. At this point though, it all seems like Oscar Bait, abit like The English Patient. Where Changeling differs is the films ability to tell a intriguing story without seeming pretentious. Its handle with graft and care if not a whole load of originality.What will attract moist to the movie is Angelina Jolie's performance, almost unrecognizable as a struggling mother; it's hard to comprehend the fact that this was the same woman who only a few months ago played a tomboyish assassin in ""Wanted"". This movie is crafted so well, every character in this movie done with the utmost attention from the writers and while most might complaining about the excessive running length, for me this film needed to be that long. It's that complex and there are that many story arcs that it's a necessary formula.Inspired by actual events that occurred in 1920s-era Los Angeles, Clint Eastwood's The Changeling tells the story of a woman driven to confront a corrupted LAPD after her abducted son is retrieved and she begins to suspect that the boy returned to her is not the same boy she gave birth to.The year was 1928, and the setting a working-class suburb of Los Angeles. As Christine (Angelina Jolie) said goodbye to her son, Walter, and departed for work, she never anticipated that this was the day her life would be forever changed. Upon returning home, Christine was distressed to discover that Walter was nowhere to be found.Over the course of the following months, the desperate mother would launch a search that would ultimately prove fruitless. Yet just when it seemed that all hope was lost, a nine-year-old boy claiming to be Christine's son seemed to appear out of thin air. Overcome with emotions and uncertain how to face the authorities or the press, Christine invites the child to stay in her home despite knowing without a doubt that he is not her son. This story's resolution, while decent felt a little disjointed to me. While it would have done fine ending at one key moment, Eastwood Carries the film along for too long making it feel as if it has as many endings as Return of the King. This is not a best director picture film for me. I love what Eastwood does but its all very familiar grounds, its the other elements, the superb acting, the astounding source material, the well scripted story and the orchestral score. These elects fit together so seamlessly that it would almost be a tragedy if this want in the running for best picture. While with Angelina Jolie, I think its a sure-fire answer over what's she's taking home come award season.Verdict: A competent, cleverly crafted period piece that combines all of its elements so seamlessly it dabbles on perfection. The lack of flair and originality shown by Eastwood is a bit of a letdown but Changeling rivals his best movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"More great storytelling,courtesy of Eastwood and company","**SPOILERS POSSIBLE**Working Single Mom Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie,who's probably too pretty to play ANYONE from real life,but oh well)lives for two things:her job as a manging receptionist for the switchboards at AT&T(?)in Los Angeles,and her son Walter,a bright but somewhat downbeat nine-year-old. When he comes up missing after an unplanned workday--a Saturday,as it was--Christine does what any distressed mother does,she goes through the proper channels to find him. What happens to her ensuing is something that shouldn't happen to anyone.Clint EAstwood's latest directorial effort is both something very familiar to his work(think UNforgiven,maybe Bridges of Madison County,Million Dollar Baby)and yet something that is wholly unique. To call this a kidnapping story,a story about police corruption,a women's plight movie,a crime mystery or a meditation on loss would miss the mark,because in truth this movie is really a big stew of ALL of those concepts. Adapted off a book by J.Michael Stracynzski(spelling?),Eastwood's simple filming is able to capture reactions and emotions as cleanly as possible. Jolie is mesmerizing as the mother,and even though I realize she seems to be happier playing ""kick-butt"" type roles,her ability to play vulnerability(she cries about as good as any A-list actress out there today!)is priceless. While I'm not sure I would've placed slow-burning actor John Malkovich as the muck-racking aggravating Presbyterian minister,he carries out this role with convincing,empathetic and intelligent controlled rage. Much of the cast is not what you'd probably call main-line or even vaguely recognizable talent,but that's maybe the great beauty of the film:character actors who don't distract from their characters. Some notable veterans who come to mind in this film(to me anyway)are ""Burn Notice""'s Jeffrey Donovan(as the conscience-free Police Captain who seems more interested in putting off people like Christine Collins and keeping his unit un-burdened), Amy Ryan(normally lovely and well-scrubbed,as a hardened,roughed-up prostitute that's been ""dealt-with"" by the LAPD),Colm Feore(as the politically aware,corruption oblivious--willfully so--Police chief),Peter Gerety(As the quack doctor,hired to basically put official wraps on loose-ends for the Force)and Michael Kelly(As the one detective in the Force who actually seems more interested in investigating a case than covering his behind). A great attention to time period(late 1920s and early-to-mid-1930s Calfornia,mostly)and EAstwood's spare usage of music(mostly instrumental horn JAzz,BTW)fills this out beautifully.Some tie-ups with the plot and a little predictability in the dialog makes this JUST shy of perfection,but still the fantastic filming,which enhances the storytelling technique,is what makes this very special. While I'm not one to usually make declarations of a film's worthiness of the Oscar or any other award out there,if one wanted to offer this up as ""Best Picture"" of the year,I certainly wouldn't object. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

WOW - Oscar Material!,"What I thought would be just another mediocre Jolie flick quickly turned into a gripping, glued-to-the-seat drama.

Jolie and Eastwood need to expand on this new found relationship and give us more, more, more!!!! The cinematography alone is Oscar worthy, and I will be really disappointed if this film is not nominated for Oscars all around. I rarely buy DVDs anymore, but I will purchase this one as a keeper. As a history buff I am thankful that Eastwood and company have enlightened us and made us aware of this dark period in LA's past.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Story, BUT...","Yes, the story is captivating and truly incredible. You can't do a bad movie with this source material and this cast, but Clint Eastwood tried his best to make it as flat as possible.The characters are black or white. Either they are saints or pure evil. In this movie an idiotic police officer is portrayed as if he was as evil (or worse) than a sadistic child murderer! I get the director is trying to make a critic to a system, but if he wanted to do so and being taken seriously maybe he shouldn't have had them look pretty much like a cartoon.Other downside of this movie is its running time. Somewhere in the middle it reaches it's peak moment and after that it loses its momentum. It seems to have several ending moments but the movie goes on and on, pretty much without reason.Anyway, a very interesting story to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Extraordinary Movie,"Let me start by saying if you are not into slow movies, this movie is not for you. This is a very intense movie with good acting and brilliant dialogs. It is about the drama of a mother and the drama of a society because of corruption and misuse of power. The atmosphere is given very well and Eastwood did a decent job from the beginning to the end. This is one of the few movies where Angelina Jolie had the chance to act without the need of using her physical attraction. She was not bad but her face was lacking emotion most of the time. You do not get an Oscar with this performance and she did not indeed. On the other hand, the movie and story is so good that performance of an individual can neither ruin the movie nor make it better. Definitely worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Engrossing,"Clint Eastwood is a great example of an actor who made a smooth transition into directing. His films are always fluid and visually gripping, direct and deceptively simple, told with a straight face whilst retaining emotional weight. Though some of his directorial work doesn't quite achieve what it set out to, it is it is nearly always gripping on some level and interesting to watch. Whenever he delivers on a script that that allows him to use all of his expertise then he usually provides something engrossing. Never is this clearer than with Changeling, based on the true story of the disappearance of Christine Collins' son and the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Here you have a period piece that is tailor made to Eastwood's understanding of human struggle and involving story- telling.The relatively straight-forward story is set in 1928 and mainly details Collins' struggle against the LAPD after her son Walter disappears. The boy they return to her 5 months later isn't hers. Her protests fall on deaf ears as the police insist that she's just in shock and that she should give the boy a trial run. The film continues to build tension and unease brilliantly until Collins is sectioned, which leaves a crusading Reverend and a detective on a case as her only hope. Eastwood had shown previously that he could handle both mystery (Mystic River) and drama (Million Dollar Baby), so a story featuring plenty of both his right up his street and it certainly shows. He handles this story with delicacy and emotion, developing characters and their feelings without letting the story itself become unfocused. The deeper we get into Christine's plight, the more we want to know the truth.The further the film progresses, the more impressive Angelina Jolie's performance is. I was sceptical that should could carry such a film on her shoulders, but she brings everything needed to the role. What she does that is most striking is give us a woman who appears vulnerable on the surface yet contains an inner strength that cannot be broken. I believed every act of defiance and cry of anguish, as much as I believed every tear and melancholic expression. Above all she manages to make Christine authentic. Her reactions are just as you'd expect a real mother to act in such a situation. This isn't an easy performance to play off and carry with conviction given its complexities, I think Jolie did an extremely noteworthy job and received a deserved Oscar nomination.The film develops the themes of female disempowerment and corruption of the law with an appropriate subtlety. We see Christine's worries dismissed by men in charge, whether they are doctors or police chiefs, and just how easy it is for them to make her life even more of a struggle. The two high ranking police only appear to care about the public's image of the LAPD and Christine only finds support from a radio reverend. All of these roles are played with dependability, Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore as the seedy cops, John Malkovich going against type as the generous Reverend Briegleb. The film does well to reflect the nature of its period. There is an authenticity and stark beauty to the visuals, almost as if they were painted. You get a feel of the time and you never question it because it washes over you. The score provided by Eastwood fits the mood too, somewhat stark and lead by a sombre piano, it suits what is happening on screen perfectly.As the film builds we discover all kinds of secrets and corruptions. The film leaves you thrilled and shocked, upset but hopeful, it manages to bring in so many emotions without making them feel forced like so many films of its style do. Eastwood is clearly in his element with films that tell deep stories about people, he gives them heart without losing sight of the story that he is trying to bring to life. In Jolie he has an actress who handles the material with grace and courage, who becomes the person we care about and want to succeed. There is a mystery that unravels excellently and Christine's case becomes all the more engaging as it does. Most importantly the film very rarely sags or loses focus, I was completely engaged from beginning to end. It gave me plenty to be entertained by, be involved with and finally reflect upon.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Changeling (2008),"Changeling easily could be nominated for Best Picture. It features a riveting story, and beautiful pacing until we reach the climax. Changeling definitely has problems, though; the resolution feels long, drawn out, and like another film entirely. While it could have benefited from more extensive editing, I don't feel it deserves a negative review for it. It was very intriguing and went places I was totally not expecting it to go, and I do think it will be remembered around Oscar time.Despite its obvious flaws, the drama is potent, Clint Eastwood's directing is just awesome (I think it's even better than Million Dollar Baby), and Angelina Jolie delivers an excellent performance as a determined mother. Even while others around her attempt to distort her perceptions of reality, she does not give in, ever. A brilliant performance. The setting of 1920's Los Angeles is incredible and realistic, and the fact that it's a true story blows me away; I can't believe I haven't heard this story.It's an important film to watch, and I do get that feeling it's an Oscar-caliber film.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Horror by the story, impressiveness by the movie","Where should I start? Mostly, I complain about the set designs and the atmosphere of the movies which tell stories that take place in old periods, because mostly it looks superficial, the (advanced) technical equipment of 2000s clashes with the set designs of 1930s, 1940s etc. Changeling was the first movie that I felt like it really takes place in those years (by the way, The Public Enemies was the most successful one in the sense of set design) However, the primary thing that makes Changeling a masterpiece is the script. It was perfectly written. This bloodcurdling true story wouldn't have been told better, it is a very bold movie including Clint Eastwood's direction. I believe that there are a few people who can dare to show some horrible details. Additionally, the story editing is perfect and there are many twists in the movie and it makes you flabbergasted. This is not a simply cliché a mother's son disappears and she is involved in a thriller and tries to find her son movie. And if it is, the best one so far. The true story is very original (because it is a true story?), just listening this story makes the movie worthy! and the script writer adapts it perfectly, so makes the movie original. The first half is very mysterious, but the second half, the movie becomes mysterious again and there are some sub stories, and each one is unbelievable, horrible and Eastwood shows things blatantly obvious. Direction has no flaw at all, if it had had, the movie might have missed the opportunity of being perfect. Therefore, Changeling is another example of Eastwood's perfect direction like Million Dollar Baby or The Mystic River. I liked Angelina Jolie more by this movie and liked her character a lot too. As for Angelina Jolie's acting, she was just persuasive (may be because I kept my expectations too high) In this movie, she is so beautiful too, but her beauty, her attraction is not in the foreground at all, this may sound cliché, but it was just an information, not as a positive or negative thing. As I learned, Changeling was criticized like Eastwood was not objective on some issues such as the faith of a character that I can't tell you know because of spoiler. I don't know whether Eastwood changed some details or not, but if this is a true story, probably he did not, but it was irritating and ridiculous that the movie got criticisms like this. Changeling is in IMDb Top 250, but it is still pretty underrated and the most important, it really deserves to be there, not like some other recent movies that have entered the list because of popularity. The ending of the movie is one of the most astonishing, original and thoughtful endings I have ever seen with a simple, but thoughtful last one-liner. It left me with complex feelings, happiness, sadness and impressiveness.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good,"I have to say, I'm shocked at the mediocre critical reaction to this film. It's the kind of perfectly good, middlebrow flick that they usually bend over backward to praise. Any other year, this would be the frontrunner for Best Picture. Personally, I'm never that impressed with the usual films that make newspaper critics' top ten lists. Sometimes I downright dislike them. This isn't one I disliked. I rather did like it. In fact, it's my favorite Eastwood-directed film since Mystic River. I think it's a lot less flawed than Million Dollar Baby, and a lot less lifeless than his two WWII films from a couple years back. Angelina Jolie plays a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles. One day, when she is forced to work overtime, her nine year old son disappears. After a five month investigation, the police find and return her son – only it's not her son. In fact, it's another boy who looks somewhat similar, but he's three inches shorter and circumcized. Most of the film follows Jolie's desperate and futile attempts to fight the police force, who refuse to accept her story. The film is based on a true story, one that dragged out for quite a while. I think a lot of critics felt that the film is poorly paced because of this, but I thought screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski did an admirable job of keeping it moving. Jolie is fantastic. I also very much liked Jeffrey Donovan as the corrupt police captain. On the other hand, I thought Jason Butler Harner overplayed his role. The thing that Eastwood always excels at is the look of his films, and everything here, from cinematography to costumes to production design, is perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Changeling undoubtedly goes to waste, no matter how powerful it may be.","They say that timing is everything, and while it is certainly a hard thing to imagine many audiences in our current social climate wanting to go see a film as downright dark and confrontational as Changeling, the quality of the feature as a whole remains a statement as to why you might want to give it a try. There's no doubt about it however, Eastwood here delivers a thoughtful and extremely emotive tale that very rarely caters to anyone's desires for uplifting holiday entertainment, and as such, things can get a little overbearing. Nevertheless, despite a severe miscalculation in terms of release, there's still plenty to take away from the experience, even if it does ask that you leave all expectations of personal enjoyment in the lobby; from the top class ensemble of performers to the stark detail present in Straczynski's script, Changeling is a gruelling and oft emotionally demanding tale that bestows a feeling of fulfilment and depth in place of entertainment. For that purpose I can only advise this to the select few willing to subject themselves to a story even more depressing than the world we live in today; and in that regard Changeling undoubtedly goes to waste, no matter how powerful it may be.Telling the true story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) and her battle with the LAPD after her son goes missing and is replaced by a fraudulent impostor, Straczynski here delves into territory that he is all too familiar with. This experience in dealing with conspiracy, corruption, politics and personal grievance gives the writer a firm hold on both his characters and plot, all of which are notably out of balance and overly contorted in the film's earlier stages, but come together neatly enough in the end. To his greatest credit however, Straczynski always keep the focus on his characters rather than his overriding themes; Changeling is a story of human perseverance for the cause of justice in a world where the word itself reeks of absurdity. It's a story that continually challenges the viewer and reveals layer after layer of development in both character and plot to the point where all such misgivings regarding the movie's dark nature are soon dispelled. Christine Colins' story certainly isn't one to be taken lightly by any means, but there remains light within the screenplay that glints at some form of hope, even if it does take the form of a shoestring. This acute balance of desperation and the harsh, bitter reality of Colins' predisposition isn't perfect more tears are shed in this movie than the average weepy- but nevertheless fulfils its purpose adequately enough in detailing a powerful struggle with corruption and personal loss.When it comes to the movie's biggest selling point, that is, the performers and the cowboy directing them however, I am of conflicting thoughts; on the one hand the movie for the most part remains coherent and rigorously compelling beginning to end, with little to no missteps from most involved. On the other hand I couldn't help but notice that leading star Angelina Jolie here, although giving a by-the-book Oscar-nod performance, too often reeks of trying too hard. She and director Clint Eastwood shoot Collins as an extremely withered, frail and timid creature prone to weeping at any given chance; sure, there are plenty of moments when this is poignant and warranted to her character, but an abundance of these scenes such as is present here, cheapens her to someone that doesn't feel as human as she ought to be. What's most striking is that given her position, she too often sinks into the background when brought in amongst her co-stars; yes, her character isn't the most photogenic for the big screen, but with so much focus on so little development on the main character herself, the result is more blunt than to the point.With much more convincing and striking performances from the maniacal, slimy Jason Harner and the ever compelling John Malkovich however, Changeling more often than not hits the nail on the head in the performance department. Placed within the terrific production values of the movie which transport you back into 1920's America with absolute ease that never draws attention to itself, Eastwood does fantastically well with the remainder of Straczynski's multi-layered and dynamic script. Yet constantly burdened with a limp sense of focus and direction coupled with an overbearing sense of tragedy that too often milks the audience for all the tears its worth, Changeling is in no way perfect, no matter how convincing its appearance might otherwise have you believe. For all it's worth though, the movie remains as a remarkably solid and well told historically based drama that more often than not gets the job done in conveying the contrast between the light and dark sides of human desire, ambition and power.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Biography
A pretty dull affair.,"A mother is reunited with her missing child but she is convincedhe is an imposter.Starring Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. Written by J Michael Straczynski.Directed by Clint Eastwood.When I first read the premise of this I was drawn in. It sounded like it would be an interesting movie, especially as it was based on a true story.Sadly though I found whole thing distinctly average.The first thing that struck me was how lacklustre the acting performances were. Angelina Jolie was so robotic it felt like she was doing a terrible impression of Joan Collins all the way through the movie. And as for John Malkovich, I just wanted to poke him with a large stick to make sure he was still breathing.The whole production was dull and pretty lifeless. I wasn't surprised at all to get the to end credits to realize that it was directed and part produced by Clint Eastwood. He was a fantastic actor but maybe that doesn't always mean you will become a brilliant director? I'll have to watch more of his movies to find out.Only a few positive things I can say about Changeling.I really liked the exterior shots of LA in the twenties. I loved seeing all the old cars and trams floating about. So a big credit to whoever designed that. Also the only acting performance with any real life in it was Jason Butler Harner who sadly only appeared towards the end. His performance as Gordon Northcott was the film's saving grace.

Filmmaking Crosses Over Into Activism,"The film is set mostly in the 1920s, but the hokiness of some of its scenes (although, according to IMDb, ""Virtually every event depicted in the film appears as cited in legal documents, with dialog often taken verbatim from court transcripts"") and its sappy score are straight out of the 1990s. However, all of that is overcome by tremendous acting performances, especially from Jolie (but not Eddie Alderson, who was not convincing as Sanford Clark), as well as by the incredible story, which is mostly true.I can't believe that this could happen to somebody. This is yet another frightening example of the dangers inherent in handing over unchecked power to any law enforcement organization. If we do not pay attention to history, we are doomed to repeat it.Additionally, this story reminds me of the value of today's technology and social media. While many complain about how much easier it is to invade someone's privacy, it is also a lot easier to expose corruption. Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Oscar Grant...these cases are not a new trend developing amongst police departments. This kind of rampant corruption and abuse of authority has existed for long before anyone can remember. But now we finally have the tools to expose them.And it's not just the police. As an attorney, I have personally stopped a mental health professional from wrongfully committing a person to a mental health institution over what basically amounted to a petty verbal argument between the doctor and the patient.Respect to Straczynski for getting this movie made. This is where filmmaking crosses over into activism. If someone just told you the facts of this case, you might struggle to fathom how this would play out in actuality...how many people would have to screw up, be complicit, or just flat out do nothing to perpetuate this evil...and just how many people would have to decide to do the right thing, even at risk to their own career, financial interests, or even personal safety, in order to unf*ck this mess. This movie very effectively portrays how this unfortunate situation could very plausibly go down...and while there are many more checks and balances today to help prevent some of the previous injustices from happening again, perhaps some who would previously dismiss all police corruption and mental health abuse as wild conspiracy theories might have their minds changed just a little bit by this film.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Changeling's Shifts Will Try Your Patience,"From ISawLightningFall.com - Stories, like people, have all sorts of different shapes. Some are short and lean, others long and muscular. Then there are a few -- pardon my political incorrectness here -- so flabby and shapeless that they ought to have a go on the Nautilus for a while. The Clint Eastwood-directed Changeling falls into the last category.Based on actual events from the late 1920's, the film centers on Christine Collins, a single mother from California whose son, Walter, mysteriously disappears from their home one day. After months of searching, the Los Angeles Police Department produces a boy to much fanfare -- only he isn't Walter. When Christine's pleas fall on deaf ears, her plight gets taken up one Gustav Briegleb, a fiery Presbyterian minister who has made it his goal in life to root out civil corruption.Some of Eastwood's dilemma comes from the complexities of history: The Walter Collins' case was far-reaching and multifaceted. Still, narratives require redaction, even the most factual, and here the film doesn't know its head from its tail, changing genre as often as a surgical nurse does gloves. What starts straightforwardly enough soon moves toward political-protest territory before shifting into a paranoid thriller and then becoming the most grisly kind of crime story. (I'll hold back on further revelations, but the inquisitive could look up the history of Mira Loma, California, if they want spoilers.) It ends -- mostly -- as a courtroom drama, but not before subjecting viewers to at least four pseudo-climaxes and then denying them a coherent resolution. This exercise in frustration reminds us that stories do best when assuming a single shape.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Thoroughly impressive and thrilling, chilling depiction of a true story brought to the screen with emotion and study.","Chageling is a wonderful film; a harrowing scenario stretched agonisingly out to two and a bit hours without a moment that is ever really without either fear, hope, pain or anything particularly uninteresting. It's a tale of dedication; of facing one's fear and truly persisting in what you know is just, even if everyone else seems to think otherwise. And boy, do a lot of supporting characters think otherwise; continuously trying to beat the lead back down, a pounding into submission; an assault on the emotions; a dangling of the proverbial carrot in front of them with the promise of their old life back, plus one thing that wasn't there before filling in for something that now isn't. Freedom and 'normality' is so close, yet justice and the righteous scenario is so far away.The film is effortless; effortless in its progression from an everyday mother and son; to a disappearance; to a re-appearance; to a might-be study of madness; to the dedication of a detective and then onto the harrowing conclusion. You'll get angry; you'll feel sad; you'll feel frustrated, only not at the film itself, before settling with an emotion that is somewhere in between everything: a sort of acceptance. The lead is Christine Collins (Jolie), a supervisor at a local branch of a national telephone company whom lives alone with her son Michael in a small house in Los Angels, circa the 1920s. As a lead, we're led to believe she embodies a number of characteristics: individualism, professionalism, but most importantly, dedication. Very early on, a senior individual at the telephone company Christine works at commends her for the level of her recent work, and it is briefly established how well she's done in defying her, what we assume to be, ego driven male doubters whom work in the nether regions of the company.Within the narrow corridors and wired-up rooms of her workspace, Collins bosses her female workmates and dominates what is hard, fast paced work that needs a lot of dedication, love and attention to get the verbal results she is given early on. What follows, rather interestingly, is a taking out of this supposed groove on Christine's behalf when the male led LAPD just about manages to sign her life away and put her on misery row. What was an office-set life of dedication against what might be perceived as male oppressors in a feminist-less set world is escalated into the rest of the world as the actual police department of the city of Los Angels, and then the government itself, is taken on by this one woman and her dedicated hunt for the mere truth.Director Eastwood treats the supposed repression of a strong, truthful female voice in exceptional taste. He tells a plight, a journey through the grinder that sees police station interrogation rooms; asylum cells and prison execution chambers the locales for the ever searching reality of the situation. The film will mostly, for its first third at least, consist of men at the supposed peak of their respective careers telling the female lead just how wrong she is; how deluded she is and how correct they are. But she doesn't buckle; she knows what's what and she knows more than they do – she should, since she's smart, independent and she's the mother.Changeling only gives us a brief glimpse of peace, tranquillity and normality very early on. The very little exposure the film gives us of Michael works in the film's favour, since there isn't really enough of a stone-wall chance to map onto exactly what this child looks like, including any distinguishable features. From here, the film rather cannily relies on the supposed bringing back of a boy, of some description, which Christine is told is her son, to act as the overall initial incident. If the boy is indeed her son, the film is a study of madness; if he is the incorrect boy, then we observe the film has a licence to go down a different path, that of a detective story so that the truth can be searched out. What actually transpires is that Eastwood takes us down both routes anyway. We go off on one for the scenes in which Christine is supposedly crazy while the film unfolds a would-be hard-boiled; whisky downing; bribe-rejecting; noir-infused detective on the other – one that looks as if he's waltzed straight out of another film and into this one.As a physical representation of justice, this detective named Lester Ybarra (Kelly) is Eastwood's way of reminding us that not all men enjoy pushing women that have garnered praise and attention for defying what's expected of them back down into the doldrums. In regards to Christine's supposed madness, Eastwood shoots the scenes of her commitment in a particularly harrowing fashion. Additionally, Detective Ybarra's investigations lead him to an isolated shack int he middle of rural nowhere and the first things he notices upon entering the property are a cleaver and a knife on a table. Eastwood changes tact here, shooting the film like a horror piece. The slow burning sensation that turns the idea of loosing a son, and getting the wrong one in return, is developed from a misunderstanding that just needs to be sorted out to a real-time nightmare which suddenly comes complete with isolated shacks housing knifes and so forth.Changeling is a scary film. Its premise to do with missing children and the 'replacements' that are incorrect is harrowing. But the film's inclusion of a certain male hatred of certain strong willed women that comes complete with a specific space in which those are rounded up and placed within is equally as frightening, only on an entirely different level. Eastwood directs this visually impressive period piece brilliantly, with a real taste and acknowledgement towards his subject matter; while Angelina Jolie shines through in what might be her best film to date. Changeling is most certainly worth the time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Majorly Impressed,"A grief-stricken mother (Angelina Jolie) takes on the LAPD to her own detriment when it stubbornly tries to pass off an obvious impostor as her missing child, while also refusing to give up hope that she will find him one day.This film impressed me on multiple levels. I had no idea that Angelina Jolie was capable of acting. I mean no disrespect to her, but the roles she had been given never were anything I considered worthwhile. Here, she not only proves herself, she gives 110%. Wow. Out-acting John Malkovich? Yes, yes she does it.The story was captivating, and although some of it seemed far-fetched, it turns out that most of this film was true or at least closer to the truth than most films tend to be. There really was a ""fake boy"" and the murders and everything else. I suspect the police corruption was exaggerated a bit here, but maybe not... if Los Angeles was anything like Chicago, they could have been a nasty, brutish lot.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Didn't hold high hopes but it surprised me.,"This is a heartbreaking movie but well worth watching. Angelina does an amazing job as Christine Collins. I was expecting a hard to watch teary drama, which it could have easily been, but it has a lot of story and a lot of spirit. As a parent you will find yourself not wanting to even mentally put yourself in her shoes - too hard. I think it's great that this story has been told and it was a powerful, well directed movie. If you are bored and looking for a movie to keep you entertained for two hours this would be fine. I didn't really like John Malkovich before this movie, but he did an amazing job as the Rev. who helps Christine's cause while trying to expose the corruption of the L.A.P.D. If you aren't an Angelina Jolie fan you will still probably enjoy this as she is playing a character far from the sexpot chars she has been so great at in the past.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sentimental and Tedious,"This movie has kind of an interesting plot premise, that a police department would attempt to substitute a different child for the mother's missing son. The concept of the changeling is fascinating and, in some contexts, spooky--but not here. The performances of Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich are fine. But the movie is blatantly manipulative of the viewer's emotions. The ""kidnapped child"" motif is played for all the emotional sentiment that is possible. So the film becomes just an exercise in feeling emotionally wrought. There is some plot interest, and the mother's character shows determination. It's certainly better than a lot of the dreck coming out of Hollywood, but that's a pretty low bar. I think if the movie had introduced some genuine mystery about the boy's identity, and if he was in fact the real son or not, it could have been an interesting mystery story. But as is, not worth watching for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
F**k you and the horse you rode in on,"A picture from Eastwood starring Angelina Jolie , my first thoughts of this kind of movie was a totally crap idea. but hey,this one is great. i must have admit,i didn't really think of such a excellent movie like this.and some sort of saying,i am wondered. story lines good and whole audience are memorizing this movie.for being at the 20 & 30 decades,Eastwood does a good job and the art direction shows it clearly. But for being a classic , it is far more behind such thing . way to go to reach the mountain top of classics . the idea of exchanging the identity of children and a single mothers's seeking for her lost boy,is performed well. but you know what?,i don't really like Angie's hairstyle & performance . seems little fake for me when she shows her wrath to wrong kid . it's like she's Lara Croft . but the woman does the role better than her previous roles and hell let's say,she has good improvement on her acting career after she is working with high working directors .she is really good.she plays a single mother who has been deceived after his lost son is found and a mistaken idea story is behind all . and she resists to believe that his son is returned by the police.this whole looks like a frame and Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie)is going to prove that.even though she is accused for being a psycho and is sent to a mental hospital.But she still have hopes to find her son. she has help to gain the aim and thats Rev. Gustav Briegleb(John Malkovich)...Angelina struggles damn hard and she is doing a hard job after fake pictures like Beowulf & A Mighty Heart. and she gains better conclusion of being an actress.hope her way is found soon or before retirement.her husky voices annoys me while yelling.but i just bare it for she is doing a good performance.i think she should give up smoking for it is bad for her children and my ear. great movie . 8 from 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

What do you do when you have nothing left but hope and a will to keep on.,"Changeling borrows it's title from the old George C Scott horror movie my wife didn't want to see it because she got the films mixed up she didn't want to see a horror movie. Changeling is another type of horror film. As a parent of two young boys This movie hit me deeply where I lived. The Story is a matter of fact In Los Angles March of 1928 christine Collins a phone operater supervisor came home after working a Overtime shift to find her son Walter Collins age nine missing. She phones the police only to find a police department that not only doesn't care but is useless. The Cops come out only after she pleads with them they inform her 24 hours must pass before Walter can be considered missing.when the cops come out they find Nothing. the trail is Stone cold. Christine Collins is understandably angry and scared while the police seem to not be able to do anything nor do they even seem to care if she finds her son. during this time she finds at first a strange ally in rev.Gustav Briegleb Wonderfully played by John Malkovich He actually is one of the film's Biggest saving graces.

"Boy, Interrupted  'Changeling' Review","During John Malkovich's first speech as Reverend Gustav Briegleb near the beginning of Changeling, his vicious indictment of the Los Angeles Police Department in front of his church congregation made me feel that the movie was going to be something of a scathing criticism of the LAPD, which is not exactly what I expected. I like to go into Clint Eastwood films knowing as little as possible about them, because the element of surprise has added a great deal to my experience of brilliant films like Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, and True Crime, to which Changeling bears undeniable resemblance.Angelina Jolie stars in the true story about Christine Collins, whose 9-year-old son went mysteriously missing without the slightest trace in March 1928. Five months later, she received a visit from a police investigator giving her the news that she had been praying for all this time, her son was alive and well and on his way back to her.Upon being reunited, however, she insists immediately that the boy they bring is not hers, even though he bears close resemblance to her son and, most importantly, he says his name is Walter Collins and yes, she is his mother. He runs into her arms in front of the newspaper photographers' cameras, and her life takes a bizarre and frightening turn.What follows is a brilliantly paced battle between Christine, who insists the boy is not hers, the LAPD, who have maneuvered the case as an example of their good work amidst public accusations of corruption and violence, and the Reverend Briegleb, a Presbyterian pastor determined to use his radio broadcasts to reveal the extensive criminal underworld operating within the LAPD.The movie tells the story not only of a time when violence and corruption flowed unchecked within a major metropolitan police force, but also of a time when women enjoyed a level in society distantly below the early 21st century. You know, I live in China and the Chinese like to cover up embarrassing moments in their history (it's illegal to print or buy books detailing the events of the Tiananmen Square Massacre anywhere in mainland China, as one tiny example), thinking that those moments make the government look bad. They have convinced the people that they ""don't need to know what happened,"" in order to maintain public approval of the government's workings.But when I hear stories like the one told in Changeling, or when I see films or read books or learn about the history of slavery of the violence that was inflicted upon the Native Americans when the first Americans arrived from Europe, it makes me so proud that America was so brutal and so dangerous and so barbaric because I look around me now and see how far we've come. In 1928, it was possible for the Los Angeles Police to tell a woman to her face, and all over the newspapers, that she couldn't even recognize her own son. People believed the police instead of a mother, which is an astonishing example of how different American society was.Initially, the deepest part of the mystery is where this new boy came from. He is given darkly mysterious origins. We see a scene where a boy and a sweaty farmer are eating lunch in a dingy country café. The farmer says he's forgotten his wallet and will return home to get it, and the man working in the café threatens to call the police if he's not back within ten minutes. The farmer leaves his son as collateral, and the man waits nearly an hour before giving in and finally calling the police. Soon, the boy is given to Christine Collins as her son. The answer to this mystery is, however, one of the film's few weak spots.Events spiral out of control with the LAPD gradually pulling out all the stops in ending Christine's protests until she is briskly locked away in a mental institution, where she discovers that the place is populated with other women who somehow publicly annoyed the police. The movie has no mercy on the embarrassing past of the LAPD. As Christine languishes amidst the screams and forced medication in the mental hospital, a determined detective, LAPD detective, by disobeying orders, discovers the horrific series of murders of young boys at a chicken ranch outside Winesville, California.Changeling is based on a true story, although the story of the murders committed by Gordon Northcott definitely seem to awful to be true, especially given the involvement of another young boy, who helped him attract and then imprison and even kill kids his own age so that he could stay in America. Is Canada really that bad?In the story of Northcott's pursuit and ultimate fate, it's impossible not to remember Eastwood's stunning crime drama True Crime, which also dealt with themes of police fallibility and the power of one man's determination. Jason Butler Harner's performance as Northcott is the most powerful and important performance in the story. If he had gotten one tic, one single detail not perfectly right, the whole character would have fallen apart into a cartoonish caricature of your standard serial killer. But he's real and he gets under your skin. We never learn much about his childhood or what made him what he is, but it's good that we don't because Eastwood understands that that would have been a waste of screen time. The story is, after all, not about him.The movie spectacularly re-creates late 1920s Los Angeles, and never for one second loses its authentic feel and sense of character and style. The Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography Oscar nominations are richly deserved. 2008 has been a year of profoundly important and well-made docudramas and crime thrillers about American politics and history, and Changeling ranks up there just below Frost/Nixon and Milk.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
""" For your terrible crime, you have earned a special place in Hell '","In 1928, in Riverside county, California, a cold, dispassionate, demented and brutally insane serial killer named Gordon Northcott (Jason Buttler Harner) amasses a string of some twenty kidnappings, molestations and murders of young boys. His eventual arrest, capture and trial became National news, leading to his conviction. This extraordinary film is called "" Changeling "" and is based in part on the true events of the time, including the abduction of Walter Collins (Gattlin Griffith). The crime also lead to a direct investigation of the Los Angeles Police Department. Their ambivalent attitudes and corruption charges would eventually lead to the dismissal of Police Chief James Davis (Colm Feore), Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) and several other police Officers. The movie's heroes include Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), Dectective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) and Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). Together they expose the single minded effort of the police to convince Mrs. Collins that her kidnapped son was found and returned to her. However, the police are mistaken when they believe the case has been solved, as Mrs. Collins is not convinced the boy is her son. Waging a non-stop war with the police, the medical doctors and their cronies, she becomes a force to be reckoned with, despite being ignored, arrested, jailed and confined to a mental Instituation. The movie and all it's tragedy is perhaps a great tribute to Clint Eastwood (Director) in filming what for many is an incredible and unbelievable story of horror and disbelief. Yet when one sees the final product, there is little doubt, Eastwood and his cast has created a Classic. Touching and dramatically sensational, this movie is recommended to any seeking the great effort it takes to fight City Hall. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The film is a dense but irregular drama, which does not, however, prevent its contemplation as a reenactment of the period","Written by J. Michael Straczynski, a screenwriter who built his career on television (in the 1980s, he wrote more than twenty episodes of the animated series He-Man and She-Ra), ""Changeling"" employs its opening minutes to establish the loving relationship between Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a single mother, and her son Walter (Griffith). When the boy mysteriously disappears, Christine enlists the help of the corrupt Los Angeles police, who, months later, publicly announce that they have found the child. However, when faced with a boy she doesn't know, Christine denounces the mistake, receiving, in response, the suggestion of ""trying"" the boy for a few days - as if he were an appliance under warranty. By insisting on the police's error, however, the woman ends up being interned in a madhouse that, for all intents and purposes, is nothing more than a warehouse for informers of the irresponsible actions of the police department of the city and where electroshock is used not as a treatment. , but as punishment.The script succeeds in chronologically following the real events. By making the child disappear right at the beginning and seeing that few police cooperate with the case, we already have an idea of the enormous drama that mother will face. Being introduced to another child by the police with the intention of posing for the newspapers only worsens her psyche and establishes the great ethical dilemma of the film. The conspiracy theory that begins to permeate her head causes her to be arrested by corrupt police and ends up in the sanatorium. The non-cooperation with the institution's doctor demonstrates the protagonist's unbreakable quality and that is where the script's strength lies. The protagonist's tireless struggle only reveals other themes relevant to the film: she needed the help of Reverend Gustav Briegleb to get her out of the sanatorium and help in the battle inside the court against the police department.The first half of Changeling represents, by the way, a great narrative exercise on the protagonist's frustration with the police's refusal to take her seriously. Incompetent and corrupt, the department's top officials are more likely to intimidate the population than listen to them - and they don't hesitate to use the power they hold to ward off any inconvenience that comes their way. With that, Christine's growing despair becomes more than justified, as does her anguish as she tries to prove her sanity only to realize that, no matter what she says, the cruel psychiatrist responsible for her hospitalization will twist her words with the intent to blackmail her.With the beautiful production design of James J. Murakami, the film does an impeccable job of recreating the period, also hitting the lifeless colors that dominate the scenarios that portray the asylum. In this sense, the art direction makes an efficient double with the photography of Tom Stern, which, in addition to highlighting the lack of life in the psychiatric hospital, also plunges the offices of the powerful police officers into shadow. Eastwood, meanwhile, sets up a foreboding mood already by showing little Walter saying goodbye to his mother as she leaves for work, when he slowly pulls his camera away from the boy just as he waves sadly out the window.Clint Eastwood claims to have agreed to direct Changeling as soon as he finished reading the script, on the same day it was sent to him. Despite remembering other works by the star as a director, most notably Sobre Meninos e Lobos (which also dealt with a missing child), this new film bets more on the dramatic load of the events that take place in the life of this helpless mother, who even though it is apparently so fragile managed to generate strong and necessary consequences. Jolie, who competed for this role with Oscar-winning actresses such as Hilary Swank (twice awarded, one of them for Golden Girl, also from Eastwood) and Reese Witherspoon (winner for Johnny and June), demonstrates delicacy, determination and complete control of her emotions. , acting in the right measure between the wronged and the independent woman used to fighting for her rights.Angelina Jolie's performance is contained in almost the entirety of the film, managing to create a devastated and lifeless mother, since she is without her son. She stands out mainly in the scenes inside the sanatorium, the most memorable and that most dialogue with the premise of the film. Repeating the stoicism of Mariane Pearl who lived in ""The Price of Courage"", Jolie embodies, in ""The Exchange"", another woman willing to do anything to find a missing member of her family - and the fact is that the actress sensitively portrays pain of a mother facing the worst tragedy imaginable for those who have children. Incidentally, Jolie's performance is so efficient that, even if the film does not try to explain the woman's actions, we understand why she accepts to take a strange child home, needing to face irrefutable evidence to finally reject it: she treats him. Comes from an irrepressible and irrational desire to have her son back, associated with an understandable fear of the authorities who insist on convincing her to keep the boy - and it is only by surrendering once and for all to that desire that she finds the strength to finally face this fear. However, if Jolie deserves applause for her emotional delivery to the character (and Amy Ryan stands out in her few minutes on the scene), the usually efficient John Malkovich seems confused when composing the reverend Briegleb, incarnating him with the cynical tone of a villain still that he is clearly one of the ""good guys"" of the plot (which can also confuse the viewer). Finally, Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore limit themselves to one-dimensionality by embodying the corrupt officers who control the police as men who seem determined to do only evil.But the big problem with ""Changeling"" is actually structural. Straczynski makes his debut in historical drama with skill in the themes and in the game of situations, but without knowing how to balance the high points of the story very deftly. Thus, what we see is a series of twists, climaxes that follow one another without need. And instead of a lean and objective production, we have an almost pamphleteering denunciation in approximately two and a half hours of projection, causing even the most enthusiastic ones to yawn. Many times ""less is more"", and this is certainly one of those cases. With 90 minutes of projection, the main conflict developed by the film (Christine's struggle to be heard) is satisfactorily resolved, giving the impression that the narrative is moving towards its conclusion - when, in reality, we still have almost an hour to go. Come over. It is at this point, by the way, that the script begins to develop a second story, which, revolving around the monstrous Gordon Northcott (Harner, excellent), practically abandons its tone of denunciation with regard to the actions of the Los Angeles police in order to to become a film about a cruel serial killer.Unfortunately, at this point it becomes impossible to properly develop the character of the criminal, which leads Straczynski to ignore his terrible life story (which includes the fact that he was the result of an incestuous relationship between his sister and his father and that he had to mother to help him in his crimes). As if that were not enough, Eastwood, not realizing the narrative redundancy he will commit, spends a long time portraying two trials whose outcomes are clear to the viewer even before the first scene comes to an end. To make matters worse, the filmmaker even indulges in a long sequence that illustrates in detail the execution of a criminal, demonstrating, at this point, that he no longer has any idea about the type of film he intended to make - and the greatest proof of this is that the signs endings reveal the fate of characters who had left the projection more than half an hour ago, when the story had reached its second possible outcome (and which was also promptly ignored by a script that does not seem to want - or know - to reach the end).Even so, the certain amount of mystery added and the interest in the second storyline still keeps the attention and anticipation. So, the film loses another chance to know when to stop. When you enter the courts, the plot becomes smaller and drags on exhaustively. What was extraordinary is lost and, finally, a moment of catharsis appears, the ecstasy of justice - something much smaller than the drama of the mother with the wrong child (and much more explored in low-quality cinema). That's a mistake a director like Eastwood couldn't make. ""Changeling"" is a harrowing portrait of a woman who spent part of her life imbued with stoicism, the pattern of an ideal mother, the one in search of answers about her son's whereabouts. Christine Collins suffered from the pain of not knowing exactly the details that detailed her final and tragic fate. Unlike Michelle Pfeiffer's character in ""The Deep Sea"", Collins was never able to find her lost son. Sad end for a woman so determined to play her ""role"" as a mother. The pain, in cases like this, at least in cinematographic narratives, seems to be greater, as the feeling of doubt in the air becomes more uncomfortable than confronting the violent reality naked and raw.Clearly intended as Academy bait (no wonder the 1935 Oscar telecast is featured prominently in another wholly expendable scene), ""The Switch"" is anchored by a strong performance that, unfortunately, is in the service of an uneven film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

What a tremendous piece of film!!,"I just saw Changeling a few days ago and I have one word to describe it: BRILLIANT!!! I had heard a lot of talk about Jolie's strong performance and it pushed me to see it. And having seen it now, I fully agree with many of these critics. Not only is her portrayal of Christine Collins beautifully poignant, it is also fully engaging (I can see a second Oscar heading towards her mantle).But as well as Jolie's central performance, there is great support from John Malkovich (at his usual best) and from the rest of the previously unknown cast.Beautifully directed by the great Clint Eastwood, who may earn yet another Oscar with this, this film really brings the 1920s and 30s to life. Much like a fine wine, Clint just seems to get better with age.I don't want to reveal too much so I will just say this: You MUST see this movie. For me, this film, along with Slumdog Millionaire, The Wrestler and The Dark Knight have been the best of the year and if you haven't yet seen any of them, you are missing out on the creme de la creme of 2008.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great story, interesting historical setting","The Changeling, directed by Clint Eastwood, is a very well produced movie that focuses on a supposedly true event in Los Angeles,1928. Angelina Jolie does an excellent job as the mother of an abducted child, who goes through a gruelling effort to find out the truth as to what happened. In the attempt to get justice, she has to fight the City and the police force. The movie portrays the period with sets that give us a look at the times. We see the craftsman bungalows in her neighbourhood, the streetcars, the switchboard operators she supervises so the viewer gets a visual treat of the period as well as the story with its multi-layered plot. One can sense the frustration and heartbreak she encounters with the authorities as she tries to penetrate the corruption and cover-up from people protecting their own vice and evil-doing. The acting is good among a cross section of characters. The sets might be criticized for being too perfect and highly sanitized but this is a small complaint, given the positives of the movie.

Clint and Jolie at their best.,"Wow! What a movie. Clint Eastwood has demonstrated his cinematic prowess in this amazing retelling of a relatively unknown event in Los Angeles during the 1920's. Growing up in L.A. I had never heard of what happened in this sad but true story of the disappearance of one young boy and his mother's (Jolie) plight to find out the truth. Angelina Jolie who I have never thought much of as an actress has proved herself worthy of acclaim in this role. This is more than just a adaptation of historical events, this is a picture into police corruption and cover ups in a time when the checks and balances system hadn't yet permeated the Los Angeles police dept. I spent two days after watching this movie researching the actual events and found it to be a very accurate depiction of actual events.

Great film,"Changeling was a captivating and well made film. Angelina Jolie playing a desperate and frustrated mother gives a stellar performance as she looks for her missing son. The film also cast light on the dark past when the police and authorities could often be negligent in their duties and try to cover up their mistakes. This thriller keeps you engaged from start to finish as the audience and Christine Collins (Jolie) search for the truth. Based on real life events viewers can relate to the plight as a woman searches for her son and justice.

Absolutely beautiful,"I am very confused by some of the negative reviews. I thought this movie was absolutely beautiful and especially very touching.
I suggest you ignore the reviews in which is sais that the story is weird or unbelievable. It's all based on real events so how can it be unbelievable???
Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job portraying Christine Collins. You don't have to be a big fan of all of her work (neither am I) but you need to recognise a good performance when you see one. I was also very impressed by the child actors and the guy who played Northcott. This was acting at its finest.

Unbelievably true story of a hideous crime and police corruption,"***MILD PLOT SPOILERS*** (without giving away the ending)Clint Eastwood's ""Changeling"" (2008) stars Angelina Jolie in the true story of a single mother whose young son goes missing in 1928 Los Angeles. The LAPD contact the mother, Christine Collins, several months later and say they found her son, but when she sees him she knows it's not her child. Nevertheless, the LAPD insist that it is, even though he's three inches shorter and circumcised, and pressure her to take him home on a ""trial basis."" When Collins continues to protest the arrogant police captain issues an order to put her into a mental institution. Evidently, the LAPD aren't interested in finding her real son, but rather in saving face and protecting their tarnished reputation. Will Christine Collins get out of the asylum? Will she ever find her son or, at least, find out what happened to him? Will the LAPD be held accountable for their corruption?***END SPOILERS***Clint Eastwood is an expert filmmaker who rarely delivers a clunker regardless of which genre. ""Changeling"" is a drama/mystery with some thriller aspects. I'll be honest with you, my wife bought this movie on DVD and I didn't think I'd like it; the plot didn't interest me and neither did Angelina (she's fine, but I can take her or leave her). However, within 25 minutes I was absorbed into the story and captivated until the end. After it was over I researched the true story of the ""Wineville Chicken Coop"" kidnapping and murder case. The case was so repugnant the town changed its name to Mira Loma in 1930.It's not necessary to say anything more. If you're in the mood for a drama/mystery based on an unbelievably true story look no further. Eastwood also composed the score.The film was shot on location in Southern California and runs 141 minutes.GRADE: A",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A very, very good movie... instant favorite of mine","Changeling is a perfect example of a dramatic, sad story of courage, endurance, and a testament to how some things were just unfair and out of people's hands in the old days. Angelina Jolie shines in her Oscar-nominate role a a single-mother whose son goes missing in 1928 Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the LAPD is under public scrutiny at the time and very eager to solve the missing boy case as soon as possible. This film is very engaging, always interesting, and very well acted. I was very impressed with the way it was shot, the set decorations as well as Eastwood's entire approach to the project. It was stylistically different than Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby, an on the same level of those films (much better than Million Dollar Baby which i consider a great film but not flawless). The supporting cast was perfect as well as Malkovich, Donovan and Amy Ryan all gave refreshing performance. There are some amazing scenes between Malkovich and Donovan, Malkovich and Jolie and Jolie and Donovan. Despite this film being a tear-jerker, a bit frustrating to watch early on, it definitely pays off, and is a big achievement for Eastwood. I enjoyed every bit of it, and highly recommend it to any fan of good Drama films. 10/10 #35 on my list of all time favorite films.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good and Captivating Movie,"What I liked about this movie is that it's based on a true story, set in California in 1928. The tragic and gruesome details of the killings committed by the murderer are so unbelievable that someone would think it was only a fiction story. The behavior of the L.A. Police towards Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), the mother of the missing child, also resemble something you would find more in fiction than in reality but, according to the facts, it really took place at the beginning of the 20th century. The plot and the characters manage to deliver a truly gripping movie, in which the spectator can't be indifferent and wants Police Officer Jones and the Director of the Psychiatric Clinic punished for their ruthless conduct.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Never pick a fight, but always finish it""","I expected CHANGELING to be good but, considering its 142-minute length, also expected some draggy spots. I was wrong on the second count: There isn't one dull moment here. This is one of the few films to come out in the last decade or so that I think deserves at least minor classic status. Fine acting (especially by Jolie but by everyone else as well), a riveting yet well-paced and intelligent storyline. . . just a very fine film in every aspect.CHANGELING is frightening, provocative, and heartwarming all at once. One of the many things this story shows us is how a governmental/police bureaucracy can make the most innocent people seem guilty and the most sane people appear nuts. CHANGELING also provides a clear, immediate portrayal of the late 1920s/early 1930s, revealing how, though very different insofar as technology and styles are concerned, this period was much the same as our contemporary age.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
true story,"sorry for my English.I will not say anything about outstanding play of Angelina Jolie or others. I'd just say, that the most horrible thing in this story that it really happened. And not only that it happens everyday in normal life. Just heard a story that happened not in those days, happened two-three years ago in Russia. The guy new his parents were killed by local police, he tried to get to them with help of federal security service (former name K G B). He thought they can be trusted, but they threw him to the Psychiatric clinic... But unlike this story he never came back from there.Besides that, in USSR in the times of Andropov's ruling, they have built such clinics all over the country. So called medical stars have invented the 'Slowflowing schizophrenia'. And used that term in order to close up those who weren't needed to them.

Easily one of the most well-made films ever,"Most movies stick to one genre, and may branch out to another, but I haven't seen a movie transition this well between genres than this movie since 1991's Ghost. Ghost, like many other movies, was both a comedy and a drama, but I argue that one of the reasons it got its Best Picture nod and won for Best Original Screenplay is because its story was a comedy, a drama, a thriller, a mystery, a crime, and a romance.In this movie, we see a transition from a drama, to a mystery, to a thriller, to a crime, to a courtroom drama, to a history. The story is so brilliant and so brilliantly told. How this movie did not receive a Best Picture or even a Best Screenplay nomination shocks me.Not only well written, but the movie is so passionately directed and acted. You can feel and see the passion in Angelina Jolie's character Christine Collins. In fact, all of the cast, from John Malkovich as the determined preacher, to Jason Butler Harner as the disturbed child murderer, to Devon Conti as the faux son. The determination and dedication by the cast to their respective characters gives serious contributions to the movie. You can feel it.SPOILERS START HERE The movie has the underlying theme and message of hoping in impossible circumstances. Although Christine does not find her son, she brings justice to the man who did her wrong, which may not have happened if she had ignored the whole thing.

Story based on the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders,"This movie is based on a true story that occurred in L.A. in March of 1928. Christine Collins is a single mother of a young boy, Walter (Gattlin Griffith). Christen works as the supervisor of a large group of telephone operators while Walter attends school. One Saturday, when she had promised to take Walter to see a Charlie Chaplin movie, she is called into work to fill in for another sick employee. When she returns from work, Walter is no where to be found. She immediately calls the police, knowing that Walter is reliable and would call her if he had a reason not to be home. The police take her call but reject doing anything immediately: Walter had not been missing for more than 24 hours. After her request is made official, days (then weeks) go by as Walter remains missing.The media is informed and Christine's search for Walter becomes a famous case as newspapers and radio reporters won't let up on the police department's failure to find Walter. A local minister, Rev Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who broadcasts on the radio and has some public clout, seems to be particularly interested in the 'widespread corruption of the LAPD.' He uses their lack of action in this case to further attack the LAPD.Weeks after Walter's disappearance, Christine receives news from the LAPD that Walter had been found with a drifter in Illinois and that he would be returning home safe and sound. When Christine goes to meet him at the train station, the boy who meets her is not Walter (even though he claims to be). After police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) has the newspaper take a picture of Christine and her ""son,"" he insists that she take him home in spite of her certainty that he is NOT Walter. Jones suggests that Walter's appearance may have changed and that Christine might be in a state of shock.When she continues to insist that the strange boy in her house is not Walter Dr. Earl W. Tarr (Peter Gerety), who regularly works with the police, tries to convince her that the new boy's shorter height and the fact that he is circumcised (Walter wasn't) all could be explained logically. As she continues to speak out, the police have her committed to an asylum.She is released when a young illegal immigrant, 14-year-old Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson) is discovered at a nearby ranch. He is arrested for deportation back to Canada. But before deportation, Clark reveals that he was involved in a bizarre series murders (about twenty other boys). The alleged murderer is Clark's uncle, Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Hamer). (For more about the actual events, see 'Wineville Chicken Coop Murders' on Wikipeia.)Could Walter have been one of those murdered..or was he one of the two that got away..or was he still missing in another location? These are the issues that continue to be unfolded as the movie plays out.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Clint Eastwood's overlong historical drama is dark, depressing, but deeply gripping in its roots","This historical drama conducted by the force of Hollywood mogul Clint Eastwood is definitely not a pleasant experience. It is dark, emotionally taxing mystery that centers on the disappearance of a woman's son, every parent's worst nightmare. With a gripping execution and powerfully rooted storytelling, Eastwood pulls almost no punches when spearing the audience with a flooring emotional atmosphere. But above the bleak subject matter is a film that shines bright light of both the directing chops of Eastwood and the acting muscles of Angelina Jolie. While the film never ventures outside of any conventions of its genre or familiar subject material, it shows that Eastwood clearly knows how to handle a compelling story without slipping into the cracks of sentimental contrivances or flimsiness. Inspired by true events, this film is set in 1928 Los Angeles where switchboard operator Christine Collins (played by Angelina Jolie) resides as a single mother of a nine-year old boy named Walter (played by Gattlin Griffith). After a day of work, Christine comes home to find Walter nowhere to be found and reaches out to the LAPD on an investigation. After months of search, LAPD successful finds the child alive and well, and when starts off as cheery mother-son reunion quickly turns dour when the child does not appear to be hers. After adamant claims against the LAPD, particularly Reverend Gustac Briegleb (played by John Malkovich), that they found the wrong child, Christine is declared mentally delusional and is admitted into a mental facility, while Detective Lester Ybarra (played by Michael Kelly) sets out on an investigation that may lead whether Christine is telling the truth or not.Clint Eastwood proves to have the muscle to take on complex stories like these, and this true-story-based drama does a magnificent job at showing it. Eastwood brings a hefty hand at bringing this mystery story in life in ways that leave viewers guessing at nearly every turn. Is Christine Collins right about the child being not hers, or is she a woman overwhelmed with emotional trauma that not realizing she lost is right there in front of here? Only the few who are familiar with the story will know the outcome, but that is not to say that Eastwood fails to keep the events within the complex trajectory unpredictable. Eastwood takes on a daunting task of not only transitioning from the lead character's part of the story (including her time in the mental asylum), to the legal trajectory of the investigation that ensues from her uncertainty, but also balancing the film's two major subplots in an even fashion. One of which centers on Christine's battle of grief with the loss of her son, and her struggle against the law enforcement who refuse to buy into her mysterious claims. The other follows Michael Kelly's investigation on a child who seems to have an odd connection with Christine's son. This all comes down to a series of shocking twists and turns that not only contribute to the grim atmosphere, but sheds light on the ethical corruption of the law enforcement. There is no doubt that Eastwood does stumble on keeping things moving at very few spots, but it boasts a strong hand at balancing these stories with solid precision. The story is gripping, and occasionally holds no bars at tugging at the heart strings.Angelina Jolie has mostly made a name for herself in taking on action roles such as 'Wanted' and the 'Tomb Raider' series. This film however, allows her to exercise a dramatic heft that defies against expectations she is brought in previous roles. Jolie shows out with an uncompromising performance that sees the actress shining with humanity and gripping acting chops. Every she is on screen, it is hard not feel the emotional devastation she leaves swarming in the air. John Malkovich leaves a strong impression in the role of Gustav Briegleb, an LAPD officer who becomes the lead character's sidekick in the second half in the heat of the battle against the law enforcement. Gattlin Griffith, a young actor in his single digits, gives a pleasant performance for his young, nothing to the ordinary to speak of. Michael Kelly boasts a fair amount of grit and integrity of his role as Detective Lester Ybarra who goes on a grueling investigation that leads to results he may forget. The rest of cast whom are all suited in small supporting roles are credible as well. Pointing out an actor that stands out among the rest would be rather difficult task, even with Angelina Jolie in the roster.Changeling is a powerful historical drama that paints a strong picture of Clint Eastwood's directorial talent and storytelling skills, and the absorbing talent of Angelina Jolie. It is a gripping experience that grabs and rarely lets go. If there is anything that chews at the film's compelling narrative, it may the overlong 141- minute runtime which seems to drag on from time to time, and of course, the grimness of the atmosphere. Above all, there is plenty of talent to be admired in this picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful film,"As director of this film, Clint Eastwood brings his passion for telling a story and his attention to detail. And it's an amazing true story that doesn't need any unnecessary effects added to it. Through cinematography and direction, the sense of menace and evil are very effectively put across, not just concerning the pedophile who calmly abducts and kills children, but from a corrupt police department that is more concerned about looking good and scoring political points than about the truth. John Malkovich is magnificent as the pastor who befriends the mother of the missing boy, played by Angelina Jolie. His character may be one of those media savvy, loud and crusading religious leaders, but you get a sense his heart is in the right place, and his speaking out, in this case, is effective in pointing out moral wrongs. Jolie is a little too glamorous to play the part of the grieving mother, I feel, but she does bring a certain quiet sorrow and empathy to the role. She is serious and committed to the character.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fight the Power,"If ""Mulholland Falls"" and other movies have taught me anything, it's that the LAPD has been corrupt for a long time. ""Changeling"" adds to that same narrative.When Walter Collins (Gattlin Griffith) was kidnapped his mother, Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), took every measure to get her son back. When an LAPD captain, Captain J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan), presented a similar looking boy to Christine claiming that the LAPD found her son, she was more than a little disappointed. The boy they'd found was not her son, but to save face they forced the boy upon her and told her she was mistaken. She would continue to fight the LAPD even though the odds were stacked heavily against her.""Changeling"" is one of those movies that wants to make you angry and succeeds, unlike many movies that make you angry for all the wrong reasons. You want to scream, shout, and fight for Christine Collins, particularly because her character is so mild mannered. She was a mild-mannered single woman opposing the force of the entire LAPD which was allowed to act with impunity, what chance did she really have? ""Changeling"" showed what chances she had and just what the LAPD would do to keep a squeaky wheel quiet.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Changeling is authentic and well written, incredible direction from Clint Eastwood","Clint Eastwood's direction in Changeling is seriously superb and the film is worthy of many awards. The film explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, political corruption, mistreatment of mental health patients and the repercussions of violence. That's a lot of topics that needs to be talked about, and Clint Eastwood does a phenomenal job at it. I also have to praise the writer, J. Michael Straczynski for his incredible screenplay. The visual storytelling is superior and matches the writing perfectly. Fantastic cinematography and art design, Changeling is a beautiful looking film.Angelina Jolie plays the leading role brilliantly, portraying Christine Collins realistically and with so much heart.

I am so sorry Clint,"The one and only problem with this movie is that Angelina Jolie played the leading role - I must say I cannot understand why Eastwood would cast her as the protagonist for this film - It was impossible to identify with Jolie as the mother of a missing child and although everything else about this film is top notch - she just can't carry it off and for me personally, she ruined it. I'm sure that Eastwood must have had a change of heart after he started working with her and realized that with all his fantastic directional skills - he won't get anything out of her- what a pity. If Angelina Jolie wins the Oscar for this hapless performance, I will eat my hat.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
compelling story plot with superb acting,"I had never though Angelina Jolie a good actress and my belief was made even more concrete after watching ""The Tourist."" But her acting in Changeling is convincing, truthful enough to change my opinion of her. But most importantly, as I agree to some of the reviewers' opinions, Clint Eastwood's approach to violence is so delicate and creative, leaving room for imagination without giving violence too much attention, so that I was able to be more absorbed into the plot. The whole atmosphere of the movie, and the slow background music captured the old school feel so well. Overall, great modern classic. PS.

Angelina looks authentic in her role, as if she is really the real woman to who this really happened.

Doesn't 'changeling' have something to do with a loaded diaper?,"How did someone who started out making spaghetti westerns get so self-important and full of himself as Clint Eastwood? I haven't seen the entire movie, beginning to end, just sections of it on TV and I just can't force myself to go all the way with it. It had the 'one eye on the Oscars' syndrome feel to it.I think Eastwood has seen too many Spielberg movies and went for the expensive production values rather than memorable characters. Both are experts at creating 2 dimensional characters that I couldn't care less about.First. I love Angelina Jolie but in this dreck, I cringed every time she was on the screen. I didn't empathize with her character's situation at all, which is pretty hard for a movie to fail at so totally given the naturally compelling 'situation'.Second. The story seemed so hopelessly depressing that I couldn't bring myself to care one way or another about her, the kid, the Depression or whatever.Third and most obvious was Eastwood's deliberate and overdone attempt to authentically recreate the era with clothes, cars, streetcars, and all kinds of stuff that seemed to take center stage over anything else. Surprisingly, there were still a lot of anachronisms with things in the movie that weren't created or used till years later. Fail.Sometimes, it's better for a director to create the illusion of an era in the imagination of the audience rather than excruciating close up shots of details to 'force' the notion. Heck, Michael Keaton's spoof, Johnny Dangerously, recreated the era better even while taking great artistic liberties. I'm reminded of how audiences who saw Gone With The Wind thought they saw great Civil War battle scenes in the movie when there wasn't one single shot of that kind. That's great movie making, not simply spending lots of money finding old cars and other objects from that time and putting them in your face on the screen.It's always amazing how some low-budget movies without big stars can do a much better job of storytelling, character development and overall entertainment than the big shots with money to burn.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

I have watched this movie so many times, not only have I cried, but also grown to enjoy kids and want to protect them.

I love it!,"While watching ""Changeling"" again, I began to appreciate it a bit less. It's not because the movie is too long or doesn't have enough action, but rather because the story sometimes tries too hard to make you feel a certain way. It wants to make you outraged when the main character is mistreated or satisfied when things work out. This can feel a bit annoying at times. Maybe the script is too self-indulgent, or maybe Eastwood's directorial style is too forceful. Speaking of Eastwood's style, the music in the movie can be irritating, with the same piano piece played over and over again.Nevertheless, ""Changeling"" is still an excellent movie. The cinematography and production design are outstanding, and they do an excellent job of bringing early twentieth-century Los Angeles to life. The acting is impressive across the board, with Angelina Jolie standing out as a determined mother searching for her missing child, and Michael Kelly delivering a compelling portrayal as a detective involved in the case. The story, based on true events, is both fascinating and intense. It sheds light on various societal issues in 1920s Los Angeles, including gender inequality, political abuse, and police corruption. Overall, it's a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"An intense, Grippy and touching movie","My personal rating is 9⭐ out of 10⭐Christine Collins (Angelina Jollie) was a single parent. She had a son name, Walter Collins. One day he was missing from his home when he left alone. After searching by the LAPD she then got back her child. But refused to accept him as her son. Police claimed that she might be a psychopath and got her admitted into an asylum. All on a sudden a child criminal captured by police and he admitted to knowing Walter collins.What happened to Walter Collins?
Was he really murdered?You have to watch this film to know about these answers.
This film is based on a real story. The story is very slow for some people but every second of this film is very touchy and emotional.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Clint falls badly, Angie continues her streak of invulnerable performances","I find it hard to believe this is the same director who directed the masterful ""Million Dollar Baby."" Perhaps Clint has gotten old and lost in touch in the last year or so? That is all I can think of, as this movie is so tremendously off. Scene after scene, it just doesn't work at all. It's as if an utter hack was directing it.Angelina Jolie's performance is truly terrible. Watching her also, I thought, how can this be the same talented actor from ""Girl, Interrupted""? But the truth is, Jolie is no longer an actress. She no longer takes risks. She just sits there, trying to look like Joan Of Arc(she does this in real life too now.) I don't like comparing someone's on screen persona with their offscreen persona, but Angelina Jolie invites it. I don't think we will see her anytime soon as a character that is vulnerable. And that's the problem. She is so busy playing strong(Marianne Pearl, Tombraider) that we don't feel anything for her. When she is sent into the mental ward, we know she will get out and endure. It's never a question. Contrast that with Jessica Lange in ""Frances"" and you see what Changeling could have been with a better actress and a director on his game.The acting time and time again doesn't work. The screenplay doesn't help anyone. Amy Ryan's character tell us a bunch of things about oppression against women that feels woefully extra... WE GET IT! Doesn't need to spelled out by a prostitute in a mental ward. Holy cow!The few decent moments come from Michael Kelly and Clint's opening jazz guitar.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

A corrupt system,"A period piece about a single mother looking for her lost son? This couldn't possibly be a Clint Eastwood film, could it? Well, if you've been paying close attention to what Eastwood's been trying to say over the previous several decades, it'd be easy to see that Changeling actually fits really well into his body of work. He is essentially a studio director in the modern era, after the fall of the studio system, so, similar to a filmmaker like Fritz Lang, you can't pinpoint the same kind of thematic obsessions at the same ubiquity as someone like Martin Scorsese. However, the tales of individuals being left behind or actively destroyed by corrupt systems simply keeps resurfacing again and again, and this tale falls right into place.Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single mother in late 1920s Los Angeles with a son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith). One Saturday, she's called into her place of work, the Los Angeles telephone switchboard where she was a manager, and has to leave Walter alone at home for the day, returning late to find Walter gone. She reports Walter's disappearance to the corrupt LA police, but months go by without any word. Desperate for any kind of positive press, the police led by Chief Davis (Colm Feore) arrange for a boy found in Iowa (Devon Conti) to take the place of Christine's son. It's obvious that this is not Walter, but the police keep insisting that the awful events of the previous few months were enough to shrink him by four inches. Her plight hits the radio waves in particular because of the Revered Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) who is on a mission to expose the corruption of the police force, and the police captain in charge of the case, J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) decides to forcibly put Christine in a mental institution where the head doctor, Jonathan Steele (Denis O'Hare) puts Christine through the wringer, trying to force her to sign a confession that the boy is hers.Based very closely on a host of primary documents from the era, the script by J. Michael Straczynski takes its first half to really establish character and the overall sense of corruption as told through this limited tale. There is some talk of the gun squads of the era run by the police department, but ultimately its about how they treat Christine, and they treat Christine with disdain, condescension, and dismissiveness, peaking with violence to keep her quiet. It's all well-handled, anchored by a very strong performance from Jolie who is at the center of most of the film, but it's when the secondary investigation begins that the film really gains the kind of character that elevates it.Detective Ybarra (Michael Kelly) takes a random immigration assignment to head out to a ranch in Wineville, California to find and help deport 15-year-old Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson) back to Canada. Clark's uncle, Gordon Stewart Northcott (James Butler Harner), runs at the sight of the police, and a basic interview with Clark begins to uncover the terrible truth that Northcott had been bringing boys around Walter Collins' age to the range and murdering them. Clark even positively identifies Walter as one of the boys. This sets up an interesting contrast of the evil corruption of the LA police with the good, solid work that they tended to do under the radar. Ybarra is a good guy in this whole thing, and the press doesn't care because he's a low-level cog in a deeply corrupt machine that's willing and able to throw a woman into a mental institution because she's become a headache.It's Christine's release where the film becomes more than just a tale of a woman who lost her son and went up against City Hall. It reaches the heights of a complex tragedy as Northcutt gets captured and tried. The contrast becomes almost explicit as Eastwood cuts between the trial of Northcutt and the public depositions of police officials led by the big-time attorney Sammy Hahn (Geoff Pierson) hired pro-bono by Briegleb. It's a strong sequence with some very wonderful and small moments from Jolie that feels like the ending to a lesser film, but it keeps going so we can watch Northcutt's execution and the further slivers of hope Christine receives in the ensuing years.This is one of those scripts that perfectly matches Eastwood's thematic concerns as well as his directing style. It's a film that, if you were to bring it back into Academy ratio and use black and white film stock, you wouldn't have to change much else to make it look and feel like it belonged in the 30s or 40s, something that Otto Preminger or Fritz Lang might have made. It takes its time with a very strong focus on character to help create the emotional reality of the piece, the strong first half that spends so much time on Christine and her plight building up to the second half that has a more subtle emotional appeal as Jolie very rarely loses her composure, sometimes no more than a quiver of a lip. It's not the kind of acting showcase that gains lots of attention, but it's the kind of acting that I find to be some of the most affecting. The script is a great foundation. Eastwood handles the production with extraordinary skill. However, it's Jolie who really give the film its final push, making Changeling one of my favorite Eastwood films. Amidst the very capable and professional cast, I want to point out Herner as Northcott who plays the part like Peter Lorre might have, creating a creepy, deranged, and almost sympathetic character.This period of Eastwood's career feels very similar to Scorsese's later period with movies like Shutter Island and The Aviator, period pieces with a lot of money behind them and an obvious effort by studios to marry the more traditional elements of the studio system with auteur directors they could trust to not explode budgets or make complete messes. And, much like Scorsese, this kind of money was where Eastwood ended up making some of his best work.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Angelina and Clint on FIRE!!,"I haven't seen this movie in a few years now (I'm watching it later on today). I recall watching this the first time around with my old Nan and she and I dimmed the lights, closed the curtains, got comfy and zoned out. Nana was new to Angelina but knew (as she always did) a 'star' when she saw one. She recognised Angelina as well as others such as Brad Pitt and Matt Damon and knew immediately that they were bonafide legit. She would resonate a 'star' via her own benchmark per the golden greats of her time and so recognised 'star quality' upon this formula. After she and I watched 'Changeling' she just nodded and said simply ""what a bloody good film that was!"" and that was that..
'Changeling' feels to me like the last of the great films ie there was 'Revolutionary Road', 'Benjamin Button' and a few others of a very similar ilk and feel and because of this then I feel it is fair to say that 'Changeling' is a total classic for the ages. Angelina is a total badass and personally I feel she is one of the hollywood greats of the last 30 years per her face, per her beliefs, and moreso per her acting ability and credentials. And as far as Clint is concerned then what do I need to say. Clints films are always top top top drawer and they always have been and always will be for now and eternity.

A mother looking for her child will go to the end,"Three times Oscar nominee in 2009, the film ""Substitution"" surprised me with the choice for the main role of Angelina Jolie. Somehow it so happened that the actress was clearly associated with the heroines from the adventures. Her excellent work in the Lara Croft dilogy impressed, and her appearance in ""Hijack in 60 seconds"" and ""Especially Dangerous"" fixed the girl in my memory as an actress of an entertaining popcorn movie. Later I discovered Jolie as an iconic dramatic actress thanks to her work in the films ""Gia"", ""Interrupted Life"" and ""The Power of Fear"". But the film ""Substitution"" is truly impressive and the image of the unrepentant mother Christine Collins, who is looking for her son.The picture sends back a century, where a young woman alone brings up a child, works hard and tries to give her child everything she can. A difficult time, a difficult situation for a woman. The unexpected loss of his son makes him watch with interest what is happening on the screen. How will the heroine Jolie behave, what will follow her attempts to find a child. The work of the actress is remembered, Angelina completely dissolves inside this character. There is no trace of the usual beauty with long legs and pistols in her hands from the adaptation of a computer game. Here Jolie gives out a surprisingly memorable and settling somewhere in the subcortex image of a slouching woman, on whose shoulders the burden of endless searches for a child has fallen, a collision with constant injustice, corruption and the absolute indifference of the surrounding world to her problem.An important moment is the meeting of Collins with her son. It seems that everything ends quickly and even somehow easily, but then these piercing eyes, full of pain and distrust of all living things around the heroine Jolie. Her words, growing into a demand that her son be returned to her, and not that unfamiliar boy that she sees in front of her. It is incredibly interesting to observe a seemingly absurd situation. Well, how is it possible, how is it permissible for a mother to return a child, but not her child, but a stranger? But as the viewer sees, all this is quite real. And then Collins begins his struggle to achieve justice.Jolie is good in this project, this is completely her role, she gave herself to her, imbued with a real character, which she realized on the screen and was rightly awarded an Oscar nomination for best Actress. The victory, however, was celebrated by Kate Winslet for playing in the movie ""The Reader"". And it's hard to say whether Jolie was more worthy of the statuette that year. But one thing cannot be taken away - the role of Christine Collins is one of the most iconic in the career of an actress. Something that allowed her to open up even more as an actress.The picture was directed by Clint Eastwood. Serious high-quality projects often come ""from the pen"" of one of the most famous actors and directors in Hollywood. The man really succeeded in working on this project. He created that unique atmosphere of the distant years that preceded the Great Depression, these colors, these human relationships, this frequent helplessness. It was a difficult time for everyone, and the loss of her son for the main character and the corruption-soaked part of society turned out to be overwhelming and oppressive for the director at all. Even when you are just a spectator of this film, and not a participant in those terrible events.The picture is excellent. This movie is one of those that I really want to recommend for viewing. Strong drama, excellent acting, heavy nerve - all this can be seen in the movie ""Substitution"".10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"GREAT Directing, NOT for teens!!!","this is a great movie. it has the zest of a 80's film. It has a lot of psychological appeal but most teenagers will not appreciate the directing and planning that goes into a film like this- (They'll be thinking OH HOW LONG IS THIS MOVIE, WHERE's THE ACTION etc). Of course, assuming they sneak in somehow (it's rated R for disturbing language and some horrific scenes, no sexuality involved)The first part of the movie is dull, prosaic and monotonous, it takes about 45 minutes to get into the CORE of the movie's substructure. This substructure plot is made up of 2 coinciding events: one is that the LAPD attempts to avoid embaressment by the media, and the other is a serial killer (in the Wineville murders). These two stories interplay into the life of Miss Collins, whose emotional burden is unparalleled. The LAPD pretty much screws her over, and that's the point of the movie. It's main focus is on the actions of the LAPD at the time and to narrate the life of Northcott , the serial killer.If you like psychological/mature adult drama, you will appreciate Eastwood's directing. He is a true genius of the camera and this film represents that (but it is Oscar bait: at 2 hours , it seems eastwood was doing this for an award). The trials at the end elicit sympathy and sentiment for the characters involved, and the viewer leaves with a sense of justice and hope.I have never seen a movie like this. It is long, it is great, and it exposes and inspires. the directors should not have rated R but due to a certain scene at the end, it had to be. great actors. bad thing is it is so hard looking at Miss Collin's face because her countenance is a cadaverous ghastly white, which is in opposite contrast to her lips, which are bright red. She looks so sick that she's hard to look at anymore.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"excellently played, impressive","This is a wonderful movie from Clint Eastwood, also being original compared to others he has released (due to the subject handled and the setting in the late Twenties). The director put together many powerful scenes, including an execution that's terribly strong. That said most of the sequences, though being a bit too much melodramatic, are powerful and the legal/courtroom ending is also effective. Eastwood has here evoked also a typical Hollywood style, in the sense that all the events don't show up in a rush, allowing the story to develop at a pace that could be defined natural. Angelina Jolie is truly impressive and really fits her role, never lacking credibility or pathos (absolutely necessary for the part she played).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A heart wrenching emotional roller coaster,"Clint Eastwood is easily one of the most remarkable and prolific figures in film history, and age has never slowed him down. It's incredible that a man of his age continues to churn out an average of one film per year, in addition to directing everything he's been in since ""In The Line Of Fire"". Eastwood's dedication to creating an atmosphere of escapism and a compelling story packed with great acting is something to marvel at. His latest effort, ""Changeling"", is an emotional roller coaster of a film that hits in more places than it misses, and features some truly dynamite acting.A mark of a great film is its ability or inability to expand as a story. When a film stays on a formulaic road during the entire runtime, despite how good of an experience it can be, I find that it's often forgettable rather than memorable. With Changeling, I found that Eastwood's ability to transform the film through the performances into more than just a 'mother searches for son' storyline, though most of this credit should go to J. Michael Straczynski, the screenwriter. It's like a flower that opens up gradually over the course of a runtime.Despite having the headlining A-lister in Angelina Jolie, she's not the best performer in the film in this writer's opinion, despite giving a tremendous performance. Her work is obviously the emotional center of the movie, as the film's emotion rises and falls with her character's feelings. She does the most with what she can, and may get that Oscar nomination that many scenes see her begging for, but I feel like I've seen better performances this year (especially in the emotionally distraught strong woman character department).The film is held up by some great supporting players, one of whom in particular gives a true powerhouse performance. Jason Butler Harner, the unknown actor in said powerhouse performance, is so effectively creepy and disturbing to the point that you'll have your jaw on the ground. Due to being a virtual unknown, he may not get the commercial recognition that he deserves, but this movie will be his audition tape for years to come for his incredible portrayal of the psychotic and unstable parts of the human mind. John Malkovich's portrayal of an authoritative and controversial reverend is spot on, as he nails the intensity of the character as well as the subdued aspects of him, especially in the end. Then there's the almost out of place Jeffrey Donovan, who is surprisingly stellar in his role as the vile corrupt police captain at the epicenter of the happenings of the third act of the film. Amy Ryan's brief turn is also worth noting. Just like in last year's ""Gone Baby Gone"", Ryan manages to pack a world of emotion into so little screen time.I especially liked how the film firmly established itself as a period piece in the 1920's and 1930's. The costuming and makeup are all top notch. Eastwood's film is beautifully shot, and it had me hooked from the first shot of the movie. The sets, right down to the streets of Los Angeles, are all exactly as I would imagine them being in the time period. It was a gutsy move on Eastwood's part to film so many transition scenes outside in the streets, and it really helps the film.If I had anything bad to say about Changeling, it would be that there are several hammy and ""Oscar begging"" moments that kind of got on my nerves, especially Jolie's parody inducing ""I WANT MY SON BACK"" speech, which kind of got worse for me when I saw who she was shouting at (I thought it was Jeffrey Donovan's character, and it totally wasn't). I also thought more could've been done in terms of developing the supporting players, but at that point I'd be splitting hairs.Though Eastwood's latest picture is quite an achievement, I don't see it collecting all the accolades it was rumored for earlier in the year. It's a strong ride on the emotional roller-coaster of cinema, but falls short in terms of being that one 'monumental' picture of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautifully created masterpiece!,"Well Clint Eastwood has certainly created a masterpiece this time.I'll mention straightaway that it's not particularly my genre, being more of a Drama movie, so I'll be reviewing more indifferently here. Nevertheless, this movie turns out as a pure classic, to be remembered for years to come!**Synopsis**Inspired by actual events that occurred in 1920s-era Los Angeles, Clint Eastwood's ""Changeling"" tells the story of a woman driven to confront a corrupted LAPD after her abducted son is retrieved and she begins to suspect that the boy returned to her is not the same boy she gave birth to. The year was 1928, and the setting a working-class suburb of Los Angeles. As Christine (Angelina Jolie) said goodbye to her son, Walter, and departed for work, she never anticipated that this was the day her life would be forever changed.Upon returning home, Christine was distressed to discover that Walter was nowhere to be found. Over the course of the following months, the desperate mother would launch a search that would ultimately prove fruitless. Yet just when it seemed that all hope was lost, a nine-year-old boy claiming to be Christine's son seemed to appear out of thin air. Overcome with emotions and uncertain how to face the authorities or the press, Christine invites the child to stay in her home despite knowing without a doubt that he is not her son. As much as Christine would like to accept the fact that her son has been returned to her, she cannot accept the injustice being pushed upon her and continues to challenge the Prohibition-era Los Angeles police force at every turn. As a result, Christine is slandered by the powers that be, and painted as an unfit mother. In this town, a woman who challenges the system is putting her life on the line, and as the situation grows desperate, the only person willing to aid her in her search is benevolent local activist Reverend Briegleb (John Malkovich).Source: IMDbStarring Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, and Gattlin Griffith.

Even my friend who didn't really like to watch movies, his eyes stayed on the screen.Amazing plot twists, and amazing acting from Angelina Jolie. She was really great. I've already watched this three times, and it never failed to make me cry. I really recommend it for everyone.The true story that happened in real life was a long time ago. I don't know why the director had an idea to bring the story up, but I am very grateful that he came up with the idea. The story really taught everyone that a mother's instinct was never wrong. She knew that it was not her son. And the best mother is the one who never gives up for their children.And she never stopped looking for her son. Although, we know that maybe she already knew deep in her heart that her son was already dead. But she never gave up because she loved him too much. This fact always made me tear up.10/10.

Great movies have multiple themes, this movie manages to tell 3 powerful stories. They center around the struggle of a single woman trying to find her child.More and more I appreciate movies shot in a certain period of Americana, they spared no expense here. Cars, clothes, advertisements even the little things like period skates, mailboxes and matches.

Outstanding,"Clint Eastwood's impact on this century has been a wholly deserved one. In his practiced and revised methods, love of cinema and wisdom of audience satisfaction that it's no surprise that 3 of his films in the last 5 years have had Best Picture nominations, with all of them only subtly being Oscar bait. Changeling is right at this standard and possibly his finest film since Unforgiven. Through the use of weaving different tones and genres, he's developed a imposing achievement not just for himself but for mainstream cinema as a whole. It takes a lot of its influence from classic film, only in style and not in content, of which the true story is handled with care and taken to cinematic levels – though the influence is presented as homages. I'm completely bewildered as to why this is no longer popularly considered in this years Oscar race as it suits their patterns and has classic, iconic material.Through precise pacing, it remains compelling throughout all the acts, that once a subplot is nearing the end it starts another so the film doesn't drag. It's a film that has completely grasped its scale so it's constantly and consistently intimate and involving whenever a new feature is added. The most fascinating detail I found in the presentation is how the characters are always most conscious of the public's reactions, so much so that they motivate their own actions. However the public are rarely viewed – except during protests, when none of them are given the individual or unbiased opinion. This allows Eastwood the opportunity to use the film's audience as this public, with his knowledge of convention in who they would support within the film; with Jolie subtly viewed as a heroin (despite none of her actions, besides her strength, are specifically 'heroic') and the police viewed as villainous – which is what Jolie's character discovers. With these perspectives not shoved down the audience's throat, it adds to the involvement and overall enjoyment without any use of manipulation. The pivotal theme is definitely mixing morality with justice, which leaves us as an audience to judge the rational actions towards this.Now, of course, the absolute focus and anticipation for the film was Angelina Jolie's performance. She did not disappoint. She amazed. It was a passionate performance in which she completely disappeared into. I could feel her completion during her routine in the first 10 minutes of introduction with her child. I could feel her emptiness during the desperate struggle for mentality during the time without her son. I could feel her relief in the brief time she thought are son had been brought back. I could feel the doubt and denial in her mind when she knew it wasn't her son. I could feel the desperation and frustration during her fight with the police. And I could feel her pain when she was losing. This amount of suffering did not feel overwhelming enough to be ridiculous. She does not glamorise the role nor begs for recognition and praise in her intense portrayal, which she has obviously used the thought of her own children to bring it to heart and make every scene with her in poignant. One of the most pleasant surprises of the film was Jason Butler Harner's edgy performance of the deranged murderer, who's edgy performance challenged Jolie despite his limited screen time. John Malkovich was natural in his role though didn't feel that significant. I respect that it's really only Malkovich and Jolie who are Hollywood actors and Eastwood's only device of gathering an audience. This film does not flash stars.The technical aspects also stand out, creating a pleasant ambiance for the film to settle in. With images blending into each other pleasantly, without the contrast of modern day technology. With this delicacy in the detail it adds the effect of the era and makes it utterly cinematic. The score fits in nicely with a tone that suits the drama of the events. However my main problems with the film as a whole is that it is often too melodramatic (the last line being ""I now have something I never had before last night... hope""). Also the themes are elaborated too much, leaving limited interpretation that anyone could inform to someone else. Despite these, they don't affect my enjoyment and I'd happily label this film as outstanding.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb!,"I must admit that I didn't know much at all about the plot when I put the DVD in the player, although I was, of course, aware that the film had been nominated for 3 Oscars.So when the story started to unfold, with Christine Collins' son having gone missing, I wasn't sure whether I was going to like the film, simply expecting a drama with a missing boy and a distraught mother looking for him for the next 2 hours or so.That changed the very moment ""her son"", who she insists is not her boy, is returned to her. From that moment onwards, I was glued to my seat. A fantastic performance given by Angelina Jolie, and a storyline that any writer would have difficulty to come up with, it's so unbelievable, so chilling, so outrageous. That the script apparently sticks very close to real events definitely works in favour of the film.This is a very powerful piece of art!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

It is harrowing. You have to stop the DVD every once in a while to take a breath.

"""Yours is a story with a happy ending, Ms. Collins. People love happy endings.""","I liked it slightly less on this rewatch. Not because it's long or because there's too much/not much going on. It's because there are certain moments where the film is catering to the audience, making the viewers feel outraged when the main character is wronged or content when something goes the way it should. Not that it's a big issue but this subjective approach becomes a little too intruding at times. Maybe the script is too self-indulgent or maybe that's just Eastwood being Eastwood and over-directing. Talking about Eastwood being Eastwood, his score for this movie is quite galling, that same piano piece playing throughout the movie to the point of suffocation.Nevertheless, Changeling is a magnificently crafted film, with pristine cinematography and marvelous production design, giving palpable life to a world set in Los Angeles in the first half of the twentieth century. The acting is good across the board, with stand outs Angelina Jolie as a mother fighting to find her missing child and Michael Kelly as a detective who works on the case. Based on true events, the story is interesting and intense, touching on many aspects of the life back in the day in LA, like gender inequality, political abuse and police corruption. Great movie.43 likes",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful,"Christine Collins' (Jolie) son, Walter, is missing, feared kidnapped, and when the police return her son to her, she sees the boy is not Walter.This is a true story. And, for such a true story back there in 1928, where was this story before? How many other stories are hidden from us that show police corruption and complete disregard for citizens rights? As you go on in this story you will see that one person can make a difference and affect the necessary changes to correct to something we thought was there all along.Angelina Jolie plays the part of the wronged mother to perfection and her nomination of Best Actress was well deserved. John Malkovich is, well, John Malkovich and his very name is synonymous with the definition of perfection. Jeffrey Donovan is a new comer who has his own TV show, Burn Notice, and did an excellent job. He sometimes let a little Scottish accent creep into his dialogue, and I liked that.In the story Christine plays a telephone operator supervisor and that was the first time I ever saw or even heard of those supervisors using roller skates to roll up and down the long line of the regular telephone operators. Imagine what the first job interview must have been like - Q: Can you roller skate? A: What? I thought this was a telephone jobThe movie is a little too long with too many anti-climatic moments  when you think it's over, it's not. But, seeing as this is a true story we need to see it to the end regardless of its length.This could very well have been nominated for Best Picture. Clint Eastwood is a Master Director.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, some not much.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent,"Excellent performances all around, especially by Angelia Jolie, who won't give up the search when her son is kidnapped. Her dismay and anger at the lack of interest by the police comes across quite true. Really a nerve wracking film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mostly gripping,"Very good drama directed by Clint Eastwood. Angelina Jolie overcomes being the most photographed woman on the planet and constant tabloid fodder by delivering a restrained yet powerful performance as the determined mother who only wants her son back. Beautiful design and attention to 1920's period detail, and solid direction from Eastwood. I like how the film references the 1935 Oscars ceremony to explain a future plot point--anyone with a reasonable knowledge of film history would know that Collins (at least in the film, that is) does accept the date! It dragged a bit towards the end, after Jolie's release from the asylum, but otherwise very gripping throughout. No Oscars for ""Changeling"", but a very worthy film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Changes the Face of the Crime-Drama Genre!,"Changeling, a riveting true crime story set in Los Angeles in 1928, is proof of Clint Eastwood's sure touch and emotional acuity as a director on powerful display. It's a mesmerizing human drama that pulls us in, to the haunting strains of Eastwood's resonant score.9 year old Walter Collins disappears from their suburban home while Christine is out working at a telephone company. The LAPD does a rather sloppy job with the investigation. Five months later, when the trail has gone cold, Christine finally gets word that Walter has been found. In a taut scene later, LAPD stages a massive press conference in order to generate good press for the embattled police department, which has fought allegations of corruption and brutality.but Christine threatens to rain on their parade when she points out that the boy (Devon Conti) is not her son. With that revelation, the film veers into spooky, almost surreal territory.As Changeling gathers momentum and shifts tone, it retains a unifying quality, a bleak and melancholy air that sustains it through its transformations. Clint Eastwood, at the peak of his artful powers, adds to his already impressive body of directorial accomplishments with Changeling - a sordid tale of the abuses of power, a gripping mystery and a shrewd historical period piece which documents several concurring events which changed the landscape of Prohibition era Los Angeles. He tightens the screws of suspense without ever forgetting where the heart of his film lies. Lesser hands might let the story sink into teary sentiment.Yet the real draw here is Angelina Jolie. Not only does she dazzle visually with her unique features heightened with pale complexion and red lipstick, but Jolie provides an emotionally breathtaking performance. She plays Christine Collins like a gathering storm, moving from terror to a fierce resolve. The trauma she suffers is almost tangible as it pours off the screen. View the scene where she confronts the impostor posing as her son; tremble at her throaty scream; feel the pain and anguish. She evokes every parent's worst nightmare, and provides a career defining performance while doing so.All in all, it is a devastatingly poignant story, beautifully told by a filmmaker right at the top of his game. A failure that's more involving than most successes!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Runs well over 2 hours, feels like 4.","Boooooor-ring. That's about all that can be said. Running time of over 2 hours feels like four by the end. Not even good as a chick flick, due to the total lack of romance. Angelina Jolie performs passably well in the hopeless task of breathing life into this corpse of a film, but even she cannot do much with the material. Worse than that, the 1930's era clothing doesn't even give one a chance to appreciate Jolie's physical beauty. No sex, no violence, no romance, no action - to whom was this movie meant to appeal? The sets were almost laughable, as apparently everyone in 1928 drove perfectly immaculate, polished cars that look like they were driven directly to the set from a 2008 antique auto show. The clothing and interiors were the same - perfect, clean, polished, immaculate. Better throw in surreal and fake. As a big Clint Eastwood fan, as well as an admirer of Angelina, I had high hopes for this film. Sadly, none were met. Don't even bother to rent it. It's just not worth it.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amongst the best of American cinema,"J. Michael Straczynski and Clint Eastwood deserve many honors for this because chief among the very good acting ensemble and the technical realization etc, the writer and director stand high.Like ""Chinatown"", this movie's story starts simply and then opens out into directions that were not foreseen; it takes in the worst of people, and takes on themes that are not easy in mainstream movies any longer. Straczynski's script is well poised, with clarity and well defined differences in character. The narrative drive is balanced and always engaging. Indeed it may be a school for scriptwriters like Towne's Chinatown continues to be.And then there's Eastwood's direction, precise, integral to the story and timed so well that like all of his later films it has a distinctive sense of time. Just count the beats, it is unlike any other director. It makes the reaction shots work, it gives space to the pauses, and because the actors are thinking under the direction, these are not dead spare, unnecessary moments. It is distinctively American in tone and phrasing.If there is one small snipe it's Eastwood's musical score: they are sounding too similar with their limpid, even folksy simple, melodies; and while they work in parts, they are not the strongest artistic element.And central to the project is the story which is one of the best and saddest and proves why strong stories still make engaging movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic,"Changeling is based on a true story about a mother whose son disappears and while that sound like a simple/ familiar story, the film is excellent. I was expecting a good film having seen Letters from Iwo Jima but this film shows all of Eastwood's talents. The acting, cinematography, production design and directing are all superb.Angelina Jolie gives a great performance and deserved the Oscar nomination. The supporting cast are also very good ensuring that the film never drops in quality when Jolie is not on screen.While the story maybe too dark and disturbing for some (there is a scene that will make you question if yo want to watch the film again), for those who choose to watch the film will find it to be a gripping experience that leaves you hanging on every word and will leave the viewer satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A True Story That Is Sure To Pull Some Tears From The Audience,"Clint Eastwood has once again created a master piece that shows us the beauty of an evil world. The story of Christine Collins is one that must be told to remind us that suffering knows no limit, and even in the worst of situations, individuals have the ability to change the world for the better. The film is by far one of the best of the year, and is sure to receive a few Oscar nominations, ( Best Actress, and Best Director to name a few.) Although it is hard to connect with the story emotionally in the start of the film, as the plot gets deeper, we become attached to the characters and you are almost afraid to see what happens to them, because you are so connected to them. Altogether it is definitely a film that you should go see if you haven't already.Jesse McKenzie",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A strong emotional drama,"Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most versatile and respected filmmakers today. He started off his career as an actor in the 1950's and became a director in the 1970's, and moved on with both careers, until his retirement as an actor in 2008 with 'Gran Torino', but his directing career is moving on at a fast-paced rhythm. And the also 2008's 'Changeling' proves thar he, at almost 70 years old, still got it.'Changeling' is set in the Los Angeles of the late-20's. It tells the story of Christine Collins, a hard-working woman that finds out her son, Walter Collins, was missing in one afternoon. After searching for him during months, the police gives back Walter to her, but she doesn't fells that's her son. This is an actual story that really took place in that period, therefore the screenplay is accurately based on what really happened. The script is extremely well-written, taking the actual events and transforming then a little bit for dramatic purposes, based on actual statements, newspapers, etc. Even though this is a very powerful story and it was well-told, the script can be a little annoying at some parts, with the too-often repetition of Christine saying 'my son'.The acting here is nice. Most of the supporting cast delivers a nice job, the movie was well-cast, John Malkovich is great as the Reverend that helps Christine and no one else other than him stands out. The problem with the acting I have here are the child actors. Of course you can't expect much of children, but most of them don't act their ways out. The only child actor that delivers a good performance is Gattlin Griffith, as Christine Collin's son. The main part here went to Angelina Jolie. I've never saw a movie with her other than the 'Tomb Raider' series, so it's nice to see that she can act. She gives a strong performance as Christine Collins, and it was even Oscar-nominated for it. I really can't think of any other actress to portray the lead role so well as Jolie did.As always, Clint Eastwood directs this movie brilliantly. His talent as a director is absolutely undeniable, and he proves it once again. I think any script would work on Eastwood's hands. As of the other aspects, the soundtrack here is so-so, it serves for dramatic purposes but it isn't memorial at all. The cinematography is well-made, with some beautiful shots, but the art-direction and set-decoration transform this movie into a great representation of the 1920's.Overral, this is a very strong emotional drama. The true story is very interesting and used in a very nice way by the script. The cast is all nice, with a exception for the children actors. Jolie delivers an excellent performance in the leading role. As always, Clint Eastwood makes a very competent job directing. The soundtrack and cinematography are both nice, and the movie is a nice representation of the 1920's Los Angeles.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A fantastic, powerful film","Changeling story has been described as being so extraordinary that it's impossible to make up. Changeling is a powerful film, which has multiple stories for audiences to sink their teeth into: a family tragedy, police corruption, a story about a serial killer, a political campaign and a trial movie just to name a few. It is a film that was overlooked by the Oscars, like The Dark Knight was in 2008.In 1928 Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a loving single mother to 9-year-old Walter (Gattlin Griffith). When she is called into work as cover Walter disappears, with Christine missing him for five months. When the LAPD say they found Walter, giving the media a great story. There is a catch: the boy was not really Walter and Christine starts to campaign against the police who claims she is insane, an unfit mother, etc. With the aid of veteran campaigner Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), Christine proves that the police knowingly gave her the wrong boy and bring down a corrupt police force and mayor. Add this done with backdrop of the investigation of the Wineville Chicken Coop murders.Changeling had everything you would except from a award contending film: great actor, writing and direction. It had a number of themes and ideas that would show that it is a real film of merit. Some ideas of the film are similar to L.A. Confidential, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Girl, Interrupted, many good serial killer films and the electro-shock treatment scene reminding me of Requiem for a Dream. Under the skillful director of Clint Eastwood he captures the periods with all set designs and costumes, whilst using more modern film techniques, like steady-cam and CGI: it was a little like David Fincher's Zodiac. After some slow moments in the beginning Eastwood is able to pick up the pace and he is able mix all the story elements together like it was effortless. He is able to film some really dark scenes, particular the way the scenes in the chicken coop were effectively creepy and scary, particularly how he used silhouettes; but so too were the scenes in the psychopathic ward. Eastwood shows how a political campaign functions on the ground and how the police would go about discrediting someone, using their own doctors and pretty much lock them up without any due process. Eastwood knows how to make a film and Changeling is one of Eastwood's best films as a director.Though Eastwood is a very talented director, he had a great script by J. Michael Straczynski, who is best known as a sci-fi writer, writing Babylon 5 and comic books, particularly Spider-man and Thor. For Changeling its report that he up 6000 historical documents and legal transcripts, with 95% of the script based on it. He writes a brilliant screenplay filled with character and ideas. As well as exploring the idea that the LAPD was corrupt (which still seems to be an issue e.g. the Rodney King beating), the police doing everything to discredit any critics, particularly women, and look for quick results and not willing to admit when they made a mistake (which is still true today). There are other ideas, such as the sociological idea that insanity is a social construct, that when someone is marked insane all their behaviour is seen through that lens. There are ideas of using the pulpit as a political platform, which of course men like Martin Luther King, Desmond Tutu and Pope John Paul II used. We get to see the make-up of a serial killer, someone who is creepy and insane, but also very cold and cunning, carefully planning his crimes. The idea of a serial killer is also nothing new, they have always been around in some form. Even the title Changeling has meaning because it in fairy tales a changeling was a soulless or empty child. The other meaning is a mystrical creature like a troll or an elf steal a human child and replace it with one of their own, thereby it ends up being raised by humans. Hopefully Straczynski can write more films like this and get to fit more ideas in his sci-fi work.There is a great cast in the film. Jodie in my opinion is a terrific actress and I prefer to see her in more roles like this, compared to action roles like Salt and the Tomb Raider series. There is a little bit of shouting which is expected from a Oscar nominated performance she was still very convincing and powerful as a mother fighting a powerful enemy and determined to find her son. Her performance felt natural, a woman who was intelligent, committed and wrong. Malkovich's performance was a lot more understated then his performance (usually psychopaths) and because of it I think its his best. He too plays his role with real conviction, a dedicated campaigner who wants to support Christine but also has his own agenda. He should have had more award nominations for this role. Jason Butler Harner was effectively creepy and insane as a serial killer who does not care about what he did and Jeffrey Donovan was charismatic and oozed hatred as the police Captain who plays one of the main antagonists of the film. The child actors were also very good in the film, particularly Eddie Alderson as a very scared and emotionally damaged young teenager suffering emends guilt.Overall 2008 was a great year for films and Changeling can easily join the ranks of films like The Dark Knight, Wall-E and The Boy in Striped Pyjamas as the high points.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
WOW! ...Pleasantly Surprised,"I usually think of Angelina Jolie as a show off. In regards to most of her movies, she's just LIKE that. But recently, I think she's begun to mature.In this film, she became a character I could actually CARE about! This & SALT are two of her films that I actually care about her characters.You actually ROOT for the characters you're supposed to root for, and you start to HATE the characters you're supposed to hate! I mean, this was amazing! I mean the hateful actually do become so hateful, you feel like you just wanna PUNCH them in the face! Wow! And in the story, justice is certainly given where it's needed!Also, the costumes and sets are amazing. The design for the time period really looks convincing.Clint Eastwood is amazing not just as an actor, but ALSO a director!

I mean, it was called for, the timing was right, you FELT the same way Jolie was in the movie, and, yes, it WAS awesome! I usually don't like swearing or profanity, but here, it's one of the few exceptions! LOL yeah.

Clint Eastwood does it again...,"Ever since Eastwood donned the director's hat he has produced masterpieces in almost every genre and style of movie making. Be it the enigmatic stranger in High Planes Drifter or the wronged Rebel in Josey Wales.

It scores very high in subject matter treatment . Full of Eastwood's archetypal conceptions on Morality, Good , evil the movie forces one to cry for the saint as well the sinner.Hope and Hopelessness are just two sides of the same coin.

Heart-Wrenching Drama,"A woman's son goes missing and is returned to her by the police a few months later, except that it's a different boy. This is a heart-wrenching drama based on true events in 1920s L.A. Jolie gives a moving performance as the woman who must deal with not only the loss of her son, but also a corrupt police department determined to discredit her for insisting that the kid is not her son. Eastwood does a great job of evoking the period and building the tension. After an intriguing start, however, the film does seem to lose some its focus and lingers too much on subsidiary aspects of the case. The supporting cast is good, but why does Malkovich deliver his lines in a robotic cadence?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Story of Righteousness,"Good movie. Nice layers unfolding regarding the missing boy. If it wasn't a true story one might deny it's plausibility. Very good performances. The supporting actors were truly enriching for the film. Surprisingly good acting from children. Many moments where I wanted to punch out one or two characters on the screen for being such puppets, and if/when they did get what they had coming, I had to exclaim my satisfaction out loud.Made me think about how much denial of the obvious truth we all allow and are sometimes complicit in via our silence. Great examples of how sometimes people will do the most dishonest and unthinkable things, just because they are caught up in a machine, a bureaucracy, and go too far before they realize what they have really done. Great examples of how easy it is to be fooled by voices of authority, because if we can't believe them, then who do we believe?Though I would have wanted it to be a touch shorter everything seemed necessary. Maybe it was just me on this particular day.Every Eastwood directed film I've seen has such class and calm confidence, I truly enjoy his work. Once again, a great story of righteousness.

"Some movies are made just for commercial purposes,while some are made to set examples and leave a mark....","At times, it is seen that the latter ones turn out to be absolute classics. And Changeling is one of those movies.Firstly, the plot. Inspired from real-life events in Los Angeles in late 1920s, the plot slowly and carefully depicts the social standards of people and the civil services of that period. Especially, it focuses on the inefficient LAPD and this aspect plays an essential antagonistic role in the movie.The story is primarily about a single, working mother , Christine Collins (played by Angelina Jolie) who comes home one night, late from work, only to find that her only son is missing from the house.She checks everywhere she possibly could, and eventually reports the LAPD about the incident. As months pass by, there's no sign of her son as the LAPD fails to find even a single trace of the boy.At this point, the viewer connects with the characters pretty well, sympathizing with Mrs.Collins and forming hatred for the LAPD. The story takes a twist, when, after a span of 5 months, they LAPD , in a glorified fashion in front of the media, reunites Christine Collins with her lost son, showing that the department can ensure safety of the people. Well, this is a very significant event, considering the fact that the boy is not the son her mother was looking for. And, as she speaks of the fact, the LAPD chief insists her that she might have been wrong, owing to the inner emotional conflicts and the time her son was away from her. She is forced to accept in front of the media this falsehood. Later on, she finds out vital proofs that the boy is not her son. And thus starts a journey and sequence of incidents of a mother who just fights to want her son back, and the dirty politics she faces played-off by the LAPD , let alone the dire consequences, the torture(being send off to a mental asylum forcibly etc.).In the meantime, a huge incident of homicide unearths in another part of the country, and this big incident ultimately connects to the prime story smoothly by the second-half.Secondly, the performance(s). Until now, we have seen Jolie in glamorous,action-packed roles, those which have very little scope of drama.But in this movie, she surprises by showing her real acting talents, of what she can be capable of. The way she manages to connect with the viewer is simply amazing. In fact, the movie is able to jerk tears in some sequences. Hats-off to Jolie. We would want to see more of her in such roles in the upcoming years.Almost all the actors in other roles manage to pull off a fine show, although i think the role of the Reverend could have been played better by Michael Caine. But apart from that, everything about performances is fine.Thirdly , the direction. Eastwood fan, anyone? Well I bet there are many, but if you are not, you will be added to the list, and would want to watch more and more of his movies, that's my bet! Making the film move in such a smooth pace(you never feel bored at any point of time), narrating the story of each and every character in such a delicate fashion, Clint Eastwood deserves to have a standing ovation for his work.So all in all, a perfect movie, that leaves you mesmerized in the end, and makes you feel and understand the agony of the protagonist. A serious drama, suitable for a repeat viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A well made movie by Clint Eastwood,"I like the way this movie moved. It flowed with good energy and kept a nice pace that made the story dramatic and suspenseful.A woman's child goes missing and when the LAPD finds him it turns out to be the wrong child, which leads to an even greater downfall for the woman as the LAPD attempts to cover up their mistakes.Set in the late 1920s the movie speaks about police corruption on all levels and the politics that come along with it as well as the feeble metal Health program at the time.I love the art direction and costume design that takes us to that time period.Jolie's performance was very focus. The combination of Eastwood's kinetic storytelling gave it the feel of an action movie without being one. Jolie was intense as a woman whose dedication to finding her son was very black and white, similar to Eastwood's Dirty Harry character.The Movie seems very truthful to what the world was like back than. It looks good thanks to the art direction, but it's not pretty.Overall, entertaining",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heart Wrenching,"I think we rarely see this decade portrayed as having hideous monsters existing in it. Something quaint and innocent about those times. Simple. Until the violence enters into your life. You can't imagine the unspeakable pain that is ripped from you when the truth comes to the surface.Angeline Jolie is fantastic in this film. Best I've ever seen. She morphs into the role without her glamour, seamlessly. You can feel the frustration in her eyes. The pain she suffers is within her hunched over body language. She's a distraught mom and plays it perfectly. I think Malkovich was completely underrated in this flick. He plays a pastor who is clearly fed up with police corruption. You don't know what they've done to him in the past, but you feel he's on a crusade.You feel that his lost cut deep in the past. And he seemed to relish in being a blustery fire-n-brimstone defender of justice.Eastwood's direction, as usual, is very low-key. He gives you the era without making it flashy.

Eternal vigilance: price of liberty... and identity,"Changeling is about one of the more positively heroic women (and men, primarily in the person of Reverend Briegleb) of the 20th century... as well as about some of the most despicable human creatures inhabiting what was supposedly, qua free country, inhospitable to petty tyrants in political subdivisions. It points out in a microcosm that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty: that if the people do not constantly watch what is happening in their local government (and if responsible civic leaders do not put in the ""sacrifice"" of their valuable time to contend with the sinister-powerful who wait like Dracula for the slightest dimming of the light), the most egregious crimes against humanity will occur.

Cinema Omnivore - Changeling (2008) 7.7/10,"""Jolie, tricked out with a potpourri of exquisite millinery, calls forth a very compelling impression of a woman in distress and remarkably refrains from letting a hardened badassery (the image audience rather familiar with) emerge out of Christine' meek, passive persona. Even when she finally roars, after realizing a closure is unforthcoming from Gordon, it is the eruption of irrepressible ire rather than malice. Jolie injects plenty of pathos and dignity into Christine's ordeal, for once, she busts her chops to remind the world, before becoming a mega cinematic action star, she is an Academy Award winning actor, which is opportune to fan our excitement and raise the expectation bar toward her upcoming Maria Callas biopic directed by Pablo Larraín, a third Oscar nomination looks propitious.""-",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Long Lost Boy,"It's always one of the last things we would ever want to happen, but the terrible truth is this is something that could happen to anyone, and when it leaves a permanent scar. There are very few film that can make me cry and this is one of them, but also strangely this actually is one of my favorite films from Clint Eastwood.Not a whole lot I can really say, I like the production value capturing 1920's America a decade long gone. From the wardrobe, cars, customs, everything. I really like the music score which has a somber and almost haunting tune to it. The writing is great the fact that it's by my favorite comic book/script write J. Michael Straczyski whom is known for the ""Superman: Year One"" graphic comic series is fantastic, it would be cool if he did scripts for movies a bit more often.Supporting character Rev. Gustav played well by John Malkovich (TV's ""Crossbones"") its to me is one of his better roles. He's pretty much a radical/activist that is helping out Christine in finding her son by rooting out the corruption going on in the LAPD. He's also kinda funny he has some charisma in some scenes.Howvever to me it's Angelina Jolie (Malificant) whom is one of my favorite actresses that really carries the movie, this to me is one of my favorite roles from her. She does a great job at portraying Christine Collins whom is simply an ordinary working class woman from a period long gone. Her character you just feel deep pathos for as she is constantly and desperately trying to seek help in finding her lost son.You really can feel her pain from what's in her eyes and all the crap she is just going though, let alone getting crap canned from the precent she asked for help from. You really feel angry at the pricent which isn't doing there job and seem to be more busy at trying to keep their hands clean, but their hands to me look plenty dirty to me; and for the record I fraking hate crooked cops.The scene when Christine says ""I want my son back."" that always breaks my heart a bit whenever I heard that. But one scene that really broke my heart was when Christine was passing by the school again after the crap she went through in the psych ward she was illegally sent to. Just the look on her face and seeing the school it just put tears in my eyes and made me cry, knowing that her son use to go to that school and the fact she passing by it shows how far and lost her son may'be.Police must always protect and serve the law and people, but must never abuse the power behind their badge to their own uses.

Surprisingly impressive,"I never considered Angelina Jolie an accomplished actress...she was, in my opinion, just an undeserved A-list actor who couldn't really act...until I saw Changeling. She has depth I never imagined; she took me on a journey I never foresaw. I was so impressed with her growth as an artist, so taken with her ability to emote. I have newfound respect for her. This website requires me to write ten lines, but that's not really necessary. You only need to read what I wrote, to know that I was moved to the point of writing this; all you need is to follow this advice: Watch this movie.

"Strong and  poignant drama, wisely and intensely directed","Having just seen ""J. Edgar"" at the cinema, watching ""Changeling"" for the first time on TV last night made me necessarily find similarities between these two great works by that gentleman named Clint Eatswood. Apart from some resemblance in the plot (in both movies a boy disappears), what is in common is the lucid denunciation of a perverted, wicked institutional power, tyrannizing the common people to the point that not only does not the police help the helpless, but moves against them and against verity. It's probably my total aversion to power abuse, and arrogance in any field of life, that made me appreciate both movies so much, also because the style is always so calibrated, balanced, sane. Certainly, there are strong scenes (for example in the mental hospital) but simply because necessary to the depiction of a whole system where violence and abuse dominated. However, never is a single moment of insane taste for cruelty or violence for its own sake or for sensationalism to be perceived. It's a movie full of controlled pathos, with very intense moments, and featuring great acting (the only disturbing thing, Angelina Jolie's over-glossed lips, truly out of tune, in some cases). Once again, Clint never disappoints, on the contrary proves to a great director, combining a deep personal humanity, with a strong consciousness of the means he has in his hands, and being able to use it intensely and wisely.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well done, but disturbing film.","While this movie was a very beautiful film to watch, and Jolie's acting was surprisingly quite great, the second half of this movie proved to be quite disturbing. I don't want to give anything away, but there are scenes in the movie that partially show the killing of and killing by children. I was sick to my stomach the the final 1/3 of the movie and had to leave at one point. There is also a scene that disturbingly shows a woman being given shock treatment at a psych ward.I sadly cannot recommend this movie because of the few very disturbing scenes that ruined it for me. Otherwise, this movie would be highly recommended.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Milestone....,"Based on real life events in 1928 Los Angeles comes a Milestone of a film, made by none-another than CINEMA LEGEND Clint Eastwood. 'Changeling' is must watch for each & every human being alive! 'Changeling' is not only about a mother & her lost child, but also focuses on the shitty & corrupt side of the LAPD & on the infamous ""Wineville Chicken Coop"" case. This is real stuff, this happened way back in the late 1920's. Honestly, 'Changeling' is such a real & moving experience, that you really forget that you're watching a film made by Cinematic Legends.Written Brilliantly by J. Michael Straczynski & amazingly executed by the Greatest Film-Personality, Sir.Eastwood, comes a film that we'll remember for a really, long, long time for sure.In the acting department, Angelina Jolie delivers an astounding performance as Christine Collins. She plays the helpless mother with rare ease & understanding. John Malkovich is first-rate in a dynamic role. Jeffrey Donovan is perfect. Jason Butler Harner & Colm Feore are good. Amy Ryan, Michael Kelly & among others are satisfactory.'Changeling' is a true story, told in the most beautiful & truthful way. Two Big Thumbs Up!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A surprisingly complex Eastwood melodrama,"Eastwood's libertarian leanings coupled with the underlying story's feminist perspective render a film that managers to make a lot of cogent points without being preachy. Collins absolutely was taken less seriously and treated worse because of being a single mother, or to use the parlance of the time an independent woman. In a different director's hands this point would have been in bold yet Eastwood renders it in graceful italics. The film's script does not fixate on the abuse of state power but Eastwood really gets that point across directorial. Instead of the two political sensibilities clashing they end up melding into a easy, restrained naturalism that utterly fits the narrative. Certain scenes are disturbing in the way they should be. There is little justice in this story and Eastwood does not flinch from all the ugly aspects of the story.Much of the film is restrained, Jolie, to her credit, is not. She gives a bold performance that renders Collins with the appropriate forceful personality. She is motherly, strong and elegant. This is truly her film from beginning to end.But I would be rueful if I didn't mention that Harner (Northcott) gives a memorizing performance. His character is human without being sympathetic. The final scene between him and Jolie is the film that has stayed with me all these years.The film has very nice cinematography. It isn't overly stylized but Eastwood and his cinematography do enough to have echos of noir present. The film has the same natural lighting style as LA Confidential. It is very visually pleasing to look at on top of the film leaning into its melodramatic aspects.This is late period Eastwood at his most interesting.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Changeling: A Comment.,"Almost everything within the film is calculated to hit extra hard at our emotional chords, to tug our heartstrings in support of the heroine, fill us with rage and disgust at the sight of the actions of the powerful leaders in the story, and, of course, jerk the tears from eyes. Eastwood's more recent films in particular are known to contain some sentimentality but, until now, he's refrained from hitting us over the head with the overexuberant brand of saccharin, meritless emotion found in many other films based on real-life accounts of peril and injustice. Yet, that is a particular test ""Changeling"" does not quite pass, though it is still far above some of the biggest and worst weepies in the room (""Tsotsi,"" anyone? Or, perhaps you would prefer shedding tears to ""Central Station""?).Part of the problem is the way the central character is portrayed, not entirely due to Jolie's work, but also to the fact that she, and as such her character, comes across as rather too glamorous for the predicaments she finds herself in. Even during the most trying scenes, such as searching frantically for her missing son, dealing with a police department that is, at best, apathetic and, at worst, one of the chief causes of grief Christine Collins (Jolie) and the audience are made to suffer, she seems oddly beautiful in a way that leaves a disconnect, to the detriment of any realism the movie may have otherwise had, with the drama that unfolds.As was the case in last year's ""A Mighty Heart,"" in which the actress delivers another impassioned performance as a woman who is, in many ways, in a similar situationtragically wronged by circumstances and people beyond her controlit is often difficult to see past her movie-star glitter to get to the raw agony at the core of her character. A large part of this has to do with how the film visually presents her. Her hair and makeup are just right enough to flatter her, even during her most trying times within a grim psychiatric ward, many of the patients of which arrived unwillingly mainly because they were an inconvenience to the police and others in power. She is always filmed by the director of photography, Tom Stern, to look beautiful, almost saintly. That's not a criticism of his work in the film generally; it appropriately renders a vivid interpretation of a 1920s Los Angeles reminiscent of old Hollywood pictures. However, it does distract from Jolie.Despite the objections, the film is by no means ruined by the glamour and the oversentimentality. Rather, these are mainly a distraction from what is otherwise a compelling and memorable story, written by J. Michael Straczynski, otherwise told relatively well. The basic story is perhaps the best thing about the film, more likely than not because it it presents an inherently compelling situation. The way scenes are intricately intercut (by editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach) so as to play off each other is an old tool of storytelling that is used to good effect here, though more for dramatic effect than as an essential method of conveying the plot. Overall, the film could have been more efficient, with a few minutes being trimmed from the film, most obviously the aforementioned Oscar scene. Also, some sequences do feel repetitious in plot and especially in the emotions evoked.In the end, while ""Changeling"" is an engrossing story, its distractions interfere with the film, rendering it far from perfect, and, ultimately, minor Eastwood.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

A thoroughly absorbing mystery,"There's no more gripping mystery than a missing child case. Just take a look at the tabloids, who reported the disappearance of little Caylee Anthony for months. If it is a gripping drama for outside viewers, imagine what it must be like for the parents of a missing child. That's what Clint Eastwood's harrowing film, ""Changeling,"" gives us. This is an unforgettable film.Los Angeles, 1928. Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) leaves for work. When she gets home, her son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) isn't there. She calls the police, but to no avail. But after months of searching, her son is found. However, the boy returned is not Walter. The police don't believe her, and do everything to make her go away. Help arrives with the Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb (John Malkovich), who has long been denouncing the corruption in the LAPD.""Changeling"" has a brilliant story, and director Clint Eastwood wisely focuses on that. Therefore, I find it rather odd that Angelina Jolie walked off with an Oscar nod for her performance. Don't get me wrong, Jolie's performance is amazing, but I think her Oscar recognition was more due to the fact that it would have gotten a lot more viewers if Hollywood's Most Beautiful Couple (Jolie and Brad Pitt) were nominated in the same year. Then again, I guess some recognition has to go to Jolie for being able to pull off a meek disposition in front of the cameras.Jolie is helped by a number of solid supporting performances. John Malkovich is surprisingly good, playing against type as Briegleb. If someone were to tell me about the character, Malkovich, having made a career out of playing creeps and psychos, is the last person I would have picked. But Malkovich holds his own. Jeffrey Donovan is PERFECTLY cast as the corrupt police officer, Captain J. J. Jones. If there's anyone who can put on an instantaneous fake smile, it's Donovan. That, and he is so good at being so thoroughly unlikable. Jason Butler Harner is chilling as Gordon Stewart Northcutt, bearing a very strong similarity (in both his looks and his performance) to Cillian Murphy. Michael Kelly is warmly low-key as Detective Lester Ybarra, the first cop who is willing to publicly believe Christine. Colm Feore, looking more gaunt than ever, is also effective as the corrupt Chief of Police.Special mention has to go to the cinematography and the costume design. The color is desaturated, but in an artful kind of way. It looks like a magazine ad, and the effect is amazing. The costume design is spot-on. Everyone looks just like they did in the 20's. If the story weren't so engaging (which it is), ""Changeling"" would be watchable just because of how it looks.I've lost confidence in Clint Eastwood's direction after the vastly over-rated ""Million Dollar Baby."" But with ""Changeling,"" Eastwood proves that he's not afraid to take a chance with his films. And he has the skills to pull it off.Rent ""Changeling."" It's better than most of the so-called mysteries out there. It's tremendously involving, and unlike most ""thrillers,"" it's never predictable. That's more than can be said for many films.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

True story? No. I read the book. Fantastic book.,The book this lousy movie was based on is Anthony Flacco's The Road Out of Hell. Sanford Clark is the boy who miraculously survived two torturous years living with a sadistic psychopathic uncle. He was 13 when his parents allowed him to be taken out of his home in Canada to start a chicken farm in Southern California. The book was almost totally about Sanford and how his intelligence and ability to read his uncle allowed him to escape death. The boy the movie was about was one of two brothers who were victimized by the uncle. I suggest you read the book as it is far superior and has nearly nothing in common with the dull rendition Eastwood produced. Extremely disappointing.,1.0,Anonymous,Biography

In that terms, I think she did more than fair job to her role.I will give 8 because movie beginning made me not to give full even though movie picked up immensely after that.

Another enjoyable Eastwood film,"Eastwood is a very talented movie maker. The film looks beautiful and the music is also beautiful. Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie detracts from the film by looking more like a glamorous 1920's Hollywood star than a mother who is living out her worst nightmare. I'm not a fan of Ms. Jolie, but her performance in the movie is not bad - it just seems more attention was given to her lipstick than to her acting. Both of the actresses mentioned - Hilary Swank & Reese Witherspoon - as lobbying for the part would have brought more substance to the part. Shame on Ron Howard for wanting Ms. Jolie because her look was more suited to the period. Hasn't Ms. Swank proved she's a chameleon when it comes to her looks - and Ms. Witherspoon pulled off transforming herself into June Carter! I agree with another poster who after researching the story of Walter Collins was less enthralled with the movie. Overall, though, it is a beautifully made film as are most films directed by Mr. Eastwood.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"No masterpiece, but good enough","Changeling is Clint Eastwood's 31st film, one of five he has released in the last four years. Although with Gran Torino the now-elderly star has announced his probable retirement from acting, in other ways he shows little other sign of slowing down, being now in the middle of 'The Human Factor', due out next year. At the tail end of an illustrious career, Eastwood's stock as a director has remained high throughout, his concerns consistent. He learnt his trade at the side of such American professionals as Don Siegel but arguably has superseded his mentor, and others, as the years have passed.Based on true events, Changeling continues the feminist strand in some of Eastwood's work, where the casual, callous treatment of women, taken either as the main or side event, forms part of the narrative. The film is sturdy, reliable, involving and includes an outstanding performance by Angelina Jolie as the mother who won't give up. If there's an unspoken 'but' in that last sentence, ironically it's because the film is so thoroughly excellent all round, but no more. The art department is painstaking in its recreation of period detail, the narrative deft in projecting its chief protagonist through various trials and tribulations (including traumatic incarceration in a mental ward for her obstinacy); John Malkovich plays well as the crusading Reverend Briegleb, who takes Collins' cause to the wider public, and so on. Even the film's less satisfactory elements, being those for the most part surrounding Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) the child abductor - whose representation as an unbalanced individual is a little too exaggerated, and the associated gallows scene has been questioned by some critics - do not really detract from the overall achievement. But a thoroughly good, decent movie is not necessarily a great one, and ultimately it lacks an edge at its centre.Changeling locates the dark heart of its city in the corrupt administration of justice, doled out by well-played cops and officials who might, never the less, have strolled in from any other good movie. The immorality reaches out of city hall to pervade and ruin the lives of those who cross it. Polanski's Chinatown dealt with corruption, albeit at a slightly later date, festering at the heart of personal and civic society, also in historic L.A. But there the malign influence spread outwards from the individual and family towards the environment. It's a reverse process which started that masterpiece off with a cynical, dark heart denied to the less scabrous family drama sitting at the core of Changeling: that of Collins' separation and continual love for her missing son.Christine Collins seeks justice. The sort of justice that will do is never in doubt, right down the verdict of the final trial, scripted with the help of existing records. To take one more observation from the earlier film, in Chinatown the justice required is often fateful and unclear, making the reaching for it seem far more dangerous and, perhaps, more memorable. Missing persons, unsolved mysteries and corrupt officials are usually the province of the private investigator. Christine Collins' reluctant assumption of the role of heroine, aided by her reverend friend and supporter, is something the story made essential - even if a story played out through the persona of a distraught mother could easily become melodrama.It's to Eastwood's credit that it does not. Despite Collins' lurid treatment in the mental home, electric shock treatment and all, the director's restrained treatment of the subject matter, as well as the inherent dignity of Jolie's character, all buoy the film up, whilst Malkovich's dignified contribution to proceedings adds a further touch of class. Eastwood's empathy with actors is such that Jolie, in the DVD interview accompanying the movie, claims at one point that she only wants to work with Eastwood from now on - a flattering exaggeration, but doubtless reflecting the high regard he gets from colleagues. The director's calm, proficient touch is everywhere until, it must be said, even the matter of serial child torture seems de-sensationalised, the unpalatable made practically palatable. Perhaps this is one reason why the execution scene and asylum shock therapy is emphasised as it is, in order to restore something of the necessary horror and revulsion back to the narrative.Critical niggling aside, none of this is to say that Changeling isn't a success on its own terms, deserving of high marks. Excellence brings it own rewards; here's a movie which never drags, provides consistent, entertaining drama showing old-style film making at its best.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Missed Opportunity to Make a Classic,"How I wish I was Clint Eastwood's Editor!Changeling had all the makings of real classic - great story, excellent period location, solid actors, good score...etc, etc, but as usual with Clint, he's overcooked it, takes it one more step and the work skirts with the pornographic.He should take a leaf out of Hitchcock's book and realise that less is often more in movies. Scorcese also talks about the missing frame on celluloid being planted into the viewers mind (for examples see Tarantino's ear cutting scene in Reservoir Dogs or Danny Boyle's Shallow Grave burial scene.)What we have with the Changeling is a well produced, well detailed, well acted drama, but it goes to far.The drawn out execution scene was completely unnecessary, as was the over blown asylum scenes.Angelina Joli does well in a meaty role, but you can't help feeling she is going through the motions at times and not varying the emotions enough to make it interesting. At almost every dramatic turn we see her face crumple, a few tears fall, then the hands shake, the trembly bony fingers and soon it's the head in the hands and cut to next scene. It all looks a bit formulaic - the method gone sad if you like.Malkovic puts in a decent shift as the militant preacher fighting police corruption and bad cop Jeffrey Donovan is also pretty good if at times a bit too stupid to be a top cop with his completely narrow view of events.It's worth watching this movie for the sets and the good storyline, Eastwood delivers fine production values but he needs to get a grip of a decent editor to avoid these dark indulgences that we witness far too often in his movies - Mystic River (a terrible final scene), Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby to name but a few.Changeling? Watch on TV or rent don't buy the DVD as it's unlikely to invite a second viewing for most.One final side note - Eastwood might have introduced some typical 1920s entertainment in the back drop - i.e. there was no radio, no source music and the town and townsfolk seemed to be completely lacking in any form of entertainment - bear in mind the film is set in LA during the boom of cinema, live theatre, live music and speakeasies full of flappers - but there is not a sight of any of that. Eastwood's 1920s LA is like Moscow 1950. Disappointing because he had a big opportunity to capture the mood of the 1920s v the contrast of this dark story. All in all worth watching, but once will probably be enough!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
a heart wrenching story - too incredible to be true - but is,"I watched Changeling yesterday night. I liked it a lot.It's played by Jolie, who most unfortunately did not get my sympathy, method actress she is not.In a nutshell, the movie talks about how her 9yr old boy goes missing. And the police bring hr back the wrong kid. It may be disputed if the police knew all along that the kid was not hers from the get go (clue is when the kid says ""the police told me to say it"" before being carted off by ""his mother"" in the middle of the movie), or whether they are just covering their shoddy police work after returning him.But after watching the police officer bullying her, we know that what the reverend says is right : The whole police dept is crooked.The continuance of the movie goes from chilling to unbelievable to damn near sci-fi with the way facts are represented, and how the story continues. Suffice for me to say is, you WILL be SHOCKED.The conclusion is just as good, and the ending does not lull you into any feeling of goody-goodness that the Hollywood movies are so blamed of. the movie could have ""finished"" about 15 min before it did, and the point would have been passed across, however the way it IS finished DRIVES the nail in even deeper.I give this One and a half Thumbs up.The movie is saved methodically by John Malkovich in his excellent role as the minister, the chief of police played by Colm Feore, and the confessing kid (Sorry couldn't find out his name).The story is chilling, and after viewing you really feel you need to research it, as did I.so checkout the article regarding the movie at http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95935010 anyway, The movie is well written and EXTREMELY WELL Directed. the casting of Jolie was a mistake, and the only reason she fits here is because she is SO SKINNY of late that it oddly fits the middle of the movie, but just looks weird at the beginning.What human beings are willing to do to keep there place/jobs is horrendous, and to find out it's for real, and this is based (not even loosely) on a real case, is chilling in the least.You'll be thinking of this one for a while.Clint has been making these ""makes you think"" movies for a while.You should also watch Gran Torino by Clint.If you loved this, You might also like STUCK, which is just as impossible to believe.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Clint Eastwood and Angelina Jolie Triumph,"I disagree Clint Eastwood had Angelina crying at every turn as one reviewer put it. Imagine if that were your son...how do you think you'd feel? If anything, I thought AJ played it exceptionally well, considering the circumstances she was thrust in by a psychopath who kidnapped her son. There's nothing worse than losing a son, daughter, brother, sister or parent. Being a single parent only made it more traumatic for AJ's character. Everything was on her shoulders...the guilt for leaving her child alone, the wonder if she'd ever see him again, the rising, then falling, then rising again of hope he was still alive somewhere. Then she skillfully portrayed the anger and disgust with the LAPD, who tried to force an impostor as her son on her. Then there was the outrage of being committed to the mental ward without provocation. Love her line after seeing her friend endure shock treatment. Give Clint Eastwood a compelling story and skilled actors and he'll come up with a gripping film just about every time. This was among his best, in my humble opinion. It was also among Angelina's best. Hard for me to believe she wasn't even nominated for best actress...I thought she richly deserved it.",,Anonymous,Biography
"One of Angelina Jolies Most Dazzling Performances,","Changeling is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a talented cast.It is easily the best performance that I've ever seen Angelina Jolie deliver,I've never seen a movie where she dosen't seem like herself in some way,I can always see a lot of Jolie in her acting,that she isn't full committing to her character.In this however,Jolie has completely became this character,it helps that,her being a mother,lets her know what a situation like this would be like for her,and it makes for a dazzling performance.It is some of the most impressive directing work I've seen from Clint Eastwood,which is saying a lot because he is a fantastic director,but there are so many shots that look absolutely beautiful and tricky to film,he did a superb job.The film got a bit less interesting in the middle which was a small issue for me,the first and final forty minutes are terrific,but half way through I felt it dragged on a little and was a bit too detailed with some slightly unnecessary information.

One of the best of its kind,"I try to watch everything Eastwood has directed; he hardly ever misses, and is responsible for some of the greatest dramas that I have seen. This isn't the very peak of his abilities, but as for movies of this type, it's nearly without equal. It is a truly inspiring piece on standing your ground, and fighting on when the system refuses to help you. This is a tremendously strong woman, and often not just ""for the time""(and yet it does not feel anachronistic; add to that the marvelously achieved look, with amazing sets and costumes). The mother-son relationship is gripping, without crossing into obsession(I'm looking at you, The Forgotten). This is an emotional roller-coaster that very nearly moved me to tears(and that doesn't happen frequently), and it is absolutely devastating, unpleasant and terrifying. It is not a coincidence that this opens with ""this is a true story"", instead of saying ""based on"". While I do not know how close to the actual events it is, it certainly feels authentic. This builds up suspense and tension well when it goes for them, though note that neither are the focus here. The dialog is good and well-delivered. Jolie gives a stunning performance(Clint has been quoted as remarking that few would notice, since she is so attractive), and with only one or two exceptions(I maintain that the titular person was wooden, and no, not only when he was supposed to be ""rehearsed""), the kids are amazing actors, as well, especially the one seen the most(there will be no spoilers in this review). The characterizations are well-done, if you could argue that it is a bit black and white. Humor isn't bad, or overly frequent. There is a lot of disturbing content, occasional bloody and brutal(if not all graphic) violence, a little swearing(all used for and with effect, not remotely gratuitous) and brief nudity(not sexual) in this. The DVD comes with two featurettes, both of them up here on the site, so I will be writing about them on their individual pages. I recommend this to any fan of the film-makers.

"Changeling, Utterly Captivating","There are three things that make this movie the classic it should become. One, Angelina Jolie rises above the hype to give a performance that should have won her the Oscar (I saw the Reader. It wasn't that great). Two, the look and sound of every scene is so crisp and polished that it's impossible to look away. Three, the mystery story with a dash of social justice that gives you hope for the human race.Changeling is about Christine Collins, (Jolie) a mother from Los Angeles whose son (Walter) goes missing one afternoon after a long day at work. When she discovers that he is missing she calls the police who won't send a unit over until 24 hours after the kid goes missing. The next day the cops show up but it seems to be too late. However, 5 months later the LAPD say they have found Walter but when she meets the boy at the train station, it's not her son. After weeks of giving the LAPD chances to admit their mistake, she goes public and with that the cops have her committed to a psychopathic ward filled with women who have caused trouble for the Police Department.What to say about a film of this calibre. The writing and directing are phenomenal. The lighting and the cinematography make every shot have a gloomy tone that fits perfectly with the story. It's obvious that Clint Eastwood put a lot of emotion into this film because not only do you feel for the characters when they are down but you have a great sense of pride in human nature when justice is served.One of the characters who will probably never be given enough credit is Rev. Gustav Briegleb (portrayed by John Malkovich). He is very reminiscent of X from JFK. His story of conspiracy and corruption within the LAPD gives you chills. Malkovich is only one of the supporting actors who is very deserving of credit. Jefferey Donovan as Captain Jones (the officer who claims that Collins is crazy) and Colm Feore (the police chief) also give stirring performances.The only problem with the film is that near then end they keep having scenes that could have been the ending, but then it continues. You only understand the reason for these multiple climaxes after the real ending comes. They show true growth in Jolie's character and although a bit confusing you see the amazing change from a woman who is content to let things go by into someone who stands up for justice and the rights of everyone who is oppressed by hierarchy.",,Anonymous,Biography
"A very impressive movie, which makes you thinking","Before I saw this movie,I thought it might would be boring but then I watched it and now I think this film isn't boring at all. The film is made without special effects, this makes the story and the acting more important, and both of this are great, the story is gripping and even if you know it is a true story it is unbelievable. The most important role is the one of Angelina Jolie as Christine Collins, and with Angelina Jolie Clint Eastwood made the best choice he could. She acts fantastic and her acting makes this movie such impressing and because of her it is so memorable to.I would recommend this movie to people who like gripping and impressive films, it is nothing for people who just go to cinema to laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Possibly the Most Horrific True Crime Film Since ""Zodiac""","Seventy years ago, Christine Collins, the mother of a missing boy, Walter Collins, tried to convince the LAPD that they had found the wrong child. She insisted they needed to continue their investigation. Except in this case, the LAPD decided she was a trouble-maker and put her into an insane asylum to shut her up. What was the use of a woman going around bad-mouthing the LAPD about a case that had been solved? The main point: don't mess with the LAPD. Strangely, how little things have changed? The story, for those who don't know it, uncovers one of most heinous crimes against children in the 20th century, the so-called Wineville Chickencoup Murders.The LAPD comes off somewhat similarly to the recent problems with the SEC in that instead of investigating what they should have been investigating, they spend their time playing damage-control. They were hoping that putting Collins in an institution would help prevent them from being on the receiving end of fear and loathing from the public, via the press. But they put the wrong person in there. At first the story centers around Collins, her missing child, and the corruption of the LAPD. Gradually, another story emerges, the serial killing of small boys by a child molester, Gordon Northcott. Northcott makes the likes of Hannibal Lector seem somewhat tame. The exposure of this case on film is one of the most disturbing cinematic episodes I have ever viewed, right up there with scenes from Apocalypse Now! and Zodiac.The center of the film is Christine Collins, played brilliantly by Angelina Jolie in maybe the role of her career, as the wronged mother of a missing boy. Her story propelled by Jolie is quite compelling despite some of the awful circumstances that come her way, particularly her incarceration into an institution. According to the film, many women, some of them prostitutes, were unjustly incarcerated when they refused to play along with the corruption of the LAPD. This story rings strangely familiar...Again high marks go to Clint Eastwood for directing and producing what may be the most horrific film with which he has ever been involved. Northcott, the real life child murderer, is as heinous as the fictional character Scorpio from the first ""Dirty Harry"" movie. But in the case of ""Changeling"", instead of going outside the law in the name of justice, the LAPD seems to be aiding and abetting crime.After having read about the case, both of Collins and the Wineville murders, the filmmakers did a tremendous job in maintaining much historical accuracy. Which may also keep some viewers away. This is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, and is definitely not for the feint of heart. Or those with emotional instability. The entire story draws the viewer in like a reluctant witness to the injustices of the LAPD and the horrific activities that took place at a chicken ranch on the outskirts of Riverside County. If anybody in the LAPD and Wineville besides the victims were trying to come out looking positive, they failed miserably. Christine Collins received a new voice to tell her story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Had me glued to the screen from start to finish...,"I saw this on DVD recently and this was an amazing movie! I wasn't sure what to expect - all I know it was about Angelina's character having a son returned to her which isn't actually hers. When I watched this, I was instantly glued to my TV screen from start to finish, absorbed into this time and this horrific tale of a mother's vow to get her son back.Angelina is fabulous as Christine Collins who is battling the Los Angeles police department and their corruption. She is claiming that they have brought her back the wrong boy when her son is missing, while the police department is trying to defend themselves.It is good to see Angelina take her acting to new levels. She has recently been in too many blockbuster movies such as Tomb Raider, Wanted etc in which she is reigned as the action queen of Hollywood. But in this movie, she shows that she is definitely one who can take on a role as serious as Christine Collins and her desperation to simply get her son back.This story shows the fragility that women feel in this period as they would most likely feel powerless against the men in the police department and how they are seen as insignificant in their own opinions. In a sense, this film is almost like political activism and brings about a change in society through this film. It is even more stunning to know it is based on real events which adds a sense of realism to this film.This is a heart wrenching and emotional story. I have read that a lot of people find this hard to watch, and I do see where they are coming from, as the film does go down some disturbing paths and scenes, but in the end you get a beautiful film with terrific performances. The relationships between the characters is very touching and you really root for Christine Collins in her fight to gain justice not only for herself, but also to other women in the story who have met with some nasty fates due to the police.It had me glued from start to finish and this is definitely one of those movies that sticks with you, simply because you can only imagine what it would have been like back in those days, and how one person's fight can change society.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than most critics say it is...judge for yourself...,"I intentionally waited a long time to see CHANGELING (as long as three months after its release) due in large part to the lukewarm reviews it received. I now believe that such reviews were given due to Clint Eastwood's long list of recent successes. While CHANGELING is not quite as good as his latest offerings, it is still a worthwhile and memorable watch.The style of CHANGELING (reminiscent of the 'early decades of the 20th century' style used in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, CHICAGO and CHINATOWN) is visually stunning, and Eastwood manages to infuse an element of film noir into the Motion Picture that I happen to really admire.The story is a quite compelling and engrossing one, as expected of films of this nature, but in my opinion, there was too much focus on the secondary story and not enough on the primary one.Angelina Jolie's acting is not as outstanding as many make it out to be, but it is still a fine piece of work. It's just that she seems lost in the role (not in a good way) and comes off as uncomfortable with such a difficult character to portray. Her Best Actress nomination seemed undeserved when compared to other strong performances that year that didn't make the final cut (most notably Kate Winslet in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD). The rest of the acting is quite excellent, as even the secondary characters deliver solid performances, and manage to outshine Jolie in many instances.All I'm saying is that CHANGELING deserves a chance, regardless of its reviews. If you are a fan of CHINATOWN-styled film noir, you'll probably appreciate this. 9/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should just about enter my Top 200 at 198. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good movie. Not perfect. Not even outstanding. But good.,"Very good movie. Not perfect. Not even outstanding. But good.This is from someone who thinks Eastwood isn't that great a director and Jolie is a grade C actress. But both do a mostly credible job here. I thought the guy who plays the bad guy (the really bad guy, not the cop) was exceptionally convincing, and I'm surprised he hasn't gotten more attention for the role. John Malkovitch is annoying as a thoroughly UNconvincing political-activist-masquerading-as-Protestant-preacher. They should have just had him play contemporary actor John Malkovitch; it would have been the same performance. The kid who plays the protagonist's alleged son is even more annoying, because he's so thoroughly unlikeable and wicked. The corrupt cop isn't exactly bad from an acting point of view, but he lends a definite sense of conscious malice to a role that is apparently supposed to be explained by thoughtlessness and inattention. I was under the distinct impression throughout the whole movie that he pretty much knew the kid was a phony and just didn't care.Too many unsympathetic (dont even get me started on that doctor) and hard-to-swallow characters sully this otherwise absorbing movie. Kind of in the same way most peoples' opinion of Silence of the Lambs is significantly lower today than it was when they first saw it, I predict people's opinions about Changeling will sour over time. The characterizations just don't, for the most part, ring completely true.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An engaging and professional drama despite the misgivings,"Awards season carries with it a raft of films that are ""Oscar-worthy"" and all tend to be released in the UK during January and February. I understand the reasons for doing this but sadly it is not for the sake of the viewer because most cinema goers do not want a glut of films in one month and then nothing till the summer time but then I suppose awards = money and this is what the studios want. Changeling came out in the UK at the fore of this season (in November/December I think) so I managed to catch it then and did so with Oscar hype and awards chatter in my ears. I managed to block out a lot of this though as I have been burnt before and I came to the film with little knowledge of the plot and not quite sure what to expect from it.Perhaps this helped me because I do seem to have enjoyed the film more than some other viewers here. What I found was a quite engaging drama that is helped by its ""true story"" tag but is solid enough to stand up on its own regardless. The whole narrative is charged with injustices and emotion and it is hard not to care as events unfold  I was quite held by it and I can't see the view of those that say it was dull. The downside of the film is that, while the events grip, the emotional heart of the film is surprisingly cold, with the viewer putting in most of their feelings and the film coasting on this. By nature of the story the viewer will bring a lot to the table and I did feel that the film coasted on this to a certain degree. This does hurt it because the lack of that on the screen does perhaps contribute to some viewers not being drawn in by it.Eastwood's direction is part of it as it is a bit too clinical  it makes it feel of the period perhaps but the cold edge is the con to that pro. Likewise the casting of Jolie. I agree with Eastwood's comment that her ""look"" fits the period, because her face certainly does, however this is not enough and I found her performance to be a bit lacking  not bad but just ""ok"" with ""give me an award"" moments in there as well. One can easily imagine what a better and more able actress could have done with the material. The rest of the cast are solidly good in the same way  with nobody really setting the world on fire but yet plenty of recognisable faces and names doing good work in smaller roles. The film belongs to Jolie though and, on the basis of that ownership one can understand why she was nominated for her Oscar while, at the same time, seeing why she didn't actually deserve to win it either.The liberties with factual detail did not bother me at the time of viewing (as I didn't know the story at all) and didn't after I read up about them (I try to see ""true"" films as an entry level summary rather than fact) and generally I did find the film to be engaging and professionally made across the board (acting, sets, direction). The problem with it is that it is quite cold and it doesn't produce people so much as it does events. These events are sufficient to make for a good film but the lack of more prevents it being more than this.",,Anonymous,Biography

An emotional and unsettling picture of the American justice system in the '20s,"""Changeling"" reminds me a lot of 1997 thriller ""L.A Confidential"" in that it deals with police corruption and P.Ds' frightening level of power. The problem with that is ""Changeling"" takes place about 25 years earlier -- same police department, same problems, different era. It's unfortunate how incompetent our criminal justice system was and in many ways still is and that's what makes ""Changeling"" such a difficult film to stomach. It invokes rage, sadness, disgust and sympathy -- and when you've had enough it keeps going. But it's a beautifully realized period piece and a quality film from all aspects.Although ""Changeling"" earned Oscar nominations in deserved categories such as cinematography and art direction, it's hard to understand why there wasn't any love for J. Michael Straczynski's thoroughly reported original screenplay. This is one of those stories that's so unbelievable and so unsettling that you can't make it up and despite its length, Straczynski tells it in a compelling and emotional way.""Changeling"" is about Christine Collins (Jolie), an L.A. single mother whose son Walter disappears for several months. When the police find him, she insists right away that he's not her son and the police department insists that she's wrong. When the case builds in publicity, she's shipped off to a psychiatric hospital, but a politically passionate reverend (John Malkovich) as well as a young boy's story might uncover the truth.There are so many painful and uncomfortable elements to this story that you wish it weren't true. You almost want to be spared the emotional agony of all the lying, corruption, torture and death. It's by no means a horror movie, of course, but each subject matter is heavy. Part of the film, for example, deals with the case of a serial murderer who has killed children. That's weighty stuff, and while it stirs up our emotions and makes the film more powerful, it doesn't change that it's tough to bear.Director Clint Eastwood and star Angelina Jolie are an excellent match in this film. They try and plant us deep down within Christine Collins without overplaying the clichés of a woman who cries wolf but the powers that be declare her insane. Knowing Collins is a self- sustaining single mother, Jolie plays her with much more inner resilience. Eastwood includes her face at nearly every juncture of the main story's aftermath and you get the perfect sense of how she's feeling. That's critical because despite all the corruption and intrigue of the story, this is still her life and livelihood here. No one has more at stake than she does.This troubling true story is top-notch film-making, an exquisite stone lost beneath a pile of rare and more exotic cinematic gems that comprised the great year for film that was 2008. The costumes and period detail is vivid and Eastwood's cinematographer Tom Stern does some of his finest work wrapping characters in the shadows of this harrowing film.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
That little miracle called Angelina Bertrand Voight,"I don't have anything against directors shooting the same movie again and again, from different angles and points of view. Some of my favorite directors (Hitchcock, Carpenter, Kubrick) spent their entire careers doing just that.And, fortunately, the same thing happens with Eastwood work. ""Changeling"" is, in a sense, ""Mystic River"". In another sense, is ""J. Edgar"". In yet another sense (the darkness, sadness, desperation and violence underlying the Charleston dancing, coke-sniffing, miniskirts blowing in the 20's US society) is a profound reflection about ""In cool blood"" and the manner in which the authority figures cooperate with the bad guys.But this particular movie is not about love, killers or bad cops; it studies the way the general corruption of the official servants (call it politicians, doctors in public health services, policemen, church priests, journalists, lawyers, foreign services et cetera) simply collaborate with the pervert, abusive, molester crooks of this world. Eastwood tells us all the time: ""With friends like those, the victims need no foes"". Under this light, the movie becomes an essay about the lack of individual rights and guaranteed freedom that all the Western societies are supposed to grant to their citizens.With all the accustomed minimalist mise-en-scène and a wonderful, extremely detailed makeup and costumes, Eastwood's steady hand guides the action through touching, full of emotion, many times unexpected paths.The story progresses nos-stop; the dramatic crescendo is unstoppable and ever increasing, the camera work is astonishing and, supported by a very apt cast, it lead onto an incredible final climax (with the usual Eastwood's low-key end after the grand finale).The movie depicts, also, a little acting miracle: Angelina Jolie's powerful character, treated here as if she were a blind, furious, devastating force of nature. She will relentless follow her objectives no matter what her enemies do, leaving them no place to hide. She's a storm, a tsunami, an vengeanceful earthquake that cries, yells and punches the evil organizations in the very heart. Will she fulfill her desires or not? Doesn't matter. The real matter is the fight, not the success.For short: a film about our daily struggle with the stubborn, corrupt and selfish States.Worth seeing: Positively.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mastress-Piece,One of the classic movies with Angelina Jolie in the lead roles - Best part is this movie is based on real life story - Never knew that a woman has to undergo so much pain in just letting know the cops about her missing child and look at the treatment they give her back - If this is the case then no one from the public would have courage to report this crime and this movie serves the purpose of re- igniting the public to raise the issue to the cops no matter whatever the result is.

Another fine effort from Eastwood,"""Changeling"", one of Clint Eastwood's two directorial efforts from 2008, concerns a single mother whose son goes missing and is supposedly returned by the LAPD. However, she immediately realizes that the boy returned to her is not her son but is instead another boy apparently coaxed into co-operating with the police. Despite fierce resistance from the authorities she stubbornly sets out to uncover the truth about her son's disappearance.For those unfamiliar with the term 'changeling', it is a term from European folklore referring to a being left behind in the place of a stolen human child. The reference is metaphorical here since the story is based on actual events that transpired around the time of the Great Depression. I don't know how close the film sticks to the facts but the plot does manage to mostly steer clear of contrivances.Angelina Jolie is the undisputed star of the film and hers is a role made for Oscar consideration. She received a nomination for her performance though it is perhaps just a little too showy for my tastes. In my mind, the film's key performances come from relative unknowns like Jeffrey Donovan, Michael Kelly & Jason Butler Harner. Also of note is the always dependable John Malkovich in the film's main supporting role.The film's look is quite attractive and the Oscar nominations for cinematography & art direction should have resulted in wins in my opinion. Eastwood's direction is also impressive and, what's even more impressive, he also composed the score (which is reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmith's score for ""Chinatown"").Being a film about a mother searching for her lost son, ""Changeling"" could easily have been stifled by melodrama but instead it makes its mark as a compelling mystery. It's currently in the IMDb top 250, which attests to its general appeal but I would hesitate to rank it quite so highly.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Confessions of a JMS-aholic...,"I'm going to break from my usual format for the purpose of reviewing this movie. From Captain Power to the Real Ghostbusters to Babylon 5 to his run on the comic book Spider-man, J. Michael Straczynski is not so much my favorite writer as he is my writing God. So, when I heard that a major motion picture, written by him, was being produced by originally Ron Howard, then Clint Eastwood and that A listers like John Malkovich and Angelina Jolie were going to be in it, not to mention Jeffrey Donovan, the star of Burn Notice, were going to be involved in it, I was excited and nervous beyond all hell. I'm not really a sports fan, but the feeling I had is the way I think a fan feels when they find out their home town team is playing for the World Series or the Superbowl. I was excited because JMS was finally going to break into Hollywood. I was nervous because, well what if it sucked? I mean, I loved JMS's work on TV shows, but while the Babylon 5's made for TV movies weren't bad, they were nowhere near as good as the show itself. I was worried that JMS might not be able to pull off a movie. Furthermore, a lot of hands end up touching movies before they get produced. I wanted to see my home town team win, not get humiliated. So, I was nervous.Also, I was confused. The movie was called Changeling, which to me, the Star Trek nerd, is the alien species that Odo from Deep Space Nine. I couldn't believe for the life of me that all these A-listers signed on for a sci-fi movie, despite the fact that JMS had made his name writing sci-fi. Then I heard it was based on a true story. This confused me even further.But, all my anxiousness didn't stop me from being a one man advertisement team for this movie. I bugged and threatened and bargained with all my friends to go see this one when it finally came out. In retrospect I think some of them might have decided to skip it because I was annoying them that badly.Well, the movie came out... and it was amazingly good! I mean, I know I'm a JMS whore, but it really, really was awesomely good. The cast was awesome, the visuals were awesome, the music was awesome, everything about it was freaking awesome, and the writing was beautifully, magically awesome!My only minor complaint with the movie is that JMS may have been too faithful to history and might have shortened the end by combining a few scenes. But, seriously, this is definitely my pick for best movie of 2008, and probably ranked number two or three of the decade, following Finding Neverland and (500) Days of Summer.

Certainly  a  film  to  not  miss.,"Now more geared toward directing that his acting career, Clint Eastwood dusts off this amazing and unique crime thriller with the help of a few writers. The concept of Eastwood returning to Universal is a rather interesting move considering he's partial to Warner Bros. I don't exactly remember much about the film awards of 2008, but if I had been a judge to determine if this was in the rankings, I would most certainly call it one of the top twenty films for the year it was released. Angelina Jolie stars as an historical character, Christine Collins who at the start of the film plays a single mother who is trying to support her son, Walter. What starts out as a missing child turns into something bigger than the audience might anticipate. Since this is a period film of the late 1920s, you do have to remember on a historical note that this was the point in time when the L.A. police department was big into scandals to mostly cover up their ties to the mob. So with that in mind, you can imagine how frustrating it was for Ms. Collins to deal with the police as well as coming from the position of a woman of that time who had very limited roles in the public eye. Bottom line, if you like hard core drama that has suspense and is thrilling, this is for you. The acting is extremely professional. Jeffrey Donavan is very convincing as the head of police affairs who is stopping at nothing to keep Christine Collins from exposing his mistake by giving her the wrong child. This movie is not for the faint of heart. There are some disturbing scenes here. First and foremost it's a documentary, so some details cannot be avoided. As far as I am concerned if there is an updated version of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this should be in that version of that book.

"too richly filmed for telling of terrible, real events","i am about a 50-50 fan of C. Eastwood's directorial style, and The Changeling fell on the not-so-much side. it was ambitious, had great material to work w/, but i blv it succumbed to the temptation of overly-drenched cinematography and way too pretty costuming and set, especially for such a dark and real subject. it does the actual events a disservice by emphasizing so overtly stylish costuming, veiled eyes, bright-red lipstick, sepia-toned police rooms and craggy-faced character actors. just too obvious and heavy-handed. i root for Eastwood as a director, but he can rely too heavily on stylistic conventions, which detracts from getting involved in a story. A. Jolie's acting did not help, either. This can point to weak direction, but in any case, i just don't feel that she delivered on a true, raw level. it was all rather clichéd and superficial. frankly, she has never lived up to the potential she showed in ""Girl, Interrupted"" (in which she was the only good thing, and deserved the Oscar), and has excelled only as the cartoony, action-figure Lara Croft since then. maybe she should just leave it at that. and maybe Eastwood should stick to fiction.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Emotionally Strong,"As with many if not most of this director's films, it is hard to find fault.

I definitely felt anger with the characters on several occasions. Many, I suspect, will be as equally affected by the lead's performace in this story of great tragedy.The story has a complexity that very tightly intertwines the various players. Their motivations are clearly laid out and effectively developed. The editing I found to be particularly effective in bringing and keeping things together.Curruption is the main theme. The antagonists should infuriate you, and the righteousness of the the protagonists you will have you unequivocally hoping for their triumph.

MY REVIEW: Hope is Everything!!,"Changeling. Never start a fight, but always finish it. Christine Collins played by terrific star actor Angelina Jolie lives these words when her only son goes missing and police tries to fit an impostor as her missing child. She faces the insensitivity of LAPD, fights against it and dares to go extra mile for justice. The movie stands tall with best work of Clint Eastwood who bring out the very best of Angelina Jolie and gives you a delicious cocktail of mystery, emotions, crime and drama. Angelina Jolie in her best form makes you root for her character. The detailed period setting of 1930s, neat characterizations and screenplay flooded with carefully written dialogues are a treat to enjoy. Clint might have chosen the thrilling pace for this chilling true story but he intelligently chooses the slow and absorbing approach to take you through the trauma that Christine experienced. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Changeling. Watch it for its inspiring struggle for justice and stellar performance of Angelina Jolie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good film, well acted but suffers from weak script and uneven tone","'Changeling' is a good film, certainly a well-intentioned one, but it suffers from a very uneven script. Directed sedately by Clint Eastwood, the film feels disjointed as it repeatedly loses focus. The period detail is impeccable as we see working single mother Angelina Jolie living with her son in 1920s Los Angeles. A mid-section reminded me of 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'.

One of Angelina Jolie's best performances,"Clint Eastwood returned back to the States from his war-time double-feature of Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima with this glossy but nevertheless beautifully photographed film set in 1920s Los Angeles about a single mother (Angelina Jolie) whose son's mysterious disappearance is handled in a disgraceful manner by the local police. The fact that J. Michael Straczynski's script is a quite faithful rendition of real events, is almost beyond imagination. But the absurdity of the story is also what gives the film a little zest when Eastwood otherwise tends to be doing everything a little too neat and tidy. He's not interested in the more perverse parts of the Walter Collins case; the film leans more towards a semi-noir in which there are slimy bootlickers behind every door in official offices. And Changeling is a harrowing dissection of both this and the ensuing case of Gordon Stewart Northcott (interestingly played by Jason Butler Harner). It's the systemic wrongdoings Eastwood sheds light on here, from self-gratulatory police via corrupt and quacky psychiatric hospitals to an inhumane penal system. Angelina Jolie leads us through it all with quiet, tearful desperation. It's one of her best performances. The same cannot be said of John Malkovich as a preacher who becomes her advocate. He brings mostly ersatz to his part. The elegant musical score is made by the director himself, and along with the agreeable pacing is Eastwood's best achievement here. He's also clearly nostalgic about portraying a time in which he himself grew up. Only on occasion does Changeling feel anachronistic. Nominated for several awards, none more than the 8 it got at the BAFTA's, winning none.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emotional Damage !!,"A true story that talks about a mother who just came back from work to find out that her son is missing. And finally when he come back she deny that this is her son.First of all, AJ acting. She just proved in this movie that she is a very talented actress and I think this role is just the best from all her movies I have seen until now. She convinced me by this role that is she a mother and that's what the film needed. How she screamed, cried, smiled anything she did any move any expression was just perfection for me. She ate it.The others also killed it like that young boy who was playing the role of the cousin of the ( bad man ) can't say to spoiler. He is a kid actor but he just proved also that he have a good acting skills and so many abilities he have to show in the future by his strong acting. The ( bad man ) acting was average until the last 30 mins of the movie he made me get very emotional especially his last scene I was about to cry and when he acted a scene just with AJ. The detective, policeman and others also well played.Let's talk about the plot scenario. Who wrote this is just incredible. In this film there were so many details, so many events, so many cases, so many characters. U just need to prioritise the main case and make it all in all. Hats for him.Effects of this movie, how they made every moment wether a dark scene or action scene or emotional scene so powerful. A felt all what the director wanted to the viewer to feel. Crying, getting mad and feeling calm all this in a very clever way. Even there were some average scenes but to cover the details and somehow the movie was so long but still worthy to watch.I think also that it was a clever thing to use less sound effects in many scenes to give us more tension and get us back to the movie as the opposite of many movies who thinks that sound effects are everything well here it was enough to listen and see and feel without it.I liked also how the production of this movie was going from shooting places that made us feel that we are in Los Angeles 20s !! And also the costumes, etc. Everything was just perfect to show in big screen. And the best when these kind of quite strong crime movies can be shown in a cinematic way, in diff direction!! Than this movie is jackpot for the director and the whole crew as I guess.Loved everything about the movie, still it's not the best but I must tell you to watch it, you will enjoy watching it very much.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Angelina Jolie's defining moment as a leading actress.,"The Los Angeles Police Department has come a long way since arriving at its current acclaim as one of the best law enforcing units in the United States. Brainchild of the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) now used in all major crime fighting units, the LAPD's tainted history in police corruption and brutality is brilliantly depicted here with shocking consequences. While ""L. A. Confidential"" and ""Mulholland Falls"" were also films with a similar theme depicting police corruption of a bygone era, this film exceptionally stands out for a varied number of reasons.At the fore, yet behind the lens is an actor turned director who needs no formal introduction. With a filmography list spanning more than five decades including winning four Oscars as a director, Hollywood veteran Clint Eastwood masterfully tells a story that is not only based on actual events, but tells it in a way where you get more than what you expect; And that is, a film made with such potent ingredients, the outcome is a rare achievement in film making these days.Meticulously set against the late 1920s backdrop, this grueling narrative has Angelina Jolie playing a single mother insistently pursuing the truth behind her son's abduction. As Christine Collins, she is met with brutal opposition from the very people sworn to serve and protect. In order to save face from public embarrassment and outcry, Captain J.J Jones (Jeffery Donavan) of the LAPD partially resolves the situation by finding an imposter that closely resembles the abducted boy. But a mother knows best, and Collins immediately points out this discrepancy, embarking on a single-handed confrontation with top yet corrupt LAPD officials. When Collins prepares to tell her story to the press, she is packed off to a mental institution and is branded a delusional mother dangerously spiraling out of reality. Locked up and treated like a psychopath, her only aide emerges in the form of Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), a high profile public figure hell bent on taking down corrupt police officers. Their victory however is short lived when she learns that her son, amongst several other boys his age, may have been the victim of a deranged serial killer, resulting in a landmark case against the LAPD.Precise scripting, stellar casting that makes for tight acting, flawless cinematography integrating factual geographical locations, costumes and props, and a nostalgic score also composed by Eastwood, are the ingredients I mentioned earlier. Acting alone is top notch starting with a visually and verbally influential Malkovich whose very presence forms some of the most commanding scenes in the film. The same goes for Geoffrey Pierson as Collins' attorney in a sensational court room drama. Jason Butler Harner as the serial killer and Donavan as Captain Jones are superb as the two villains in roles sure to invoke utter loathing. Saving the best for the last is Jolie in the most significant role of her career, powerfully portraying a mother's pain. A far cry from some of the mindless action movies she occasionally stars in, Jolie is to this film what Julia Roberts is to ""Erin Brockovich"", because at the core, this is one woman's true struggle against a male dominated world. Nominated for three Academy Awards including 'Best Actress in a Leading role', this film may have been the fuel behind Jolie's propulsion into Tinseltown's upper stratosphere from a supporting actress to a leading lady. Now all she has to do is stay the course.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

more about police corruption than an abduction,"I thought this movie would be more of a thriller about a woman trying to find her missing child after claiming the child found by the police wasn't her son. But, actually this movie is more about the LAPD police corruption. LAPD tries to hide any mistakes made by them. If someone says they are wrong, they have a habit of having them incarcerated in a mental ward. That is what happens to Chirstine Collins after she claims the child returned to her is not her son. She has all this proof her son's dentist to teacher to the fact he is 3 inches shorter than her son. Yet the police won't admit that the boy is not her son, instead they say she is confused and crazy.Chirstine finally has some info about her son when a boy admits that a man and him were involved in the kidnapping and killing of young boys. He points out a picture of Christine's son. The guy is finally found and the last part shows Christine going to two trials: one of the LAPD and the other of a child killer.The acting was pretty good in this. However, the movie could have been shorter. Because it was so long, it seemed to be void of a lot of action.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but too long. It wasn't really a mystery more about corruption. I don't think it was good enough to recommend.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'm most certainly change-ling the channel,"The beginning and end have powerful moments about an abducted child, but the middle is an odd muddle centered on political fall-out for the Los Angeles Police Department. It's especially this element that weakens the potency of the film's main underpinnings of a mother's loss and despair. What's more, it's ineffective and begs credibility because of the stylised manner through which it's executed. Jason Butler Harner's performance as a serial killer is plain clownish. More bizarre is Jolie: she regularly looks as if she's posing for a glamour magazine during her character's grief. Perhaps she was secretly yearning for a good film noir,, who knows?The film's historical period is presented as an eye-catching and glossy ideal of 1920s Americana. This juxtaposition to the downbeat subject matter distracts from the audience's sober sense of their suspension of disbelief. Are we suppose to admire the film's chic visual opulence or identify with familial heartbreak? I guess we could do both, but it sure is deflecting.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

impressively made with many profound themes,"Angelina Jolie gives an impassioned and intensely vulnerable performance as a single mother in late 1920s Los Angeles who becomes grief-stricken when her nine-year-old son vanishes. It's not until several months pass when the publicity-seeking LAPD ""reunites"" her with a missing child fitting the description. Publicly proclaiming the child not to be hers, she gets caught up in an intense melee with the less than ideal police who are willing to go to extreme measures to silence her. A riveting real-life story that encompasses corruption, abuse of power, mental coercion, criminal culpability, but most of all hope. A rare instance where one almost yearns for a conventional finale, however the biographical source material leaves a few of the subplots open-ended, and although some obvious anachronisms are thrown in for enjoyment of the viewer, it's still a praiseworthy showing--directed, produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood. ***",,Anonymous,Biography
Feels like two movies cobbled together,"Changeling is a harrowing story of one woman's nightmare when she tries to find her missing son. For screenwriters it shows the benefits, but also the difficulty, of combining the thriller with the social drama.Drama is one of the great storytelling forms, but it has become rare in a Hollywood that requires all its movies to have blockbuster potential. Most writers of classic drama have moved to television where the level of writing has never been higher. But to get a drama made in film, you have to combine it with a more sensational genre that can pull in the big audience. Enter the thriller.At first glance, this marriage of forms looks like a good idea. Social drama lets you explore human nature and social conflict in depth, while the thriller gives the story excitement, jeopardy and narrative drive. But these same qualities dictate virtually opposite story movements. Drama wants to slow down and dig deep, find the underlying causes and explore the subtleties of human character. Thriller wants to charge ahead, to find out who is attacking the hero. No subtlety here; it's yes or no, he did it or he didn't.This is the crux of the problem that Changeling writer, J. Michael Straczynski, had to solve to make this film work. The story begins with the social drama. The hero, Christine Collins, returns home from work to find her son missing. Months later the police bring her a boy they claim is her son, even though she insists he isn't. Her desire is simple: she wants her son back. But that creates a big structural problem for the writer. She can't act on her desire. All she can do is repeat it to the corrupt cops. And while this generates anger in the audience at the arrogant injustice of the police who treat her as an incompetent child, it doesn't drive the story forward.This early part of the film also highlights another flaw common to the social drama. The hero has no moral need. All immorality is located in the opposition, the corrupt cops. This creates a good vs. evil contrast that is the kiss of death for good social drama, and exacerbates the hero's position as a victim already established by her reactive desire line.With the social drama line slowing to a halt, Straczynski introduces the investigation line and the story takes off with a burst of energy that's palpable. A cop in the same precinct as the corrupt captain follows up on a kid's claim that he helped a serial killer murder boys. The resulting investigation is not complicated, but it doesn't have to be. It gives the story a goal with clear action beats. The writer then cross-cuts this line with a thriller line that comes from the corrupt captain sending Christine to an insane asylum for claiming the police gave her the wrong boy.Does this story have a double desire line, and therefore two spines? You bet. And it does feel like two movies that have been cobbled together. But we also see here a writer making a unique story work on its own terms. Most stories have one or more structural roadblocks built in; they are part of the animal. If, as a professional, you have to make a story work, you pull from your bag of techniques and get the job done. Straczynski knows that neither desire line will support the story on its own. But by cross-cutting them, he creates a track with enough narrative drive to take us to the end of the social drama.But not without severe costs. The story's structural flaws prevent this from being a great social drama. Yes, the corrupt captain and chief of police are brought low and the mother is publicly redeemed. But subtlety and an exploration of deeper causes are nowhere to be found.So what can we learn from Changeling? I've already mentioned the importance of making the story work, even if you have to break a few of the rules of good drama. The lesson of never letting perfection get in the way of success is always good for writers to remember. Changeling also shows us the power, and the difficulty, of combining drama with thriller. The key structural element is desire. If possible, try to turn the two desire lines - of drama and thriller - into one. Each line should help solve the other: investigating the crime should lead to deeper layers of the social conflict while the argument about the social issue should lead the hero to new clues about the crime.Finally, Changeling shows us one of the keys to dramatizing a real-life story: finding the right frame. A true story must hit the same seven major structure steps as a fictional story. But a true story restricts you in how you find those steps, since you can't just create them from thin air. Instead you have to focus on the frame, where to begin and end the story, and that means you have to start by identifying your battle scene. In Changeling, everything comes to a dramatic head at the trial, actually a cross-cut between the trial of the killer and the trial of the LA police. This battle brings a convergence of the two lines that this real-life drama-thriller desperately needs.If you are interested in how to tell any story with maximum dramatic power, regardless of genre, look at our 22 Step Great Screen writing Class.

a must watch!,"I must say this movie is the best i've seen over the past few days. It has all the elements that a drama should have, beautiful moments, powerful acting, amazing dialogs and an ending with some food for thought for the viewer. Okay so basically this movie revolves around a single mother from LA (year 1928), Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) and her struggles with the LAPD to search for her son who goes missing one day. She finds herself in a difficult spot when the police turn in a boy few days later which as Christine claims is not her son. Now this is where the real deal begins. Realizing the corrupt intentions of LAPD officials who try to save their image by not accepting the mistake, Christine makes a media statement on this matter. The rest of the movie focuses on the efforts of the police to prevent her from making a courtroom appearance and the mother's endeavor to find her son. The movie has its share of emotional, sentimental scenes (especially the ones in a psychopath treatment center). The story on the whole is engrossing and satisfying and confronts some heavy issues pertaining to the malfunctioning and corrupt LAPD during those times. Angelina Jolie has done a fairly well job. There's one thing though, I felt the movie getting stagnant after 2 hours and it seemed a bit boring after that. But thats just a very negligible flaw and the awesome plot more than compensates for it. Oh ya by the way this is based on a true story. Overall, this movie is a must watch and I highly recommend watching it. What happens to the boy? Does Christine get him back?...of course you'll have to watch it to find out!",,Anonymous,Biography
A little heavy handed,"Clint Eastwood has produced some brilliant work as a director. Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby come to mind.But, as with Flags of Our Fathers, he here demonstrates a penchant for going over the top.There were times I felt like I was watching a dystopian commentary on systemic corruption at the hands of the new world order rather than a period piece revolving around a humanly dramatic mystery.Much of the acting is equally excessive as Clint lingers to jab a knife into our hearts in a way that is meant to be grueling but is surprisingly shallow.Such are the consequences of the risks inherent in going deep with dramatic material. The effort is compelling even if the result is lacking in grace.Part of the problem is the complexity of the material, which seems to drift between two different story lines, both of which are given equal weight even though they are barely related, as if one is meant to throw us off the trail of the other - which results in cheaply woven mystery and a plot that loses its way.",,Anonymous,Biography
