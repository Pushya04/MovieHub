Edge of the seat stuff,"Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen. An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security.This shot effectively captures the mood of the film. As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security.It is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year.It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) ""This isn't some newspaper story, this is real"" and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing.The pacing is just incredible. It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it.With its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age. Ultimatum is its peak.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Smart and Gripping,"The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final outing for super-spy Jason Bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is ""universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.First, I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was. You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne is played very well by MattDamon. Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.I won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. However, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. Ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.It seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August 3. It's the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard.Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie Bad) Story is like many others",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Perhaps One of the Greatest Motion Picture Trilogies of our Time,"I don't hand out ten star ratings easily. A movie really has to impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Furthermore, this trilogy has come together so nicely, that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours.From the moment that the opening title appeared, I knew we were in for a ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again: the action, the dialogue, and of course the shaky camera. However for me, that last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the suspense.I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD, simply because it is genius. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion, and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie, and altogether, an unforgettable trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The original Bourne trilogy at its best,"Finally getting round to seeing the original Bourne film trilogy, after hearing nothing but good things, there hasn't been any regret watching them. Wasn't sure initially as to whether they'd be my cup of tea or not, hence why it took so long to see them, but that was not the case.'The Bourne Identity' was a very pleasant surprise, giving a fairly well-worn genre a much needed freshness. It had its imperfections, but was a very solid and even very good film with much to recommend and introduced a cast-against-type Matt Damon in one of his best roles. 'The Bourne Supremacy' was an example of a sequel that was every bit as good as its predecessor, maybe lacking its freshness but also made a few improvements along the way. The original Bourne trilogy ends with 'The Bourne Ultimatum', which has been regarded often as the best of the three, cannot disagree.Some of the hand-held shaky cam is used a little too excessively (epileptics be warned!) and the ending could have been a little less frenetic and confused and had more careful tying things together and explanation.Visually, on the other hand, a vast majority of the time 'The Bourne Ultimatum' like its predecessors looks slick and stylish with even more breath-taking locations. There were many instances when the hand-held shaky cam did intensify the tense claustrophobia of the atmosphere and intensity to very good effect, never making things incomprehensible.Like 'The Bourne Supremacy', the music score is even more dynamic, atmosphere enhancing and more layered this time round, while Paul Greengrass' drama-documentary style and background to his directing is used to full advantage. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' has the sharpest, most intelligent and subtle script of the three films, in a way that is just dazzling.The story never lets go of its grip and never strains credibility or reality. It is a tense adrenaline rush throughout, with the best mix of exciting action, the best of it is absolutely thrilling, and meaty story-telling, with lots of emotion and characterisation meat, that develops Bourne the best of all three films. Paul Greengrass' directing style and his experience in drama-documentary is once again used to full advantage.Matt Damon has really made the character of Bourne his own, at the time of 'The Bourne Identity' it was very much a cast-against-type role but now it is one of his best. Julia Stiles and particularly Joan Allen are marvellous, as is a suitably malevolent David Strathairn, and while the supporting cast are a little underused they all do uniformly sterling work (one would be very hard pressed to get a bad performance out of Albert Finney for example).In conclusion, what a conclusion to the Bourne trilogy. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Great,"The best one of the original trilogy it's non stop thrills and twists and amazing gripping story only gets better with every scene, Matt Damon was great again, Maybe in my opinion there could of been more action but that's just me but apart from that it's a very intelligent gripping film and should not be missed.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One Of The Year's Best Movies.,"The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After a thrilling set of two, we get the final installment. Here's my take:The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) on the coattails of the ones who know everything. He has been running for too long. This time, it ends.The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, awesome writing, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best action of the summer. Matt Damon delivers possibly his best performance to date. He has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin.There are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense. The reactions to certain events will have you either laughing(in a good way) or cheering on. (or both) I heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping. The audience was loving it.The Bourne Ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package. All of the goods and then some. This is, in my opinion the best movie this summer.The Last Word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. This is how summer movie thrillers should be done. I love the Bourne trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
May be the best action movie I've ever seen,"This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - there isn't any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one.Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Shaky camera got to me a little,"Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is once again on the loose. After losing his love Marie in the second movie, he is now trying to uncover his past and find those who started it. Reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is investigating him and operation Blackbriar which is the newer version of Project Treadstone. The CIA team under Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) is tracking him looking for the source of his information. Bourne also wants Ross' source but they kill Ross. Bourne is able to retrieve Ross' notes. The CIA director forces Vosen to take Pam Landy (Joan Allen) on the team. Bourne reconnects with tech Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles).Director Paul Greengrass does everything within his powers to amp up the thrills. The chase with Ross is terrific and very tense. The action is great. Even the control room is filled with energy. However the control room gives a diminishing return. It get a little bit repetitive. There is only so much that can be done with people looking at computer screens. Greengrass is known for his shaky camera work but this is going a little overboard. Sometimes, I lose some of the action. Other times, there is no real reason to do the shaky camera. He just needs to give me a few more quiet breaks so that I can catch a breather. On the acting side, there is only generally good work. It's yet another solid performance from Matt Damon and David Strathairn is a strong addition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One Great Thriller,"Here we have one of those rare franchises that constantly gets better and better. The great thing about it is that Director Paul Greengrass is back and better than ever. He brings more realism and technique in this sequel than he did in the last film.Matt Damon has gotten older and into the character more perfectly to where he seems to be living the role and realistically the character. I can't really picture anyone else in the role at this point. David Starthairn is just magnificent and Julia Stiles was surprisingly quite excellent.The chases sequences are some of the best, and the like it or hate the shaky cinematography – it does exactly what is necessary and right on point. The intent is to be agitated as you watch the film, which is exactly the point. The intent is to feel and experience what Jason Bourne is experiencing and feeling. The cinematography technique works brilliantly.I have always felt that one of the possible issues for people, as it was for me, was that my expectations were extremely high. This is by far the best of the trilogy, and one great thriller. I loved the fact that the film was not over the top and is so grounded like a documentary.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"It'll do, but not nearly as good as the original first movie.","This third edition of the series is almost an exact copy of the second edition, which wasnt remarkable either. Better watch the first original if you want to witness a really thrilling action movie.The bad: this third edition has NOT got any great vicious bad guys. We have got solid perfomrnces from Albert Finney and Scott Glenn, but they are only starring in small supporting roles. The assassins character who are after Jason Bourne, dont look impressive or tough at all this time around, that's really disappointing.More bad: the same shaky cam mess as in the second edition. And what about all those endless camera shots of board rooms with screens, I got SOOO tired of them talking heads trying to look serious and ""intelligent""...Not any good then? It's the worst in the series, but it'll still do if you are into action movies and you havent yet seen it. I have seen all the Bourne movies dozens of times but this edition really started to bore me and that's a first for me as a big Jason Bourne fan.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bourne Again Fan,"""The Bourne Ultimatum"" begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely superb) tracks down the masterminds behind the CIA black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity. A devastatingly icy David Strathairn as the ""man behind the curtain"" is added to the returning cast of regulars including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent).Like the second entry in the series, I wished Paul Greengrass' shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime. However, that being said, it's a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic. It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there.With the absence of the emotive and involving Franka Potente, the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything. Still, this can be forgiven, for unlike the ""Identity"" and the ""Supremacy"", this ""Ultimatum"" reveals all and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Magnificent  and thrilling third part completing perfectly the trilogy,"This third part is an astonishing following with similar premise to former entries(Bourne identity,2002:Doug Liman and Bourne supremacy,2004) , again Jason Bourne living under assumed names and suffering amnesia must piece together the clues to his true identity and being pursued by CIA officers(David Strathairn,Scott Glenn). Bourne swears revenge and relatiation should anyone from his previous existence . Bourne confronts his enemies in order to find out the truth why they're still after him and is forced to once again take up violent means to survive. He attempts contact a journalist(Paddy Considine) but is pursued by a killer(Edgar Ramirez).He takes the law on his own hands and acting as a trained assassin , being only helped by Cia agent named Niky(Julia Stiles). The argument is displayed on an interesting screenplay by Tony Gilroy who completes perfectly the trilogy, based on original characters from Robert Ludlum. The Ludlum's novel have also spawned a television series and several more books.This exciting follow-up contains suspense, thrills, frenetic action, shootouts and violent fights. From the beginning to the final the noisy action and fast movement is unstopped.Matt Damon acting as hard-rock,two-fisted agent with no identity is top-notch. The 'contender'Joan Allen and David Strathairm as obstinate chief are excellent. Again Julia Stiles is cool as agent Nicky Parson who helps to Jason Bourne.Customary trilogy's cameraman Oliver Wood using steadycam and zooms with numerous locations Moscu, London, Madrid, N.Y. Habitual musician John Powell creates a stirring, moving soundtrack.the motion picture is stunning realized by Paul Greengrass(author of 'Bourne supremacy'2004).

I've never seen such an impressive action movie in my LIFE,"Having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of Bourne movies, I was a little reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum.However it was a very thrilling experience and I didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films. Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it had reached the interval! I don't think I have ever watched such an exquisitely made, and gripping film, especially an action film. Since I usually shy away from action and thriller type movies, this was such great news to me. Ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films, it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances in the Bourne 1+2, and now, this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.The stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and I was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. Well done.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"007 had better watch out, Bourne's about!","When the Bourne Identity arrived five years ago I have to confess that I didn't think much of it. At the time I was eleven years old, so perhaps I was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario. Two years ago when the Bourne Supremacy arrived I thought it was a better movie than Identity but still didn't think it was as good as I expected it to be judging by the trailers. Over the past two years I had been told numerous times that the Bourne movies were amazing, many a time I had to bite my tongue and not say what I really thought about the movies. Until two months ago I couldn't have given a damn about the Bourne Ultimatum, I really had no intentions of watching it. But then I decided to go back and re-watch the first two before I came to any abrupt decisions. So I went out and bought both the original movies. And what a surprise it was to me when I was gripped by them. Identity I found the superior of the two, but Supremacy isn't far behind. They're both slick, action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that I have watched numerous times since I bought them. Because of this I was first in line today to see the Bourne Ultimatum. And boy did Bourne Ultimatum not disappoint!Matt Damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the Bourne movies, I'd seen him in the Talented Mr Ripley, but I never thought much of him in general. However, it appears he was born to play Bourne (pardon the pun). Throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes, in this movie we see Matt Damon at his very best, even better than he was in The Departed and I thought he was one of the best things in The Departed. You really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything. Matt Damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable. The supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding. Joan Allen was one of my favourite things in Bourne Supremacy, here she excels herself. Her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie. Julia Stiles turns up again as Nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character. Julia Stiles is a very underrated actress and I think she deserves a lot more roles, well decent roles, than she gets. David Strathairn is a newcomer to this series as Noah Vosen, he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels. He's definitely the nastiest character we've met, and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty. Strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie. Special mention must also go to Albert Finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time, I will not say anything about the character, that's best left as a surprise, but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie.The Bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences, this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences, good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies. But running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline. This storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie. As I watched Supremacy the night before I saw Ultimatum it was nice because I could notice certain little parts. That very final scene in Supremacy, in New York, a lot more important that I ever imagined at the time. Won't spoil it for people but I recommend checking up on Supremacy before you see Ultimatum. Unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see Ultimatum purely because of the action sequences. This is the part where I should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that my favourite parts of the Bourne series as a whole are the car chases. The mini car chase in Identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time. Well the action in Ultimatum has to be the best of the Bourne series. In fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in Moscow. So in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups, all very violent and shockingly brutal. A bike chase that is absolutely amazing, many foot chases which are even more amazing, a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable, and oh so much more! But the highlight for me has to be the scene in Waterloo station, won't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped.So any flaws for the movie? In my eyes no, but if you are not a fan of the Bourne series or have not seen the previous two then I wouldn't recommend Ultimatum for you. The movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top. The Bourne Ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007. As a James Bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that Ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the Bond movies, and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that. While Bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the Bond series, it is definitely nearly its equal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Ultimatum is Easily the Best Bourne,"Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say to that is...are you kidding me? Come on it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie I really didn't even notice it.You can tell that Damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case its a really good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon also has a great supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization.Even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on. This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

A trilogy that stays true to the story,"In order to fully appreciate 'The Bourne Ultimatum', one must have to  have seen 'The Bourne Identity' and 'The Bourne Supremacy'. Like it's  prequel's, it is slick, action packed, suspenseful and has an engaging  screenplay. I particularly loved the chase scenes shot in Tangier.  Director Greengrass just keeps the right pace without making it boring  or too fast to follow. A fine ending to a trilogy, I preferred it over  the overrated 'Lord of the Rings: The Return of The King' and the  abysmal 'X-Men: The Last Stand'. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' has done  justice to the first two films.   Cinematography deserves special mention, whether it's the shaky camera  or the zoom-lens, it certainly adds to the 'fun' of the ride supported  by brilliant background score. The dialogues and characters are very  well written. This is especially a plus because character development  seems to be lacking in action films of today. Damon again looks the  part and his acting is fantastic as he completely owns the role.  Supporting cast that boasts of talented names like Joan Allen, Paddy  Considine, Albert Finney and David Straitharn all stand out.  A brilliant conclusion, it makes the whole trilogy stand out.  Filmmakers (especially that guy who made 'X-Men: The Last stand')  should learn how to make a trilogy interesting and intelligent. 'The  Bourne Ultimatum' is an intelligent, slick, well-paced action film that  respects the trilogy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Great action flick practically ruined by crazy directing/camera-work,"The first ten minutes of this movie I practically felt car sick. I kept wondering, ""Are they ever going to stop shaking the camera and swish-panning so I can focus on these characters' faces?"" Then when Jason Bourne is sitting completely still on a couch opposite another character and the camera is shaking all over the place just for the sake of shaking, I started to laugh out loud.This is a sad example of a movie that is so stylized that the camera work is distracting. I do like hand-held work when it is done well (i.e. Children of Men). But I do not like it when it is does to the point that: 1) I can't always tell what is going on, 2) I get distracted by it and pulled out of the story because I am well aware a camera is capturing all of it, and 3) Even in still, calm moments the camera is shaking all over the place.I'm being generous when I give this a 6. I give it a 6 only because Matt Damon is superb as Jason Bourne and the story/writing is good. Also, there are two action sequences that have good suspense and fantastic stunts/fight scenes despite the poor camera work  the train station & the chase involving Julia Stiles. The overall story is good, but the telling of that story is completely hampered by the style of the director.My favorite of this trilogy was definitely the first, because I could enjoy that one without taking Dramamine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Sit at the back of the theater,"I sat about 40 feet from the screen and could not see the fight or chase scenes. Why? Apparently it's really ""hip"" to employ UNsteadicam now. The camera was constantly moving randomly as if the ""steady"" part of the steadicam apparatus had been removed. There's hardly a fixed camera or dolly shot in the entire movie. The constant close-ups made this ""nervous"" movement even more distracting and indiscernible. I can only see viewing this on a home screen or in the back of the theater.The director should have taken into account when you blow up the picture you amplify any camera movements exponentially.Sort of ruined the film for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Jason Bourne's highest point,"How many movie trilogies do you know that don't go south towards the end? The answer is, even aside of the spy movie genre there aren't too many, and all of them are classics. Now, Matt Damon & Co made that list one item longer.True, there's not that big of a competition in this genre, for the spy film franchises that take themselves seriously and live long enough are so rare that you could count them by one hand's fingers. There's James Bond, there's Ethan Hunt, and there's another JB now. But Mission Impossible has long transcended that line beyond which the laws of reality don't apply. As for James Bond, it's a phoenix that can only live on by burning up at the end of its every incarnation, and Spectre was a perfect example of such pyre. Yet, Jason Bourne managed to walk that line between carnal ashes and mythification and do it with flying colors.The first group of people we should thank for that remarkable achievement is the screenwriters. The spy thrillers are only as good as their story, and when the story bends under scrutiny, the whole movie goes down. In that aspect, the Jason Bourne trilogy was played brilliantly, with enough loose ends to keep us involved throughout the three-act story and with enough wit to tie them up in a single convergence point towards the finale. The second film might have dragged a bit and has gone over the top a few times (the unbelievable yellow taxi car chase being one of them), but it was worth the amazing two-point transition into the third film that not just redefined the meaning of the second film's ending but also gave us a new angle to look at the main character at. Such things don't happen occasionally, that's an intentional masterpiece, something I simply can't help admiring.And of course there's Matt Damon. Now, in 2016, we know him as a big star. And of course he was already a star in 2002, for his role in Good Will Hunting was not to ignore. Yet it seems that it's Jason Bourne that really made Mr Damon who he is today, a solid all-round performer who's able to bring a deep emotional charge into a whirlwind of action.Speaking of action, it alone could earn the JB trilogy a place among the titans of the genre. The fight scenes and the chases are what make these movies hold their viewers at the edge of the seat, and no shaky camera or rapid cuts could deprive them of the sense of true realism that such action monsters as Mission Impossible or Fast and Furious tend to lack these days. Even though Mr Bourne manages to dispatch his opponents without seemingly breaking a sweat (and definitely without breaking anything more vital), he still looks and feels like a human being who's not deathproof but simply trained enough to outplay it.Even though the producers' greed made them try to capitalize on the JB success (which they failed at, it seems) and release a totally disposable spin-off movie, it doesn't at all reduce the trilogy's value, making The Bourne Ultimatum a Skyfall of its franchise, but without the disgrace of Spectre. The phoenix didn't burn down, it just flew away to its own lost paradise. Off the grid, exactly where Jason Bourne had wished to stay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

This particular scene must have been around 5-7 minutes into the movie and already I had noticed and started getting annoyed with the excessive shakiness of the camera and the ""artsy"" behind-the-shoulder shots. The two men were simply sitting in a restaurant and talking but the camera was shaking so much that you would think they were in the middle of an earthquake. It was ridiculous and I felt that it completely detracted from what should otherwise have been an intense and revealing conversation. I have never in my life ever had the urge to leave the theater during a movie till tonight when I saw ultimatum. I then remembered the 9 dollars I had spent and decided to wait it out. I am definitely glad that I stayed because the movie, apart from the camera issues, was brilliant. Matt Damon is supremely believable as Jason Bourne. For some reason more so in this movie than the previous ones.The beautiful action scenes were again marred by shoddy camera work. I was immediately reminded of the camera work during the action sequences in Batman Begins. The fact that I was sitting towards the front of the movie theater only made things worse as my eyes struggled to stay focused on the action for more than half a second at a time. As someone else on this board suggested, it was almost like a strobe light effect. I really think it was a lazy and stupid decision to use the Shakycam so extensively. Just like any other flourish or trick, it should be used sparingly so that it subtly enhances a certain aspect of the movie. In this case, regretfully, it took away from the movie rather than the other way around.Aside from the camera issues, the movie was very solid on many levels and easily a great addition to the series. All in all I don't regret spending the 9 bucks and I suppose that should say it all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
My favorite of the Bourne series,"The Bourne Identity (2002) was a great introduction to the series. Then came The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and it wasn't as good as the first one, not unusual for a sequel. Then came The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) as part of a trilogy. Due to my let down from the sequel, I really expected this third installment to be even worse. Well, I was very wrong. So wrong in fact, that this one was the best of them all! It was refreshing to see some back-story details that complimented the first two films. This one was perfect, and a perfect 10/10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Outstanding Film with cinematography performed by a dancing monkey,"This is an excellently written, well-plotted film, expertly acted.... and filmed by a 2 yr old monkey with a camera mounted on his head, who also suffers from arthritis and epilepsy.Pros: Matt Damon turns in another expert acting job as Jason Bourne, the federal hit-man with no memories of his deeds or his origin. The fight scenes are amazingly well done (at least...I think they were) and Damon's portrayal of the capable, highly intelligent, yet befuddled Bourne is amazing to see (when you can).David Straithairn shows up as a new character and his level of acting has never been better. Julia Stiles is at her best in this film. Joan Allen, Scott Glenn, and Albert Finney also show up and provide amazing stellar performances.The plot is extremely well-laid out and the writing captures both the modern world and the HIGHLY imaginative view of espionage, CIA, and the NSA that Ludlum invents for Bourne. In short, perhaps the only danger in this film is that some people may actually come away believing the CIA and NSA actually have all these godlike abilities due to the talented writing.Cons: I'm not joking about the monkey. This is, with the possible exception of Blair Witch Project, the worst filmed movie I have EVER seen. Every film I've ever seen was filmed better than this one from major motion pictures, indys, car commercials, local used car ads, porn, and things filmed by my dad on vacations.When The Rock came out, I was particularly hard on Michael Bay for having the ""shakycam"" effect placed on every car chase to ""up"" the action level. Sadly, Bay still thinks this works and it becomes the only negative aspect of many other films like Transformers. If I cant see the action because you've made it into a blur, it doesn't have the same effect on me. This is not realism.In this film, director Paul Greengrass takes this to a new level. We don't have the ""wandering realistic"" camera only in chases and fight scenes, now we have it throughout the entire film. Even in close ups of people you'd like people to see (like the ever attractive Julia Stiles), you cant see her for any more than a second or two because the camera has bounced all over the damn place as if its on a yo-yo or a pendulum.A discussion between two characters, with no action value at all, in a quiet cafe, is filmed as if someone has handed the camera to a small child. This child was told to just ""hold the camera and point it at those two guys"" and meanwhile he's sucking on a lollipop and running around the table.I have seen POV porn films that were filmed with more artistic integrity than this...and I HATE those things because of this very thing: You cant see anything. The first 30 minutes of the film were so painful for me to watch that I nearly left the theatre.....which would have been a shame, because whats happening in the film is so good.My advice: Wait until it comes out on video and listen to the dialog from the kitchen. Its an amazing script.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Plot makes sense but still not that engaging,"I have not been real impressed by the previous Bourne movies, and this one was no exception. The best part of the movie was that the plot actually made sense this time and could be followed. Most of the action is car chasing scenes. And there are a few and they are shot very well. They look realistic. Bourne also gets to engage in hand combat with another asset and that was some fight. Nicky Parsons shows up again and is involved a little with the plot then just gets on a bus and leaves. What was the point in that? Bourne goes from Europe to America searching for his identity and what happened to him. He finds out some surprising answers and gets revenge on those in charge.FINAL VERDICT: It wasn't anything great, but I'm sure if you liked the other Bourne movies, you will want to see this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

All I get is a migraine/headache and frustrated.What that kind of camera work tells me is that there is no substance in the scene and you have to create some. It is not art, it is a joke. It really takes away from the movie.

Great action movie but be warned....,"Some of the stunts are sensational and the movie never lets up from the moment it starts. However after about half-an-hour the restive hand-held camera-work and rapid fire editing become very wearing and you just long for a long lingering shot and some peace and quiet. Relentless hand-held camera filming just makes you feel nauseous after a while and adds nothing to the movie.The plot is really quite old-hat, somewhat reminiscent of many older movies with the so-called government good guys up to no good. Despite this, Bourne 3 is a cracking film with never a dull moment. The soundtrack is really good; Matt Damon is excellent as usual and Julia Stiles is gorgeous.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Gripping and Smart Conclusion,"""The Bourne Ultimatum,"" directed by Paul Greengrass, is a thrilling conclusion to the Bourne trilogy, offering intense action, a compelling storyline, and strong performances. This third installment solidifies the series' place as one of the best in the modern spy genre, bringing the saga of Jason Bourne to a satisfying and exhilarating end.Matt Damon once again excels in his role as Jason Bourne, bringing a depth and intensity to the character that anchors the film. His portrayal of Bourne's relentless quest to uncover his true identity and bring down those responsible for his transformation into a super-spy is both compelling and emotionally resonant. Damon's performance is marked by a quiet intensity that makes Bourne a relatable and complex protagonist.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Joan Allen returning as Pamela Landy, adding layers to her character with a nuanced performance. Julia Stiles also reprises her role as Nicky Parsons, providing a subtle but significant contribution to the storyline. Newcomer David Strathairn delivers a chilling performance as CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen, a formidable antagonist whose cold determination adds tension to the narrative.The film's narrative is expertly crafted, maintaining a relentless pace that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The plot picks up immediately from where ""The Bourne Supremacy"" left off, plunging Bourne into a high-stakes game of cat and mouse with the CIA. The story is both intricate and accessible, balancing action with moments of introspection that delve into Bourne's past and his quest for redemption.One of the standout elements of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is its action sequences. The film features some of the most thrilling and well-executed action scenes in the series, including a breathtaking chase through the streets of Tangier and a tense showdown in a New York City office building. Greengrass's signature shaky cam style enhances the sense of urgency and realism, immersing the audience in the chaos and intensity of Bourne's world. While some may find the handheld camera work disorienting, it undeniably adds to the film's gritty and visceral feel.The movie's thematic exploration of the moral ambiguities of national security and espionage adds depth to the action. Bourne's journey is not just a physical one but a moral one, as he confronts the ethical implications of his past actions and the broader consequences of the government's covert operations.Visually, the film is striking, with cinematography that captures the diverse and dynamic settings, from the crowded streets of European cities to the high-tech confines of CIA headquarters. The global scope of the film enhances its epic feel, making it a truly international thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Should Have Finished It With 'Supremacy',"Let me preface by saying I liked the first Bourne film (""The Bourne Identity"") and loved the second one (""The Bourne Supremacy""). I was anxious to see the third - this one - but delayed my viewing because I had heard this film was very anti-American. However, I finally got around to seeing it, deciding to make up my own mind.Frankly, I didn't find the politics much more Liberal than the other two, so that didn't bother me.....but overall, it just wasn't that good a movie. Looking at some of the other reviews here, I guess I am not alone. I agree with all those who said watching this film can give you a headache. The director here upped the amount of scenes with the hand-held camera and shook it horizontally and vertically during all the action scenes. It ridiculous; literally hard on the eyes....and I normally can put up it, but there were a few times I had to look away for a few seconds to give my eyes a rest, and that took away from the enjoyment of the film.The other two things that disappointed me was there was really nothing new regarding the story except for the ending. The rest of it was the same things I had seen in the first two films. Worse, the credibility in the action scenes was zero. As usual, Hollywood takes things to excess. Now, Bourne isn't just a great fighter and survivor: he's Superman and Rambo rolled into one! He eludes not one but several entire city police forces after him, both on the run manually or in vehicles (car or motorbike). That part is a real insult to anyone's intelligence. It makes the film look dumb.Two other leading characters also were stupid and annoying. We get the usual PC woman-is-better-than man angle with Joan Allen's character more honest, compassion and smart than the cliché corrupt male government worker, played by the moronic-voiced David Strathairn.With Liberal icons like Straithairn, Allen, Matt Damon and Julia Stiles I expected more propaganda, although it was there more than you think, just more subtly. For instance, the American flag was always prominently shown in a negative way in the film and the TV networks getting a couple of plugs each were CNN and MSNBC. There was no Fox News shown. Gosh, what a shock! Overall, they should have added 20 minutes to the last film and had Bourne find his true identity there.....thereby not wasting everyone's time with this headache-producer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
humdrum,"I cannot understand why this average action film (and bellow average, if you consider film making in general) got such high marks! It's true I'm not an action films fan, but take this: Ronin is noted 7.1 and Nikita 7.5, only to take 2 masterpieces of the genre! I found it duller than the others of the series. The continuous chase and short cuts editing are the only techniques used at such an extent and so repetitive that I got bored from minute 2. Matt Damon is a fine and intelligent actor (see leading role in ""Good Will Hunting"", when he won also an Oscar for screenplay), but he had no chance of showing it in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Who Am I?,"When Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) contacts the British reporter of The Guardian Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) that is researching the Operation Blackbriar that superseded the Project Treadstone to find out a clue to lead to his true identity, he is chased by CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), who wants to eliminate him. Jason is chased in Moscow, Paris, Madrid, London and Tangier, and while fighting to survive, he is supported by Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen).""The Bourne Ultimatum"" completes the trilogy of the Bourne saga to find out his own identity with golden key, with an above average conclusion. However, this movie is totally overrated since it does not deserve to be in IMDb Top 250. Most of the breathless action scenes are frantic, but awfully cut and edited like in a video clip; the sequences last a few seconds only, making very difficult to follow what is happening. It is also funny to see the efficiency and the apparatuses used by CIA in blockbuster movies, absolutely contradictory with reality. Anyway cinema is fiction and action movies must be liars and exaggerated to work. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Ultimato Bourne"" (""The Bourne Ultimatum"")",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Nothing new after 1 and 2,"While I do appreciate this series, this movie leaves me with more questions than answers. Like, why did I just watch this?The first two films were exceptional, and the second was even better than the first, which is a rarity. Most everything felt answered and I was very fulfilled at the end of the second. This movie was very unnecessary and hardly provides any new context or storyline that we hadn't already visited. The characters are rehashed, the scenes are peppered with cutouts from the previous two films, and even the music down to the ending credits was reused. Even many of the action scenes felt all too familiar. It was as if I was watching someone's attempt to remake the second film.The directing and acting was to a Bourne caliber, but with such a lackluster script with soon little new to add, it's hard to speak highly of this film. Unfortunately this felt more like an attempt to simply sell more tickets at the box office, and thus failed to captivate my attention.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Good movie ruined by bad camera work,"This is the first review i write on IMDb, but i just had to say how utterly disappointed i was with this movie's camera work. The shaky camera in each and every scene ruined the movie completely. I simply couldn't bare to watch the movie to the end, even though I'm a fan of action movies and Matt Damon, that's how much the camera ""work"" ruined the film. I have seen this shaking camera effect in another movie before (forgot the name), and it had the same effect: making it unwatchable.What is the point of the shaky-cam when the viewers cant see what is going on in the action scenes and are distracted during the dialogues? What on earth makes the film makers decide to shake the camera at all, and in the Bourne case so excessively? Are they trying to hide the fact that they used some cheap effects or bad fight choreography? I don't know, cause I cant see! What a waste of a good film. Hope this hype about shaky-cam is soon over before it ruins more good movies.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Better than Bond.,"The Jason Bourne films with Matt Damon in them succeed where the current James Bond films fail. While Daniel Craig's sociopath Bond wallows in self loathing and psychopathy, the emotional sub plot in the Jason Bourne films are direct, focused and sensible.It makes sense for a man that has lost his memory to desperately try and figure out who he is, even without highly trained assassins dogging his every move. Throughout the series, he attempts to make amends for his nefarious espionage past and in doing so, blazes a path toward redemption. Having read two of the originals books this series is based upon, I can say that the Jason Bourne character is actually better fleshed out in the films and no doubt intellectual actor Matt Damon had a lot to do with that. This is an excellent action espionage series of films.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"All action, no plot...but a great summer thriller","As those who have read the books and seen the prior films already know, there is zero relation between the the plots in the two genres. This Bourne is no exception, but here it is taken to the extreme. There is no plot whatsoever! Instead, we get two hours of really, really excellent chase sequences. While the trendy, shaky, hand-held, fast-cut camera work gets to be a bit much after a while, the non-stop action makes up for it. This is one of those 'suspend disbelief', 'indestructible superhero', 'the CIA is all-powerful' films, but it's a delicious summer confection nonetheless. It has nowhere near the nuance or thoughtfulness quotient of something like Scorcese's The Departed, but it's nevertheless a real crowd pleaser. I saw this at a small private screening, and *everyone*, young and old, conservative and liberal, action-junkie or drama- snob, came away liking it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A solid spy vs spy plot, intense acting, but mostly just stellar stellar filmmaking!","The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)The best of the big three Bourne movies. A have a soft spot for the first one because it was ""first"" and it brought out the basic ideas fresh and with some grit and invention (as in the opening scenes). By comparison the plot here, the narrative, is actually more of the same, another spy movie.But so incredibly well done it's riveting. There are fight scenes and car chases, plenty and then some, but there is a lot of really intelligent pursuit on another level, on foot, not only of Bourne but of a couple of his accomplices. The camera then becomes a player, and the action, though fast, is absolutely vivid and discernible. There's no exaggerating the power of this kind of chase, as if you are there, first in London and then in Tangiers.It helps slightly if you've seen the first two movies, because a lot of the movie is out to ""explain"" the mystery of this creation, this killing machine named Jason Bourne. Of course, this is a machine with a conscience, and his struggle for memory, and for self, is the soul of the movie. In this third installment he has some help, and some unexplained old feelings with, a woman in a pale echo of the first movie with Marie (who is mentioned many times here). And this helps give the movie feeling.There is a ton written about these movies, and about Robert Ludlum's three books that are the core of the plots here (for deviations, see the internet). Note there is no fourth book, and the fourth ""Bourne"" movie—""Legacy""— is a decent wannabe without Damon and also without Bourne (as a character). The efforts of original director (Doug Liman) for ""The Bourne Identity"" aren't to be underestimated, but it is partly his cameraman, Oliver Wood, who makes the movie delirious and rich. And when the director was changed to Paul Greengrass for the 2nd and 3rd movies, Wood was retained, and he helps (along with the actors) give the movies coherence.Greengrass earns his own kudos, though, for after doing a creditable but routine (and extremely kinetic) 2nd movie, pulls off this bit of movie-making masterwork. It's really something to study. It's a Hollywood piece of crap on some levels, of course, with lots of effects and a plot that isn't going to win awards for creativity. But it's so well done, and with enough touches of genuine human intensity, it works. It really works. See it even if you doubt it. And if you like this kind of movie, then you've already seen it.So see it again. I did. It holds up great the second time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

My Opinion On The Bourne Ultimatum,"This is one of the most action filled movies I have ever seen. It has every aspect that I look for in a movie, amazing plot, incredible acting, and the directing was one of the best. There was rarely a moment when I wasn't on the very edge of my seat waiting for another scene full of action. Not only did it have action in it, there were times of sadness, dry humor, and internal conflict. Throughout the film, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is trying to figure out his identity and why people are after him, as in the previous two movies, The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy. As he is doing that, he tries to avenge the death of the one girl he truly cared about, who was introduced in the first Bourne film. With Bourne's wit and constant confrontations with the people after him, he gives the movie a sense of suspense and thrill that I haven't gotten in any other movie I've seenOn the other hand, there were a few faults I picked up on while watching the movie. One of those faults I believe is that a couple of the scenes had no meaning. To me, there was no point in adding them to the movie because they slowed the movie down. Without those scenes, the movie would have absolutely been the best movie I have ever seen. Overall, I believe that the film had the best setup, plot, and acting I have ever seen.Compared to another action film I have seen, like Gone In 60 Seconds, The Bourne Ultimatum has a better way of keeping the audience engaged in the movie and always wanting to know what's coming up next. Gone In 60 Seconds was a decent movie, if you were to only focus on the cars rather than the acting. There was action in this film but it wasn't as interactive as it was in The Bourne Ultimatum. That movie had me feeling ready to go out and fight as soon as I finished watching the movie. The way both movies ended had a different effect on me than the other did. Gone In 60 Seconds had an ending that I thought was cliché and expected in a movie. What was different in The Bourne Ultimatum was the fact that it closed the whole series perfectly and had me wanting more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Captain America's gone wild !,"He now has a name, an identity, some memories and a a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear, but still, they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built. Now he wants some explanation, and to get ride of the people how made him what he is. Yeah, Jason Bourne is back, and this time, he 's here with a vengeance.OK, this movie doesn't have the most elaborated script in the world, but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, like every Hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90's, ""The Bourne Suprematy"" is a super-heroes story. Jason Bourne is a Captain-America project-like, who's gone completely wrong. In the first movie, the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one. He now fights against what he considers like evil, after a person close to him has been killed (his girlfriend in ""Suprematy"") by them. That's all a part of the super-hero story, including a character with (realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible) super powers.And the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world (there's no frontiers in the Bourne's movies, characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye), is, as in the best seasons of ""24"", an American enemy, who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him. Funny how ""mad patriots"" are now the N.1 enemies of paranoiac Hollywood's stories.Beside all those interesting thematics, the movie isn't flawless : the feminine character of Nickie Parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes. But all that doesn't really matter, for ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is an action movie. And the action scenes are rather impressive.Everyone here is talking about the ""Waterloo scene"" and the ""Tanger pursuit"" and everyone's right. I particularly enjoyed the fight in Tanger, that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of Tsui Hark. Visually inventive scenes, lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on American's contemporary thematics : ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Actions from start to finish,"Read the book decades ago. Though can't remember the details, but the film is definitely updated with new and exaggerated spy technologies. This is an action film, it is made for this entertainment purpose - so forget about the book.It is an edge-of-the-seat action-packed movie. The story keeps the movie-goers anticipating for the next scene and change of events. Every time Bourne losses a lead, you keep looking forward to what he is going to do next. His wits and resourcefulness keeps him alive. In the end, it gave me that deja vu feeling of ""Die Hard"".I would have given it a higher rating if not for the shaky camera work.

Lend the scene some gritty urbane shades of grey and you might just get a sense of what watching The Bourne Ultimatum is like. It is the third and final instalment of the best Hollywood trilogy since Lord Of The Rings. A cataclysm of chase sequences all brought together through an incredibly well managed story of searching for identity. Jason Bourne is now closer to finding out the truth than ever before. But those who rely on secrets and lies fully intend to make sure he never does. His journey brings him from Moscow (where we left off from Supremacy) to London, Tangiers and finally New York. Our main man has kept himself busy, amid trying to solve the riddle of why so many want him dead.Paul Greengrass may just be the finest director working in Hollywood at the moment. After the admirably harrowing exercise in recreating the brave but doomed lives of those aboard United 93 last year, Greengrass has returned to what brought him mainstream acclaim, with Matt Damon as the man with many names. He is Jason Bourne, a man who pulsates his way through the journey faster than the camera can catch him, dispatching of his enemies in skilfully undetectable panache. He is the anti-James Bond, a man who achieves his goals through relentless determination but secretly just wants to let it all go and get back to being a normal person. Greengrass manages to capture the unclothed torture that occasionally surfaces in Bourne's demeanour during the film. In the few scenes between the break-neck action set-pieces it is almost as if Greegrass has been studying the characters' biorhythms, as the camera learily explores the meaning of a tapping finger, or a nervous twitch of an eye. The faux-documentary style allows for the camera to be as intimate as possible when needs be, and as explosively dynamic too. It is that wonderful mirage of cinematic excursions that lend The Bourne Ultimatum a sense of intimacy and substance. But that is not all that gives the movie its edge. Indeed it has political undertones too, with one brilliant sequence inside Waterloo station exploring the effects of being watched through CCTV. Not so much being watched, but who controls the cameras. Secondly, those who attempt to assassinate Bourne are all under the banner of the CIA, and references aplenty are made to waterboarding, black ops and rendition, as if the movie is questioning the humanity of those methods.But the real stars of the show are the incredible action chases. Whether it is the roof jumping in Tangiers, or the car chase in New York, The Bourne Ultimatum is never short of being unrelenting. No other director could ever perfect this pace, for anything faster would be overkill, and anything less would diluting the frenetic energy that charges the movie screen. Greengrass is a master at roping his audience in and never letting go of that leverage. He can take the most basic of action sequences like a man running and make it feel like a helicopter exploding. Whether it is too frenetic or not, the one thing that is impossible to feel is boredom. Even the rare tender scenes are utterly compelling in their delivery. This is Matt Damon's finest work. He has always had a fluctuating career in terms of quality, despite being a very bankable star in the process. But his subtle raggedness, and penchant for looking unperturbed in the face of great danger is what makes Bourne seem like the classic no-man. He is an anomaly in terms of James Bond bewitchery, but perfect for the role of Jason Bourne  handsome, rugged and steely eyed. Not a flicker of doubt ever crosses his mind whilst fighting for the truth. And not a flicker of doubt ever crossed mine when reviewing this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Love it,"It starts of very slowly, not showing that it will differ from the previous two instalments in the franchise, but when Bourne enters the London train terminal, all hell breaks out.There is a short break in Madrid, and then the chase in Tangiers starts. For me, this is the best action scene in movie history. There have been many rooftop chases in movie history, but this one is truly incredible. Its simplicity, power, speed, suspense is unparallelled. The shaking camera, which a lot of people point out as the weak spot of the movie shows its true meaning in this scene, and i think it, alongside the incredible movie score, is its strong point. Of course, the screenplay, acting, directing, sound, picture, and not to forget the best stunts ever seen in a motion picture make this movie truly the best.This movie is not more than a compilation of three huge action scenes put together with breaks in between, but that is why this movie is so brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An Edge-of-the-seat Roller Coaster,"This film is chipper. It follows Jason Bournes hunt for his life while the CIA centre all their forces on his capture. The fierce and deadly determination of the CIA is portrayed with a raw tang that demonstrates how much power the CIA have been given. Matt Damon is very good as Bourne, a charging assassin who is not here to mess around. When the reporter contacts born it is obvious that this guy is out of his depth. The reporter's whining performance is good because he gets across how normal people get drawn into gigantic wars. The director did a sterling job, the camera angles are up-close and swift and this makes the action forceful and jittery. The film is a headlong chase that unveils the truth very cleverly which makes the audience ponder. Anyone who hasn't had a goosey of this film needs to. The acting is great.The fighting has a savage dong to it. The ending has a twist thats better than a cheese string.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The film that cemented the Bourne name,"'THE_BOURNE_ULTIMATUM' was_directed_by_Paul_Greengrass_and_stars Matt_Damon, ​David_Strathairn_and_Julia_Stiles. ​Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues his international quest to uncover his true identity. From Russia to Europe to northern Africa to the United States, he must stay one step ahead of those who would capture or kill him before he has a chance to discover the truth.I didn't like Identity. I liked Supremacy. I adored every second of Ultimaum. This is easily the peak of the trilogy(and allegedly franchise as a whole). It encapsulates the good from both movies and improves drastically on the flaws I had with them films. No Marie Kreutz from Identity. Easily the Bourne franchise's best villain and no contest the best action. Greengrass is the only current director who can use hand held cam effectively and he perfected that craft with Ultimatum. He was working there with Supremacy but ironed out all the chinks with Ultimatum. This is easily the best movie in the trilogy and maybe even one of the best action movies in recent memory.Where do I begin in complimenting this movie. I guess the story would be a great place to start, and what a brilliant story it is. Gilroy, Nofil and Burns have made a spectacular story that is gripping and enthralling from beginning to end. It is interesting and I would argue the best story of the three, even though Supremacy is technically the better thriller(for me). I've heard many people refer to this franchise as the 'Smart Bond' but I've never believed them until now. One small sequence in this movie(and a ridiculously clever way to intertwine Supremacy and Ultimatum) changed my entire outlook on this nickname and made me believe it. It is the thinking man's Bond. Not that I don't love Bond, it's just Mert Dermon is smarter than it. I defy anyone to tell me that the ending of this movie is not perfect. It is exhilarating, it ends on a cliffhanger but also complete finish, it's smart, it's engaging; it's the perfect way to end this trilogy.Mert Dermon is spectacular in his role as Jason Bourne. The arc he experiences over the course of the trilogy is brilliant character development and Damon sells every single scene of it. It is probably his best performance, purely because of what he managed to do to the character.David Strathairn was great as Noah Vosen and provided a great mental foil for Bond. On the subject of Vosen, the villains in this movie are by far the best out of any Bourne film. They are smart, interesting and most importantly have a purpose. As much as I enjoyed Supremacy, Yuri Gretkov had little to no relation to Bourne and that made his character so much weaker. The villains in this movie, however, make sense and that instantly gives them an edge over the 'competition'.Julia Stiles plays a much larger role in this movie than the previous one and does it very well. She is filling in for Marie Kreutz and I actually prefer her to Kreutz. I also love how they don't try to force some love story between the her and Bourne. This is the maturity and evolution we need in film. Not every woman should be treated as merely a sex object or as a relationship starter for the masculine lead character. They can be interesting without the need for forced romance. Take notes Hollywood, take notes.Joan Allen plays a much smaller role in this movie for me but I still admired her performance just as much as in Supremacy. She holds her own against other character and provides a useful ally for Bourne.I have said it once, I've said it twice, I'll say it again; Paul Greengrass is the only man alive who should be allowed to use hand held camera. He uses it to add realism to the sequences and make them arguably more intense. He doesn't use it to obscure an actor's face and their movements so we can paint a picture of what is happening in our minds. It's truly admirable that he is the only living human that can do something that should be so simple.Leading on from the action, this movie is full of it. Two sequences stick out for me and both are excellent. The police chase sequence is probably one of the best action set pieces of the 2000s, and I don't say that lightly. Greengrass' use of hand held cam(I refuse to refer to it as shaky cam in this instance) helps sell the realism and urgency of the action. It doesn't feel well rehearsed(even though it is) and that makes it seem so much more grounded and real. Greengrass cleaned up his act with action and hand held cam and perfected the craft of it since Supremacy. Very, very impressive. Very enjoyable to behold.I love the score of this movie. It is utterly fantastic and spectacular and I adore it.My main and only issue with this movie was that I never felt Bourne was in any immediate danger. I never doubted he'd escape or survive. They basically make him a god and that made the film lose stakes. Not that it takes away from the action, when the action gets going; you don't pay attention to this, but if you take a step back, you realise that there was 0% chance he'd lose any fight. I know that losing would be out of character but I would prefer to see some sort of weakness that he had to overcome.In conclusion, Ultimatum is a very enjoyable and widely accessible action/thriller. I don't think seeing the first two films is required to like this movie but it is recommended. I definitely recommend you watch Ultimatum, and specifically recommend you watch the trilogy back-to-back. I'll rate The Bourne Ultimatum 9 'COME ALONEs' out of 10. Please see it; it is awesome!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Long and Winding Road Home,"The third movie in the series of the CIA amnesiac super agent, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is as dynamic, fast-moving, filled with the first class chase sequences, and never-stopping tension as the first two movies. All three movies make a very exiting trilogy and also manage to tell something very important on the subject of the honorable goals that not always justify the means. This time, Jason Bourne is set to find out how, when, and where it all started for him. He wants to remember all, he wants to know what the flashbacks that keep coming back mean and by doing so, he once again becomes a danger to CIA. The agency made him a part of a special top-secret program ""Blackbriar"" which had created a perfect killing machine, a super assassin out of him. Now, he presents an imminent danger for CIA's director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn) who had approved the program and for Noah Vosen (David Strathairn, excellent as usual), the chief of department's division of top secret operations. Vosen does not hate Bourne personally. He knows that Bourne is as a treat for the agency and has to be eliminated and he would use all possible high-tech devices and techniques as well as ruthless manipulation to trace him see him dead. Bourne also has allies inside CIA, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (grown up Julia Stiles has just a few words in the script but the close ups of her face that changed emotions and feelings so vividly made her character compelling and memorable.)A lot has been said about Paul Greengrass's (""United 93,"" ""Bourne Supremacy"") directing and his use of fast cuts and an unsteady camera. I found his approach competent, appropriate and fully justified. In the film packed with suspense and thrills, at least two chase scenes are perfect and breathtaking. The long scene in London Waterloo station where Bourne tries to make a contact with a reporter for The Guardian, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is a masterwork. Bourne knows that Ross has been watched by the CIA high-tech specialists in NYC office and has been followed by the operatives at the station while an excellent sniper is waiting somewhere for a signal to terminate the reporter. Bourne controls the situation by trying to get the information from Ross and to protect him. Another scene takes place in Tangier as Bourne attempts to talk to a man from his flashbacks who has knowledge of his past before he ever became Jason Bourne. Bringing the action to Tangier, reminds me the old movie ""Pepe Le Moko"" (1937) directed by Julien Duvivier where the main character stuck forever in the suffocating maze of narrow streets of Tangier. It also made me think that Bourne movies are not just high adrenalin thrillers/mystery/spy flicks but they are first of all about longing for home, the quest for returning to the roots, searching for and understanding one's real identity and as such they are more interesting, deeper, and poignant than just a well done action flick. Maybe the movies would not have made me think so had another actor played Jason Bourne. Matt Damon, the actor with a lot of charisma and high intelligence is perfect for a role of a thinking superman that wants to know who and what is behind his super abilities.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Bourne is ""born again""","Action junkies...here it is!! Well done and obvious but certainly worth viewing. Entertainment for the masses!! Enjoy!!! I would hope that this would be the final, final. Sequels that are well done often engage the perilous precipice of being overdone. Die hard 4 being the rule of being to close to the precipice. Matt Damon is very engaging and the fact that there is the familiarity of the supporting cast makes the viewer who has watched the previous Bourne chapters very comfortable.

"Great story, but difficult to view","I saw this movie when it was first released and I own copies of the trilogy on DVD. My teenage son and I recently watched the trilogy over three nights (you know... the whole COVID-19 thing). His first time seeing them and my first re-visit in probably a decade or more.Five minutes into the film, I remembered why I disliked it. It is the OVERLY-jerky camera motion and the scene cuts of between three seconds and less than one second. Seriously, you can't count to three on a scene before they change the angle or the shot and it's bouncing all over the place. The first two movies employ this to some degree and it is even explained in the ""Extras"" on one of them that it is shot from a ""hand-held"" perspective to make the viewer feel as if it is unfolding real-time. But in this, the third, it is over used and therefore it overstimulates. After 45 minutes, it started to give me a headache. I even had to close my eyes just to give my throbbing head a break at times. It was unnecessary and to the point that if I see another movie from this director, I will approach it with caution and, likely, avoid.The story is good. We all realize how it will likely turn out before the ending. If it weren't for the shooting style, it would be a downright enjoyable action movie and would then be worthy of eight or nine stars.

Gr8!,"It was awesome! i believe it was the best out of the trilogy... its ending is open for HOPEFULLY a 4th movie. The directing was awesome! As well as the effects. Matt Damon is a great actor and no other actor could have played his part better. There were some really great scenes. There were some nice dramatic scenes too. It was a movie of variety: comedy, drama, suspense, etc. In order to totally understand what is going on, you have to pay attention very closely the whole entire time or else you might lose some very important details that lead up to the end. There were too many characters, in my opinion, but I guess that is what made it so good because so many people were after Jason Bourne.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A non-stop, high speed action-fest","Action movies don't do much for me, they bore me and I find most of them way too stupid to believe. However, this movie had saying ""Wow"" at the end. Never have I seen an action movie that is so fast paced, relentless and believable. The acting from everyone was great (especially Matt Damon as Jason Bourne), the fight scenes were realistic and the direction from Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93) was brilliant.Following straight from the events of The Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne is still trying to find out who he is while evading assassins sent from the CIA as well as a government agent hell-bent on killing Bourne.As said before, The Bourne Ultimatum is a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish and is a very satisfying conclusion to an awesome trilogy. The main issue I had with the movie was the camera-work. The whole movie was just shaky and by the halfway mark it was getting annoying and it was a really distracting thing. I think Greengrass needs to steady up with the camera and only use the ""shaky-cam"" technique during fight scenes and not throughout the whole movie.Aside from that The Bourne Ultimatum is an amazing action movie and one of the best this year.4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Shaky Screen Blues,"There has been a new fad in movies such as Mission Impossible 3, Ocean's 12, and other big hits. Do you know what I'm talking about? I mean the style of filming that makes you think that the film had such a low budget that they couldn't even afford a tripod.During the close-up scenes the screen wobbles and during the action scenes, the irregular camera motion mixed with the fast editing makes the scene unintelligible.The only way that someone can capture everything that is going on is by loading up on a dozen Starbucks Venti Crapa-Frapas and sneaking in a couple boxes of Red Bull to keep their brain working as fast as the images that are flying by on screen.Myself as well as several of my friends and relatives have discussed this filming technique to extreme measures, and we feel that it should be banned for the following reasons: 1: This type of filming induces dizzy spells and vomiting. I do NOT want to have to take a Dramamine before going to the movies: I am there to be entertained, not nauseated.2: When the movie ends, I wan't to be able to have some sort of grasp of who kicked who's buttocks in this scene or that.3: Halfway through the movie, when I need to take my regular bathroom break, I would appreciate being able to walk to the bathroom without looking drunk or sick.and finally 4: It's cheating. The film makers only use the shaky screen because they know that they aren't very good film makers and they are trying to hide all the errors in their film that would be seen if the film were filmed in a traditional fashion.Well, there you go.The Bourne Ultimatum had a terrific storyline, acting, editing, and everything, but that shaky screen is a real deal breaker for several of my cousins who said ""Now that I know it's a shaky-screen movie"" I will wait until it goes to the cheap theater.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Bourne continues to run as those that created him try to kill him in a film thats pure action and almost no plot,"Third in the series this film is pure motion from beginning to end. The plot is the same as the first two, Bourne looks for his past while the people who know it try to kill him. Not very original. Like the recent Harry Potter film the narrative is as bare bones as you can get, only more so since we really don't learn anything until the final moments, otherwise its pure action as Bourne goes from Moscow to London to Madrid to Morocco to New York. Give them points for making it just compelling enough to keep you following along for two hours, but take a few away from the lack of anything meaningful happening. Yes, the set pieces are fantastic but there really isn't anything to hold them together other than an idea, which is not really a plot. What is it about this series, they've done the opposite of most movie series in that as its gone on they've made them less and less complicated and removed the narrative almost altogether. (The next film will be Bourne running for two hours and we watch as he randomly assaults passers by.) I enjoyed it but was getting hungry for a real meal about half way in.

Third Bourne not a charm.,"After reading all the glowing reviews and having loved the first two Bournes, I was eager to see this film. And, of course, with Matt Damon as the star, how could it be anything but great? But the reviewers must lack any kind of discrimination because the film was a bore. And it didn't even star Matt Damon. It starred the camera, which was a complete ham throughout: bobbing, weaving, leaping, panning, jumping, spinning, doing everything but capturing real action. The fight scenes were what I call ""Tarzan and the Snake"" shots. (In 1981's ""Tarzan, The Ape Man"" we don't actually see our loin-clothed hero battle a snake, just some quick still shots.) Damon was, as usual, strong, but the story, when you could see it, was nothing but all the chase scenes you've seen in a hundred films from ""Bullitt"" to every Bond. Stiles, Allen, Strahairn, Finney et al were wasted, the apartment-jumping chase scene (borrowed from the last MI) was hilariously unlikely (doesn't anybody live in that neighborhood?). Pity, the first two Bournes were tight, exciting, believable. This was a string of clichés lensed by a cameraman on too much caffeine by producers who had the arrogance to think that today's reviewers are so film-illiterate that they would fall for lots of fast-moving shots but very little real action. And damned if they weren't right.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Nothing that merits a rewatch. Too much action and not enough substance,"Again. Not good enough to justify more than 6.5. It was more frantic running about and more corruption and unfortunately the ending never provided anything particularly note worthy either. No big reveal or significant new information. There was a minor reveal. But it wasn't exactly anything that was fundamental to the ""story"". Overall the whole series was the same stuff done over and over again. I do struggle to see the attraction of intense music and a constant hunt for a fugitive. It just gets boring for me. Not by any means a bad movie. Just not a particularly thought provoking or cerebral series. Assassin guy evades capture for 8 hours. That's the gist of it. If that's your bag, then it will tick the box for you.

"""Cut and copy"" of the second movie","Well, first of all I like spy stories. So, I like the Bourne trilogy.

A lot of things are cut and copied from the second, and overall in this one Bourne do things literally impossible (ok, it's a spy story, but not a comic!). Another thing I can't accept is that, like the second (same director Greengrass) the camera is unstable to show critic moments: at the end you feel like if you've played Doom for too much time with your eyes going up and down. Great directors can give the same without using this poor trick. So, this is (now) 126 in the IMDb Top 250, near Yojimbo, Per qualche dollaro in più and The sixth sense.

Clearly the best of three,"Well, this one annoys me! It is one heck of a spy thriller. Matt Dammon continues to portrait Jason Bourne in a surprisingly good almost shockingly so way. From being a barely mediocre actor, he in these three movies have grown to be a splendid actor. And in this last installment, he simply is Bourne. Well, at least the movie version. The only thing that pulls down, is that Matt doesn't know martial arts if his life depended on it. But what could have been disastrous for the series, have been saved by one heck of a genius behind the camera. The fast moving close in camera, successfully hides his lack of fighting skills in most instances.the plots have become better for each movie also, and it is with a heavy heart i have to give this one 8 stars.

Roller-coaster ride? Maybe... It did make me sick!,"I seem to remember liking the 1st two Bourne films... If my memory serves me correctly they were exciting, well acted and directed and were a breath of fresh air in an otherwise suffocatingly stale Spy Movie genre. When the third Bourne film came to town, I was amped.But, what I was not ready for was 2 hours of the most nauseating camera work I have ever seen. Seriously, this was WAY TOO MUCH. It was ridiculously over shot. Some of the fight scenes looked sooooo great (for the 3 seconds where I could make out what was happening). The chase scenes were almost ballet-beautiful (for the 3 seconds where I could make out what was happening). But all the potentially wonderful things this film had to offer were all drowned in a raging sea, the likes of which brought about a sickness a box of Dramamine would not have quelled.Where the other films like this?

"Absurd but Entertaining, Propelled by Strong Performances","The latest high quality adrenalized action franchise is Bourne Identity - Ultimatum. Matt Damon and excellent supporting actors, combine with good writing (based on Robert Ludlum's novels), decent cinematography and directing to produce one of the better action trilogies. Ultimatum is the third installment and is just as good as the previous two. The film does not contain the amount of character development in the first two, so any prospective viewer is encouraged to watch the first two films in sequence before seeing Ultimatum.In Ultimatum (strangely inappropriate title, since no ultimatum is ever delivered) Bourne gets closer to learning his own identity while his former employers close in around him. Tipped off by a smart investigative journalist, Bourne must stay several steps ahead of the most advanced espionage organizations in the world simply to preserve his own life. He tours most of Europe searching for clues and informants, and leaving the trail of destruction we have grown to expect in his wake.The following paragraph is not intended as a criticism - the film is entire entertaining. However, I do feel compelled to point a few things out regarding the basics of the premise and the action of the film. There are quite a few aspects of this film which are more than a tad ridiculous. Action audiences must be willing to suspend disbelief for substantial periods of time to be able to watch practically anything in the genre these days, but the silliness even extends into the dramatic elements of the Bourne franchise. The plot exploits American paranoia about intelligence agencies, but almost makes these seemingly omnipresent and omniscient organizations ridiculously vulnerable. Bourne himself, though a consistently compelling character, is not simply capable of surviving any physical damage, but also seems to be able to predict the behavior of several dozen people at the same time - without the assistance of the surveillance equipment being used against him throughout the film.Damon does a fine job with the lead role. David Strathairn is GREAT!!!!! Joan Allen, Julie Stiles and Albert Finney are also very strong.The editing is excellent. The film is intensely paced, but doesn't have quite the desperate feeling as the first two. The directing and camera work are fine, but some of the simulated hand-held photography and hyper-speed fight scenes seemed a little weak.Ultimately, the entire series is highly recommended for action and thriller fans, but I don't recommend walking into this without previous experience with the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Great Scotts,"Why did I think ""Transformers"" was great and this not? They use the same cinematic engineering at root. This is simpler and because it is not a cartoon and chase-oriented rather than battle-oriented it grabs better.Both are made by untalented men advised by brilliant producers. In this case, its Doug Liman, who has made study of how the eye can be diced. What he's done is take the standard camera techniques for excitement and toned them up a bit.The model is Tony Scott. In fact, the Scott model is followed so stringently, we have that teletype effect and sound when we are told where the action has moved to. Can we finally get rid of that, please? Its as disruptive as that business of the red line moving across a map used to be.The camera is otherwise inherently cinematic and ""there."" By there, I mean even in the quiet segments, we are reminded that it is a hand-held camera. The interesting thing is that you can see that a machine is putting those jiggles in as no cameraman could be that random. Its not a human eye but a robot one pretending to be so.But you probably won't notice that. You'll notice, as I did, that when the fights happen, you see flashes as the participants would, When you run, you see irrelevant motion as a runner and someone following him would, and taking cues from that amazing section at the beginning of ""Casino Royale.""So why did I like ""Transformers"" better? You'll laugh when I tell you. Because the story is more intelligent, and elements of it relevant to the cinematic adventure. Here's an example: the concept in Transformers is that we have a hyperactive, flitting eye. So we are prepared for this by being shown a robot with the same hyperactive vision disorder (and we see things through its eyes).That's not the case here. The story is one of recovered memory, of bits coming together to make sense. The cinematic basis is the opposite. Oh, there's some cinematic memory, the type of stuff from ""Manchurin Candidate,"" (with the ""memory"" film incongruously striped with use and faded by exposure). That's old model, and it fits the story such as it is.The new cinematic vision is merely bolted on, the way that car chase was bolted on in ""French Connection."" That was about as exciting in its day. Go and watch that movie today and see how bad it is, and you'll see what we'll be thinking about this in 35 years. But it IS a rush if you see it now.Scott Glenn does a good job. Everyone else is a prop.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Thrilling end to a great series,"Bourne Supremacy - 9.5 / 10 This is easily the best 3quel of the entire year.

"OMG, it was awesome","I think this is the best action movie I have seen in a long, long time. Maybe ever!!!! This kicks Bond's butt! Compared to Ultimatum, Casino Royale is like a romance story. It took all the best action scenes that could ever be made and put them into one EXCELLENT movie. If you're an action movie fan and especially a Jason Bourne fan, this movie is a MUST SEE! I can't think of any negatives. The way it was filmed was perfect. The action was non-stop and the mood of the music definitely added to the suspense. It picks you up right at the opening and doesn't let you go until the closing credits. It just leaves you wanting more. One great thing I liked about this movie is that it wasn't too long and drawn out. I found myself checking my watch a few times during Casino Royale but during this movie I might as well have not even worn one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Good story, good actors, poor cameras.","I've seen all the Bourne movies, loved the first two, and the third one really does the series justice.While the plots are simpler and less ""super-human"" action thrown it (not to say there's a lack of it, there's certainly some fantastic scenes), Ultimatum still kept my interest.The only reason I'm not giving it a higher score is because my mother became sick watching the entire movie (I'm not joking, she couldn't drive). I don't know who was behind it all, but the camera did not sit still for the entire movie. I mean, even when they were sitting at desks and chatting, it was like the person filming the scene was in a giant vat of Jell-O.I mean, jiggling the camera for the ""Guy on the go"" effect has its merits, and the quick cut-scenes to literally shower the viewer with information, again, wonderful when used correctly... But the two can't seriously be the ENTIRE movie. That's almost all I remember.. jiggling, angle shifts, jiggling, in-focus, out-of-focus, jiggling, a shoe here, a nose there, someone's neck, and a car crash...If there had been some reprieve from the ""Bounce Castle"" style visuals, it would've been a 9 or 10... but for what there was, it was far too much of a good thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Exciting, but lacked characters and a real conclusion","I really enjoyed the first two films, but this one was pointless.First, the good news: Joan Allen proved once again she can say more in a single subtle look than many actors can say in an entire performance. You literally could see what she was thinking.The chases and stunts were sensational. This series always comes up with things you haven't seen before. If all you want are stunning chase scenes, then this movie will be enough for you.If you want characters, motivation or explanation, then this will feel futile.Were are the characters? Bourne was--Bourne. We've seen him before, twice, and in those films we learned a little more about him each time.This movie, should have explained not just what happened (since we basically knew) but WHY. Why did Jason agree to do this (or not). What motivated him? What was his relationship with these people before? Clearly he had his reasons, but we don't learn what they were! You know as much going into this film as you know after. So it turns into a loud, busy, pointless exercise.And frankly, Bourne is now becoming almost a super-hero in his ability to survive virtually everything.The endless use of jumpy hand-held, the closeups, the flash cuts all got tedious. Without the constant ""Stomp"" drumming that passed for a score it might have just seemed like a busy music video.Casino Royale was brilliant because it made Bond, formerly a machine, into a real person. The Bourne Ultimatum does the exact opposite, changing Bourne from a person into to a machine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bourne Ultimatium will send you onto an ultimate ride!,"This movie was action from beginning to start, i thought the secondary actors/actress were kinda weak, but Matt Damon saved the day.Jason Bourne (played by Matt Damon) tries to find out who he is in possibly the last of the Bourne films. He runs into old friends and enemies, and is wanting fond out who erased his memory and get revenge! the Borune Ultimatium Will definitely deliver to Fans of the trilogy, I thought the movie could have been better with the shaking camera throughout the whole movie (even in just face to face talking scenes) also the dialog could've been much better.I would love the see another Bourne movie, BUT change character a bit, i mean he is way too uptight the movie with very little and bad dialog. Damon is very,very , very good actor give him something to work with! He's also good with a little comedy in him ( just works well with him).In the end i give the Bourne Ultimatium 7.6/10.

Yet another Brilliant Bourne Movie,"Well they just get better and better. Third in a series is usually an awful made just for money movie, but this is one of the best Bourne films (so Far anyway).Matt Damon really is a brilliant Bourne, tough, ruthless but with mixed emotions as he still struggles to remember who or what he is.Joan Allen and Julia Styles are both excellent in this as they were in the last Movie. David Strathairn is just perfectly cast as Noah Vosen as is Albert Finney as Dr. Albert Hirsch.The action sequences are as good as in the previous two movies and the pace of the action is just right.I just hope they make another sometime soon to replace that awful Bourne Legacy which just didn't work at all.The end of this brilliant movie left the option to bring back Matt Damon as Bourne!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Love Bourne - hate the cinematography.,"This films has upped the very fast change of scene and this results in a movie that tries to be fast and original, but ends up being fast and disorienting. Needless moving camera angles just take you out of the action, and it's actually physically and emotionally tiring to watch this movie.

Paul Greengrass grants Jason Bourne with the finest treatment yet,"Paul Greengrass concludes the trilogy with the most portrayal of our action hero Jason Bourne yet. After being introduced to the titular character in 2002, audiences everywhere experienced a major game changer for Matt Damon as he demonstrated a high-octane performance. The first installment introduced the CIA agent with an intense character study of a man with a loss memory and trying to recover his past that made him the gun- totting assassin he is. The sequel continued the story with more hyperkinetic action and thrills. Paul Greengrass however, ignited the real deal in this third installment. Concluding with some explosive action sequences while balancing a polished narrative heft, this film achieves the rare accolade of improving on both it's first and second predecessor -- something -- it is difficult to point out any aspect this doesn't improve on. So this film follows Jason Bourne who's once again stripped away from his peaceful life, to search for CIA official Neal Daniels (played by Colin Stinton) who happens to be in possession of valuable information that holds secrets to his past. During his mission, Bourne must also dodge vicious assassins appointed by Operation Treadstone director Noah Visen (played by David Straithairn) to hunt him down despite the orders of CIA Deputy director Pamela Landy (played by Joan Allen) who suggest them leave him be. This all comes down to a mission that defines the very person Jason Bourne.Paul Greengrass continues his immersive style congruent to what we brought in 'Bourne Supremacy', only much better. From the energetic camera-work, the compelling action sequences, an intriguing storyline, and his overall covered direction all come together to conclude the film trilogy with a bang. The film opens with a tense action scene with Jasom Bourne on a train, and following this is a suspenseful airport scene where he comes face- to-face with British journalist Simin Ross (played by Paddy Considine) in an operation that quickly sets the story in motion. The sequence is both tension-filled and shot very beautifully but this is only the beginning. The story continues through an extraordinary journey of visceral character developments, realistic hand-to-hand combat (shot with slightly better camera-work than in the previous film), and a plot with interesting nuances about the characters including Julia Kate who's character is now granted a more prominent role than in the previous entries. By the end, it all comes down to Jason Bourne discovering the true meaning of his past and how he became the ruthless CIA agent we know him for. Is there anything the story leaves unexplored? Maybe, but hardly anything crucial is left abandoned here. And the result is something truly fascinating.The Bourne Ultimatim is a spectacular conclusion to the Bourne trilogy, and this is all thanks to both the compelling performance by lead Matt Damon as well as Paul Greengrass's stunning directorial efforts. This is easily one of the best action films of it's decade, it not only places Greengrass in the front ranks of action filmmakers but also leaves a landmark on the action flick genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

""" The Incredible life and death of David Webb ""","Movie audiences who follow the various preceding chapters of C.I.A. agent Jason Bourne are in for an exciting time when viewing this latest episode. When last we heard from Agent Bourne (Matt Damon) he had just completed a hard-fought visit to Russia where he sought out the daughter of his first victim. Following that, we catch up to him in busy London where he meets an inquisitive and popular reporter named Simon Ross. (Paddy Considine) From him Bourne learns of Operation Blackbrier, the secret Black-ops agency which emerged from the original source called 'Treadstone.' Risking his life to uncover his origins and identity, Bourne is marked for death from the very agency which created him. Ezra Kramer,(Scott Glenn) the new head of C.I.A. has instructed operations director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) to eliminate Bourne, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and Pamala Landy (Joan Allen). Despite the obvious danger, seeking his creator Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney) which may cost him his life as well as those who may try and aid him, Jason is determined to uncover the truth. The film is one enormous thrill ride, filled with all sorts of shootings, killings and general mayhem.

Greatest movie!!!,"It seems to me that this film has no minuses, let alone the plot and speech is not worth talking about! I went to the cinema for 'The Bourne Ultimatum' 2 times, I would go 22 more times, it's a pity we don't repeat films! This is just an unimaginable adventure, a picture of the highest class!Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has changed over these 5 years of running around: he has undoubtedly matured - this is clearly seen in his tired, exhausted face, a little Russified (take a closer look at Matt in the first part). But he is still 'mobile' and invulnerable!Part 3 introduces many other heroes, including the infamous 'Professional Killer Generation'! I really liked the mention of Marie, who is not in the story for almost 2 parts and the dry eyes of Jason Bourne! In general, I would like to draw special attention to this!When reviewing the film (and this applies not only to part 3), you constantly discover new smallest details, whether it is the scene mentioned above or the moment the Audi A6 rear-view mirror is turned (I will not describe in detail, talk about the meaning of the scenes ... I think, everyone will find and learn everything for himself). You could say that about almost every movie though. Everywhere there are interesting moments not immediately noticed by the viewer's eye!The third narrative has become a little richer and more colorful than the previous ones; it's difficult to talk about the first - after all, there are 5 years of difference: the budget is not the same - less, the cars are not the same - more modest, and after all, the first part differs from the next two!Greengrass car chases and fights (with Dash in this part) towards the end still tired me. This shaking, flickering of the camera - nothing is visible: how does it hit, with what, where? It would be great to figure it out! But in general I am satisfied and still do not complain!The soundtrack of this part disappointed me the most. Moreover, I liked it in the film, but when I got the OST and listened to it ... well, worse than the previous ones, but still good! Two words - 'an amateur'!In general, the atmosphere of the film is already much heavier, a certain tiredness is felt (for this I adore this film, not a film, but real real life): you can see it in Bourne's face after another murder of his counterpart!Loved the role of Edgar Ramirez (Paz), much more than Joey Ansa (Dash). Just Paz's surprise at the sight of Jason Bourne running at full speed towards him! He disliked Noah almost immediately (as did Kramer): sort of an aging handsome fashionista, the most elegant 'dude' in the CIA, probably a goat cheese omelet, all right! Dr. Hirsch is a notorious experimental scoundrel! Nikki has also grown noticeably, although her pleading at gunpoint in the second part still impresses me more than anything else played by her!And the words Bourne said to Paz were very reminiscent of the speech of 'Professor' Clive Owen from 'The Bourne Identity'. Very symbolic!Well, in the end: the film is simply breathtaking, for me - the best tape of the year! I would also like to note the good Russian dubbing! Very high quality!Excuse me, I don't know what else to say ... And there's nothing more to say and there's nothing to say! Watch and enjoy! Here's what's left to do!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Beware if you suffer from motion sickness,"Overall, I feel this movie is probably the best of the three. The story was developed and held your attention. The continuation of the story line from one film to the next was well done. Unfortunately, the filming was not as good as the first two. I can understand that they were probably trying to give the chase scenes an ""edge"", but the quick changing of camera views only help to emote an amateur film maker feel to the movie where the film is shot with an unsteady hand.

Best of the Original Trilogy,"The Bourne Ultimatum follows Jason Bourne as he sets out to uncover the last of the memories he lost, and is ultimately pursued, yet again, by the CIA.I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. After the first two, which upon a re-watch weren't exactly the classics I thought they were, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.Matt Damon is great in this movie. He really steps it up a notch from the last two movies, and makes what should have been his finale as Bourne something to remember. The rest of the performances are pretty great as well. They aren't amazing, but this is by far the best acted movie of the original trilogy.The story itself is interesting and fun. It's simple enough to understand pretty easily, but it's complicated enough for it to be clear that there was a fair bit of effort put in.Jason Bourne's character is much more fun to watch in this movie. He knows what he's doing, he's well-rehearsed, and it's just awesome to see how he knows exactly what to do, whether it's hand-to-hand combat or hiding someone in a crowd of people. It's all very cool, and despite the fact that I'm pretty sure I knew the outcome of the whole film, it was an intense movie to watch.The action scenes were pretty intense, and a lot of fun to watch. There was a lot of shaky cam, yet again, which got on my nerves, but the good choreography shines through well enough to make them both engaging and fast-paced.As for things I didn't like, the cameraman doesn't know how to hold his equipment still. Right from the get-go scenes that would be better off not shaky are, like conferences and the such. They aren't intense, so stop moving the camera so much. It was actually kind of nauseating to watch, but after the first little bit I got used to it. It's not unbearable, but it was kind of frustrating.Another thing is that the movie is much of the same. It follows something of a formula: something happens, CIA gets excited, Jason Bourne comes and goes, CIA gets mad and tries again. That's basically the entire movie recycled a couple times. While it isn't really a bad thing, it's still noticeable enough to be bothersome.Overall I really enjoyed the Bourne Ultimatum. It has it's share of flaws, but they're minuscule enough not to hinder the movie too much. In the end I would recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Good ending to a superb series,"Everything that has a beginning has an end. Five years after the release of The Bourne Identity Jason Bourne comes back to the screen to finish the story by coming full circle. The story of this one picks up where part two ended: Bourne is on the run, chased by the agency that trained him and several other. Bourne still wants to find out who he truly is and who made him into what he is now.Being a third part in a series means the film doesn't have to ""waste"" time on explaining new characters and their place in the story and that's why it can let itself start of the easy way - full throttle action. And it does this well. In fact, it never lets go of the throttle, it just keeps rolling on and doesn't allow itself to take a breather. The sequences used are good, high adrenalin based and building a good tension field that lasts till the very end. The storyline isn't breached too much by plot holes (only a few marginal ones really) and things done aren't too impossible which makes the film a highly enjoyable.Not the best in the series, but a very worthy closing chapter to the series. Amusing to watch once and watch again when the DVD release is done. Personally I will be waiting for a trilogy release that I assume will be coming sometime in the future - these films belong together and deserve to be watched back-to-back as one long running feature.7 out of 10 dirty little secrets",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Bourne Again: The Return of the Shaky Cam,"Jason Bourne is back in what may prove to be the final film in the Bourne Franchise. If so, what a way to go out. Unlike many of this summer's three-quels, this film delivers the goods. This is a 115 minute roller-coaster ride that barely lets up from start to finish. However, in a world of leaden imitations, this unfortunately isn't quite the 24 carat gold classic that the two previous films were. Don't get me wrong, this is still one of the best films I have seen this year and most films would kill to be this good. Unfortunately both ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (especially the latter) set the barrier so high that unfortunately this film doesn't quite measure up in comparison.First the good stuff. Matt Damon is great as usual and it is good to see that Julia Stiles is given more to do this time round. Her character especially is an appealing mix of ability and vulnerability. Whilst she doesn't get as good a scene as the one in the previous film where Bourne threatened to kill her, the hints that she may have had a relationship with Bourne that he now doesn't remember is an interesting twist and it is a shame that her character drops out of the film over halfway through. The great Joan Allen gives good support and David Strathairn makes a good replacement for Brian Cox as the man to hate. However most of the kudos should go to Paul Greengrass and his editor Christopher Rouse. Greengrass has become a great director since Universal took a chance on him to direct ""The Bourne Supremacy"". His so-called ""shaky cam"" style which has been criticised by many on this site is the reason why this film works so well. The Waterloo station scene in particular should become a masterclass study in editing (in addition, the fight scene between Bourne and the CIA ""asset"" in a small room in Tangier is a terrific piece of action editing that ought to win Christopher Rouse an Oscar if there is any justice in this world, reminiscent though it is of the fight scene between Bourne and one of his German contemporaries in the previous film - which Rouse helped to edit). Even though there are a few flaws in this film, they are down to the script and not to Paul Greengrass's direction which is arguably better here than in the previous film (he was also criminally robbed of an Oscar for ""United 93"" earlier this year - as good as ""The Departed"" was, Scorsese's Oscar was a compensation prize for his earlier work where he really should have won).So why is this film only 23½ carat gold grade? Mainly because of the script. I yield to no one in my respect and admiration of Tony Gilroy who has written a number of great films over the years aside from the Bourne films but there are a few flaws here that stick out like a sore thumb. Since other hands are involved here as well (Scott Burns and George Nolfi), I am prepared to give Gilroy the benefit of the doubt and trust he wasn't responsible (since Nolfi wrote ""Timeline"", ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""The Sentinel"", guess who my money is on). So what's the problem? Well for a start, the Simon Ross character is meant to be a security correspondent with The Guardian newspaper and yet makes the mistake of mentioning the word ""Blackbriar"" on the telephone. Surely a security correspondent at The Guardian whose job consists of studying the Security Services and their methods would be aware of the ability of the National Security Agency to harvest key words from all the telephone conversations that take place around the world. Are Guardian journalists really that stupid? (well, okay, perhaps they are) Of course, the problem for the film is that without the NSA and the CIA latching onto Ross at the start of the film, there would be no way of them finding Bourne. Another problem is the way in which Bourne happens to discover he is the subject of an article by Ross by coincidentally picking up a copy of The Guardian and reading it. Pretty unlikely (especially as Bourne hardly strikes me as the sort of person who would read The Guardian anyway) but without Bourne reading the article, he would have no reason to contact Ross and start the plot rolling. This sort of lazy writing to cut plot corners affects a film where credibility and believability are important (more so than a Bond film where you can readily suspend your disbelief given the usually fantastic nature of the plots). Also the plot timeline is a bit confusing because it follows immediately after Bourne's car chase in Moscow at the end of the last film, seemingly forgetting about the final telephone conversation between Bourne and Pamela Landy which came after that (although this is explained later on in the film, it was a bit confusing at first). My last complaint is the updated version of Extreme Ways over the closing titles. It's awful and if Moby isn't responsible, he should sue. The original version is a classic and this bastardized version is the aural equivalent of painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa (if we don't complain now, who knows what we'll get to hear next? Madonna singing the theme tune to a Bond film?)Still, small gripes for a film that still manages to beat the opposition hands down (including, dare I say it, ""Casino Royale""). Perhaps better to finish the franchise there though rather than risk ruining it with a fourth film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Shaky Cinematography ruined it,"The trend to use hand held cameras and deliberately keep the image in constant motion is a total annoyance, and the death knell of this movie. Any close up or emotional shot is so jittery, that it is practically unwatchable. Even the close up of items that the audience should read are done in 'shaky cam' mode. It's brutally bad work, overall. I do not need to be nauseated in my seat. Gawd, I miss stable tripods and smooth camera work. If this goes on, I can see why the movie industry is dropping audience support. One cannot focus on characters or story when the image is painful to the eye.

Granted, one could keep eyes closed and try to use the sound track, but if I wanted a radio show, I wouldn't waste my time in a theater.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A Terrific Third Installment that continues to Impress,","The Bourne Ultimatum is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's a very well done third Installment, which can't be easy to do, it had two films to compare itself to and managed to make itself just as good, if not better, than its predecessors, it's certainly the most intense, it's an action packed film that will keep you at the edge of your seat literally until the credits come up. The only thing I think this film is missing that is very evident in both Identity and Supremacy is slower, dialogue based scenes, Matt Damon had some great moments with Franka Potente in the first film, and plenty with Julia Stiles in the second, but this movie never really takes much time to slow down and just develop Jason Bourne's character some more, it certainly could have done with it. The highlight of the movie is of course Matt Damon who dosen't seem one bit tired of playing Jason Bourne, he is just as much dedicated here as he ever was previously, he clearly loves playing the character and does so with pure charisma, and I hope to see him portray Bourne some more in the future. An action packed thrill ride that goes by very fast, the Bourne Ultimatum is a delight and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller.A former CIA hit man suffering with amnesia joins forces with a reporter in order to uncover the truth about his past.Best Performance: Matt Damon",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

"fast pace, too fast","Excellent action movie. Pacing was great, but the use of 1990s style hand held camera to create a fake docudrama feel at the beginning was jarring. I know the director wants this to create continuity between the action scenes and slow paced dialogue, but the movie would have been better if the action was subtly highlighted by more static camera angles, I think. Damon as always is highly believable, and as usual in these huge budget action films, the supporting actors are great. There's an ensemble feel to the cast, as well there might be since there is some continuity (Stiles, Allen) with the first. The story was comfortably complex without too many twists, and the action was believable, even when they fight through the incredible amount of pain the protagonists inflict on each other.

The camera man was drunk,"A plethora of trilogies have emerged in recent years, signifying a shift in decision-making of Hollywood producers: they are abandoning risky, yet original and creative scripts for pathetic dime-a-dozen scripts and plots ... and sequels... that they are guaranteed to at least get their money back on.The ""Bourne"" trilogy is an exception to that rule in many respects because it abandons so many of the devices and plot formulas commonly found in films of this genre. First there is the gun. Go back and watch all the films and you'll find that Bourne almost never carries a gun (and interestingly gets rid of guns that he wrestles of his enemies). He's a hand-to-hand combat man and a master of creating a diversion. I like that aspect.Second is the intelligent plotting. While there are some double-crosses running through the film, they don't become the dominant focus. Some films tend to throw in 500 double crosses in the hope of creating an intelligent and powerful plot, but end up in a puzzling web of contradictions with many turns that simply don't make sense at all. Not the case with Bourne.Third is the creation of suspense without shooting or fighting. This is exemplified particularly well in Waterloo station sequence in this film - where the viewer is on the edge of their seat without one shot fired and very little hand-to-hand combat. It was all evasion and diversion which was thoroughly engaging.Finally, the inventiveness of the hero. For instance, in this film, he's pursued through Daniel's office in Madrid and all we see is him pick up a fan and a few random objects before he disappears. Is he going to pull a Magyver? build a helicopter and fly out of there? Nope - I won't spoil it, but it's that sort of subtle inventiveness that makes the actions sequences all the more intelligent.But there was a major problem i had with both Supremacy and Ultimatum: the camera work. A lot of shots, especially action sequences, were extremely confusing. No doubt that the director of photography thought he was breaking new ground with lots of hand-held, close-up camera work. But i thought that it made the action sequences difficult to follow and even in some of the CIA station scenes, they seemed to zooming in and out with hand-held cameras, but it didn't seem to lift the intensity of the scene. In fact, it simply became annoying after a while.I looked up the biography of director Paul Greengrass and found that he's a big fan of the hand-held camera shots. Well good for him! Unfortunately, it was appropriate for this film and it became too messy and irritating at times. Liman, who directed the first one, new how to vary the camera during the fight scenes to perfection. And furthermore, the first one - identity - was one of the greatest spy films of all time and certainly the best of the trilogy. The change of directors wasn't a good idea in my humble opinion.In the last two Bourne films, it looked at times like the cameraman was drunk, rather than dynamic and creative. It ruined many explosive entertaining fights and stand offs they we'd been waiting for. IT loses marks for that I'm afraid.Otherwise terrific watch and if the first one entertained, but like many others you thought the second one was OK without being anything special, i highly recommend the seeing this one. Great watch, good plot, the first half of the film is actually magnificent (but it does fall away a bit in the second half) and all round entertainment to wind up one of the best trilogy series of the last 15 years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An Outstanding sequel,"I got all of the Bourne films on DVD. Out of all of them, this is my favorite!!! Pure action, awesome stunts, and incredible chases.It stars Matt Damon, Julia Stiles, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, etc.Bourne (Matt Damon) is once again brought out of hiding, this time inadvertently by London-based reporter Simon Ross who is trying to unveil Operation Blackbriar--an upgrade to Project Treadstone--in a series of newspaper columns. Bourne sets up a meeting with Ross and realizes instantly they're being scanned. Information from the reporter stirs a new set of memories, and Bourne must finally, ultimately, uncover his dark past whilst dodging The Company's best efforts in trying to eradicate him.Identity and Supremacy were great films in the Bourne trilogy, but this movie is one of the best action movies ever, and the one of the best of 2007, next to Transformers and Live Free or Die Hard.No words to say about this movie, it's an action masterpiece.The Bourne Ultimatum gets 10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Twizard Rating: 95,"To some, shaky-cam has become synonymous with low quality. But not the way Paul Greengrass does is. The director doesn't just do shaky-cam--he masters it. Every single movement is perfected and deliberate so that during fight scenes, we still know exactly what's happening all while getting the feeling that we're involved.The pacing is pretty much perfect in the third installment of the spy-thriller series. We pick up weeks after the events of its predecessor, and Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is still trying to figure out his forgotten past. The secret CIA program which was once called Operation Treadstone is essentially the same, except operating under the name of Blackbriar.Dipping and dodging different assassins, Bourne is one step closer to finding out how he became an important piece in all this. But this time, there's more desperation. More urgency. He knows he could be dead at any moment and possibly should have been dead already. But he's not and he doesn't know how much longer he can cheat death. We feel it too. We want him to find everything out before he gets killed.It's this energy that runs all through The Bourne Ultimatum that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.Bourne's character depth doesn't really progress anywhere from the last film, but we don't really feel like it needs to. He doesn't say much, but we can read his thoughts much of the time.In the end, we're relieved, but not necessarily satisfied. There is still more to be found out. Although in the moment, we aren't aware that there will be more sequels to come. We just hope that there are.Twizard Rating: 95",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"The Bourne Ultimatum, best Bourne installment.","My favorite Bourne movie in the series. The Bourne Ultimatum was awesome, it topped all the other Bourne movies. It has so much action, more action then the other two. This was very fast-paced, I think they probably filled in all the unsolved answers from Supremacy. I hope they didn't answer all the questions because I would very much like Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon make another film. They also brought back actors like Joan Allen and Julia Stiles but they brought in David Strathairn as Noah Vosen.The plot goes as this, Bourne tries to find a journalist who continues to write stories about Bourne's past including Marie's death. He tries to track him down but the journalist was also wanted by the CIA in New York, so the CIA sees Bourne with him so Bourne is yet again tracked down by the CIA. The only reason Bourne was after the journalist because he wanted answers on who started Bourne's assassin ways. So while looking for answers he also has to deal with CIA.Now in my Supremacy blog, I said I would discuss the same conversation in both films. At the end of Supremacy there is a conversation between Bourne and Pam, this conversation also happened in the middle of Ultimatum. This conversation was the way that they were able to continue with Ultimatum. So the 1st half of Ultimatum is a quarter of material of Supremacy they wanted to use in Ultimatum instead of Supremacy. So basically the conversation is a lead into Ultimatum. I thought it was a clever move. 5 out of 5 stars again for The Bourne Ultimatum. To leave off if Paul or Damon sees this blog I hope they will listen to a die hard Jason Bourne fan to make another film because I really want to see a fourth film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

The Ultimate Action Movie,"This movie is simply explosive. The action load of this movie is off limits, recently released. The best part is the history that is phenomenal, with a foot grounded in reality. The characters are human and the scenes have visual and emotional impact. Bourne, a former agent, goes in search of answers, in a government agency, but the film has the aura of mystery to the very end. Why Bourne himself inscribed in the government program. The actors do an excellent job, the characters are interesting. But the rhythm and tension are of the highest level. Some of the best I've seen in an action movie.

Could Someone Please Stop the Room Spinning...?,"The Bourne Supremacy was a great film - plot, performances, locales, action, all good - with only one real downfall; director Paul Greengrass seemed to have never heard of a steady-cam, leading to some very iffy camera work, especially during the fight sequences.Three years on and Greengrass is still ignorant to that simple advancement in movie-making technology. Worse still, his camera-men seemed to constantly be in a state of abject terror, unable as they were to keep the camera still for more than three seconds. Worse *still*, every single over-the-shoulder shot drifted behind an actor's head so that half of the screen was obscured during conversations. It's as if, over the intervening period between Supremacy and Ultimatum, Greengrass has managed to forget what little he used to know about filming.However, The Bourne Ultimatum *is* a good film. The story is again weaker than Identity, but satisfying and intriguing nonetheless, Matt Damon's performance is rock solid, as are those of the rest of the cast, and the action seemed fantastic (what could be made of it, that is).It isn't worthy of the mass praise that's been heaped upon it and I would have liked to have seen Doug Liman stay on for the whole trilogy, but it's still a good end to a good trilogy.

Deeper moments of introspection make it a good thriller,"I was expecting a rehash of film 1 & 2- the usual international locales, car chases, fights & indestructible Bourne tries to get info. - nothing too deep, so I was pleased it exceeded my expectations.Nice to see a film where they don't throw the main stars into a romance just because they happen to be male & female! Chase & fight scenes: I found them too fast too watch/follow for my taste - but at the same time -I could respect that the speed, editing & camera work were more aimed at making you feel like you were there and how quickly it all happens (instead of a John Woo-like slo-mo so you can appreciate the grace and skill of each blow) and I did like how they incorporated ""on the spot"" improvisational fighting with whatever they could grab (book, candlestick, etc.) It made it seem much more realistic and showed the brutality of it.Mostly though I like how the film made you consider larger issues of national security, torture, assassination, civil rights, freedom and personal choice.Can the US really monitor anyone anywhere in the world that fast (through cameras, satellites, passport RFIDs, cell phone locating, monitoring all phone conversations for keywords). (We already know they're allowed do it without warrants under the current administration) Can they really just kill anyone they want anywhere? Shoot a British citizen in a train station? Are assassination and torture justified for our ""security"" or just easier? Is blind obedience and following orders worth it/ I don't want to give too much away but I enjoyed the parts that touched on personal choice and the responsibility/moral issues of killing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Such an amazing saga,"Jason Bourne doesn't deceive. Here he comes once again for the third time, trying to survive as he's still chased by his ex-employers.This third installment is as good as the two first movies. Jason Bourne is a magnet and watching him tormenting the CIA and exact his revenge for the life he lost is still exciting and masterfully shot.Matt Damon is once again amazing as Jason Bourne, this CIA assassin who wants to start over. It's no longer a quest for his past. It's about redemption for all the crimes he committed for the CIA and put down the monster by revealing its dark secrets. Which makes him the biggest threat to the CIA who is more than willing to end it definitely.So here we go again following Jason throughout the world from Moscow to New York while stopping at Paris, Amsterdam and Tanger, taking down the assassins sent after him and his allies to his final destination where everything began for him.The rest of the cast is as great as Matt Damon especially David Strathairn who plays the main villain in the movie. He's so cold blooded and despicable he's giving me chills at each of his scenes. So does Albert Finney who plays Dr Hirsch, the one who conditioned Bourne and turned him into a cold blooded killer. Those two are great additions to the cast alongside Julia Stiles and Joan Allen.Please give us more!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
As good as the previous Bourne movies,"Manny's Movie Musings: Taking place immediately after the end of ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" once again stars Matt Damon as the ex-spy whom the CIA just can't leave alone. With the information Damon received in ""Supremacy,"" he sets out for the U.S. to find out more about who he is and how he came to be the way he is. Some members of the upper management of the CIA aren't so happy with Damon being alive and actively seeking information that could bring prison time to said members of CIA upper management, so a standing order to shoot on sight is greenlit on Damon. But Damon does have two friends in the CIA, possibly giving him all the edge he needs to stay alive and finally unravel the mystery of how he came to be spy. Director Paul Greengrass ups the ante in this third ""Bourne"" movie, giving us a faster pacing, more intensity, longer action set pieces, and bigger stakes. This was a good ""end"" to the seriesif this was truly the end — we know now there were more to come. My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is Damon's fight scene with an assassin named Desh. As with previous ""Bourne"" movies, the fights are long, raw and savage, with Damon using household objects to fight and kill his opponents.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Hunting for his past memories and identity,"The movie ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007) is an action/thriller that was directed by Paul Greengrass and written by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns, and George Nolfi. The Bourne Ultimatum film is based from a 1991 novel by American Author Robert Ludlum. The film is the third part of a trilogy series so to completely understand the details of this film and what is taking place you must see the two prior movies: Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy. The main character of the film is Matt Damon as Jason Bourne who is an ex CIA agent who has lost his memory and identity and is now being sought by the CIA for an operation gone badly. David Strathairn as Noah Vosen and Joan Allen as Pam Landy are the CIA characters who are heading up the pursuit to get Jason. Their fear is that Jason will remember who he is and his knowledge of the secret operation – Treadstone. The underlying theme in this movie Jason realizes very early in the previous films, which carried over to this one, is that one must be careful things or people may not seem as they are. As one line from the movie states and showed to be very true, ""It is funny how different things look, depending on where you sit."" (The Bourne Ultimatum, 2007)The Bourne Ultimatum is a ""mind-blowing action"" (Ebert, 2007) film that takes you behind the scenes of the CIA black-op and some of their secret operations. This series picks up right where the last film left off with Jason wounded from a Russian assassin and running from the Moscow police. Paddy Considine as Simon Ross is the character of a British journalist who is investigating the secrets of Operation Treadstone and Jason's past when he is provided with lead about ""Operation Blackbriar"". So what was ""Blackbriar"" and it's significant to Jason? These simple words promote a series of intense scenes of Jason trying to figure out what this means and how to protect Simon.The camera angles in this film will put you in Jason's shoes as he is being watched and sought after, as a target of the CIA, while he is hunting for his past memories and identity. The fast pace on your seat chases provide some impressive special effects with Jason jumping from building to building, through windows while fighting off numerous guys at one time to the remarkable car chase with one scene showing him driving off the roof of a building backwards. The film then takes a shift and provides a look into the CIA headquarters in the U.S. and how they have been watching Jason the whole time through surveillance camera. The motion blurred background camera shot with Jason walking intensely towards the camera with a gun is known for one of the best effects.I highly recommend this movie along with the additional Bourne series films. I believe Robert Ebert sums up the movie the best, ""The movie is complete as itself. You sit there, and the action assaults you, and using words to re-create it would be futile. What actually happens to Jason Bourne is essentially immaterial. What matters is that something must happen, so he can run away from it or towards it.""

"it's not simply about the shaky camera that's the problem, in this tense but uneasy third Bourne film","The Bourne trilogy has amassed a huge following of fans, particularly, it would seem, for the third film. I was a big fan of the first film, and found the second one- the first from director Paul Greengrass- to also work pretty well under the circumstances of a slightly lesser story. This time, with Ultimatum, it comes as something of a slight disappointment. Certain ingredients are still there and cooking well, such as the spectacularly well choreographed chase through the rooftops and windows of the Morroccan city, leading up to a really intense fight between Bourne and an assassin. As well as this there's some other elements added, like secrets and cover-ups within the NSA and CIA and whatnot, meant to bring up the charge of more to ponder about what is really going on with Bourne's original identity. But somehow it also feels a lot of the time like it hasn't been cooked well enough emotionally, or at least with enough ingenuity between the characters.Matt Damon said recently in an interview that it was a tough and not very good experience working on the film, aside from other personal pressures in his life, because of the erratic shooting schedule and a lack of cohesive directing from Greengrass (they shot the film, much like POTC: At World's End, without a finished script). It makes some sense then to see why it's not Damon's, or Greengrass's, best work by far, even as both try to do what they can. But the problem with the latter (Damon is just much too two-dimensional, if that, as he doesn't express much more than one or more emotions until his final scene with Albert Finney) is the nature of the shooting to the material. It's not that a shaky hand-held camera is always a negative or a cause for nausea, and in fact Greengrass's own United 93, with it shot mostly in hand-held, worked perfectly with the subject matter. This time however there's a lack of consistency: having it hand-held for every scene, even if it's just a shot of characters looking at documents, becomes rote after a while as opposed to naturalistic.It doesn't detract terribly from the action sequences, since they're still as in the other films very well choreographed in that non-stop chase kind of mode such as the NY chase scenes (which near the laughable as Damon almost becomes a superhero with the amount of damage he sustains with only, at one point, slightly bruised hands after the fight). But because the material itself has its own problems, such as the sort of typical cover-up plot that unfolds (and as there's some double-back crossing with a couple of other principle characters), the style sometimes gets in the way, as if its compensation to add edginess in close-ups. Then again the shaky-hand-held is almost pleasant when compared to the flashback first-person memory scenes, which are shot mostly as if through the eyes of someone on absinthe. The end results from 'Ultimatum' aren't completely grim, but there's not really too much of the unexpected, or a fully controlled approach to elevate it, even to having two more shots (an underwater moment) that follow what could have been a really terrific final shot. Neither the best nor worst of the summer 07 blockbusters",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A perfect ending to a perfect trilogy,"Finally, I've arrived at the final movie of the original Bourne Trilogy with The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). Similar to the previous two movies, this was a first time watch for me and to say that it was a satisfying ending to this trilogy would be an understatement. The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) is one of the greatest action movies of all time.Positives for The Bourne Ultimatum (2007):
For the concluding chapter of this trilogy, this movie has everything that fans would want from a closing chapter. This movie has by far the best action sequences, the best chase sequences, the most personal stakes for the main character and the biggest payoff. Matt Damon gives easily his best performance as the character of Jason Bourne. This is the movie where the flashbacks are at their most effective in the entire series. The fight sequence between Jason Bourne and Desh Bouksani is hands down the best of the entire franchise. And of course, the answer that Jason Bourne has been searching for are satisfying and a real gut punch because youbare feeling all of the emotions from Jason Bourne as these flashbacks are being shown to us. You can truly feel the sense of closure that Jason Bourne has been searching for throughout this trilogy. And finally, I really appreciated how this movie ended with the world finding out about the shady stuff with Operation Blackbriar and the arrest of the man behind that program and I liked that it was more of a quieter ending to opposed to what you would expect from an action movie.Mixed for The Bourne Ultimatum (2007):
These aren't issues that didn't bother me, but I'm still willing to point them out. Paul Greengrass' usage of shaking cam is very nauseous to the auidence and I actually felt that throughout the runtime, but I was engaged with the story, so I'm willing to let that slip by. The final mixed aspect is that despite this movie ending the Bourne Trilogy perfectly, it's not the final Bourne movie because Universal Pictures decided to make two more movies and while I understand that there are people who want to see more Bourne Movies, I would've preferred that this movie series should've ended with this movie and let the franchise rest for a couple of years before doing another movie. Even Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass stated for years that they were done with Jason Bourne and that there was nothing left to do with this character and I definitely agree with the both of them.Overall, The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) is as perfect of an ending to a movie series gets and a phenomenal sendoff to one of the greatest movie trilogies in cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A tremendous movie. The best of Bourne.,"The super spy is Bourne.With nothing else to live for, Jason Bourne seeks the final answers to the fractured memories and ghost recollections about what was done to him.The Bourne Ultimatum is a rare third act for a film series; it isn't overblown, it doesn't contrive or skew to ""enhance"" the story outside of its themes for a bigger showdown. This is an effective conclusion that not only ties up the loose ends that our hero has been suffering, but also maintains a fantastic consistency with its previous films.Something very few third parts ever manage.Bourne Supremacy director Paul Greengrass returns to direct Matt Damon, and by 2007 the two men are well versed in what works and what doesn't. Especially for the Bourne films, and they deliver a roller-coaster urban thrill ride of action. Bouncing off the foundations of Bourne Supremacy, Ultimatum strikes it rich with its two leading ladies Julia Stiles and Joan Allen. Allen playing Pamela Landy, the only surviving official who has first hand knowledge of Bourne's skills and the only one prepared to help the situation, does an excellent job filling the sympathetic gap left by Brian Cox and making a layered character who answers much of the franchise's questions. In the antagonist role, asides from the half-dozen different super agents sent after Bourne, is David Strathairn, who doesn't rise too much farther than Chris Cooper did in Identity, but is a good fit in the role as a merciless official hunting down Bourne.The role of a total schmuck who Bourne continuously runs rings around with spectacular fashion and incredible ease, more like. The film is as enjoyable and rewarding as it is thrilling and suspenseful!We see Bourne in full super spy mode in this film, he is in control and cold as ice. There are pivotal scenes that show how Bourne has tried reconciliation, he's tried to let go of what he's done in the past but he cannot shake the memories that are resurfacing. What we get is a conclusion with Bourne on the warpath. An action movie through-and-through. The film opens with a fantastic scenario in London; where Bourne via phone is navigating someone else through a crowd to not be seen by officials. That should be really hard to film, but Greengrass nails it; you know exactly what's happening, the spaces involved and line of sight. It is followed by the chase in Morocco, a chase and fight sequence that was so incredible that it influenced the Bond franchise for a decade at least, as well as other movies in the genre. Granted there's more shaky-cam in the fight sequence again, but the steadier cinematography for the initial rooftop chase and incredible tension before that makes me go easier on it.It is a tremendous movie and ties both the moodier Identity and the white-knuckled Supremacy together and actually builds on and improves them, delivering a hugely satisfying conclusion for Bourne in the process.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Great acting, great story, shame about the direction","I love the Bourne series, books and films, and so it was with great expectations that I went to see Ultimatum, the latest in the series. Imagine my extreme disappointment when I discovered this great story had apparently been shot on a Handycam by a cameraman with a nervous twitch!! Why is it that some directors (often quite decent directors!)feel they have to resort to the very amateurish appearing ""live cam"" approach. Don't get me wrong this method has it's place, usually as a crutch for tired TV shows in an attempt to make it look as if there is more going on than there actually is, but when you have such an action packed script and great actors, like in the Bourne Ultimatum, why go there? A pet hate? perhaps, but I do find this particularly annoying during still (i.e a normal conversation around a table) or heartfelt (when an actor or actress is expressing some inner feelings) moments and the camera goes twitching and wandering off subject as if being held by a bored child desperate to go wee wee! Completely unnecessary and detrimental to this good (could have been great!) movie. Rant over. On to the movie itself; As I have already intimated the Bourne Ultimatum is an action packed romp with a great cast, some excellent understated acting and a fairly credible story to tie all the action together and could have been one of greatest action flicks of all time, a strong 9/10 - it's such a shame about the desperate direction hence only 6/10 from me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Filmed in vivid BARF-O-VISION!,"After being a huge fan of the first movie I rushed to see the second one. It was terrific despite being marred by too much hand-held camera work. I was hoping that installment #3 would keep the momentum of the plot while getting a better grip on the camera. Sadly, no. The plot pretty much evaporated and was entirely replaced with pointless action scenes which might have been exciting had they not looked like they'd been shot by a drunken epileptic. I spent over half of the movie with my hands over my eyes because the blurred and shaky images gave me extreme motion sickness. I spent a good portion of the movie plotting an exit strategy from the packed theater in case I should actually have to throw up.From listening to it, I don't think I really missed that much. Nothing terribly earth shattering was revealed in this movie and it was pretty much one scene after another of Bourne having to kick someone's butt. Normally, this would not be a problem for an action movie- I don't expect high art in this kind of film- but I do expect to SEE and ENJOY the work the actors and stunt men went to in order to film the action scenes. The camera work here is so bad that all you can really see (if your stomach can bear it) is a big blur. What a waste of great action talent! One fight scene in particular (one which ends in a shower stall)was probably choreographed wonderfully, but I guess we'll never know for sure.This was a sad and forgettable (as soon as possible preferably)end to what could have been an incredible trilogy. I recommend you skip this one and see instead ""The Shooter"" with Mark Wahlberg. It has a similar plot, lots of action and you can actually watch it without hurling.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

CIA Spoof Series Continues,"This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In reality, perhaps they are. After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film, somebody is trying to kill him.There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the film in feeling.The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A nonstop thrill ride,"POSITIVES:1) Paul Greengrass is the master of 2000s action sequences. I genuinely think the Waterloo train station sequence in this film is one of the best action scenes I've ever seen. It has everything. The best part about the film is that that sequence is only one of several outstanding action sequences
2) The film rips along at such an exhilarating pace, as well as the film being quite short anyway, so you're never bored or checking your watch
3) Joan Allen as Pamela Landy really grounds these films for me and she's always gripping whenever she's on screen
4) The Moby end credits music always makes me smileNEGATIVES:1) There is a bit of a sense of rinse and repeat here. It's yet another film where Bourne remembers something new from his past and there's a sinister old white man from the government that's trying to cover it up. The formula for all three of these films is almost identical in that regard, so it can get a bit repetitive. The whole narrative around Bourne's amnesia is the main issue for me, because it just seems so convenient and selective because whenever a new piece of exposition is needed they just show Bourne randomly remembering the exact piece of info that is relevant to the plot
2) The suspension of disbelief required here is insanely high. The way in which Bourne can effortlessly travel around wherever he wants without being stopped, despite being such a wanted man, or effortlessly hack into basically anything he wants, is just crazy at times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Good movie but terrible camera work,As a Bourne fan I could not hardly wait for the 3rd and possibly final chapter in the Bourne series. I really enjoyed the story line but thought there was a bit too much and unnecessary flash back. The most annoying thing to the entire movie was the camera work. In my opinion the camera was much too close in all of the action scenes. After about the second action scene I acquired a severe headache and became motion sick just watching and I can tell you I was not the only one with this problem. I did see a couple of people get up and leave rubbing their heads. All in all I think it was a good movie but you should get away from the action by sitting on the very last row in the theater... reddman,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

"Not all that great, actually","The Bourne Ultimatum, like the other 2 movies in the so-called trilogy, promises to be three things, and fulfilling any of the three promises would make it a satisfactory moviefulfilling all three could make it great. It promises to be a political thriller, a psychological drama, and a pure action movie. Unfortunately, the Bourne films, especially this one, fail to deliver on all three promises. The first two are obviousthe politics of the movie are way too vague to support a plot (ooooh, there are shadowy conspiracies running amok in the higher echelons of the security establishmentso original), and the Bourne character is so underdeveloped (and the amnesia plot so hackneyed) that I don't see how anyone could care about these movies as psychological dramas. That leaves action.The Bourne Ultimatum comes closest to delivering when it comes to its promise to be a good action flick. There are fight scenes, chases, explosions, near-death experiences, and tense confrontations. But I have a problem with the way the action sequences in the Ultimatum are filmed (this has been true of all three Bourne movies): the fight sequences are so fast and chaotic, that you really can't tell what's happeningyou take it on faith that Jason Bourne is kicking the bad guy's ass, and when the bad guy's on the ground when things settle down, you figure you must have been right. I guess it's kind of like the Psycho shower scene on crystal meth. And maybe that's the point. Hitchcock would have liked to have shown more actual violence, gore, bloodshed, and nudity, but he knew he could never get that kind of scene past the censors, so he got creative, and since Hitchcock was a genius, his creativity produced a murder sequence that is probably better than anything more gory and explicitly violent could have been. I have a feeling that the action sequences in Bourne have been shot and edited in this hyper-fast, frenetic style, in part, to secure the valuable PG-13 rating. After all, what's Bourne supposed to be good at? Inflicting unthinkable injuries on people in a very short time. If we really got to see this clearly, it would be gross. It would not be PG-13 fare. Plus, Matt Damon would have to know how to fight really well, or the filmmakers would have to get even more clever with stunt doubles. Instead, we get fight scenes in a blender and chase scenes shot so close that we don't know whose car we're seeing, what direction we're going in, or who's crashing into whom.OK, so, what's the problem? After all, I love Hitchcock, and I think the impressionistic shower scene was brilliant. So why do I dislike the action sequences in Bourne movies? Well, when I see an action film, I guess I've grown accustomed to seeing the action. My complaint about Batman Begins was the same: this guy trained to be a bad-ass fighter, and now whenever I see a fight scene it's too sliced up and dark for me to get a good look at him using those hard-won skills. Give me Jet Li or Michelle Yeoh...or even Bruce Willis...anydayI'm paying $10.50 for my action, so I'd like to see it please.There will be more Bourne movies. But I think I've paid to see my last one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Awesome thriller,The Bourne Ultimatum' is arguably the best of the Bourne Trilogies. The story is superbly structured where the stunts and action scenes are well co-ordinated to ensure you stay at adrenaline through out the movie. The sheer thrill of story line in which Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) finally traces his roots to David Webb is spell binding and the desperation to find out his identity brings a class to Matt Damon's performance.Superb action sequences... cool shaky camera moves.This third film in the Bourne trilogy is a relentless action stunner which doesn't let you sit back for a moment.Excellent screenplay powered with some breathtaking stunts. A winner all the way!,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Best Bourne film and one of the best action films in history...,"As much as I hate to admit it, it took a second viewing for The Bourne Ultimatum to really connect with me. Each and every second of the film had a purpose. The film truly re- defines the word 'THRILLER'.The film, in my opinion, perfected the art of perfection. The acting, the direction, the action, the thrill, the sheer sense of intrigue that is carried throughout the film, everything is just excellent. Matt Damon is at the top of his game and is more compelling than ever. Another thing that should be duly noted is the MUSIC. Now, the music of all of the Bourne films is brilliant. It is simply majestic. But this time around, it is just... magical. Right from the very first frame (The Universal Logo), the music is absolutely breathtaking. The Bourne Ultimatum defines what a smart action thriller means to me. It is PERFECT. Flawless. But most of all, The Bourne Ultimatum defines an era of terrific movies that, sadly, will never come back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Does not withstand repeated viewings,"When I first saw this, I thought it to be among the most exciting things I'd seen, however at the second viewing, it seems contrived, ridiculous and frankly annoying. Yes, there is always a great deal of suspension of disbelief in a Bourne film as in a Bond film, but this stretches it beyond breaking point. Certain things, slightly off putting the first time round become more tiresome on the second. The shaky camera work for example and the over-the-top sequences actually seem less exciting for being so unrealistic. When the film maker is not bound by the rules of physics or the basics of human anatomy literally anything is possible. So we have characters who survive impossible crashes, walking away with barely a scratch. Both Bourne and another 'asset' survive an unbelievable collision (which Bourne survives by holding the seat belt tightly!) with only Bourne having a limp to show for it.Nor does Bourne's abilities stop merely at being invulnerable. He also seems to possess vast knowledge beyond his ken such as a detailed knowledge of Waterloo station including back ways out of sweet shops, where they lead and other routes to get there. No one in these shops seems to object at someone walking through by the way. Being an 'asset' is one thing, but things like this require detailed knowledge not acute powers of observation.One of the poorest scenes, which annoyed me even on first viewing, was how Bourne gets into the highly secure CIA building and out again undetected. This was a wasted opportunity for an action sequence, made worse by a pointless phone-call which Bourne tells the CIA chief what he's doing.Another aspect is that the characters are poorly motivated. This is especially true of Nicky Parsons in this film, who oddly shows up out of nowhere them gives up her career and apparently is prepared to spend the rest of her life on the run, simply to help Bourne out. He must be one hell of a guy. We never find out what her motivation is, although possibly this will be revealed in another episode of this franchise I guess.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Action seen/scene,"The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy (duh), is lacking a bit in the story department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! Twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better.The director and star (Damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story-wise. How they got around that? The action scenes, for once, but they did another thing too, which I can't reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, than you'll notice it!

It's just an exciting ride watching all these different events take place behind our backs; im talking agents, spys, kingpins...Jason Bourne is the ultimate bad ass!

It would be so much easier if they just talked to each other.,"I think that this is my favourite of the three so far. Jason is a more established character and knowing something of his recent past from the other two helps this one move along a lot easier.I was slightly disappointed to see Pamela Landy losing some of that powerful drive that she had in ""Supremacy"", but I still think she's a great character.I think what helps with these films is that Jason is just such an awesome and cool guy. He is a badass and drives like a legend, as well as knowing loads of things and having mad skills in general (Where do I sign up, my brain could use the upgrade).
I would actually like to read the books and see how much he differs if at all, because he is a fantastic anti-hero too.I did find it a bit confusing that they brought in Albert Finney, as I'm always confusing him with Brian Cox who was killed off in the last one. It's also weird, because I can see similarities to the Wolverine story arc in the X-Men series of films, where Brian Cox played a scientist/Doctor very like Albert's, Dr Hirsch here - A man determined to succeed in his attempts at creating a super soldier to defend his country, only for the ""Asset"" to lose his memory and go on a rampage that needs to be contained and who is looking for answers and some degree of vengeance.I am uneasy about watching The Bourne Legacy next, as I haven't heard good things, but it will be interesting to see how it compares. I personally have no problems with Jeremy Renner, but I have come to enjoy Matt in this role and the great action sequences and clever processes he uses to survive.A bit like James Bond in a way?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Best camera-work since The Blair Witch Project,"I've tried, 3 times, to like these movies, but I just can't. One of the main reasons people love these movies is because Jason Bourne is a badass! And he doesn't take no for an answer! If you like Rambo/Arnold/Bond movies and don't care about story or plot holes or logistics, you'll probably love this movie (not that there's anything wrong with that). But it's so full of clichés and absurdity I couldn't help but cringe and fall asleep (literally, and I rarely fall asleep during movies, especially not action thrillers). The biggest groan from me came when Bourne looks at the blood on his hands and acts sad for all the people he's killed, in a pathetic, clichéd attempt at a three-dimensional character.Why is it so hard to get a camera man that can keep the camera from shaking for more than 2 seconds? Even when Bourne is buying a newspaper, there are 20 cuts, zooms, and shakes!The action and story takes suspension of disbelief to a whole new level. What a waste of time...The only reason it gets a star is for the scene where Bourne steals a cop car while the man who is after him distracts the police by shooting at him.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
My Favorite Movie Franchise of all Time,"A movie that I can watch dozens of times and still experience the same level of suspense, excitement and overall entertainment is what earns this 10-star rating for me.It gets me every time and does an excellent job with telling so much of the story through facial expressions and no words.

Disappointing,"You know how you watch something, and it's great and innovative and creative and you think that everything associated with it must be just as good, even if realistically it couldn't be? That's how it is with Bourne Identity.I first watched it when it came out, and all the other movies, and because if you take a break for years, each one is just as good, because the first is amazing.But it isn't true.This movie is bad. Not just bad, that would have been forgivable - it's awful. It retcons everything we knew so far, it piles on characters from nothing that were never meant to exist. It takes a simple story and balloons it into a parody. You watch it and you think 'but why? Why complicate? Why rewrite? Why invent? It makes no sense'.If you're a fan of Identity, don't watch this. Or if you're very curious, don't watch one movie after the other, have a couple of years break, that way this thing will look better than it is.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One of the best action/thrillers to come out in a long time...,"Jason Bourne has returned to the big screen for the ending of the successful Bourne Trilogyor is it the endmaybe I shouldn't use the word 'trilogy'. It is the so-called end and the filmmakers bring a large measure of closure to everything, but still leaving it open for a sequel. I mean who are we kidding, this is Hollywood. AnywayThe Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best action thrillers to come out in years. It does not disappoint and maintains the level of originality the other two. Director Paul Greengrass (United 93, Bourne Supremacy) assembles the film with a masterful craftsmanship, and builds the chase/action scenes with an almost Hitchcockian suspense. He effectively uses his signature ""shaky camera"" shots, but only to portray the utter chaos the characters are going through. The story follows Bourne on a quest for answers that spans the globe, staring in Russia and ending in New York. Matt Damon plays Bourne again, terrifyingly calm as always, but this time a little more hardened from the death of his girlfriend in the second film. The supporting cast all do superb jobs, especially Julia Stiles who has a bigger role. Veteran actor Albert Finney joins the cast and despite his small amount of screen time makes a big impression as the lead doctor of the Treadstone program. Joan Allen is wonderful again as Pamela Landey the operations director from the second one. John Powell's produces another wonderful score containing traces of the main themes. It compliments the suspense building scenes so well I can not imagine what it would be like without it. Overall an amazingly crafted thriller, and seriously one of the best in yearsyes years. My only complaint was that I wished towards the end when you find out all the answers of Jason's past through flashback, I wanted to see more about his past. But it is a small complaint compared with the rest of the film. It ends the, okay I am going to use it, Trilogy very well and left me quite satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"The best of the 'three's' this summer, and the best Bourne movie yet","The Bourne Ultimatum packs a punch - to say it in as few words as possible.Picking up right where its predecessor left off, we once again find ourselves following the story of Jason Bourne, a former government trained killing machine who, suffering from amnesia, is on a mission to discover his past - specifically, what led him to become what he is. Little time is wasted until we see Bourne's supreme display of combat abilities taking down his enemies effortlessly. The combination of a progressive story line and intense action sequences succeed in tying loose ends together - and leaving more to be desired.Matt Damon's performance is excellent once again.I personally was never really a fan of the Bourne series. But I can say confidently that that is no longer the case. The Bourne Ultimatum is hands down the best movie of 2007.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Why film it this way?,"Just saw the third chapter of the 'Bourne' franchise and I must say I was disappointed. Paul Greengrass needs to understand that the use of the Steadycam worked very well in United 93, a hypothetical documentary (I refrain from calling it a mock-umentary), it's use is NOT optimal with this subject. The action scenes are way to shaky, even the excessive close-ups are shaky. I noted this same problem when he directed the 2nd film of this series. This is an ACTION picture, I need to be able to make out what action is happening, not just that action is happening. The first director, Doug Liman, did a far better job of filming action scenes. In addition to that, there are a number of plot issues that I'll not outline in detail, but are notable enough for me to go ""What? they're just now figuring out she lied?"" or ""How did he get in there?"" Also, are supposed to have any character depth? Aside from Bourne having some flashbacks, where we mostly see the top of Jason's head, no one has or shows much emotion. There is some possible spots where some humanity could show, but we never get there. So, if the focus is supposed to be ""Who Am I...Really?"" and we are supposed to care, then this isn't that film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Fitting End,"This summer is a series of trilogies for Matt Damon. After the dismal and regurgitated ""Ocean's 13"" that came out a few weeks ago as a weak attempt to squeeze one last drip from the cash-cow that had lost all of its glory before the end credits of the second one; I wondered what the assumed end of the Bourne series would have in store.I caught the film earlier this afternoon at a CinePlex with high expectations. Overall, it was worth the money and a good, if different, finale to the Bourne saga that has gone through two directors, numerous stunts, and thousands of hand-held cameras on its way to becoming the definitive contemporary ""spy film franchise."" From the opening-scene, where we get a glimpse of a still-on-the-run Jason Bourne avoiding capture yet again, its clear that the production is telling us that this is a very different film from the previous two. And it is.""The Bourne Ultimatum"" continues to explore the titular character, an amnesiac assassin who knows nothing about why so many people want to silence him concerning secrets that he isn't even aware of. While the first film focused on discovering WHAT Jason Bourne is, and the second presents the question of WHO he is, this one is definitely about HOW Jason Bourne is what he is.**************** The plot revolves around a new version of the Black Ops. assassination-program that Bourne was involved in prior to the first film, now dubbed ""Black Briar."" When a journalist bites off more than he can chew while searching for the cause of so much damage over the past two prequels and ends up forcing the masterminds behind the operation to eliminate anyone that can compromise the mission, they target the one surviving Treadstone agent, Jason Bourne.What follows is, on the surface, a basic rehash of the first two films. Governments agents desperately strive to trap an unstoppable, highly-trained professional agent while the secrets he uncovers actually force some of those pursuing him to wonder what the purpose of their targeting him truly is. Although, thankfully, this is only in the peripheral as the plot charges forward at a neck-breaking pace. And enough of the plot from the other movies is alluded to or even stated that it makes the film accessible to those unfamiliar with those before it.The action sequences are honestly few and far between but, when they do occur, are exhilarating. This is because the director has made the wise decision to distance the film from non-stop action and instead chooses to focus on suspense and thrills in its place for the majority of the film. Because of this, I can honestly say that the film keeps you not only glued to your seat, but breathlessly so.As Matt Damon has said in interviews, he is retiring himself from the franchise after this one - and its clear that he is obviously struggling to find depth in the character anymore. He still puts up a strong and honest effort, though its noticeably difficult to maintain interest in a character who exists only as a force of nature on a quest to discover his past - made even less interesting by the fact that he is now after the only piece of the Jason Bourne puzzle that has yet to be uncovered. The supporting cast, while effective, are more or less simply there as either ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" when everything is said and done.When we eventually do get to the bottom of the last three films, roughly around ten minutes before the end credits; its interesting, but somewhat disappointing. All the hidden secret reveals are the fundamental things that we were led to assume in the first film. Nothing more, nothing less - buts its all about the ride in this movie and not so much the destination, so most can be forgiven.Overall, despite some of the obvious complaints that are a given when finishing a series such as this, it is a fitting end. In tone with the previous entries to the series, we are taken on a fast and furious ride that never lets up, until it eventually does for the final time and reminds us that the mystery has been solved. And, in keeping with its theme, we realize that all of the answers aren't handed to us on a silver platter, but offered as something to think about and make your own conclusions.Its also interesting to note that the film ends in a very similar fashion to the opening of the first film; taking us full-circle. Its been a great ride.This film is definitely worth the price of admission and much more. Worth a look even for the novice fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
This is truelly one of the best trilogies released in my lifetime... from 1991- ????,"I gave this film 'The Bourne Ultimatum' a full rating because it is truelly one of, if not the best action trilogy; that has been released in the cinema in my lifetime; for a number of reasons. I was surprised that this film was produced by someone as rich as Frank Marshall, because the camera effects are what made this film believable. 1. point:- For most of the film a hand-cam was used, creating a realistic effect. 2. The music was used astonishingly well, stopping and start depending on the tension, tempo or action. 3. This film lacked nothing, it had psychological, personal, tonnes of action and most definitely matched up to 'The Bounre Identity' and 'The Bourne Supremacy; which rarely do the Trilogies manage.Matt Damon plays the role off Jason Bourne astonishingly well, I strongly feel they really don't need a fourth film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Why did you pick me?,"The Bourne Ultimatum picks up where the previous installment, The Bourne Supremacy, left off, with Bourne on the run and trying to unravel the mystery of his past. The story is fast-paced and intense, filled with adrenaline-pumping chase sequences, hand-to-hand combat, and thrilling espionage maneuvers. The action sequences are choreographed to perfection, and the use of practical effects and stunts adds a gritty and realistic feel to the film.One of the standout aspects of The Bourne Ultimatum is Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne. Damon brings depth and complexity to the character, portraying him as a skilled and determined operative haunted by his past actions. His performance is both physical and emotional, capturing Bourne's internal struggle and the physical toll of his relentless pursuit of the truth.The supporting cast also delivers strong performances. Joan Allen reprises her role as CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy, who is torn between her duty to capture Bourne and her growing suspicions about the agency's actions. Albert Finney shines as Dr. Albert Hirsch, a key figure from Bourne's past, adding depth to the story and creating an additional layer of intrigue.The film's screenplay, written by Tony Gilroy, is intelligent and well-crafted, weaving together a complex narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The dialogue is sharp and the plot twists and turns are executed with precision, creating a sense of suspense and mystery throughout the film. The film also delves deeper into Bourne's backstory and the conspiracy surrounding his past, providing satisfying answers to long-held questions while leaving room for interpretation and speculation.In addition to its thrilling action and engaging story, The Bourne Ultimatum also boasts impressive technical elements. The film's cinematography, helmed by Oliver Wood, is gritty and visceral, using handheld cameras and quick cuts to create a sense of immediacy and urgency. The film's sound design and editing are also top-notch, enhancing the tension and impact of the action sequences.Despite its many strengths, The Bourne Ultimatum does have some minor flaws. The film's complex plot may be confusing for viewers who are not familiar with the previous installments in the series, and the fast-paced editing style may be jarring for some. Additionally, some of the characters' motivations and actions may feel contrived or overly convenient at times, but these issues do not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the film.In conclusion, The Bourne Ultimatum is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the Bourne trilogy. It features outstanding performances, heart-pounding action, and a compelling story that keeps audiences engaged from start to finish. Fans of the previous Bourne films, as well as those who appreciate well-crafted action thrillers with a touch of mystery and espionage, are sure to enjoy The Bourne Ultimatum.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"This film is tripe. Tries too hard.  A bore from beginning to end.  Hopefully, young Bourne will be killed off before we have to endure yet another sequel.","As I said: ""Tripe"". I cannot fault the acting; Damon looks very convincingly like he doesn't have a clue what is going on and he seems as harmless as a mouse. A big disappointment as a film. Give me Hellen Mirren in ""Prime Suspect"" any day.The whole premise of this film is almost risible. As if Bourne was any real threat. He's an operative who must be liquidated. BUT, what a lot of fuss! This is Hollywood going out of its way to try and make spies and spying sexy. It's nothing of the kind from what I've learned. Much ado about nothing as far as I'm concerned. I may get raked over the coals for my crit, but I hope someone sees this film for what it is, nothing but high-energy fluff.Hugh Corston",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The vision,"This was for me an improvement over the second at least in the sense that we finally ask how much Bourne was himself culpable of.The idea of opposing wits is thus brought to its conclusion. On one hand you have the CIA operatives with their screens, eyes, wires, satellite imagery and systems essentially guiding a film. In it is of course Bourne attempting to wrestle control of that narrative from the inside as means of finding self. Oh he is as usual an action hero, adept fighter and shooter when the moment requires it, but his exceptional skill is a superb cognitive clarity.So we have the film in similarly lightning-speed perceptions of things that we have to surf if we want to come out on top of the story and not lost in the whirl and this opens up an interesting and more broadly cinematic dimension of the work.The thing I feel is worth scrutinizing most closely here is the vision itself. Now I don't doubt viewer claims of nausea and what not, the film is a relentless barrage of impressions, but let's not discard the whole right away.Visual cognition is as much as the body something that you can train and cultivate, it can be stolid or agile. In related jargon there's something called constancy, it refers to the ability to stay tethered to a sense. I may be able to maintain e.g. a constancy of time, an inner sense of its passage. Okay, fun experiment time on how this appears in an awareness of space, look out from the window of a speeding vehicle, does the moving landscape 'drag back' your sight or do you maintain stability? In yoga there are exercises where you have to balance on one leg, do it right now and you'll see it's much easier with eyes open. With eyes closed I can no longer 'lean against' my visual field for balance, there being able to balance involves - surprise - finding my bearings from inside, embodying.So what happens in film is that I lean on the images, actively attempting to see and center. In a static or slow tracking shot my eyes have room to traverse the image, picking my paths and points of rest. The fundamental difference with a film like this is that it has been designed with the paths already 'seen', in other words the camera is the eye and the image is 'seeing'. Confusion arises when you try to re- orient each time, of course it's going to be exhausting. So if you relax in your own self the film does all the seeing. It's not only perfectly intelligible, you begin to notice some pretty great rapid-eye craft. So a different kind of art that assumes you are the body and wholly trust the 'seeing' to be done for you.Surprise, this doesn't come from the American visual tradition which focused on clarity in ordered space, cultivated in the western. It were the Soviets who first dismantled the continuity of perceptions and world and constructed the latter solely in the eye, the Soviets in the brief time before Stalin had them essentially film westerns. It was their way of asserting that reality was no fixed stage but a space you could construct to have psychology, the only intelligent interpretation of Marxism I know.Here it becomes about the uncertainty of perceptions, the inability to reach out to a stable world and balance as a broader anxiety about the extents of certainty. So a film about manipulable and constructed reality and seeing where all the seeing is constructed for you and to disorient.Unless if, like Bourne, you surf on the visual debris, in which case the film reveals itself to have only physical extremes to offer. Indicative for me that the filmmakers were clueless of the potential is that here we have a film where the eye supplies the space and scenes of memory are boxed separately.So for me this is only fruitful as gymnastics of perception, it's otherwise mechanic. But ride it just the same, train the eye in the new spacetime, our whole visual imagination is headed in that direction. There will of course good and bad films in this mode, the point is to be able to navigate them as freely as before. Hollywood will tend to push it to loud extremes like here, but just imagine the possibilities for a while.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Best out of the three films,"The Bourne Ultumatum is a fitting conclusion to the Jason Bourne Series. The film has Jason trying to finally the solve the mystery behind his past with Trendstone and how it all began. Joan Allen is given a much larger role as Pamela Landy, who knows that the CIA betrayed Jason and helps him discover clues to his past. Another returning cast member is Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons who is sadly underused in the film, but Julia does the best that she can with the limited on screen time and material that is given to her. Nicky also on the run with Jason from a group called Blackbriar which suppose to be a more advanced version of Trendstone with the most elite assassins in the field.

"The best threquel of summer 2007, hands down!","I simply loved it.I liked the first and second Bourne movies, but I can't say I was a big fan; but I really loved this one.

The Best of All,"I decided to have a Bourne-a-thon. I had never seen these movies. I absolutely loved the first one, like the second. This one puts the pieces together. The psychology implications of Bourne's training are hinted at in the first two movies. The beauty of this is that everything is kept so tight and so tense. I think that a really good adventure film relies on villains that are more complex than one dimensional. The failings of the bad guys and their monomania are at the center of this. Because of their overreaching, they make themselves vulnerable. Bourne has been trained well because he never makes a move without a reason. That doesn't mean that his ignorance of his past doesn't get him in trouble. There are a couple times when common sense would have won out. But weight that against the odds. He also picks some honorable allies now. It had to happen. The last half hour of this film is vintage. It works on the mind and pops up one surprise after another.

Bourne is definitely the new Bond!,"Geez... I just saw this movie last night, and it's been a long, LONG while since I've been totally griped by a film for 2 ('ish) hours.From the get go this movie is in overdrive. But don't worry It's far from your usual mindless romp of an action movie. It's intelligent, sharp, efficient, and the way it has a docu-dramatized feel to it, makes it gritty and believable.I saw the first film, long, long ago and I thought it was a kool movie. I didn't actually get around to see the second one, but from what I hear, Ultimatum appears to be the best out of the three and believe me, this could well be the best film of 2007.Matt Damon is excellent as the lead and I'm sure the obvious comparisons between him and the new Bond man (Daniel Craig) will continue to be made. In my opinion, both actors play the role of new, contemporary gritty, tough guy well. But to me, Matt has the edge. I suppose it's his (slightly) younger age. And the obvious lack of those legendary Bond clichés of suave women, megalomaniacs, and the deeply entrenched upper class echelons of the British MI6 and of course those ridiculous gadgets (I mean, that ""invisible"" car in Die Another Day, was just plain nuts).No Matt Damon is like a slimmed down, ""pure"" version of contemporary Bond.Asides from the power and energy of Matt however, don't be fooled into thinking that means the rest of the films' characters are weak. Far from it. I'll admit there isn't much of a Human touch in the film, as signified by the cold, professional divide between the characters, especially between Bourne and his female sidekick played by Julia Stiles (but to be honest, I think Stiles was probably DEAD in this film anyway, so perhaps sparking ANY relationship with her character was a non-starter!). Sure, there was the odd crack and fragility in Bourne, but this is a gritty film It feels ""real"". And as we know, in the real world, people usually are quite cold and distant, especially in this day and age.No The other characters were great and all complemented the film well. From the deadly, terminator like assassins assigned to take Bourne out, to the shadowy scheming CIA special operatives planning strategies and tactics in front of an array satellite feeds and virtual computer screens.The War, if indeed there is a war between Bourne and Bond, is far from over. The new Bond is definitely going in the right direction in comparison to its predecessors. Dare I say, Bond is becoming more ""Bourne"" like, so it remains to be seen who wins out in the end.Casino Royale was good. Definitely the best Bond film to come out in a long, LONG time. But given the open-ended ending of Ultimatum, its creators may well be planning to take Bond on and believe me, they've fired a pretty damaging salvo into the Bond franchise with this one.Bourne IS the new Bond!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Too many cuts/edits during fights,It's hard to watch some of the action/fights because they are so choppily edited together and cut so many times.

Bourne again.,"Firmly blowing my theory that there's never been a good trilogy as the third in any franchise is never as good as its predecessors (e.g. Godfather, Back to the Future, Matrix, Star Wars etc (and before you start I'm not including the likes of The Lord of the Rings as I see that as a whole)) this Greengrass directed final instalment in the Bourne series is a top notch thriller. Starting off exactly where the second one ends Matt Damon reprise his role as the amnesia suffering super spy and it is business as usual as he runs from the C.I.A. always trying to find the answer to who he is and why he's a expertly trained killing machine. As with Greengrass's other work Bourne Supremacy and United 93 the camera work is stunning, it's claustrophobic and always feels very real which in a film like this just adds to the tension and urgency. Although not a huge fan of Damon you cant take it away from him that he was born (excuse the pun) to play this part and in doing so has opened up many a pub based conversation on which JB would win in a fight, Jack Bauer, James Bond or Jason Bourne and on the evidence of the rooftop chase and subsequent close quarter hand to hand fight about halfway through this movie I'd put my money on Bourne. As superbly directed as it is I feel I have to extend a nod to the editor because half of the films appeal is in the way it is cut together, so as much as this is Greengrass's film it equally belongs to Christopher Rouse and together they are a brilliant team. Set all over the world from Russia to Britain and wrapping up with a spectacular car chase through New York it is edge of your seat stuff as you hurtle closer to Bourne's actual identity and the dramatic conclusion to what started with the first film. There's also a neat little trick that brings them full circle which you'll get when you see it. At just under two hours this is a blockbuster that actually delivers and will undoubtedly be the hit of the summer and rightly so. All I need to know now is where do I sign up to be a spy?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne Ultimatum,"I got off to a bit of a bad start with this third instalment - the idea that a bloke in a building in Langley was issuing orders to murder a British journalist in a London railway station used by almost 100 million people a year really didn't sit at all well with me; so I already felt that whatever our hero wanted to do here was OK by me! Just as well, because Matt Damon has his hands full trying to stay alive and to discover the nature of the upgraded ""Treadstone"" operation - this time called ""Blackbriar"" which may well shed more light on just how ""Bourne' became who he is! Again, Paul Greengrass elicits the best from his star - ably complemented by Joan Allen, again as ""Landy""; David Straithairn as his ruthless pursuer ""Noah Vosen"" and Edgar Ramirez (""Paz"") who is never far from his tail/trail. It features more end-to-end action - again, though, not gratuitously long and violent like many others I've seen and although the script is not so good in this one , it remains of the few franchises where the third film is up there with the others. I think it's done now, though - let's not have any more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Great Potential - Great Cast - Poor Directing,"This movie has everything except good directing. Paul Greengrass, the director, mistakes (lots of) camera motion for action. He turned a great concept - the third in a series, with great actors, into a blurry, stomach-sickening, not-so-thrilling, roller-coaster ride. It is as if he did not trust his excellent cast to act and preferred instead to have the camera operators create the action - often during scenes that begged for a still camera.This is really a shame, it reduced a potentially great movie into an OK film, but it succeeds marginally despite the direction and camera work, certainly not because of it. He is lucky that lots of kids like the motion or this film would not have been a success at the box office. If Greengrass continues down this road, I predict he will find early retirement on his agenda.Watch it on a small screen if you are subject to motion sickness.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Greengrass is now established as one of the world's finest and most important directors,"Jason Bourne has single-handedly outrun hundreds of policemen, killed tens of assassins and changed the nature of the spy thriller. It is a simple fact that if ""The Bourne Identity"" had not been made then ""Casino Royale would not have been made, and the latter was hailed as a great reinvention of the Bond franchise and raised the bar for ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", released the following summer. This was just a little bit more pressure on the team behind the Bourne films as they had to take the twisted plot from the first two movies and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion for the enormous number of fans across the world and provide a tense and satisfying spy thriller.In a summer of deeply disappointing ""threequels"", ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" reigns supreme. Thanks, largely, to the work of director Paul Greengrass, the films holds the audience from the first frame to the last although, as always, there has to be a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, (but surely that is what the cinema allows you to do?). Every action scene is gripping and adrenaline pumping. Whether it's a game of cat and mouse at Waterloo station or a chase on the rooftops of Tangiers or a relentless car chase through the streets of New York, the film never drops the baton and it is completely fulfilling. Matt Damon, who has shown his range and ability in recent years, especially with Scorsese's ""The Departed"", delivers his best performance to date and is electric on screen. He is ably assisted by David Strathairn, Julia Stiles (who gives her best performance of the series), Joan Allen, Albert Finney and Paddy Considine who hold the film together completely and together make one of the best ensembles of the year so far.Having gained an Oscar nomination for his direction of ""United 93"", in my opinion the best film of 2006, Greengrass has now, with the addition of ""Ultimatum"", established himself as one of the world's finest and most important film directors working today. In this film he continues with the hand-held camera style that made his 9/11 drama so effective but he is also a storyteller and is not afraid of moments of stillness. He delves into his characters minds with silence or a stare and creates intrigue seemingly effortlessly. But this is also a political film and subtleties, and not-too-subtleties, lie under the frenetic game of international tag, making their presence known but not enveloping the film. Greengrass controls his film well providing the perfect cocktail to produce a gripping film with brains and this will surely ensure that his name is thrown into the ring come Oscar time, though it will be surprising if the Academy vote for him or his film in enough numbers to get nominations, let alone victories.Powerful, tense, gripping, this film has put some quality into what has been a very bleak summer and has once again raised the bar for Bond. Greengrass has established himself as a top director and Damon as a top actor and this film is certainly one of the best of the year, though it is doubtful whether it will gain the awards it deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"A Breathless, Intelligent, Finely Honed Part 3 of the Bourne Series","Paul Greengrass has stepped into the director's shoes for this third installment of the Jason Bourne identity crisis and in doing so has created nearly two hours of tension that would make Robert Ludlum proud! This is an example of how Hollywood can shine when it integrates all of the components of an 'action suspense thriller' by capitalizing on finding the best contributors available - actors, producers, cameramen, stunt men, script (Tony Gilroy, George Nolfi and Scott Z. Burns), composer of music (John Powell), editors - everyone of the hundreds required to pull off this superlative film. It is as fine as any thriller can be and reflects the intensity of concentration and understatement and respect for the viewers' intellect that crowned his excellent UNITED 93 and THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. The result is a polished movie that remains compelling form the opening frame to the final credits.For those who have read or watched Ludlum's Bourne trilogy the story line is at core very simple: Jason Bourne has lost his memory and struggles through terrifying confrontations with all governments and potential assassins, endures relentless chases, and defies the machinations of the world's intelligence sources to discover his true identity. The rest of the novels and films are the how.Matt Damon has come into his own as an electrifying screen presence as Jason Bourne: his acting is keen and his ability to hold our concern through impossible situations would be difficult to duplicate by other actors of this genre. The supporting cast includes such superb actors as Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, Paddy Considine, Daniel Brühl, Joey Ansah and a very large cast of others. The pacing and use of Intelligence techniques is extraordinary and is beautifully captured by the cinematography of DP Oliver Wood and finessed by the editing of Christopher Rouse.One aspect of this film that is the most frightening is to observe just how invasive the Intelligence portions of our government can be: there seemingly are no secrets about even the most personal aspects of our lives that cannot be flashed on multiscreens in the war room of the CIA and associated organizations. Perhaps this film will be a red flag to alert public attention as to how our right to privacy has been so visibly raped by the government in the name of security - a factor that makes watching this excellent movie even more terrifying!

"Despite Solid Action, This Finale Offers No Comparison to its Predecessors","I've read that the producers responsible for this series had never intended to make a third film, but faced with mounting pressure from the studio, they chose to invent a few excuses to get their amnesiac action hero back under fire. That's certainly evident in Ultimatum's story, which does have its moments but never really shakes the feeling that it's just another adventure for Bourne and not an integral part of the arching primary storyline. I had trouble investing in the hunt for the new government goons after Supremacy effectively wiped out the last remaining string pullers of any circumstance, and it's never adequately explained what interest the new goons have in capturing, hunting or killing Jason. Julia Styles is positively crammed into the same wide-eyed, good looking field liability that Franka Potente played in the first film, but doesn't have the same kind of connection with Matt Damon that made the original relationship work so well. Ultimately, the enhanced role granted to her character feels like an unnecessary step backwards. The action is still good, though, with a rooftop parkour chase through Tangiers being the highlight and another high-speed street chase that does its best to mimic the successes of the previous one (even ending in, basically, the exact same manner). However, the abundance of hand held shots this time around are way over the top. Rather than relegating the technique to the action scenes, where it makes the most sense, this time around we get the shaky treatment everywhere from baggage check at the airport to a sit-down conference in the pentagon. I still enjoyed Ultimatum for what it was - it's a high speed thrill ride - but one that pales in comparison to what came before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Greengrass does it again!,"Paul Greengrass once more paints a vivid moving canvas in The Bourne Ultimatum, an excellent follow-up to United 93 and The Bourne Supremacy. It is my contention that there is none better at choreographing and implementing complex and exciting camera movements and sequences. Rouse's editing is fast paced and spot-on, using point of focus and movement to draw the eye precisely where it needs to go.Greengrass' visceral visual style added to a solid story and a character that the audience can't help to root for every step of the way makes for a roller-coaster thrill ride - I found myself nearly constantly gripping my plush theater seat, laughing out loud and cheering for Bourne at each of his successes. There were more ""YES!"" moments in this film even than the last, which was icing on the cake of a phenomenal action film. Again, there is simply none better than the Bourne franchise, Rouse, Damon, and of course, the puppet-master himself, Paul Greengrass. My hat goes off to you sir.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The action genre at its finest,"One may have anticipated a drop in quality upon the release of Paul Greengrass' trilogy-capper The Bourne Ultimatum back in 2007. After all, the first two movies made no real effort to cover up the fact that they are ultimately the same movie, and Ultimatum is no different, again sending Matt Damon's haggard, amnesiac super agent on the run from serious-looking CIA agents and emotionless ""assets"" across a variety of countries at breakneck speed. However, the Bourne trilogy does what trilogies rarely do and gets progressively better which each movie, and this third instalment has learned from the franchise's previous mistakes.Greengrass goes for all-out action here, barely stopping to catch its breath as the film squeezes tension out of the most ordinary of places and situations, and delivering set-pieces that dwarf anything that came before. There's no doubting that Bourne will make it out of this film alive, and no matter how dire the situations the superhuman find himself in as shady CIA heads Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) and the returning Pam Landy (Joan Allen) track him down using every conceivable piece of spy equipment at their disposal, you know he will somehow find a way to smash his way out. What makes Ultimatum so miraculous is how Greengrass manages to still keep things grounded, whether it's watching Bourne pummel an assassin with a leather-bound book or causing carnage on the streets of New York.When it does pause for breath, Greengrass thankfully seems eager to wrap up the story of how Bourne came to be the unstoppable badass he is, and uncover the organisation known as Treadstone, the secret agency that have been hunting him down ever since he was picked up by a fishing boat with bullet holes in his back. It's a revelation without any revelations, as anyone with half a brain could fit the puzzle together from the events of the previous films, so the film doesn't spend too much time dwelling on it, cutting straight to the chase when the voice plaguing Bourne's dreams manifests itself in the form of Albert Finney.Of the plot, there is little to write about. Bourne tracks down journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), who has taken to writing pieces on the former agent's exploits and a program known as Blackbriar. Bourne's presence naturally attracts the attention of Vosen et al, and the rest you can guess. It's the simplest of McGuffin's, one that exists for the sole purpose of transporting Bourne around the globe and assaulting the senses with exhilarating action, and the experience is all the better for it. Damon is so good here that he doesn't need much dialogue to create a credible and sympathetic hero, as he manages to capture the spirit of Jason Bourne with his fists and looks of panic more than words ever could. While you may still need a barf bag on hand during some of the more frantic moments, The Bourne Ultimatum is an example of the action genre at its finest, one that will leave you scratching your head as to why the studio felt the need to add the Jeremy Renner-starring spin-off and the recent fourth instalment, Jason Bourne, to the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

What Bourne Ultimatum is Really All About,"It's joyfully obvious to everyone that this is a great and entertaining movie. You don't need to read another gushing rave review; there's no shortage of those here.What makes ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" more than just another action/adventure/spy movie with elements of comic book super-heroism; is that ""Bourne"" is actually quite effective as cutting edge political satire.The way it subversively/viscerally exposes the morally, ethically and spiritually compromised hypocritical nature of policies like the global invasion of privacy, rendition, torture, dehumanizing/identity raping conditioning (a la The Manchurian Candidate ;-), state sanctioned murder/assassination (and all manner of just plain old evil) speaks volumes about what has been happening for a long time and is still happening now. The denials of involvement from high level officials remain as implausible as ever.It really should be common sense/ethics 101 that two wrongs don't make a right, that the ends don't justify the means, that the cover up ends up being worse than the crime, that being more evil/ruthless than your evil/ruthless enemies actually means you've already lost your soul, that power corrupts etc etc etc.This masterpiece works on the mundane level of Hollywood blockbuster entertainment, yet (mostly) avoids the trite cotton candy realms of cliché.The Bourne Ultimatum is as good as Hollywood gets. Food for the thrill seeking child in all of us as it also feeds a quest for the meaning/manifestation of human Spirit!My prediction: Three Oscars...at least!!!As to the question of a sequel; I say yes.Without giving anything away I can say that the movie leaves lots of room for a Re-Bourne.

The thing that really got me hooked into the movie was the fact that the villains were just as good as Bourne. In a genre where the protagonist is usually unrealistically better than his enemies, The Bourne Ultimatum gives us a situation where he is not safe at any time and where his enemies constantly find out where he is and what he is doing.

The film does reveal more backstory to the characters and I still enjoyed the great soundtrack and editing it just had at times that sense of having been there before. The movie does has some other great moments though such as one scene set in London and another great moment which cleverly subverts our expectations in a way that was very meaningful. This was probably the right moment to stop, making the 4th movie just wasn't necessary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The best action-thriller franchise since the 60's and 70's,"It is fairly simple to put a finger on just what makes this movie in particular and the Bourne trilogy as a whole such superior action films. Just compare The Bourne Ultimatum to another summer action-vigilante extravaganza, Live Free or Die Hard. While the filmmakers clearly had a blast making the latter film, it must be taken with a grain of salt and requires quite a lot of suspension of disbelief. And indeed, most of the stunts, action scenes, concepts and characters in that film are so incredibly unbelievable they are borderline parody. But the Bourne movies have this relentless knack of keeping it real  real-world settings, great attention to detail and protocol, on-set action and car chases, and just an overall realistic and totally believable feel to them. Indeed, it is this ultra-realistic, totally believable aspect and tone that makes me appreciate the Bourne series far more than other spy franchises such as Mission: Impossible, Jack Ryan, and, dare I say it  James Bond.But that's not all that makes the Bourne films unique and sets them apart from most of the other movies in its genre. In most action-adventure films, the sides are very clear and present: The main character is the hero and operates solely for the side of good, while the villains are also clearly outlined. But in the Bourne films, these relations are far less black-and-white. Jason Bourne himself is clearly the protagonist, but obviously doesn't operate for the ""greater good"". He's on a personal crusade, seeking revenge and information, and on the way, breaks all sorts of laws and rules and kills whoever stands in his path. On the other hand, all the various CIA operatives working to catch him, it could be said, are just doing their job. We don't have any super villain masterminds; we just have a bunch of men and women doing their job trying to catch someone who clearly is dangerous and a threat. It is these ambivalent and conflicting motives of the films' characters that make them such a treat to watch.Specifically on Ultimatum, Paul Greengrass and all the technical crew do a stellar job of creating the Bourne world and relaying the realism and believability of the story. Greengrass again utilizes his hyper-realistic documentary style of film-making that featured in all his previous films, most recently United 93. It's disorienting and confusing, but the style serves the film's purposes perfectly. It is also absolutely wonderful to see an action-thriller movie that prominently features on-set, practical stunts and effects, as opposed to using lots of CGI to tweak up the action and to make things easier. And what action sequences this film has! From the first scene Bourne grabs you, and we the audience literally run through the movie right along with him. It's just fascinating to see how Bourne's mind works; how he thinks on the spot, always sees the broader picture, and of course does his fair share of close hand-to-hand combat  those scenes in particular are breathtakingly well choreographed. It is also worth mentioning the insane chase sequences, both on foot and in vehicle, and I'm particularly glad that the film's advertising didn't give too much away of the film's grand finale car chase, which is one of the most thrilling and outstanding action sequences I've seen lately.One can't review this film without mentioning the cast. In all of its installments the Bourne series was blessed with some fantastic supporting character talent  in the first film we had Chris Cooper and Brian Cox both deliver outstanding work. The Bourne Supremacy added the unexpected but more-than-welcome casting of Joan Allen, one of the most underrated actresses working today. And in this film, we are introduced to characters played by David Strathairn and Albert Finney, with Strathairn in particular delivering absolutely stellar work. But the true star and the one who ties it all together is, of course, Matt Damon. Damon is an actor I have grown to appreciate more and more in recent years, and especially in light of last year's release of The Departed, I am very surprised that Damon only has one acting Oscar nomination. His work on the Bourne films is far subtler as his character does a lot more running and fighting than he does talking. But Damon succeeds in doing what most A-list actors fail to do: He disappears into the character. During most of the film, I forgot that I was watching Matt Damon because I was so engrossed in the action and into his character. This level of disappearance is one that actors such as Tom Cruise are simply unable to do. And for that, I commemorate Damon all the more. Julia Stiles, on the other hand, doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but one would think that a more established or talented actress would be able to do much more with the character than she does. Still, she's not a burden nor a distraction like Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, so her casting is more than forgivable.Director Greengrass, his crew, Damon and the rest of the cast do an absolutely magnificent job on this film: The story is delivered outstandingly, the action is directed to perfection, and just the whole overall tone and energy of the film is pitch-perfect. Also worth mentioning is composer John Powell, whose percussion-based score more than enhances the pace and adrenaline of the film. In the end, everything comes together to create a brilliant, well-executed and just pitch-perfect action-thriller spy film, and the success and quality of this third installment in the Bourne series undoubtedly seals the trilogy's fate as one of the strongest, unfailing film trilogies in recent years, and probably the best action-thriller movies since the 60's and 70's films like The French Connection or Bullitt.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Great fun,"A typical criticism of the Bourne series is that it is all style over substance; flashy and fast-paced but lacking in heart. Were any tears shed at the departure of Bourne's love interest Marie (Franke Potente)? Do any viewers have even a vague interest the relationship that is hinted at between Bourne and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles)? I would go as far as to question whether the primary Bourne audience has much concern for the character of Jason Bourne and the truth behind his identity. This is a series of films so slick and disinterested that they often seem to hold you at arm's length whilst you take in the absurdity of what's occurring on screen. Luckily, to make up for this Bourne assaults your senses in such bombastic fashion as to make such concerns irrelevant. Every roller-coaster is built to make money, but if it's built well, it's also a damn fun thrill ride, even if it fails to live on in our memory for too long.Ultimatum actually serves as something of a prequel/sequel to Supremacy as the concluding scene of the second instalment is repeated and expanded upon somewhere in the middle of this film. But, we open where the action in Supremacy ended, with our favourite amnesiacally-challenged superspy mid-chase (of course) as he attempts to avoid the Moscow police. Still plagued by flashbacks of an abstruse, curious past, Bourne now seeks answers from those who made him the man he is. At the same time the CIA are once again after Bourne believing him to be the man responsible for leaking important information regarding off-the-books taskforce Blackbriar to the British press. Plot summary be damned, the story primarily serves as an excuse for director Greengrass to execute a game of cat and mouse between Bourne and those who seek him across beautifully photographed locations in Europe and New York.There are two major points of contention with this film: the camera-work and Matt Damon's performance. Supremacy and Ultimatum are labelled by some viewers as nauseating, headache-inducing due to Greengrass' insistence on 'shakey-cam' where the camera unrepentently nods and wobbles up and down instead of staying fixed and focus. It's not as effective here as it was when Greengrass utilised it during Bloody Sunday, United 93 or even the later Green Zone as those films often play with a kind of documentary realism absent from the clearly absurd Bourne.Indeed if one looks too closely at Ultimatum it can affect adversely one's enjoyment of the film. At one stage, distracted by the frantic editing at witness in the film I began counting the length of every shot. Soon I became distracted by the camera-work and noticing its erratic path began to get that headache-feeling that everybody refers to when mentioning these films. Eventually though I gave up fighting the film and enjoyed it for what it is – a knock-about action jaunt that's fun so long as you roll with the editing techniques and the unpredictable nature of the camera. It is best just to let these things wash over you so as to not disturb your enjoyment of the film. Indeed, at times the camera can add a degree of intensity that would not be present in a steady-cam shot and can make the action-scenes even more forceful. It is an effective tool for ramping up the tension.It has also been said that Matt Damon's performance is too one dimensional – that although he has the body of an action man doll, he also displays about as much emotion as those plastic features can. Although I don't agree with those on the other end of the spectrum who declare this a supreme, masterful performance, there's much about Damon's adept measured performance to recommend. He brings an intensity to the character which is necessary to drive the plot forward and carries off the various chase and fight scenes with aplomb. It's a good action performance in a role which is perhaps is non-too-demanding (at least in an emotional sense) and thus never fails to reach the kind of levels of, say, Bruce Willis in Die Hard.The Bourne Ultimatum is a success because it plays to its strengths and delivers thrills and suspense, some might say despite the deviant camera-work. There's a technical brilliance underlying the tightly choreographed chase scenes (and one could argue this film is one long chase) that leaves you sometimes in awe. There is no doubting the kind of influence that Greengrass' directorial style and this series of films in particular have had on the way action films are presented to their audience. Quick edits and wild camera movements are now the blight of a good number of camera movements. Whatever you think of this legacy, it's a testament to Greengrass' ability that he was first to recognise the potential of this style and remains perhaps still the only one to fulfil it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Still relevant post-911,"When The Bourne Identity hit the screen in 2002, the Cold War was decidedly over and spy movies had lost their relevance in the post-911 aftermath. The Bourne Identity masterfully resonated with our psyches: here was a man, despite all his abilities, unable to answer a basic question: ""who is my enemy and why are they after me?"" The next installment took a different turn, Doug Liman was replaced by Paul Greengrass, and while Brian Cox was brought back as Ward Abbott, the electric performance of Chris Cooper was missing. The Bourne Ultimatum not surprisingly shares more with the second than the first. Joan Allen returns as Pamela Landy with more intense action than ever and Bourne traversing more continents than ever.However, the writers clearly make an effort to tie all three movies together. In fact, do yourself a favor and watch the Bourne Identity before you watch the Bourne Ultimatum. Many minor details from the first become critical plot elements in the third.While I can watch the Bourne Identity again and again, I am afraid the Bourne Ultimatum has about the same weight as the Bourne Supremacy. Not that it isn't any good. Rather, it lacks the intensity of the first and the electric exchanges between Cooper and Cox.4 out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
I want to hit the director with a tripod.,"In every shot of this film the camera was jiggling around. Every shot! With the possible exception of a scene borrowed from the previous film.On top of this, there were a lot of shots which were not very well focused. Since cameras automatically focus these days, they must have gone to quite an effort to film in this style.In the action sequences, each camera shot lasts maybe 2 seconds maximum. The upshot is that every time there is an action shot you get half a second of out-of-focusness, then the shot gets brought into focus but the cameraman is jumping about (they must have got very fit filming this) so you get a vague impression of a person moving, and then on to the next shot - and it's out of focus again. Most of the major action sequences did not spend enough time looking at important events to let the audience realise what was happening. Very hard to follow! In a good film the audience should be totally absorbed in the story, at no point should they be aware of what the cameraman is doing. This film, you have to make an effort to get past the camera-work to figure out what is happening.If the director had used a more traditional filming method my rating would be about 5 stars higher. The plot seemed to follow on along the same line as the previous films, Matt Damon got to hit people: good solid action movie stuff.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Excellent ultimatum,"As a fan of Matt Damon and a fan of the Bourne trilogy, I have to say that this is a great ending of a wicked CIA complot. A great ENDING, meaning hopefully they will not make another one. Ultimatum gives you all the answers you've been looking for, all the strings are tied together and everything starts to make sense. Still it has drive, action, and fun, pure adrenaline entertainment. The interactions of Bourne with his enemies are fast and fun to watch. Part of the art of film making within a trilogy, is to make a movie so it is part of series, but can be viewed as an individual film as well, and still make complete sense. I think the Bourne Trilogy does that: My compliments to the chef; extraordinary film making! I still recommend to see all three films in the intended order. If you haven't seen 1 and 2 go rent it. It will make the 10 dollars at the box office exponentially more worth it! Damon shines and the role of Jason Bourne is tailored for him. Enjoy the ride!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Testament,"A testament in 2 ways. Firstly, you CAN have an action film with plenty of brains, secondly, you CAN have a 3rd in a trilogy equally as good as the first one, which is the case here. There is no cheesiness, no tired over used clichés, no silly macho heroics, just a damn good action thriller.This film works similarly to the others in terms of plot and content, but throws new ideas in, as this film trilogy never stops doing. Matt Damon returns as the much hunted Jason Bourne (does this guy get ANY peace?) as he once again finds himself on the run from ruthless CIA agents with ultra high tech gadgets, super advanced computer systems and on call assassins! Yet this is not enough to en capture Bourne, a man who could get from New Zealand to Great Britain using only a toothbrush and a coffee mug.This film uses shaky hand held camera techniques to help get the audience into the frantic and fast paced nature of the story, not to mention make the frequent action sequences gripping and exciting. The combat and car scenes are so realistic you almost forget your watching a movie. They have a raw, no nonsense feel to them. None of this slo-mo, souped up Matrix malarkey, it isn't needed. Here it is served upfront.This is the kind of film where you could go to the toilet and miss crucial parts of the story, seeing as everything happens so quick. It is not a film to wind down to or watch while doing something else, as it takes concentration to keep with it. But it is worth a watch, fans of the previous 2 Bourne's will not feel let down or cheated, as what was in the previous films has not gone walkies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bourne to be the best !,"By the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet. The movie never, and I do mean never, lets up in action. It may be mild action but it's action. Once again every member of the cast fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were feasible, and the fighting was incredible. Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne.All I really have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and this is no exception. The action, the stakes, the plot. How they do it I will never know. I applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies. Because if he hadn't done such a great job with the first movie, we wouldn't have this one to talk about.So don't go see it in theaters, go experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live, but if not December 11th Bourne comes home to you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
This you need to see!,"All round great film. One of the best ""Spy"" thrillers ever made. If you want to understand the plot watch The Bourne Identity and Supremacy just before watching this one. This is going to be a film that you will want to buy on DVD even if you do go to see it at the cinema, because 1. you may not fully understand everything in the plot the first time; 2. it's just that good. Matt does a fantastic job as the ultimate spy, miles better than Brad Pitt in ""Spy Games""...and that was also a good film too! Lots of great action across many continents, however each new ""combat"", ""chase"" scene can begin to feel a bit ""samey"" towards the end. There are not many sequels/trilogies that you can say are this good. Well worth a visit to the silver screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Bourne is Reborn,"From acclaimed film director, Paul Greengrass comes the third installment in Jason Bourne series. Starring Academy Award winner Matt Damon and nominees David Strathairn, Joan Allen and Albert Finney. Great action with an even greater storyline make Bourne one of the most successful sequels in decades.Matt Damon brings a great sense of vengeance and humanity to his role and engages himself in a character even if he is incredibly reserved. What people tend to forget is that Damon is one of our most underrated and talented actors working in Hollywood today. Turning in great after great performances in The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Departed and Syriana, Damon is on his way to a future acting win to bookend his writing win. His ""Jason Bourne"" is as complex as he is simple and gives us the range of an actor that the audience believes.Joan Allen is our most overdue, besides Julianne Moore, working actress today without an Oscar. While it isn't the Oscar bait role that every person dreams of, she brings that needed exuberance to a role and balances this film perfectly. Snubbed for The Upside of Anger, fans of Allen will wait for the role that will land at on a Kodak stage. However, her ""Pamela Landy"" is quite an impressive performance nonetheless, and is a likable character that the viewer doesn't mind seeing on screen.Our supporting players David Strathairn and Albert Finney play their villainous roles effectively and exquisitely. We enjoy their on screen presence and look forward to future work from these veterans but there is no shining when Allen and Damon are this good.The screenplay by Tony Gilroy, Scott Burns, and George Nolfi is quick, engaging and intoxicating as it keeps the viewer enticed the entire time without giving us a breath. Adapting it from the series was an achievement especially when it's an action story, which can often take away from the storyline. They never lose that character depiction and development. Along with the direction by United 93's director Paul Greengrass with his lovely precision of directing and never losing site of source material, Greengrass is our next big directing icon for generations to come, if not there already.The Bourne Ultimatum is a great addition to a action, crime genre like Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and Casino Royale. Sound and Cinematography are feasible considerations for Oscar in the upcoming season but it is subtle and can be overshadowed and steamrolled by bigger projects. But audiences can easily enjoy this gem of cinema.Grade: ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The definitive proof that the saga is not to my liking.,"When I went to do the Bourne Marathon, the movie I was most excited about was The Bourne Ultimatum, for being the most acclaimed by the critics and the public, and even after watching 1 and 2 that disappointed me a bit, I continued with A Hype contained by The Bourne Ultimatum, but the film disappointed me, Paul Greengrass back in the direction, and he is very competent in the action scenes, which are the best things in the movie, Matt Damon is getting better at the character, the rest Of the cast is fine, none compromises the film, the soundtrack does its part, but the pace continues lens in a few moments, the script has some problems, unfortunately The Bourne Ultimatum was proof that the Bourne saga is not to my liking , The movies are cool, but they are not movies that I plan to watch again.

Brilliant Bourne film,"The third instalment of the Bourne series sees Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) reprise his role as Jason Bourne, the ex Treadstone agent who is looking for answers about his past. Bourne travels across Moscow, London and Madrid to try and find answers whilst Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Noah Vosen (David Strahairn) try to track him down. Winner of 3 Oscars, The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best thrillers of recent times with edge of your seat car chases, gun fights and great characters.The plot is solid with mystery and excitement at every turn with the characters leading the way. It's exciting, enjoyable, interesting and energetic throughout, justifying the genre wonderfully and proving that the genre is not just about special effects, but more about the plot, which makes the film unique.What makes the film great for me is the work that went in to make it. Hardly any special effects were added, the team use real filming locations in Madrid, Waterloo Station and America, Damon does a lot of his own stunts and all of these factors are fantastic to make the film amazing and even more realistic.The action and thriller genre gets scrutinized for its lack of realism but this film excels as it is always realistic and doesn't go over the top with special effects and action sequences. It uses the right amount to make it exciting and interesting for viewers.Damon, Allen, Stiles and the whole cast are fantastic. The locations for the scenes are great, especially the scene at Waterloo Station which is a landmark for the thriller genre.The ending is unbelievably tense and exciting.Paul Greengrass' fast flowing direction justifies the plot beautifully.Like the other Bourne films, it's sophisticated, mystifying and energetic but with more intensity. All the films are different but this is probably the best because of its style and energy.A one of a kind thriller, one of the best trilogies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Wolves Came Out of Their Den,"Having followed the trilogy of Bourne, I have to say I'm satisfied. Greengrass decided to open a ""cat and mice"" game, where intellects are put under pressure and Bourne must challenge alone all of them who are seeking for him. The movie is in a constant run, whereas it is in cars, bikes, over the roofs of houses. Traps, set ups. We can't even start to breath when the game is on.The ""steadicam"" use couldn't be more accurate. It gives a sense of company to the movie; we are always running, always present while escaping. His semi-shots, out-of screens and artful photography are details I myself enjoy pretty much.Morocco, Belgium, France, Rusia. You won't have a breath, I repeat. The film doesn't stops and has great use of it's elements, and it's nice to see how the wolves operate on their constant hunt, with their intelligence edge, superior technology and fearful bureaucracy. It delivers with a high sense of realism.This is a movie of intelligence, thrilling essence and utter energy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"high octane,intelligent action, simply brilliant","Previously , if asked at the beginning of the year (2007) i would have said without blinking that the Die Hard franchise , was the greatest action franchise they is. But with the release of the last Bourne Installment, that is in great challenge. Jasoon Bourne is easily the best spy/assassin in movie history, he is everything that Jameb Bond can never be. They're is just something about the way his rain switches gears when presented with different situations, and how he gets himself out of them.He is always ten steps ahead of his adversaries, and that is incredible for man that was function on muscle memory and autopilot. He didn't need any gadgets or one liners to be cool.His silence said a lot more than any line he could ever come up with. The Bourne series have completely redefined what an action movie should be,and what we should expect, the same way the John MaClane character changed what an action hero should be like,( prior to the muscle bound days of Arnie and Sly).It's is clear in the way Bond was revamped in Casino Royale, that they were taking cues from Bourne, and the Mission Impossiple franchise may have also been an inkling that Bond needed to be reinvented. Personally, i would say that Bourne Ultimatum, is the best action movie i have seen in many years, on so many levels. Not only does it have awesome chase scenes, and brilliantly shot and choreographed fight scenes, but it's a highly intelligent movie, that's high octane entertainment. Matt Damon, has established himself as an action star, and i hope to see more collaborations of him and Director Paul Greengrass in the near future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Wow talk about saving the best till last,"Jason Bourne is getting closer and closer to discovering who he was and when he learns that a reporter in London may have the information that he needs, Bourne makes contact with said reporter. However, when his peers realise that Bourne is getting close to finding out the answers he needs, they begin eliminating everyone that knows too much. Will Bourne manage to find out the truth?I've watched the first 2 films in this franchise before, but re-watched them again when I noticed that the whole trilogy was on sky as I didn't get round to watching this third film in the trilogy, but I'm so glad that I've managed to see it now because it was superb.It definitely feels closer to the Bourne Identity in terms of quality, but Ultimatum really comes to life just with its electrifying pace and non-stop suspense. Literally from start to finish, Bourne is being chased and pursued by all and sundry and not only has to utilise his fighting skills, but given that there is so much in the way of manpower searching for him he has to really use his ingenuity here (the fact that he manages to outsmart and fool an agency that are supposed to experts in surveilling people is nothing short of incredible). The scenes within the CIA have a gritty sense of realism (sometimes it's like you're watching 24) and honestly I just found this film hooked me in and thrilled me slightly more than the other films.The acting was decent by all involved (Damon was at the top of his game here), but everyone else was solid as well. Though I did have to laugh at the guy who played the deputy director (not because of his acting, but just because of how much of a dumbass he was).Normally a franchise worsens as it progresses, but this is a rare occasion when the final film in the trilogy is the best one. The only thing that is slightly disappointing about this film was the camera work (though in fairness it was bad in the first 2 films and I didn't find it quite as problematic here).In summary, this is a very satisfying finale to what has been a very enjoyable trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

A little short of expectation,"It was non-stop action - but that is kind of the problem. Overall, I did not feel cheated. It was entertaining and a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon, however, I never got the same ""thrill"" as I had in the previous films. Perhaps it is just because it is the third one, and there is little new - particularly in the plot, which is rehashed from the last movie. There is lots of chasing. Chasing in cars, on foot, in buildings, across buildings, in train stations... you get the idea.It starts out in Moscow, where Bourne takes out a bunch of Russian Police (which is never really explained), then as he gets snippets of his memory back, he goes on the same spree as before. He spends the movie tracking down answers to his past and showing off lots of CIA uber-agent skills and survives more death encounters than Friday The 13th Jason Voorhees. There is minimal mind engagement and most of the movie is about Bourne's physical prowess. The end was anti-climatic at best. Lastly, The camera movement was maddening. I saw this movie with 7 other friends, and universally that was the chief complaint. One actually said there should be a warning that watching this could cause epileptic seizures. While I understand the intent is to make one feel as though they are in the middle of the action, it really just made me nauseous. Overall: It's OK.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Intensity defined.,"I'm a huge fan of the first two ""Bourne..."" movies. ""...Identity"" was a top-notch action-thriller that kept you guessing all the way through. ""...Supremacy"" was so fast-paced and immediate, I found myself holding my breath more than once during one of Jason Bourne's escapes. So I could not wait to see ""...Ultimatum."" And for once I was not disappointed in any way by a third installment.The plot is simple...on the surface. Jason Bourne wants to find out who he is, because that is the only way he can be at peace with himself. And he plows headlong into that task with his usual resourcefulness and adaptability, jumping from Moscow to Paris to London to Madrid to Tangiers to New York, chased all the way by those on both sides of the law, including people supposed to be on his side. We connect with some of the usual suspects -- Pamela Landy (the always excellent Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Styles being just right) -- and some new ones -- Noah Vosen (the always excellent David Strathairn) and Dr. Albert Hirsch (an understated Albert Finney). And I will not ruin anyone's enjoyment of the film by saying one thing more about the plot.This movie starts in fourth gear and peels out like it's at a drag race. The chases are breathtaking, of course, but what is stunning is how connected you stay to the characters, even as they're running and jumping and driving and diving off roofs and chasing and being chased. I did not know it was possible to keep the action and suspense at such a high level for a full 111 minutes, but Paul Greengrass does it. I now truly believe the man is two steps short of God when it comes to making action films.What's even more beautiful is how the story and images bring us right back to the beginning of the first movie. Taking the audience full circle and ending on just the right note. I've already told all my friends they have to see this film. I urge everyone else to do the same. It is intensity defined.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Weakest of the three films,"True fans of the Bourne movies will be very disappointed in this film. The fight scenes which are so enjoyable from the first two films are not even viewable due to the ""shaking camera"" technique. All you see is quick movement and a blur leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Also, Matt Damon is noticeably heavier and with a deeper voice which is distracting to the viewer. I think the fight scenes were shot closer up with the shaking camera technique to compensate for his heavier appearance and possible lack of agility. The first hour and twenty minutes of this film is honestly boring and barely keeps the viewer's interest. Also, Jason Bourne is so robotic. The existential dilemma of who he is and his search for humanity is just phoned in to the office in this third picture. His character is at his best in The Bourne Identity. The Bourne Supremacy is almost as good as the first. However, with each subsequent film his character becomes less human and more robotic. I don't think he smiled one time in the entire film. I think everyone is so excited that there is a third movie and is caught up in the Bourne Mania. However, I think history will judge me correct in my opinion that this is the weakest of the three movies. The first picture will always be the best one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bourne Trilogy,This movie give us what we expect. Everything works well. Matt Damon is a great actor and his performance is outstanding. The fighting scenes are working really well. Sometimes I had the sensation that the cámara is moving a little bit to fast so is kind of tricky to follow what is happening on the screen but otherwise I really enjoyed. The shooting scenes as well are good...the history is so good. We need more movies like this. The soundtrack is good too. Is kind of complicated find bad stuff for Reason Bourne Saga.

Ultimate Boring Movie,"If you are so easily entertained by mindless car chases, wrecks, fights, and gun shots that you would rate this movie higher than a 4 you are getting what you deserve.The plot is so thin in this that it could only have been written by a committee dedicated to screenwriters anorexia. Dialog is painfully dull and relationships between actors so scantily developed that I would be ashamed to have my name on this.The cutting of this film leaves you feeling like you have taken a ride inside a pinball machine. It seems to swat you around from one point to another in the script without regard for any development of its characters.If this isn't bad enough the decision to make it with hand-held cameras with all Steadicam turned off creates the feeling of being aboard a small boat in a bouncing ocean.It was just plain boring, not Bourne.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"""The toughest target that you have ever tracked""","Like a lot of film fans, I was super impressed with the first two Bourne pictures. Most of us agree -- they were pretty original and definitely pushed the boundaries for the action-thriller genre. With all this in mind, I had my doubts on how the Bourne team could make a similar impact.I'm glad to say, I think the Ultimatum is worthy. In its own right it is a great, very fast moving film with some brilliant photography (once you get past the jittery hand-held camera action), stunts & acting (besides Damon, all working solid working actors). As expected you get the panoramic city-scape views that Jason Bourne leads us thru, some brilliantly brutal ""punch ups"" in closer proximity, my favourite being the deadly scuffle with ""Desh"" a north African CIA Assassin.Looking back at the Ultimatum, I do think the speed of the film left several short gaps, which is where I think fans may draw the Ultimatum as the weaker comparison, for instance; there is very little character development  there were opportunities to shed more light on Nicky & Pamela Landy, come to think of it, the lack of dialogue was largely replaced with facial sighs and physical exhaustion. I would've also liked to have seen Bourne use some downtime on the screen & possible preparations (ala early Bond) for his next skirmish.With that said, it's not a fly in the ointment, especially as the story does tie up well and gives the viewer a sparkling ending.~Paul Browne.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Bourne is Back, and Back with a Bang","It was difficult to imagine Jason Bourne rushing through the streets of top European countries, and bashing box office records at the same time. Especially after the records set by its precedent, it seemed unthinkable, perhaps unimaginable. But it really does. And it also wins the average movie goer's hearts.To be honest, I had read a couple of reviews of Ultimatum before heading down to see this flick, and I have to say I was a bit skeptical. Especially since the same reviewer had bashed ""At World's End"" and ""Ocean's 13"", both of which in my opinion were classics. But I was equally impressed. This is probably the first movie of the year which fulfills your expectations and more.Yes, the shaky cameras are back. Yes, the classic hand-to-hand combat moves are back. Yes, the exhilarating chase sequences are back. Yes, Jason Bourne is back. And yes, he does remember now. From start to finish, Ultimatum keeps you at the edge of your seat.The director has done a fabulous job by the method that he has adopted. He has told the story in a very nice manner, which always keeps the audience pondering what is going to happen next. The story picks up almost from where Supremacy ended. From Moscow, we find Bourne escaping the clutches of the Moscow police and then travel all across Europe and over the Atlantic to New York. The catchy dialogs which have been impressing in supremacy are more gritty this time around, and Bourne becomes a more suave and a much more deadly assassin. As if he wasn't deadly enough in the first place.The action sequences are obviously very good. Especially the hand-to-hand combat. And of course the fabulous car chase in the heart of NYC towards the end. The shaky camera adds fuel to the action, making it much more realistic in nature.The acting is once again undoubtedly superb. Matt Damon returns for one last time to reprise his role as Jason Bourne. So does Julia Stiles as the ex-CIA agent Nicky Parsons. We discover a chemistry between these two characters which have been surprisingly absent from the last two movies, suggesting that there might have been a bit more than matches the eye. Joan Allen also makes a comeback as Pamela Landy, the CIA agent who is out for Bourne. We are introduced to CIA deputy director Noah Vosen, played by David Strathairn, as the man out for Bourne's blood. He fills in the shoes of the chief antagonistic character and takes up the place of Brian Cox from the previous two movies. A small but significant role is also given to veteran actor Albert Finney.The background score along with the soundtrack is also perfect. Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" is fast catching up to my list of Must Listen songs. Something also must be said about the ending. Ironically we find Bourne comes back to the first movie where he kills ""The Professor"", Clive Owen. He says, ""Look at us. Look at what they made you give."" They are the same as of David Webb a.k.a Jason Bourne. It my just as seem that Bourne finally realizes the gravity of the Treadstone project and the Blackbriar program.This exciting out of the edge thriller certainly deserves a special place in my heart. 9/10 !!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Maybe the BEST action movie ever made!,"This 3rd Bourne is the best of the 3 and I give Identity a 9/10 and SUPREMACY a 10/10.This movie starts huge and never ever lets up. It is smartly cast, beautifully performed (CAN WE GET SOME Oscar NOMS for Matt Damon and Joan Allen?), breathlessly paced, wonderfully shot/filmed and intelligently scripted and on and on and on.The Bourne movies have really separated themselves from the rest of pack (save for the last Bond film which wisely echoed a Bourne film), because we care intensely about this deeply complex man. I don't find myself exactly rooting, er, cheering (sorry Aussie film nuts), for him. He has done some very nasty things. Nevertheless Bourne is unequivocally one of the most memorable characters in cinematic history.And what new superlatives can we use to praise Paul Greengrass? His last 4 films have been BLOODY Sunday, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, last year's best movie UNITED 93 and now this one. Greengrass is at the top of his field by a clear margin. Just when you think movies can't get anymore exciting along comes ULTIMATUM and it is never at the expense of the human drama. The new DIE HARD, TRANSFORMERS and 300 had some amazing set pieces in them but this film's action slays anything in those movies. It is almost too much.I just hope Oscar finally rewards his work and his movies. ""They"" really missed it last year with 93.

Tremendous Trilogy Finale,"When the Bourne Identity came out I was as impressed as anyone with the clever storyline,fine acting, and pacey, often innovative, action sequences. However the Bourne Supremacy, which I had assumed was a ""cash in "" sequel lost me, mainly because the narrative was poor, and the sense of purpose in the story was lost. Well, this third installment puts that right with spades, and works both as the end of a trilogy, and as a stand alone piece.Matt Damon proves what a fine actor he is. Although an action hero, he always seems to avoid cliché and formula in the role. Cleverly, because the essence of the story is the search for his ""identity"", it is also a search for his soul. So although the action sequences are frequently quite brutal, he never succumbs to the Schwarzenegger ""automaton"" style of action hero.Although awash with surveillance gadgetry, the story eschews hi tech killing methods, and is far the better for it. The thrill is in the chase. David Strathairn, who has a gargantuan list of film acting credits behind him, is tremendous as the maverick Deputy CIA Chief,Noah Vosen. Joan Allen,as his nemesis Pamela Landy, is superb as his nemesis, and proves that there is a place for women over 50 in modern movies. By contrast, Julia Stiles as erstwhile love interest Nicky Parsons, has a curiously underwritten, functional role.Not cerebral, but visceral entertainment. Much cleverer than the Mision Impossible franchise. and a for once plausible cross Atlantic contrast to James Bond.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Best 'Bourne' concludes an already legendary trilogy. Best action movie of the year.,"We had to wait twelve years after the Die Hard Trilogy but once again has a great action trilogy been made. To anyone who doesn't believe this movie deserves it's Top 250 spot, think of it this way: The Bourne Ultimatum is a representative of the whole trilogy and as the best of the trilogy, deserves it's spot. I truly believe it's unique for a third installment to be better then the first or second one. In fact I would go so far as saying the first one is the worst of the series, even though I love it to death. Matt Damon gets his chance to shine once again and I'm really happy he's finally getting recognition. He's a great actor and a lot of his films are worth seeing. The Bourne Ultimatum is a must for action movie fans. It's the year's best ( of the action genre) even though I enjoyed the controversial Die Hard 4.0 too. 300 rates better on CGI but both Die Hard 4.0 and 300 are seriously lacking intelligence compared to TBU. I hope they don't do a fourth, the trilogy is too legendary already to ruin with an uninspired and unnecessary sequel.The Bourne Ultimatum is Paul Greengrass' best and I really hope it remains in the top 250 even after the hype passes.

Pretty Boring,"This film is nothing but, more of the same Bourne stuff. There is not much of a thrill to this film since it is so much like its previous two stories.

Whoosh! Bang! Crash! Wallop!,"What's become a spy-film franchise big enough to be compared to the Bond series (there's a link on the Orange homepage asking 'who's better: Bourne or Bond'?) is now onto its third film. For those who, like me, found 'The Bourne Supremacy' an inferior film to 'The Bourne Identity' (mangled and meandering plot; the lack of surprise and sense of mystery that the first film had; Paul Greengrass' frantic direction, suited to gritty documentaries like 'Bloody Sunday', but maybe not to a Hollywood action film), the good news is that 'Ultimatum' is a better film, though still not as good as the first. Greengrass' zingy, constantly-moving camera-work, deployed to add a 'gritty' edge to the fight scenes in 'Supremacy', is again present, though here it seems to be used often as not to cover up improbabilities such as Bourne jumping, superhero-style, improbably long distances from roof to roof. Damon remains tight-lipped and pretty much expressionless throughout, playing the role of assassin to perfection but skimping on the softer, vulnerable side that would allow us some emotional engagement with him which is rather lacking in the film (something brought out more in his relationship with Franka Potente's character in the first film and the beginning of the second). It's pretty much action all the way - one long adrenaline trip, frequently driven by John Powell's insistent repeated theme in the orchestral score. To accommodate this, the plot is stripped down and simple (basically: Bourne goes after baddies; Bourne fights baddies; Bourne goes after more baddies in search of who he really/originally was, and how he became the assassin Jason Bourne). There are numerous set-pieces: dodging a shooter in Waterloo station; scooter and roof-top chase in Tangier (the most extended, and perhaps the best, of all of them); and finally, climactic action in New York. Also, you got appearances by good, respected actors: David Strathairn, the mellifluous voice intact from 'Good Night and Good Luck', but the role very different; Scott Glenn; Joan Allen; Julia Stiles (thankfully not turning into the love interest here, though playing a fairly major role); and, to trump them all, Albert Finney, who really doesn't have that much to do but provides a suitably serious cameo. In the end, you may wonder whether it adds up to more than the sum of parts - the answer is probably no, but it's an entertaining enough summer blockbuster and it'll keep you suitably occupied for a couple of hours in the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

They make more of the same and yet it still seems new:  that's why the series can go on,"The Bourne stock is high. Paul Greengrass, who's made the last two, is a good director. He proved his mettle with his documentary-style history film about Northern Ireland, 'Bloody Sunday,' and another one last year, 'United 93.'Once upon a time action films ended with a chase. In the stripped down action world of Jason Bourne, the whole film is a chase. And that is fine. Matt Damon is a brilliant action star; he IS the Bourne franchise, as Bruce Willis is his franchise. Bourne is a new kind of hero. He is a cipher who suffers, a hyper-kinetic version of a spy hero, because he doesn't know who he is, and everyone is his enemy, and he is always in a foreign country. 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' the latest, but no doubt not the ultimate, of the series, begins with Bourne in Moscow, and then moves on to Paris and London and Madrid and Tangier and New York. Bourne is equally at home--and equally a stranger--in all these places, and we love this blurry world tour with bodies and bullets and cars flying. Jason Bourne doesn't know who he is or what happened but he has astonishing skills. He's the ultimate human weapon, lethal and indestructible, and he speaks good Russian, French, German and Spanish and can open any door, get past any code, dodge any pursuer. He is a wily trickster. That makes him a character of folklore, a creature of our dreams.But let's not kid ourselves. With each successive sequel, the series is growing thinner. 'The Bourne Identity,' which was based on a Robert Ludlum novel and directed by the young Doug Liman (Greengrass is ten years older), took the time to establish places and people and had the intense relationship between Bourne and Marie (Franka Potente) -- something approaching a love interest. Potente had an air of recklessness and danger that made her a good match. This was the essential Bourne film. It began with Bourne emerging from the water, like some kind of sea birth. 'The Bourne Supremacy' (the ante is upped in each title, as if screaming to be noticed) also had a long prelude full of tropical atmosphere. It had moments of tragedy and betrayal. The first film had Chris cooper and Clive Owen and Brian Cox. Cooper and Owen dropped out,. and we got Joan Allen and David Strathairn. Albert Finney seems a rumpled version of Cox., and he is underused.But the spy-chaser machinery brought to bear against Bourne is really meaningless except as a foil. Nutty as the CIA is, would all of Langley be marshaled in a giant war room to track down a single man--who only attacks when he's attacked--and whose threat seems to be that he may remember who he is and what he was supposed to do? Doesn't that make us all dangerous? The marvel is that the CIA can track Bourne on TV monitors all over the room that come up with sound and pictures and tap into cell phones at a yelled command from Strathairn. The believable part is that Bourne always dodges or offs the CIA ""assets"" who're after him and escapes from the net. And Bourne catches them all napping and they lead him directly to the information they seem to want to hide from him. That part is very convincing.'Ultimatum' is a post-Abu Ghraib story, showing that hoods and water-boarding and sleep deprivation were used in Bourne's training. But in year seven of Bush II, the arrest of some CIA chiefs for using harsh tactics in their black operations seems unlikely. These are just brief allusions, anyway: the special ops, even though there's a new one revealed, ""Blackbriar,"" were more fully developed in 'The Bourne Supremacy' than here.Greengrass uses a technique of very rapid editing and very unsteady camera (Liman's camera work did not require Dramamine, but his does). He introduced that in 'Supremacy,'' and he continues it in 'Ultimatum.' This style in time may date, but for now it makes the visuals seem fresh.It always seemed Matt Damon was an awfully funny kind of matinée idol, a strange degeneration of the Hero: he looks more than anything like a burly bellhop. But he has proved in various films that he's a good actor.-- particularly adept at showing self doubt or emotional disconnection. I prefer Malkovitch's Tom Ripley to his, but his (in Minghella's film) gets best at the core of Patricia Highsmith's antihero -- his lack of affect. Though the Bourne action goes so fast you barely get a chance to appreciate it, Damon's obviously also an athlete. He may be no kung fu star, but better than that, he convinces you Bourne is not a showoff but simply a deadly physical opponent.Given the increasing dilution of content, it's a bit surprising that the Bourne franchise films are seen as ""intelligent"" or even that they're seen as ""spy"" films. Yes, there's something classy about them, and they're not dumb by any means. They're battles of wits and skill as well as brawn and technology. And they are great fun to watch, even though the material is getting diluted and stretched.David Denby cites Manohla Dargis as saying that ""the drama of 'Identity' was existential (Who am I?) and the drama of 'Supremacy' was moral (What did I do?)"" and concludes that ""the drama of 'Ultimatum' is redemptive: How can I escape what I am""? Very neat, but rather artificial, since all these questions occur in each movie, and yet there is no answer in any of them. It is another kind of stretching, this time by the film critics, to attach profound significance to these three movies and make them into a trilogy. It makes more sense to imagine the filmmakers considering how they can make more of the same and yet make it still seem new. They succeed at that, and that's why the series can go on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The best of the Bourne Trilogy,"The third installment of the Bourne trilogy was without a doubt the best of the 3 movies, something quite rare in the movie industry. The acting was great by all and Matt Damon was once again great as Jason Bourne. (I wouldn't have chosen anyone else for the role) The movie was action packed the entire time and actually even kept up my girlfriend who usually passes out for almost every movie around the middle of it. The best part of the movie was definitely the cinematography which like the first two makes you feel like you are part of the chase and fight scenes. (the fight scene with Desh was probably one of the best I have ever seen in an action movie for both its realism, intensity and cinematography) All I can say is go see it, if you have even the slightest interest in action movies, I promise you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Fantastic Movie,"If you like action flicks, and if you've seen the previous Bourne movies, this is a ""don't miss"" show. The action is non-stop, and there's something about Damon's portrayal of the Bourne character that is totally involving. It's hard not to identify with the main character. At several points in the movie there were verbal exclamations from the audience and spotty applause--a sure sign that the involvement was complete. My only complaint with this movie was the filming of the action sequences. Some idiot (the director?) thought the excitement would be increased by stimulating nausea in the audience with jerky camera movement. At many times it feels like the scenes are being filmed by a raw amateur (me for example). The camera work sometimes makes Youtube camera work look expert by comparison. Still... it's worth seeing and is one of the best movies of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Great .....edge of the seat stuff.....,"I saw the movie with great expectations as the previous two Bourne movie were just superb......and needless to say the third part was just ultimate...great movie in totality. Fantastic movie experience....Jason Bourne rocks big time. Chase sequences were simply mind blowing and makes even multiple viewing enjoyable. The hand fight and action sequences are well crafted and most importantly they give a much needed break and respite from the computer aided , wired work which we have seen innumerable times since the cult action movie matrix. The movie is so fast and pulsating .....u feel that something is going to happen every second . The whole intelligence stuff , technology and communication has been picturized with such acumen that one is just sucked into the movie. Matt Damon....seems like he was tailor made for the role of Jason Bourne. He is impeccable in this movie. Brilliant in chase and action sequences and has done justice to the role in its every scene. Undoubtedly the best movie of this summer.....a must for every cinema goer. It is these genre of movies that depict Hollywood at its very best .",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An astoundingly great piece of action cinema,"I spoke to the God-Of-Film. He was a bit busy whispering in Zack Snyder's ear about the forthcoming adaptation of ""Watchmen"" (which was an interesting coincidence in itself because, up to a couple of years ago Paul Greengrass, who directed ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", was slated to direct ""Watchmen""), but He gave me a couple of minutes.I said to Him, ""I want 'The Bourne Ultimatum' to be the best action film released this year"".He said, OK.I said, ""I want it to have a sly, almost non-existent humour"".He said, Sure.I said, ""I want maximum intensity and minimum dialogue"".He said, Fine.I said, ""I want dizzying camera work, global locations, in-your-face fight scenes, heart pounding chase sequences (on foot and in motor vehicles), serious men (and women) doing serious business behind serious computer screens, double crossings, secrets, great performances, murder, mayhem, violence and, finally, closure.""He said, Anything else?""Yes. I want Matt Damon looking confused and tortured, but as tough as hell, and I want the Goddess Julia Stiles looking foxy.""He said, Done deal my friend.The God-Of-Film. He often lets me down, but not this time.All joking apart, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" really is an astoundingly great piece of action cinema. My first 9 out of 10 of the year.

Where we are frenetically borne along with Jason once again,"There's two thing's going for this latest chapter in the Bourne saga: it has one of best fight scenes ever filmed, between Bourne (Matt Damon) and Desh Boukansi (Joey Ansah) within the confined spaces of a cramped apartment in Tangiers. As a martial artist myself, I know just how easy it is to get hurt, even when playing around  so, the time taking to choreograph that whole sequence must have been meticulous and lengthy. It's worth seeing this film for that alone.The other thing in its favour is the spectacular chase sequence in New York City with Bourne in a stolen NYPD cruiser being hunted down by a succession of CIA agents all intent on the shoot-to-kill order from the Top Bad Guy Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Just how much damage can a cruiser take? Be amazed and awed as you watch  particularly a very clever action shot as mangled cars zoom completely over cameras (which must have been two fixed and remotely operated units) positioned directly in the line of crash. And, prior to that sequence, we see Bourne take a flying leap backwards, in a car, from the top of a car park, to land onto... Ah, ha  you thought I was going to say 'water' or 'balloons', or such like. See the movie...And then wonder just how a superhuman like Bourne can survive so many potentially fatal situations. This guy is totally, I mean, totally unbreakable. Oooops, sorry, that's been done already by Bruce Willis in Unbreakable (2000).Well, then, try to understand how a guy can be fluent in so many languages, apparently so quickly: Russian, German, French, Spanish, Italian and who knows what else, while still trying to find out who he is. I guess he's been around a lot...Which must be true, because he seems to know every little alley, street corner kiosk, parking lot, train station layout, and a plethora of other aspects about just about every major city in the northern hemisphere. And, that in turn means this Bourne guy must be loaded with an inexhaustible supply of money and/or credit cards to which he has constant access...from where and from whom?And, he never sleeps. Even when traveling...The thing that stops this movie from descending into comic book chaos is the presence of director Greengrass and the quality of the production. It's very well made, as a film; the editing is sharp, quick (almost too quick sometimes) but ferociously exciting. So much so, while the fight scenes are very good, I'm sure there's cranked up speed to parts that are done at a more leisurely pace.The story is merely a continuation of Bourne's need to uncover his past. Which he does, by the time the credits start to roll  leaving open, of course, another sequel.I just all hope it's not called Bourne Again. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Great soundtrack , great movie and great everything.","My brother and I recently saw this film and I am happy to report that it isn't a tired cash in like many other sequels.I didn't think that Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass could improve on the Bourne Supremacy but boy was I wrong.All the hallmarks of the series are here like the pulsating music, the furious action sequences and the haunting atmosphere.This puts every Bond movie to shame. It has no tired clichés no dire puns or one liners and it packs the gritty realism that puts James Bond to bed.The bad guys are also much improved upon in this installment, although I do lament the absence of Brian Cox who is always worth watching no matter what he is in.However David Strathairn is almost as good. I've enjoyed his work in the past in LA Confidential and Goodnight and Good Luck.I've noticed that many people don't like the up close and personal camreras. This is done to give the fight scenes realism and show the tension on the actors faces. I daresay it was also implementd to keep down the rating the film would get.Still despite these minor grievances I still give this film ten out of ten,an all star classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Motion Sickness - Wait for DVD,"I am joining another reviewer here and will only see a Paul Greengrass film on a small screen. I previously complained about the shaky cam in my review of Bourne Supremacy, but could not condemn the film since everything else was done very well. This time, the shaky cam is now doing more to inject tense feelings into what could be a thin story. I sat in the fourth row, and had to frequently look away or down to keep my stomach from fluttering. I eventually had to walk out to relieve the nausea, only returning later by sitting in the very back of the theatre. Greengrass said he wanted to make essentially a smart popcorn film, and he has. He may even have come up with some clever enough scenes to dare and shoot them on a tripod once in a while. I'm afraid what he is really doing is ratcheting up his camera-work (that looks like it was done by a 5 year-old), thinking that it is necessary to outdo the previous film.There is a great deal of evidence why; much time is taken to merely go over old material covered in the first two movies, the new CIA bad guys are like the old CIA bad guys, and NSA surveillance scenes are a dime a dozen nowadays. So it is only Bourne and his lightning fast action scenes that make this film worthwhile. I was thoroughly enjoying the intelligence they put into the set pieces, extending their potential and increasing the adrenaline. Also winning honors is the under-rated Joan Allen. Her intensity energises the screen, and provides a voice for the audience - rooting for her to save Jason and other colleagues from elimination.Greengrass delivers on the popcorn part for sure, but gets an 'F' for over-using an over-rated camera technique. Instead of giving this film a thumbs down, however, I am recommending that you watch it only on a smaller screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Great action and acting, but sorry storyline.","The Bourne Ultimatum is the movie that should not have been made. Like most trilogies, it was made because the first two movies were such a success. I loved the first two, but hated this one. Now I must admit that the blood pumping action and good acting will be enough to distraction most viewers from the absolutely horrid storyline. This storyline was just an add on to the original story line. The original storyline that actually made some sort of sense ended with the Bourne Supremacy. The Bourne Ultimatum story line was just concocted to try to put together a third movie to make money.The one thing that really bothers me about this movie is that Bourne is so supposed to be some sort of super spy that knows how to evade detection. He goes to unbelievable lengths to not be found and he never once thinks of changing his appearance! But other people with far less training immediately change their appearance to avoid detection. It is so inconsistent with the super spy character they are trying to make Bourne into that it flashes like a giant neon sign DUMB! DUMB! DUMB!. There are many other stupid thing that this supposed ""Super Spy"" does during is this movie that is so inconsistent with his super intelligent character that it makes you want to scream at the screen ""You Idiot!"".The other thing that I hate about this movie is, the filmography of the chase and action scenes. They made it look like the camera men were mounted on galloping horses during chase scenes. This is just an old trick to try to make a chase scene appear more dramatic. All it did for me is make me sea sick. When you make a home movie, everybody complains if the camera shakes to much, but Hollywood camera men get paid millions to intentional shake the camera! Very unprofessional looking. This is not to mention that the rapid flash frame changes during action sequences that made think I was watching a low budget Japanese Anime cartoon. These cheap attempts at dramatization are totally unnecessary and were just added to distract you for realizing how bad the storyline stinks.The bottom line here is that if you up are for a blood pumping action flick, this one will suite your needs. Just take a clothes pen to hold your nose so you won't smell how bad the storyline stinks.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The best movie about Jason Bourne,The best movie about Jason Bourne. Here excellent plot and fine scene action. It is the culmination of everything that was in the trilogy. Scenes with pursuits and prosecutions in this movie one of the best that I saw.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne Ultimatum,"Going into this movie, all I had heard was how fantastic this movie was, from friends AND critics. I had to put it to the test.I saw both the past Bourne films. While I enjoyed them, I would hardly call myself a fan. I gave the first a 7/10 and the second a 5/10. But when there is 100% positive reviews for a film, it's a must see.Bourne is all over the world in this one with a simple goal: to find out who he was. Meanwhile, a new bad guy, the guy from Good Night and Good Luck, is on his tail trying to kill him so that secrets about the CIA are not spilled. Helping him are the two women from the last movie: Joan Allen and Julia Stiles.The action scenes are constant. This is good, the movie's pace never goes down. But I have one major complaint that almost ruined the movie for me. Paul Greengrass, the director, is not only obsessed with hand-held, but also with extremely close shots during action. Through two of the major fight sequences, I had no idea what was going on because I couldn't see anything. The camera was so close you were confused.But the fact that the plot is fantastic is what saves the movie. This plot is one of the best I've ever seen in an action movie. Period. So, while the directing is poor, the screenplay and story pull the weight making it a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Fitting end to a consistently entertaining trilogy,"I liked both The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004) but I didn't love them. As espionage thrillers they were a welcome antidote to Bond (especially in the wake of 2002's bloated Die Another Day), were competently made and, at the very least, consistently entertaining. It seems to be something bordering on blasphemy to suggest this, but I must admit I preferred the Doug Liman directed Identity over its sequel, helmed by Paul Greengrass. The latter's hand-held camera-work (even in scenes where a properly composed, static shot would be more effective) constantly distracted me from the on screen events. This irritating stylistic choice, coupled with an unnecessary-to-the-plot (though undoubtedly thrilling) car chase in the final act makes Supremacy the weaker film, in my opinion. However, regardless of minor foibles, I enjoyed the two Bourne films thus far and, with this in mind, looked forward to checking out the latest instalment  The Bourne Ultimatum.Again directed by Paul Greengrass, now with the frankly awe-inspiring United 93 (2006) under his belt, Ultimatum follows on immediately from the events of Supremacy. In fact, the initial action follows Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) as he escapes from the aftermath of the car chase which ended the previous film. It is during Bournes' escape from the police in Moscow that the first possible downfall of the film reared its head  flashbacks. Though the gradual reveal of Bournes shattered memories has been an element in each of the previous films, it is such a tired cinematic device that I feared its use, so early in the film, might be a symptom of sequel fatigue. A spy film with a central character suffering from amnesia had been done to death 50 years ago, and is a plot line revisited by countless neo-noir and science fiction stories. Here it frames a tale of revenge on the people who created Bourne; echoing backwards to his indoctrination into the ranks as a mindless assassin. The use of this device, and the generalities of the plot which it fuels, are rather crude, rudimentary and extremely familiar. But this is where the disappointments with The Bourne Ultimatum end.The plot, in complete disregard of its failings, rockets along  taking us on a globe-trotting adventure from Moscow to Tangiers and, ultimately, New York. An ensemble of new and returning characters populate Bournes headlong sprint from one danger to the next. The acting is almost uniformly excellent; Damon manages to meld death-dealing assassin with world-weary everyman perfectly, Julia Stiles makes the most of a chance to flesh out her returning character and David Strathairn is uncompromising as a heavy-handed section chief. The only minor casting blip comes in the form of the other operatives sent after Bourne  they are particularly nondescript, forgettable and almost indistinguishable from one another. Though this is, quite possibly, deliberate it occasionally feels as though Bourne is fighting and running from the same Terminator-like enemy throughout. The events are essentially the same as the previous outings  the only real difference being that this time instead of running away Bourne is taking the fight to his former bosses. The action, in keeping with the series, is short, sharp and brutal. The choreography and execution of the action scenes is near perfect in this film, building on the lessons learned in the previous outings. The hand-to-hand fighting is not marred by the jump-cutting, speed ramping mistakes of the first film and the central New York car chase is both breathtakingly captured and is at least partially integral to the plot. The most effective sequence though, in my opinion, involves Bournes interaction with a British reporter (Paddy Considine). The latter is guided through the rush hour madness of Waterloo Station in London while Bourne moves around the periphery; eliminating the agents who are stalking them. The sequence is relatively action free but filled with the kind of sustained tension and a palpable sense of danger which action films in general, and Hollywood films in particular, generally find impossible to create.As the third part of a previously competent and enjoyable trilogy, The Bourne Ultimatum had the deck stacked against it  particularly coming at the end of a summer movie season with so many disappointing second sequels (Shrek 3, Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, Spiderman 3). Against all odds it truly delivers. I would not hesitate to say that it is the best of the trilogy; likely the best action film I've seen this year and possibly one of the best films of the year thus far. As a film-lover who is more often disappointed than dazzled I am delighted to be able to recommend this film as a triumph of sincere and sustained talent rather than a vacant money-maker, a symbol of studio greed. The Bourne Ultimatum is uncomplicated without seeming shallow, realistically brutal without feeling constrained by its PG-13 certificate, well-acted, impeccably directed and, above all else  it leaves you with that indefinable feeling of post-cinema satisfaction. It's neither the greatest film ever committed to celluloid, nor even the greatest action film but it succeeds far more than it fails and deserves to be seen and appreciated. Enjoy :)P.S. And yes, for the record, the ubiquitous shaky hand-held camera-work does make an unwelcome return. Though noticeably toned-down it is still consistently distracting, injecting unneeded energy into dialogue scenes and occasionally obfuscating any sense of geography in the action scenes. However, Greengrass pulls off everything else with such panache that he can be forgiven this one, peculiar habit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"impressive film-making, less impressive storytelling","""The Bourne Ultimatum"" has much in common with this summer's earlier ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" in that both movies are essentially one long chase sequence involving a protagonist whose ingenuity and grace under pressure are surpassed only by his seeming indestructibility.This is the third, and, we're told, final installment in the Robert Ludlum series about Jason Bourne, the agent programmed by a rogue element of the CIA to be a mindless killing machine. In ""Ultimatum,"" Bourne, who has since long disowned his professional-assassin past, is being hunted down by the Langley operatives who created him in the first place, believing that they risk career-destroying exposure and criminal prosecution if they don't silence their boy permanently.Acclaimed director Paul Greengrass (""Bloody Sunday,"" ""United 93"") brings his considerable film-making skills to bear on the material, sprinting headlong right out of the starting gate and giving us few moments to catch our breath on the way to the finish line. By employing a jittery hand-held camera throughout, Greengrass intensifies the chaotic nature of many of the scenes and brings a spontaneity and immediacy to the action on screen. In addition, the razor-sharp editing and plethora of locales (the film makes stops in New York, Moscow, London, Paris, Madrid, Tangier and a number of other cities) add greatly to the movie's effectiveness. We're never in any one place for very long, and a mere blink of an eye or lapse of attention at any crucial moment could spell disaster for anyone dutifully trying to follow the plot.I must say, however, that for all the tremendous movie-making pyrotechnics on display here, the movie suffers a bit from distention and overkill in the long run. After about the first half hour or so of nonstop action, the movie becomes a trifle wearying and redundant. We find ourselves wishing it would actually put the brakes on for a few moments so we could get to know the characters to a greater extent. For almost the entire movie (until the final sequences, that is), Bourne is little more than a nonstop running machine, dodging bullets, karate-chopping bad guys, jumping off rooftops, crashing through windows. All this is very impressive as stunt work and action-figure hoopla, but a little of it goes a very long way after awhile.Matt Damon has become very comfortable in Bourne's skin over the course of the three movies, but the role doesn't provide him with a great deal to sink his teeth into in terms of genuine acting. David Strathairn, Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and Albert Finney also do well in their assorted roles, but like Damon, they are limited by the restrictive nature of the film-making.Thus, for all its big-name, high-priced talent, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is more a director's picture than an actor's, making Greengrass the default star of the movie when all is said and done. And if we are ultimately left wondering if it may not be just a bit too much of a good thing, well, the goodness itself is treat enough these days, I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Ultimate Bourne From Start To Finish,"This is arguably the best of the three Bourne movies, and I could not agree more. This movie is so awesome that I might just have to spoil it.

And Joan Allen looks great for her age! The acting is great, and so is the dialogue. I won't give away the details, but we FINALLY learn who ""Jason Bourne"" really is, and all about his past.There was just one thing about the movie I didn't like. Julia Stiles' new hair!

The Best Bourne!,"The Bourne Ultimatum is the best Bourne movie. Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne who wants to know what happened to him in the past.

The movie starts off slow, but it's very interesting trying to see what is going to happen to Bourne. Then the middle to end has action and mind-blowing surprises. My favorite action scene is when Bourne is fleeing the cops by jumping across housetops. The acting is great. Matt Damon does not slow down one beat. The music plays a part in this film.

Incredible,"By far the most intense and exciting in the series, this movie was a great way to wrap up what has been a remarkable ride. Jason Bourne is a kick ass leading spy who rivals Jack Bauer in his drive to get at the truth using everything he has been taught and making no mistakes. The fear and respect he commands even from those trying to destroy him will give you goosebumps. I loved these movies because Bourne is not your James Bond with his dirty martinis and bed room antics. He is a man, hurt, betrayed and on a mission fueled by the loss of someone he truly loved. The women in this movie are tough as nails and are never the helpless victims that women are often portrayed as in most male audience geared action films. Seriously, see this movie.

Better and better,"I saw ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002) and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) on television but enjoyed them so much that I was determined to see the 2007 third segment on the big screen where the furious pacing and visceral violence has full impact. So many trilogies fail to live up to the promise of the original movie and the later works too often look as if they've been tacked on to sweat the asset of the franchise (there's much talk of ""the asset"" in this movie), but the Bourne films have got better as they've progressed, are neatly linked by characters and plot, and in the end are satisfyingly symmetrical (we open and close the series with a floating body).Doug Liman got things off to a commendable start as the original director, but having Paul Greenglass at the helm of the second and third films and Tony Gilroy as a scriptwriter on all three has really paid off. The trade-mark running through streets and over roofs and racing in cars and on bikes (with no regard for traffic rules or laws of gravity) are here again in spades, but most of the locations are new, notably London's Waterloo station (very familiar to me) followed in short order by Madrid, Tangier and New York. The dazzling editing, the insistent score and the 169 stunt performers present an enthralling couple of hours.I was delighted to see that (like me) Bourne is a ""Guardian"" reader, but sadly my PC does not work as fast as those at the CIA and I doubt that even the Agency has quite such immediate access to such voluminous data bases (if they do, the 'war on terror' should have been a breeze).This time Blackbriar is added to Treadstone, but things gradually become clearer to Bourne, both in term of his fractured memories and his real enemies. The narrative arc works well as Bourne discovers who are his friends in the Agency and only kills when he really has to do so.

And I've Seen a lot, solid script and a very great action element, the camera work as some people said was sketchy but i didn't really mind had a great cast , Damon has etched himself into the action heroes hall of fame IMHO with this thrill/action ride non stop for about 2 hours , so if you love Damon see this, or action in general you cant call yourself a action fan without seeing this movie, Matt is at his best in this and are for the stunts in this he claims to have done most of them and they look splendid, great direction in this movie as well as good depth to the story to un-tie all the lose knots.... thats why i most def. give this title a 10/10 flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

incredible amount of energy,"Not one of the best movies of the year (on the other hand this is the third Bourne and cannot be that original..) but certainly a film dressed with style, not only a popcorn flick.

"""Ultimatum"" Ultimate Bourne Film!","Without a doubt, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is flawless. The cinematography, which ups the ante from ""Supremacy"", was easy to follow even through its shaky documentary feel, and John Powell's score builds emphatic tension with perfect cadence. The writing maintains the complexity of the first two installments of the ""Bourne"" trilogy, but may in fact be the easiest story to follow of all three.A particular sequence roughly two-thirds through will be a standout. Without divulging details, I assure the uninitiate that they will all but hold their breath for the ten minutes in which Jason Bourne races to save a compatriot's life. The grim intensity that Matt Damon displays as Bourne makes up one of the most immersive character portrayals in any modern set of movies.If you have not already seen this extravaganza, in which every stop is pulled out for a fantastic film-going experience, get up from reading this review and do so.

Franka Potente badly missing,"I would like to give ""The Bourne Ultimatium"" a 10 out of 10. But already as it was the case with ""The Bourne Supremacy"", the great Franka Potente from part 1 ""The Bourne Identity"" is more than badly missing.Franka Potente made part one the success it became. She was and is different from the general line of young actresses modeled and standarized by Hollywood. A real life character and personality. It was a bad mistake to have her killed in part two (Bourne Supremacy) and she should have been with Bourne all throughout that movie too.Part 3 ""The Bounre Ultimatum"" changes the ending of part 2 by cutting the end in which Bourne is being told his true identity and starts one step earlier in Moscow again. So when they could do that why could they not have ""resurected"" Franka Potente again to make part 3 even better than it is now? Franka Potente would have been the real highlight of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" again and would have taken up the movie one or two levels higher than it stands now.Is there some kind of conspiracy in Hollywood against Potente because of her personality, independence, great acting ability and naturalness? Obviously this seems to be the case. Or was Matt Damon afraid that Potente might beat him in regard of acting as she did in part 1? The movie is great, but with Franka Potente being in it again it would have been even much greater like was the case with ""The Bourne Identity""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Stiles Shines.,"The film editors had to have been on Dramamine. I disliked the shaky camera and the half obscured views. I can understand a partially blocked view if there is a point to it. Like to represent some surreptitious filming but to have the camera view blocked by intervening objects, thus bring to the forefront that the character is being filmed, i.e. that they are actually actors doing a job, seems counterproductive. I would think the goal is to get the audience to forget that they are watching a crafted production and have them suspend disbelief and get involved in the story. The stylized camera work did the opposite. I was constantly reminded that the camera was purposely obscured with blurry objects for no reason but style, like look at this I'm blocking half the shot. Aren't I cleaver? I found it very irritating. This was the weakest of the three Bourne films with the action sequences shot in a way that obscured what was actually happening. I don't like the jittering hand-held camera and extreme close-ups. I think it detracts from the movie. Maybe it makes the cinematography easier since shots don't have to be composed, just move that camera in and most of the filming could be done in a broom closet. ""The DaVinci Code"" sucked for the some reason. Also the 21st century deus ex machina of computers was abundantly evident. A couple of keystrokes can replace intelligent writing easily plus the computers can be fickle and reveal all if needed while being conspicuously absent when suspense is needed. Matt Damon was good in his role, looking serious and troubled, and he was effective in the fight sequences, as far as I could tell. Joan Allen was very good as an intelligent mature woman, rare to see in the bimbo age of movies. David Strathairn, who I typically like, was too much of a cliché for my tastes. A standout was Julie Stiles. She had this tight lipped intelligent look. You could just see the wheels turning as she analyzed each situation I believed she was an intelligence operative who was trained to keep secrets and revealing very little of what she was feeling. She was great. Albert Finney did a competent job in another clichéd role. It seems that in these movies the idealistic, good people are young and the bastardly, manipulators are all old fogies. I would rate this movie as a weak 7 out of 10 on the basis of the strong performance of Ms. Stiles and Mr. Damon and on the basis of a continued compelling story. The camera work downgraded my rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Matt Damon is Bourne again to kill,"(My Synopsis) After having his memory erased, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is determined to find out who he really is. To do this, Jason must stay one step ahead of the people who turned him into a highly-trained killing machine. Jason doesn't know why he is being hunted, but he is going to find out no matter what it takes. Jason contacts Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), a journalist who has been investigating the Treadstone story for years. Ross has collected secret information about the Treadstone operation and the new operation named Blackbriar, which the U.S. government doesn't want to be revealed to the public. CIA assistant director Noah Vosen (David Strathaim), the new man in charge of Blackbriar, has been trying to stop Jason from finding the truth. Vosen sends a covert team of assassins out to neutralize Jason and Simon and close the chapter on Treadstone.(My Comment) As the third in a series of Bourne movies, this one does not disappoint. You do not need to see the other two (Identity and Supremacy) to see this one. The globetrotting around the world and suspenseful non-stop action is a real audience pleaser. The evading and outsmarting of his enemies is what makes this spy movie special. The fight scenes and chase sequences are incredible. The new assassins are up to the task of taking on Jason. Damon plays the indestructible Jason Bourne as someone we can root for in finding truth, justice, and the American way. If you like the Bourne movies, you must see this one. However, I must say that the motion from some of the hand held cameras will make you feel a little uneasy. But with all the action that is going on, I don't know how they would film the movie without using them. (Universal Pictures Inc., Run time 1:51, Rated PG-13)(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Superb concluding chapter to a a brilliant series,"I had the chance of watching THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM yesterday and I must say that I was really impressed with the amount of energy-pumping action that went out throughout the entire film. Never was there any dull moment in the film.The pacing was just right in that it was really quick (but not too quick) so much so that it did not quite feel like it was an almost 2-hour movie. The adrenalin rush was enough to keep the audience at the edge of their seats.Equipped with brilliant dialogues, scheming political conspiracies and lots and lots of governmental jargons, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is one film that qualifies as a truly action-packed concluding chapter in the Robert Ludlum's Bourne trilogy. In fact, the Bourne series itself should be considered as the longest action-thriller movie if all the films were put together.To wrap the film, the end credits rolled with the trademark Bourne song EXTREME WAYS by Moby.However, I was left rather unsatisfied at the end of the movie for the fate of Jason Bourne (or his true name, which I would not reveal). Although it is the concluding chapter to the Bourne series, I somehow felt as if the ending forces me to think that there is a need for a continuation.Nonetheless, it was a superb film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Nothing really new to see but fans of the series will know what to expect,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFollowing on from where the last film left off, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues to play cat and mouse with those who are tracking him down, desperately struggling to stay one step ahead of them and trying to get his memory back in a build-up to an explosive revenge at the end.The reviews had been touting this as the best in the series yet but to be honest I couldn't tell much difference between this and the other two, really. United 93 director Paul Greengrass is on hand for directing duties but his hand-held camera style of shooting is better suited to the docu-drama movies he makes rather than big screen adventures like this.One thing the film doesn't focus too much on is plot, bursting straight into the action movie element and flitting wildly between places, from Russia, to France, to London, to Spain and then onto Morrocco.To be fair, it would probably be better if you'd read the books first, but fans of the series probably won't find anything to complain with in the final film, which has proved a fine franchise and which Damon has firmly stamped his mark on as his own. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Exciting all the way, yes, but oh those hand-held camera shots!!!!","Despite all the comments in 'Supremacy' reviews about the amateur cameraman they used for all the wobbly hand-held shots, they went and used him again in 'Ultimatum', the idiots. At times you couldn't see what the action was supposed to be. Will they never learn? I guess the technique is trendy and is meant to convey frantic action, but it sure was overdone, the man must have thought he was hosing the garden. If he had tried to hold the camera as steady as possible, then it would have looked shaky enough. Anyone who has taken home movies will know the result. There was of course the obligatory car chase, and the bits that could be seen through all the camera-shake were certainly spectacular.

Haven't seen a better sequel in a decade!!!,"This ""Bourne"" movie was absolutely fantastic (Beyond my expectations)!!! The dialog delivery is awesome and so is the action and sound effects. The plot too is well developed and related to the first two prequels with emphasis on every minute aspect of each character. Also like its prequels, the movie is shot in many different countries which makes it immensely interesting to watch. I can watch this movie 10 times and yet be enthusiastic to watch it again. Usually sequels are not considered as good as their original theme. But this one is different. I can compare this sequel to my childhood favorite sequel of Terminator (part 2: The Judgment Day!!!.

Less than expected...,"Everyone is hyped up about this movie because the promoters did such a super job in promoting it. But there were many disappointments. First, the lack of plot. Chase, chase and more chase was the name of the game here. What they should have done was focus more on the why all of this is happening instead of the what. A lot of folks are seeing the Bourne series for the first time. Second, the limited use of other cast members (should have used the newspaper guy more). Why did the reporter exit so quickly in the storyline. Could have built more on him. Third, the blurred visuals(was that deliberate?). I go to the theater to see a clear, focused picture. I am hearing that the camera was shot this way on purpose, why???I could have waited for this on DVD. The Mission Impossible series had a better storyline. Maybe the Bourne Resurrection will be better....good try though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Out of Focus,"Great story, great dialog, fantastic scenery, but ...Get a new cameraman! The action scenes were filmed so close that you could NOT see anything happening other than a blur. Truly at least 50% of the action was a blur and could not be seen. The fights could not be appreciated at all because no one could see what was happening.Who wants to count the nose hairs of the actors when they fight or sit in the back seat of the car in the car chase. Neither vantage point allows one to see or appreciate all of the action.Viewers want to see all the action from a vantage point that allows them to appreciate the complexity and incredible coordination and timing of the actors and stunt people.I bought the DVDs of the first two movies and watch them often, but I won't be buying the third, for at least half of all action sequences are a blur! And the parts that are clear are so close you cannot see what is happening! Don't you have fans preview scenes for input? If you rely on professional reviewers, you will only get the boffo comments from those who want their names in print, so they can keep their jobs and increase their fame. They will only jump on the bandwagon and not give you an honest opinion.I raved about the first two to my family and friends, but this one gets my thumbs down for such poor camera work. Even my wife said, during the movie, that the camera was far too close to the actors to see what was going on. Really, a full 50% of the action was out of focus. Did you enjoy that? Who decided to change the way the story was filmed? Get rid of them and go back to the original format.Yeah, there needs to be more of these!!! The stories are superb.

Jason Bourne and the shaky cam return with a vengeance,"If you think the first two Bourne movies were out of control, that's only because you are reading this without having actually seen the third installment. The Bourne Ultimatum is a thrill ride of a movie, and wastes absolutely no time in getting started. What made the first two films very good is present in this one, plus much more. In it we have more crazy chases, insane camera work, over a dozen different settings, brutal fights, tense moments, and very limited slowdown. The plot is not as convoluted or as smart as the others, but we still have an engaging story that is full of twists, mysteries, and surprises. To top it all off, this is the most brutal of the three, as the production holds back no punches.The Bourne Ultimatum is basically about a cast of characters looking for closure. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) wants to find out what happened to him in the past, or his life will remain the way it isalways running, always hiding. Going after him is a top government official Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), whose closure is finding the wanted assassin dead. Re-seeking closure in the midst of the hunt are familiar faces Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who want the entire ordeal to be over once and for all and on peaceful terms. This chase runs through a good portion of the entire planet; jumps from Moscow to London to Morocco and finds it way back into the United States. One would think that with all these nice places we could stop and admire the scenery, but Greengrass wants us enjoying the conflict, not the landscapeleading to less than two seconds of overview footage of the current location.Matt Damon does an excellent job portraying Jason Bourne once again. His delivery is icy cold and merciless, as well as his fighting and his espionage skills. Yet underneath the tough exterior lies a torn man that has no idea what has happened to him, diminishing his trust in other people and his willingness to communicate. The other performances were good as well, notably Strahairn and Stiles. In terms of summer blockbusters, this movie has some of the best acting, nothing feels or sounds forced. The soundtrack in the Bourne Ultimatum is also superb, as it blends orchestrated work with the occasional techno and trance.Paul Greengrass is back with the shaky cam, but this time its just as frenzied as ever. While the camera does slow down during the calmer and more emotionally driven moments, the action scenes make up for it with a violent case of camera thrashing. The camera vibrates like its been through an earthquake, it gets hammered by props, gets a beating during the fight scenes, and ultimately has you right smack dab in the middle of the insanity. The technique is hit-and-miss, but here it works very well because you can actually see the subjects and you do not get confused as to who is who. Greengrass also directs one of the best foot chases in a very long time; the best chase in the series also turns into the most brutal fight in the series, as Bourne takes on a highly skilled assassin resulting in a fight that is the best in movies in quite some time.We have a much more straightforward plot that is easy to follow in the third installment. Within the first ten minutes, one can be fully caught up with what happened the previous two movies, which is an added plus. Most of the tense scenes involve a bunch of CIA folks in the office trying to figure out Bourne's next move, and that is usually followed by an intense chase. Like the other Bourne movies, there is no remorse or mercy towards the vehicles, as we get not one, but two vehicular chases, both meshed in with on-foot chases. By the end of the chases, we will have unrecognizable cars sprinkled throughout the setting, leaving the viewers gasping for breath. The best part of Bourne Ultimatum (besides the action) is that all questions are answered; all loose ends are tied together. Troy Gilroy and Scott Z. Burns craft a screenplay that may not be as smart or as engaging as the original, but is much easier to follow.Bottom Line: The definitive action movie of the summer has arrived, and stands as one of the smartest action movies since the second installment. Trading in humor and unnecessary subplots for more action and suspense, The Bourne Ultimatum never feels slow, never feels forced, and doesn't bore the audience with unnecessary scenes created to just extend the running time. From the very beginning the conflict is presented; and after visiting half a dozen countries and witnessing jaw-dropping scene after jaw-dropping scene, you will be left desiring more. Fans of the first two movies will not be disappointed, but if you have not seen the first two movies, it is required to watch Identity and Supremacy before enjoying this powerhouse flick. The Bourne Ultimatum is a another great addition to the series, and rises as one of the better movies to come out in 2007.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Bourne Identity was good but when Supremacy came out people questioned the freshness of the ideas, this one is good because there is lots of original stuff added.A must see movie this year!

"Best of the series, but that's not saying much","Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), or whoever he is, continues to be on the run from the police, innocent people, the CIA, and the world at large. He's scared, he's frustrated, and he's in mourning, since losing his beloved Marie (whom he met in the first Bourne movie and who died in the second). Bourne's put together a little bit of his past, after killing scores of people with skills he didn't know he had, but now a British reporter has published a series of articles about Bourne - and they seem to contain a lot more detail than an outsider would have. This sets the plot in motion, as Bourne's flushed out into the open in London, and the CIA battles with itself to either bring him in or shoot him dead like a dog.You can see the frustration build on Damon's increasingly creased face; he's looking older, weathered, beaten down - although Bourne can still disarm two strong bastards quick like a bunny rabbit. Jason Bourne doesn't have much to go on regarding his former life, but he's able to grasp at a couple of loose threads and weave a comfy blanket out of them. That sort of sums up this movie, really - it's a comfy blanket that doesn't go overboard in trying to wow the viewer while avoiding the appearance of stagnation. Damon has grown rather well into the lead - ironically, he looks a hell of a lot more believable here than he did as Edward Wilson in the recent The Good Shepherd. Damon's grim and determined but not robotic; he appears to be a couple of steps ahead of the audience, anyway, and that's what's important.Helping Damon out is an excellent supporting cast. Joan Allen is back as CIA operative Pamela Landy and manages to look tough while not looking bitchy. Great job, Joan! David Strathairn joins the cast as CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen, with an aging Scott Glenn as the agency's director. Turns out Strathairn (who's also a fantastic actor - see him in Good Night, and Good Luck, for example) and Allen have tremendous chemistry together; their in-office battles could have come off as just histrionics, but both actors use steely glares in lieu of angsty shouting. When these two were on screen, the tension was palpably thick, and you were always wondering if the characters had ulterior motives in how they want to deal with Bourne.Also back is Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons; her scenes with Damon far supersede those he had with Franka Potente in the first two Bourne films. So much is said with a flit of the eyes, with a curl of a lip. We aren't beat over the head with Nicky's motivations - in fact, they're left rather vague, which is good - and neither she nor Bourne behaves quite as predicted when they're interacting.I wasn't a huge fan of the first in the series (The Bourne Identity), and I felt that the second (The Bourne Supremacy) was a little bit better. This one, purportedly the last of them, is the best of the lot, although that's perhaps damning with faint praise. One trouble is that there are plot holes that you can drive a car through. Another is that when director Paul Greengrass wants to film an action scene, he makes sure no cut lasts more than a half-second, else your brain would be able to follow what's going on. It's extremely chaotic, intended to convey the sense of how a real fistfight or car crash would appear, but still - I don't need the scenes to be so realistic that I get a headache from watching them. This is supposed to be fun for me! A favorite dumb moment - Bourne's involved in a high-speed chase that culminates with his car hitting a parked car and then getting slammed by the chasing car, from behind. Bourne, of course, exits his car with a few scratches, although the guy who slammed INTO him dies while slumped over his car. Makes little sense. Sure, we need to see violent crashes - it's the American way! - but c'mon. No injuries? Heck, at least Bruce Willis limped a bit in the new Die Hard movie.And finally, although this is alleged to be the last of the Bournes, it's all left rather open ended. Which is a shame, really; at the end, you'll notice there's a great chance to finish the series definitively without making it seem too pat. And the filmmakers passed this up, presumably to ensure they could have another shot at making millions more dollars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
I can't believe people actually like this movie,"I was a big fan of this franchise and recommend both of the first 2 movies. This one however left me feeling like I had just sat through a continuous 2 hour chase/fight scene.There was virtually no plot, just one chase and fight scene after another. And almost all of this non-stop action was filmed with cameras shaking all over the place.Directors who think that a shaking camera means action should be forced to sit through their own unwatchable scenes until they puke.Even some of few scenes that weren't action scenes were shot with unsteady hand held cameras.And there were tons of ""clever"" extra tight shots that added nothing.All and all a huge disappointment for me.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Adrenaline Junkies Wanted,"What a great action movie. The Bourne Ultimatum keeps the pace going from start to finish, with particularly exhilarating fight scenes in the middle segments in Tangiers.That being said, some of the more interesting human elements from the first two films are missing here. The fact that Marie is gone puts a bit of a damper on Bourne's emotional development (if that's what you're here for, anyways). He's back to kicking butt and taking names, which is perfectly fine for me.Overall, the performances are strong throughout. We aren't really introduced to any new characters who are particularly compelling, which is unfortunate. We do get a bit of an expansion of Julia Stiles's character, who is really minor in the first two movies. Her strange and strained relationship w/ Jason is probably the only part of the film that breaks out of the constant rush of action being thrown at you on the screen.The camera work, much discussed, is not always great. The shakiness can be a bit much at times, particularly when there isn't a great fight scene going on.

Action-PACKED!!!,"This is one of those rare third episodes that really lives up to the first two. Very very good indeed! The action begins even before the beginning credits. Then, throughout the movie, this action is relentless. Those motorcycle and foot chase scenes in streets and houses of Tangiers and the car chase scenes on the streets of New York City are really editing masterpieces. Very exciting! The direction of Paul Greengrass does not disappoint. It was breathtaking. All the scenes are important. There is no wasted time.As with the first two installments, there is very little downtime in this. In fact, the downtime is very similar to the first two, where Bourne is in the company of a female, and washes up.Honestly, during the first Bourne movie, ""The Bourne Identity"", I did not think that Matt Damon would be a good action star. In fact, I believe I did not watch that one until I watched and was very impressed with the second installment ""The Bourne Supremacy"". Matt is really very good and convincing as Bourne, in all three. In this one, the drama was more intense as Bourne comes into information that leads him from Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, Tangiers, and New York, back to the very facility where his new violent life began. Matt's talents as a dramatic actor balances perfectly with his physical prowess in the amazing stunts.I think this is really a great action and espionage trilogy I would probably watch all over again, together, one day.

But after the great beginning The Bourne Ultimatum deteriorates into the same old, same old, CIA, NSA bad guys against the rogue covert ops hero. Boring! Too bad they didn't use more intelligence when they wrote the script. Sure car chases and fight scenes are nice, if you're a 17-25 year old male, but come on the rest of us want to see a little more than the camera swinging around as someone gets killed. They had some great opportunities to do something really smart but they failed to do it. And let me say one more thing, the character Marie was used very well in the first movie and even Pam Landy (well played by Joan Allen) in the second, but this time both female roles (Niki and Landy)were wasted. Come on women might not need to fight but we can certainly use our brains. I got so tired of the closeups of Niki doing and saying absolutely nothing. And poor Pam Landy though heroic we never get to see how she thinks. Too bad 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Too much of a good thing,"I loved the first two Bourne films, and had high expectations of the third especially because of the higher user rating here on IMDb for this final installment. Apparently there are many movie enthusiasts out there that like the relentless fast action and shaking camera.The Bourne character is for me a much better version of James Bond. More real, more human. More vulnerable yet more lethal. And Matt Damon plays a great Bourne. It's these qualities and the realism of the fighting and chasing that really jumped out in the first two Bourne films.The excessive camera shake and hasty flashing from one camera to the other in this third installment are over the top and don't contribute any more to these qualities. In fact they diminish them. It's just the director trying to grab your attention by force. The Bourne Ultimatum is a classical case of too much of a good thing.What happened here is similar to what happens in many sequels: more effects, less character and less story.Matt Damon is still worth watching though.....",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Money and Time well Wasted!!!!,"1 Hour and 56 minutes long. With a 1 hour and 50 minute chase scene. A foot chase, car chase, and a motorcycle chase. That is the whole movie. And then there is the camera work, I have seen better done by dear old dad with his Super 8 Bell & Howell at home. Yes, there is some acting, about six minutes worth. Remember Albert Finney, well that is the highlight of the film as far as true acting is concerned. To bad it is for only the tail end of the movie. This film was made for one reason only, to get $8.00 out of your purse and into the pockets of some Hollywood producer.

Authentic Bourne style... continued,"I was wondering if this third or fourth Bourne movie would be following the same sad and very disappointing path of ""Die Hard"". But it did not. The film brilliantly continues the saga from the beginning to the end, with a clear and well structured story, with some audacious stunts that however never end up in absolutely absurd evolutions. Bourne is a killer, very well trained in his job, but has also a human side, which he shows in a very natural way. No false morale, not pathetic, not hypocrites. He is authentic. And the film has exactly the right ingredients, not too much and not too less. And it leaves the spectator open to imagine a further film, where maybe our hero gets a little more closer to his female co-star. It was a pleasure to watch this movie, that shows that you can very well entertain without swear words, without sex, without pure and extreme violence. Well done...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"...""We'd be talking face to face...""","I have to say it's been a while since I walked out of a theater wanting to tell everyone how enthused I was about the film I'd just seen. In the case of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", I would especially mention the ultimately satisfying ending, so subtle, yet so satisfying, that Greengrass could accomplish so much in an action film with a simple Mona Lisa-like smile and a limp, submerged body suddenly coming to life. And there are some classic scenes. For me, the scene where Bourne calls Noah Vosen in his car, and the exchange goes something like ""Where are you now?"" ""I'm in my office."" Etc, etc...Priceless. I would also mention the scene in Victoria Station, with the planted cell phone. I thought at times that Noah was almost too evil (did he have a loving wife? Kids? A dog?), and I felt sorry at first for Joan Allen, a superbly talented actress who looked like she was about to become the cold, calculating operative I remember from ""Identity"". (Some posts here may suggest I got that wrong.) Anyway, there's nothing like redemption. And she gets hers, big time. Frankly, it's made me want to watch ""Identity"" again.

The hand held camera works fine, and the sounds effects editing is fantastic. 9/10 But this comment is not aimed about my feelings on the movie. I just gave you them in a nutshell.

An Okay Script Ruined By Terrible Camera Work,"I'm on the third of the initial Bourne Trilogy movies as I prep for ""Jason Bourne"", and that has brought me to ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", a film I had not seen since it was first in theaters in 2007. I remember thinking at the time that the camera work was troubling for me. It was even more so seeing it on Blu Ray. At the time I gave the movie 8/10 stars, but on this second viewing I have to go with only six.This film is a direct sequel to ""The Bourne Supremacy"", and picks up exactly where that film picks up. The script is okay, but not great. I won't go into details so as not to write a spoiler, but the film centers around Jason Bourne uncovering more about his past life, and the climax of the movie is sort of the big reveal about that past life--and that big reveal was, to me, pretty hokey. The whole thing felt forced, and a bit like a caricature, or something you expect from a comic book character rather than a spy movie.But the real thing that kills this movie is its terrible camera work. I get that it was the mid-2000's and the whole jittery camera technique was a thing, but goodness is it ever annoying. And the overwhelming majority of the film uses this technique. It makes you feel like you're on a ride at an amusement park, and it just doesn't work for me at all. I might have given this film seven or eight stars had it not been for the camera work, but that nuisance drops this movie down to a six. It's good, but not great--and a step down from ""The Bourne Supremacy"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Pretty Good but not a ""Top 250""....","I saw this on Saturday in a full house of Bourne enthusiasts and I have to say that the first 30-45 minutes had me enthralled. The story was compelling, acting was great, and the camera was alive in a way that really drew me into the story.Somewhere about half-way through it, though, it began to get repetitive and the bond that had developed between me and the movie was broken, and I found myself thinking, and questioning some of the logic and ""tradecraft"". Now these are small things but I'm going to mention them here because eventually they became problematic for me.First of all -- major plot point -- after the car bomb Jason Bourne goes to New York because in the wreckage of the dead guy's briefcase he sees a scrap of a top secret cover sheet of a ""Blackbriar"" file that has the actual address of the ""deep cover"" CIA NY Anti-terrorism unit on it. Guys, I've got to tell you -- no way.Secondly, when Nikki Sparrow comes into the Madrid sub-office Noah and company KNOW there are two dead or unconscious bodies there, minimum, and Jason Bourne somewhere in the area. Yet when he does the ""authentication"" question: ""are you okay"" and she has a choice ""ruby"" meaning ""I'm under duress"" or ""everest"", I'm okay -- it's silly that she says ""everest"" and they just accept it. A), Bourne would understand and they would know he understands the drill, B), whether Bourne is there or not, it's certainly not a normal situation. This goes on a bit as they, after this scene, just ignore Nikki and leave her with access to all systems even though they would have to be very concerned that she's not controlled any more.Thirdly -- I'm no CIA specialist but over the years one thing that is clear is that the CIA doesn't put sensitive offices on the outside of buildings in Manhattan where there is line of sight into the offices. Yet in this movie (and all the Bourne movies), he always manages to get on a roof across the street and can look right into Pam Landy's office (or Noah's). This is great dramatically but I think it would work better if the film-makers made it the way it really is -- with sensitive offices being buried deep within the bowels of a building (particularly if it's a city building) rather than on the perimeter.Anyway -- my point is not so much to take issue with the film-makers on these points, but rather to illustrate that the repetitiveness caused my mind to wander into these areas rather than stay locked in the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Ultimatum Makes for a Good Action-Thriller,"I enjoyed The Bourne Identity thoroughly, but I was somewhat let down by its sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. Now, Supremacy director Paul Greengrass brings us the final film of the trilogy - The Bourne Ultimatum.Identity was cool because it introduced us to Jason Bourne. There were some great action sequences, notably an apartment fight and a car chase, and it played out like a good espionage/spy/international thriller flick.The second to me seemed like more of the same. Also, Doug Liman was replaced by Paul Greengrass. I have the utmost respect for Greengrass, but I didn't like all the shakiness utilized in the cinematography that he's kind of known for. Shaky camera is distracting, and why do you want a distraction from a well choreographed fight scene or car chase or whatever? And it didn't seem like all that much had been accomplished - the movie essentially ended where it started.Then we come to Ultimatum. Greengrass is back for this one, and there's still some of that shaky camera, but it's less distracting than in Supremacy; I think this can be attributed to the fact that there's less of it and that there's more flair in the action scenes. Speaking of action scenes, Ultimatum has one of the best fights I've ever seen. Think of the bathroom brawl at the start of Casino Royale extended for several minutes. It's pretty cool. There's also a decent car chase, ending in a great crash, but it's not as exciting now since these have become typical occurrences in the Bourne movies.Unlike Supremacy, however, Ultimatum does advance the storyline of the Bourne universe. In fact, the biggest development in the whole trilogy probably happens at the end of this one.Overall, it was a pretty good summer flick, much more intelligent than the Hollywood fare we've enjoyed thus far, this summer. A little sophistication is nice after the likes of Shrek 3 (ugh), Transformers, and Rise of the Silver Surfer. Still, I think the action could have been a little more streamlined and the whole movie in general a little more enthralling. But I won't complain. It's definitely one of the best movies I've seen this summer, probably even the past couple of summers. Bourne fans won't be disappointed.I give it a 7.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Best action movie of 2007!,"Matt Damon returns in the third and most likely final instalment of the Bourne franchise as Jason Bourne. A man trying to unravel his past hunted by his enemies and pursued across the globe he is searching for answers and this time he may just find what he's looking for.With two suspenseful and action-packed blockbusters behind it (The Bourne Identity and the Bourne Supremacy) The Bourne Ultimatum wastes no time upping the anti with plenty of intense, pulse-pounding action.Picking up right after the second film (Supremacy) it quickly delves into the story, flashing back and forth between locations and never slows down however unlike previous action romps (including this year's Die Hard 4.0) the action scenes and sheer suspense in Ultimatum serve to move the story forward, and are mindless by no means - which is the great thing about this franchise. It doesn't over-do anything, keeping it believable but unbelievable at the same time if that makes any sense.Paul Greengrass directs with precision while the quick-cuts and flash cinematography only enhance the intensity of the car chases and fist fights, Matt Damon is excellent in the role and the supporting cast plays there part to a tee.If this is the last of the Bourne Franchise they went out on top because this is not only the best of the trilogy, it's the best action movie of 2007 period.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
not as good as the first one,"first i'd like to say that lately movies are well over rated like Ratatouille, which is nice but does not deserve an 8.5, i mean were basically saying that it is as good as matrix and lord of the rings. here's the thing, the only movies that deserve to be voted over 8 are good, quality, smart movies, and Ratatouille is not, and definitely not ""the bourne ultimatum"" which is no more the a regular, little above average, action movie that deserves a 7. the first one in the trilogy, ""the bourne identity"", is a smart interesting movie that shows you how the c.i.a ""brain washes"" their soldiers to an extent that even if they will get amnesia and won't remember their own names or anything about themselves they still will remember all their training, which is seen in the first movie in the scene where he sleeps on the bench and two swiss officers came and told him to get up and when one of them touched him with their stick he kicked their asses and was so surprised he able to do that. this demonstrates the ""brain wash"" he was put through. there for i would give this movie a 7.8, but the third one, which was not special and smart at all, i would give a 7, barely.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"The viewing audiences may be below par, but the film's enjoyable","Okay, folks, I must be one in a thousand, since I was the only one to laugh at a line in the movie ""Bourne Ultimatum"" where a lead character says ""you can't make this stuff up."" In case you don't get the joke, the movie is fiction, so the whole thing is made up. And if you doubt it, then you may believe that George Washington's niece was the first spy for what later became the CIA, and her great-great-grandson George Bush (the father of W.) later became head of the CIA.

I remember everything,"One of better movie series of the last decades possibly concludes with the release of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", the third movie that follows super-secret spy/assassin Jason Bourne as he attempts to track down his past against the wishes of the United States government that trained him. The original, ""The Bourne Identity"", was one of the best pure action movie in recent years. The sequel, 2004's ""Bourne Supremacy"", was unsure and not quite as polished, but still solid. Now comes the series third installment, which just about wraps up the summer movie season.The storyline follows a natural progression from the previous two movies. Now that Bourne has figured out who he is now and atoned somewhat for his sins, he wants to know who he was. In order to do that, he must race the government to various people who know the secrets behind his black-ops work.Few cinematic characters are as perfect for action movies as Jason Bourne, from both an action and narrative standpoint. As he learns his past, he takes the audience along for the ride. But that process is not tedious backstory or mediocre character development, as is often the case in such movies. Instead, his quest is the story, which makes for a rapid-fire flick that simultaneously entertains and enlightens. Matt Damon's determined yet understated demeanor is ideal for the role, and the no-frills approach never distracts from a driving story that is filled with plenty of high-tech action.In a lesser movie, the technological implausibilities might weaken the movie or distract from the storyline. But ""Ultimatum"" dodged that bullet in two ways. First, the story moves quickly enough that the viewer barely has time to think about what might or might not work before the flick is on to the next frenetic sequence. Secondly, the movie does not use the technology as a dominant point of the movie, like ""Enemy of the State"". Instead the devices are merely a means to an end.Also overshadowing the technology is another strong supporting cast. The always-good Joan Allen returns this time, joined by Scott Glenn and David Straithairn, from ""Good Night and Good Luck"". Strathairn and Allen are compelling in every scene, particularly when they are together. Their exchanges crackle without flying over the top, and their restrained focus is as intense as any shouting match. They add a layer of gravity to the goings-on that separates ""Ultimatum"" from other summer action like ""Live Free or Die Hard"".Other differences between this and ""Die Hard"" lie in the technical aspects of the film. Director Paul Greengrass also helmed ""Supremacy"", and he and his crew remedied one of the main problems of the second movie, which was the overly shaky camera work. Most of the shots are still hand-held, but they are more static than before and pulled back a little in the fights. The music is surprisingly good too. As Bourne trots through Europe and Africa, the music travels along, mixing in pulsing strings, African drums, and even going completely silent when appropriate.""Ultimatum"" often echoes ""Identity"", which is a good thing. Both possess a similar driving intensity interspersed with quiet moments that allow humanity to leak through. This one lacks the originality of ""Identity"", but replaces it with the satisfying resolution that Bourne is seeking. On the whole, as the summer movie season wraps up, this is the best action film of the last few months. It's better than ""Die Hard"", although it doesn't provide as much fun. It's a better film; ""Die Hard"" is a better movie, if that makes sense.Bottom Line: Better than the second; not quite as good as the original, but still a bang-up way to end the summer movie season.

Bourne to be Bourne,"After the release of The Bourne Idenity people started referring to the movie as the better Bond, the psychological Die Hard. When the second movie was released Bourne became an international superstar of an action hero who's name is not unknown by many. And now, with the release of the Bourne Ultimatum, it has been confirmed that Matt Damon has taken a name and turned it into an unforgettable phenomenon. The Bourne Ultimatum not only exceeds its predecessors, but it also makes an attempt to be considered the best action movie ever made.

I believe that it takes a certain level of genius to depict a genius character,"I believe that it takes a certain level of genius to depict a genius character showing how intelligent he or she is. It's one thing to declare a character as ""genius"", as many stories do, without it ever being shown in his or her actions or words (beyond cheaply throwing in the occasional ""big words""). But it's a whole 'nother when the intelligence of the character is plainly visible in front of your eyes.Much of the credit for this goes to Robert Ludlum, the author of the Bourne novels, for creating the character and the story in the first place. After coming up with the scenario and overall theme, Ludlum had to ask, at every single corner of the story, ""What would this genius do next?"" He had to become and think exactly like the character Bourne, who is very intelligent. It takes intelligence and creativity to get in the mind of an intelligent character like that.In fact most of the characters in the entire film are pretty smart, and convincingly so. This is a tough thing to achieve in the film world; when it's done poorly, it's fairly transparent and the character just doesn't seem bright even though he or she is depicted as such. It's the lack of intelligent writing (and perhaps acting) that makes you feel that they just aren't what they're portrayed to be.This is why Tony Gilroy, the screen story writer, gets a large portion of the credit as well. He has displayed that he knows which bits work better just left to the book and which were translatable into film, and carefully sewed together a modified version of the story that just works better in a film context than the book's would have.I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of Paul Greengrass's directing style as a whole; the intentionally shaky camera can feel a bit gimmicky and sometimes even amateur. But I also must say that he was a smart choice for director of this particular film. The style fits the fast pacing and there's something about the very raw, quick feel about it that works well. The cuts give you the sense that there's no time for breathing room, because there basically isn't. Bourne has a mission and can't waste a single second. It never really gets slow or boring; it constantly grips your attention.One very subtle thing I love in this film is the extremely unspoken romance between Bourne and Nikki Parsons, played by Julia Stiles. Fitting with their personalities and jobs, they both don't reveal a single word of it but you can just feel it's there, especially when Stiles delivers the line ""With you, it was ... difficult..."" You know what she really is saying there, but they never reveal anything directly beyond that.To top all of it off, the film offers some of the slickest fighting in the past decade. Excellent choreography and once again just plain intelligent, not just on Bourne's end but also his opponent's. He is, of course, going up against some of the most highly-trained killers alive, so naturally they have a different kind of smarts about them, combat.This film just plain and simple delivers intelligence in almost every arena: story, writing, acting, characters, choice of director, fighting, and certainly plenty of CIA ""intelligence"".

Bourne ends with a blast but I'm glad it's the last (oh my that rhymes!).,"Yes, I'm quite the poet.One thing that the Bourne movies also really learned us is that magazines, books and towels can be more lethal weapons than guns or knives. I mean with this that the Bourne movies mostly redefined the action genre by having the guts to be different and original.Still I am glad it's the last out the Bourne series, also because this one is definitely the least out of the Bourne series. They with this movie obviously ran out of ideas and this movie is also mostly a rehash of the previous two Bourne movies. It's really more of the same and actually made me realize how much alike all of the Bourne movies actual really are to each other. The story is actually quite similar to the second movie, also because halve of this movie is set at the same time the second movie was set in (getting confusing?). There again is also an assassin on Jason's tail and his superiors once more want to see him dead to cover up illegal secret mission and.Just because you have lots of shaking camera-work and fast editing doesn't mean you have a good action movie as well. It makes the movie fast paced but in my opinion they could had gone a bit more easy on its style. Paul Greengrass already sort of overused this with the previous movie ""The Bourne Supremacy"". The shaky cam and all works great for its action sequences and more realistic moments, such as in the other Paul Greengrass movie ""Bloody Sunday"" but making an entire action movie, with an obvious fictitious over-the-top action story is a whole other thing. The same goes for the overall same gritty visual style. This visually has as a result that Madrid looks absolutely the same as New York, New York looks like Moscow and Moscow looks like Tangiers. A reason why I think they could had gone a bit more easy on its consistent visual style.As a matter of fact once you really start thinking about it, this movie isn't even really THAT action filled, in terms of having lots of fights, chases and explosions.The main reason why this movie is in my opinion the least out of the Bourne series is simply because of its story. This movie has such an incredible simple storyline that it really seems that they simply pushed it entirely to the background and let the action instead tell the entire story on its own. Nothing wrong with it, since this definitely worked out for the movie but it of course is a very cheap way of film-making, that makes you get away with practically everything. And does this movie really reach a satisfying enough conclusion for the trilogy? In my opinion not really, since I don't really have the reason that lots have changed for Bourne. Somehow I don't think he picks up a normal quiet life after all he has been trough.Matt Damon is perhaps the biggest winner after his three Bourne movies. Before these movies he sort of had a dull and very boyish, nerd like image. His career was already getting sort of slow, before he signed up for the first Bourne movie. He by now has officially been taking serious by lots of critics and movie goers all over the world and he has proved that he can actually handle action really well and is even a convincing action star. Joan Allen also luckily returns in this movie and so does Julia Stiles, though I have the feeling they should had dropped her two movies ago. David Strathairn, Scott Glenn and Albert Finney are some of the new welcome additions to the cast this time.It's a real fancy and fast, slick looking action flick, that all in all forms a satisfying enough conclusion of the Bourne trilogy.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

The Bourne Ultimatum caps off the trilogy and nicely ties up all lose ends. Bourne's field craft is better than ever, and the fight scenes are simply stunning.

2 hour video game,"Before the movie begins is an advertisement for ""The Bourne Ultimatum video game"".

When the editing of a movie takes center stage over story, acting, and every other element, this is what you get; a relentless roller coaster ride that defies common sense, emotion, wonder or anything else, because it's moving so fast all you can do is hang on and wait until it's over. For adrenal junkies this is just the ticket to pound you into submission. Don't expect anything else and you may enjoy this film more. I own Bourne Identity, and have watched it many times, and each time it is enjoyable. That is not the case with either the Bourne Supremacy or Ultimatum. Once was more than enough.

Superior spy thriller and a great close to an excellent trilogy,"The Bourne trilogy is certain to be considered one of the best ever, especially when compared with the uneven Pirates, Matrix and Spiderman outings. In terms of consistency, Bourne has come up with the goods for all three films, with Ultimatum being a fitting, breathless and stylish conclusion.Unlike the previous two films however, Ultimatum plunges headlong into the action before the title card even appears. Picking up from where the last film, Supremacy, left off, we follow Bourne as his escapes Moscow and continues to pursue his past. As more detailed flashbacks start to emerge, Bourne gets closer than ever to finding out his origins as an assassin. His first stop is a British reporter who has been getting leaked information on Bourne and various black ops.The pace of the film is relentless and aside from a scene where Bourne visits his dead girlfriend's brother, there is barely a moment to catch a breath. This is because, once again, the CIA are determined to find Bourne and terminate him at all costs. This time, his journey takes him across four continents with a whole bunch of hit men after him. The action sequences are, once again, fantastic and include a number of brutal punch-ups and a couple of awesome chase sequences.The story itself is very satisfying, with revelatory moments packing the punch they need. This is helped largely by the late appearance of Albert Finney as Bourne's ""creator"". Matt Damon fits back into the role like a pair of old slippers and there's not one weak link in the chain, with regards to the other actors and the script.In fact, Ultimatum plays like a greatest hits of the first two Bourne films - not just in terms of action. The score brings together all the music from Identity and Supremacy, while key scenes and lines are recreated. Incidentally, there's also a brilliant moment where the last scene from Supremacy is used (the conversation between Landy and Bourne), which shows that this is a trilogy that rewards those paying attention as well as those in search of a slam-bang chase thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Please don't spoil this fabulous trilogy with a fourth,"Sequels are the most annoying habit of modern American cinema for me. More often than not they have the smell of money making greed running through them instead of wanting to create something special with a logical and satisfying ending to the series.The Bourne Ultimatum has succeeded in rounding of a fantastic trilogy of films in the way I described above. Along the way it has provided thrills and spills with excellently executed to give the maximum buzz. This final? instalment ramps up the tension dramatically and steers clear of any kind of mushy ending which would'be been a real letdown.I seriously love these films. My only quibble relates to Greengrass's obsession with using 'shaky-cam' to heighten the tension. In places it is highly effective, but in the longer dialogue/office scenes it gets rather annoying. It's a minor complaint but I still think it's an exceptional, well thought through ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Still the benchmark,"14 years on and this film still sets the benchmark for action thrillers. It is said that the Bourne trilogy forced the Bond series to up its game, well in comparison, Bond needs to keep trying.Damon, Stiles Strathairn and Allen are all brilliant in their roles but the real skill here is Greengrass with his direction and editing. No shot is longer than 2 seconds which adds a constant edginess, atmosphere and pace that never lets up. Add this to the brilliant story and what we have is a masterpiece of its genre which is yet to be equalled.The story should've ended here with Ultimatum, but even if the final instalment was weaker than the trilogy, you can't blame it for trying.If the Bourne trilogy is going to be beaten, it'll be by something special .....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Damn good movie, almost spoilt by not using a steady-cam","Great movie! Love the trilogy! Overall the movie would have benefited from more use of a stead-cam. The out-of-focus pieces (shoulders, posts, walls) in the foreground of the shot are real artistic, but get real annoying when it's all filmed with a hand held camera. The fight scenes are pasted together from multiple shots, quick edits, bam, bam, bam, cut here, cut there, then combine that with the shakiness of the hand held and I find it very distracting. I would have much preferred longer scenes, with fewer cuts.Will be interesting to see if another movie is produced following the Eric van Lustbader continuation of the series.Krazymann71",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Solid Film to Finish the Original Trilogy,"This is one that I saw in theater. I was the first one that I saw all the way through as well. Jaime and I decided to finish out this trilogy since she's enjoyed the previous two well enough. It had been awhile since I saw it as well so I wondering how it would hold up.For this, we are picking up where the last one left off. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is hunting down those that were a part of Treadstone. It is here that he learns they still are doing missions, but it has become Black Briar. Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) is convinced that Bourne is a problem so they need him killed. I should also point out that they're doing illegal things with monitoring people.There is also a reporter who is turned on to these events. He is out to publish the truth, but that also makes him a target. Bourne tries to find him before it is too late. All of this will lead him who he is and the truth of his time as the sleeper agent that he is.That is where I'm going to leave my recap as this one is like the previous ones. I don't mean that to say this is bad. This is an interesting espionage movie that has more under the surface. You can enjoy this as an action movie. Seeing Damon as Bourne is great. His abilities are amazing to me. He knows where all the exits are. He is sizing everyone up and he's always two steps ahead. Even when he has trained agents or killers after him, he does what he can to survive.Now what I was saying about under the surface, we are dealing with the idea of the government making people into sleeper cells. In this case, we learn that Bourne volunteered for it. That doesn't mean that he deserves what they do to him. He is dangerous though so I get that. I just like the social commentary that is there.From there, I should bring up the rest of the cast. We bring back Julia Stiles and Joan Allen. They're both good. We also have the likes of Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine, Albert Finney, Corey Johnson and Daniel Brühl. They're all solid across the board. There isn't a bad performance and that includes the rest of the cast.The only things left to bring up are the filmmaking. This is shot well. I think the cinematography is good. I like how it feels like we're seeing what Bourne is and it almost feels like we get a taste of being a secret agent. The effects are good. It looks like they did all that they could with practical which I appreciate. Other than that, I think that soundtrack fits for what was needed. I don't love this movie, but if you are into the sub-genre like we get here, I think this is worth your time. Even for the third in what was originally planned as a trilogy.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
this truly is a magnificent flick,"The Bourne Ultimatum reviewed by Samuel OsbornThe auditorium in which I screened The Bourne Ultimatum was filled to capacity and humming comfortably with the floating refreshment of air conditioning when I took my seat. By the film's end, the theatre was still full to capacity but the room's temperature had risen several uncomfortable degrees. The air conditioning was furiously rattling, expelling refrigerated air as efficiently as possible, but it couldn't keep up with the perspiration-inducing intensity that the film had caused our heart-rates to rise to. The film had indirectly made the room hotter. Talk about global warming.Stoic, solemn, and robotic, Jason Bourne returns for his trilogy capper, The Bourne Ultimatum. Less of a continuation and more of an upgrade from The Bourne Supremacy, this third installment, working off of Robert Ludlum's source material again, invents new memories for the amnesiac hero to remember. What used to be Operation Treadstone has now been upgraded to Operation Blackbriar and Mr. Bourne was (of course) involved with it in some corner of his blurry past.As Ultimatum picks up almost immediately after Supremacy left off, Jason Bourne is still on the run, hurdling cops like leapfrog and outrunning the CIA like they were a pack of blind, one-legged cats. Falling in beside the defensive, calculating Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) as the CIA's resident Bourne expert is Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Vosen heads up the Blackbriar gang and has hooked a reporter, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), whose exposure stories on Bourne have uncovered confidential information. Because the information concerns Bourne's past and because it's a matter of national security, Ms. Landy, Mr. Vosen, and Mr. Bourne are all on his trail.Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93) wastes zero time in mining the action from this storyline. As a filmmaker, his edit points are quick, his camera shaky, and his close-ups constant. He wants realism and he wants his action to appear in real-time. The pseudo-documentary style he's becoming known for is at its best here, muting the spectacle of his stunts to make room for believability in the play-pretend realism. And since it appears many of his stunts were actually coordinated on setand not in front of a computer monitorthe realism is certainly accepted as, well, real.For this reason, The Bourne Ultimatum sprints as a missile for the moon. It's fast and sometimes infuriatingly so, as it rounds plot corners at double-time, leaving us confused and choking on its dust. But all is forgiven when a clever foot-chase is launched, when Bourne kicks down the clutch of a motorcycle, as he hijacks an NYPD squad car, as he leaps from a roof, etc, etc. Luckily his stunts are as loud as they are intelligent. And since Bourne stays generally low-tech with his tricks, he becomes a sort of spy-version of MacGyver.Though I'm not positive as to how essential this installment is to the Bourne legacy. CIA Director Ezra Kramer is discussing the Bourne subject with Ms. Landy early on in the story. Both are unsure of Bourne's importance to the agency, weighing out the possibility of giving up the search altogether. Landy mentions that maybe he's not involved with this particular quarrel at all; that this isn't Bourne's fight. Kramer shrugs, frowns, and says, ""Well, let's keep looking."" It seems even the fictional players are stretching their connection to Bourne to keep this story chugging. And it's true; the Bourne legacy doesn't require this story to be told. This becomes apparent when the same good joke from the second film is repeated twice more in the third; and also when the action set-pieces are nearly the same, if not extended to a more satisfying length. Like I said, this is more of an upgrade than a sequel.But don't think I'm complaining. The intelligence of the screenplay is a damned marvel. To craft the delicate logic of such a complex CIA tale deserves a merit on its own. And so what if it's a formula their running through the Hollywood factory for another go-round? The last film was the best spy film in ages. Just imagine how good this upgraded version is. And technically The Bourne Ultimatum does have its own (very valid) storyline that jet-sets Jason from Morocco to Paris to London to Madrid and finally to good ole' Manhattan. And though what character building that's continued here may not be required viewing for any Bourne enthusiast, the power that David Strathairn most certainly is. Skeletal and sever, Strathairn's Noah Vosen is a formidable needle of a villain. He's human, as all CIA leaders claim to be, but that trait is buried beneath a permafrost mounted by his overwhelming coldness. Strathairn drives this storyline into a realm of quasi-originality, making The Bourne Ultimatum relevant enough for us to enjoy it unabashedly. Because of him we swallow again the tired conceit of Bourne's lost memory and his lingering guilt. We admit that, yeah, this truly is a magnificent flick.Samuel Osborn",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Slightly better than the previous.,"This one doesn't have the Flat-Ark of the previous one. I still don't think we learn anything that new about ""Jason Bourne"". With a film that's littered with double beats, it trys so hard to pull the rug out from under you. Ultimately the film is semi enjoyable. I might be in the minority about this, but its an ugly film to look at.

No new ideas in this movie,"I can't say I enjoyed this movie. From the first second on, it seemed to me as if I had seen all of this far too many times. Super-smart FBI/CIA/NSA/whatever agents standing in front of big screen monitors, assisted by computer specialists, busy in their hight-tech control center and saying things like ""Find me his last known address and cell phone number NOW, go, go!"". Then, a completely superior rogue agent who knows every step of his enemies in advance. Who can handle every enemy, no matter their numbers.The faces of all these protagonists stay mostly emotionless, even in the toughest of situations - this is probably supposed to cast a light of professionalism on them, while it only gave me the feeling of watching a bunch of robots doing their work. I think there is a lot of hype about ""Supremacy"" and ""Ultimatum"", while ""Identity"" was okay to watch.I like this genre of movies, but it needs new ideas and approaches.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An high tension and fast-energy close to the Bourne trilogy!,"This is a high tension and fast-energy close (as of now) to the Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon. He returns as Jason Bourne once more, still having memory problems and determined to get to the bottom of the issue in what his real identity is and who is responsible for the operations. With the help of London-based reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), who is trying to unveil Operation Blackbriar (an upgrade to Project Treadstone), and former Treadstone support technician Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), Bourne gets that much closer to uncover his dark past.The film picks up about six weeks where the events of The Bourne Supremacy left off. Like the previous two films, the movie starts off with a fast pace as Bourne visit's the brother of his girlfriend Marie, leading to Simon Ross trying to uncover the secrets of Operation Blackbriar, as the sinister plans of Blackbriar lead operative Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) to take him and Bourne down unfold. This results in another thrilling and suspenseful cat and mouse chase between the assassins and Bourne, giving the audience an edge-of-your-seat ride that is, what I think, contains some of the best actions scenes in cinema - from Bourne attempting to avoid the Blackbriar assassins to him trying to protect others under their target.Back in the fray is CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), who is against Vosen's mission to terminate Bourne. Her trying to vindicate Bourne adds onto the story's suspense and it makes you wonder where her actions will lead to under the watchful eye of Vosen and his associates.Much intrigue is generated as the secrets of the CIA operation begin to unravel and Jason gaining more steam in unlocking his memory, creating a mind-numbing sense of mystery.The acting is great; Matt Damon continues to deliver as Jason Bourne, quick in action and dramatic, and Joan Allen gave another commanding performance as Pamela Landy, committed to solving the investigation but sympathetic to Jason's dilemma. I also liked Julia Stiles' role as Parson, who has a larger and more significant role in the movie. In addition, all the actors who played the villains were sinister and well-played.Hands down to the film-making team for their stunning work on the visual and special effects, stunts, screenplay, music, sound and direction on this film, as well as the first two. It's probably the most well-balanced, exciting and captivating action trilogy I have ever seen. Highly recommended!Grade A",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An Action Film that has a Heart and a Brain,"I want you to name me the last great action flick. Die Hard 4.0? Nah, it lost all credibility when The Bruce single-handedly beat a jet. Casino Royal? Nope, too much talking for my liking. MI3? Anti-climactic. The Bourne Supremacy? Oh yes, that was a magnificent picture. So, I guess it's not really surprising that The Bourne Ultimatum, the sequel to Supremacy, is arguably the best film of the year so far. We went in with extremely high expectations, and I'm happy to say that those expectations were met, and then some.When we last met Jason Bourne (Damon), his girlfriend had just been killed, so he was out for revenge. This time though, it's back to basics. Bourne is being hunted by CIA officials, led by Strathairn's Noah Vosen, as he's still searching for his unknown past. Also unlike the last film, Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Allen) and series regular Nicky Parsons (Stiles) are on Bourne's side.I'm quite sure no other film this year will give you the Adrenaline rush Ultimatum gave us. To cut to the chase, I'll just quote US critic Todd McCarthy: ""If they could bottle what gives The Bourne Ultimatum its rush, it would probably be illegal"". Basically, the film is one massive action scene. The chases in London and in Tangier in particular took my breath away and had me on the edge of my seat. But if you think Ultimatum is just a loud & dumb action flick, well, think again. The film's got big a heart; Bourne is still the sympathetic spy who wants to atone for his previous sins. And even better, Ultimatum has a brain too. The story is complex and gripping and believe or not, but Ultimatum is probably the most anti-American film since Syriana, Damon's 2005 political thriller (I haven't seen Sicko yet)After helming Supremacy, United 93, and Ultimatum in a row, I think Greengrass has firmly established himself as one of the best directors working today; the film has an excellent gritty look, innovative fight scenes, and an outstanding score. The English filmmaker still uses the shaky cam excessively, but because the editing is phenomenal, the shots hold long enough that you can actually tell what's going on. Greengrass got the best out of his cast as well. Damon excels as Bourne, Allen is amazing as usual (she should get an Oscar like, now!), Stiles finally gets to do something other than listening to her earpiece, and Strathairn is good, but somehow underused.So, I'd definitely recommend seeing The Bourne Ultimatum. It's a fitting end to an amazing trilogy, and it's one of (if not) the best films of the year",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Jason Bourne: Portrait of an Artist,"In ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" titular character Jason Bourne (a.k.a. David Webb) has finally elevated ass kicking to an art form. You could say he is the premier artist working in the medium of anal annihilation. He is peerless. Contemporaries such as John McClane and Jack Bauer have made relevant (and to be sure, important) strides in the field. But only Jason Bourne has mastered the rump-rupturing arts. To him, a book is not merely entertainment for a leisurely afternoon at the beach. Nor is a towel simply a convenient drying device. In the supremely talented hands of Jason Bourne these innocuous objects become weapons of ass destruction. It's truly a remarkable sight to behold, and one I encourage you all to witness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One of the best cat and mouse spy thriller,What a ride! The third Bourne is even better than the last one. I liked very much how it began so fast and could keep the pace till the end. I can only say fasten your seat belt and enjoy this adventure trip around many places in the world. The Bourne Ultimatum is a very interesting cat and mouse chase and there are some very good breath taking action scenes. The only weak point is the shaky hand camera in the last ones.

Good addition to the series.,"I liked it quite a bit but the camera work that seems like it's in an earthquake is bothersome for me. I didn't care for it in The Bourne Supremacy either. I think the camera work makes the pacing of the movie uneven and, at times, a little hard to follow. There's some good technique brought forward from the previous movies but if there's a fourth one I hope it doesn't become a cliché (like the Bond movies). The Bourne Ultimatum is beginning to get a little that way. The acting is excellent and I'm glad to see that Julia Stiles got more screen time. Her role is a wonderful addition to this movie. This is a great series that I hope, if it continues, doesn't become repetitive in it's presentation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"I'll avoid saying anything silly like ""The Ultimate Bourne!""","In this film Bourne chases and is chased, and sometimes both happen at the same time. It all becomes twisted yet it never loses a basic simplicity that keeps us involved.There are some great additions to the cast, including Albert Finney, Scott Glenn and David Strathairn (he was Edward R. Murrow in Good Night, and Good Luck.) The acting has been strong in the entire series, and it's great to see the ""evil higher-ups"" not spitting and screaming at each other but talking calmly and realistically, their menace more believable. Then when they do yell, it actually means something.There is also a great twist that puts this movie into chronological perspective with the second film.It is further proof of great directing and writing that the same scene with the same dialogue can have two completely different emotional meanings when spun in different ways. Really connecting this film to The Bourne Supremacy, this further stressed that this is one story told over multiple films. It does that trick better than many sequels nowadays shot back-to-back.Also, Bourne's connection to a character with a small role in the previous two films is given new meaning that easily could have become silly and cliché. Instead, it really works and actually gives an extra layer of substance to Bourne and to the people helping him on his dangerous journey to self-discovery.That's why the film works, because it has real characters who aren't idiots.Still, the action does not disappoint.In fact, what makes the action so successful is that there is a sense that it is captured rather than created.I'd say the style most reminds me of the television show The Shield, which also uses a lot of hand-held camera work and zooms, sometimes shifting out of focus as if it were documenting real events unraveling at breakneck speed before an audience.It's a style that has gotten Greengrass notice since his 2002 film Bloody Sunday.It's also a style that could get tiresome, but Greengrass doesn't keep everything at ""11."" Although the hand-held is a constant, there are different degrees to how the shots are framed and, especially, how they are edited together. There is a dramatic curve to the writing, directing, and editing, which creates room for slower scenes that aren't about running around on roof tops.The second film got a lot of complaints for its use of ""shaky cam."" It never bothered me that much, but I do think Greengrass has gotten better at his style. He perfected it with last years United 93.He brings what he has learned to the table here. Even a few shots in The Bourne Ultimatum are completely breathtaking and memorable. One involves a dive into a river, and another is that money-shot from all the trailers of Bourne as he jumps in mid-air through a window. And you can feel the crunch of the metal against the hard road in the New York City car chase.Yet, the directing is never about just one shot but about how they all connect together. I think this is what helps Paul Greengrass stand out as a director, as in some ways he is almost like a modern (and non-communist) Sergei Eisenstein.The editors know exactly how to cut the shots together in a rhythmic, almost musical way.One example involves a codeword which we see on a computer screen. At a different location, a character answers when asked for the codeword but does not give the same one. You're confused for a split-second, and then back on the screen another word is revealed with a different meaning.This all happens in about three seconds, and the entire film is directed and edited with this care, always keeping a sense of mystery and spontaneity. When characters make choices, we feel there are literally making those decisions on screen.And the credit really goes to everyone who made this film.The music is fantastic, and the best in the series. It really sets the mood without devolving into cliché, and there is some surprising orchestral work.The writing especially stands out for delivering a script that escapes a lot of its genre confines. In a way The Bourne Ultimatum becomes the ultimate character driven action film.The flashback scenes are a bit too formula ""streaky lights"" and ""jerky slow motion."" I think it would have been more original and effective if a different film stock were used, perhaps 16mm with a different range of colors to more subtly reveal these important moments. Some very important moments happen during the flashbacks, too.Also, after one particular crash Jason Bourne only has a few bruises on his face. Although in all the movies there are unrealistic moments, everything is still fairly grounded to Earth. This one has the most ""superman"" elements of any of them, and though the majority of it all fits for the filmic world created it would have been nice to see him a bit more beat up at the end, kinda like how he was bloodied and limping at the end of The Bourne Supremacy.Furthermore, one could argue that the revelations behind Bourne's past aren't exactly earth shattering, but the series as a whole has always been more about the journey than the destination. I would argue, as well, that the real twists are more character based than narrative based.With these minor details aside, this is easily the best action film of 2007.The Bourne Ultimatum will help solidify the Bourne trilogy as being one of the big movie surprises in recent memory. Who would have guessed five years ago that Jason Bourne would become one of the defining action heroes of the decade, like James Bond of the 60's, John McClane of the 80's and Jack Ryan of the 90's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Why does the third film in the trilogy always fall short?,"The character of Jason Bourne and the previous two movies gave me high hopes that this too would be a film I'd enjoy watching. Boy was I wrong! Reasons? Here goes:#1.The dialogue. On Bourne's side it was OK but the CIA Deputy director kept asking for the assassin to be sent in every 3 lines. The rest of the time he was barking at his staff. In an effort to make him seem a power crazed man they ended up making him sound repetitive. Maybe it was David Strathairn's take on the character, maybe the director kept shouting at him for more anger and hysteria. God knows. I'd have imagined him as a cold and calculated man, truly convinced that what he was doing was for the greater good but it's easy for me to tinker once I've seen the finished product. And what's with this obsession of having every bit of information blown up on screen 1? I must have heard that line at least 3 times.#2. The extras. I couldn't help but notice most of the staff in that CIA war-room weren't doing much. You had your basic *guy-at-the-computer* guy and few others around him plus you *girl-with-the-files* girl all of them hunched over keypads. Every once in a while after a hysteric order from their chief they'd look up. Thrilling.#3. The shaking camera. Some people think it's cinematic art. I agree but I still got a bit nauseous.#4. The advertisements. All the bad but efficient guys had a Motorola. Hmmm. And the car that took the most hits and kept going was a Dacia Logan. Well noted. I'm getting me one of those.All in all it's a 1 out of 10, not cause it's THAT bad but it sure doesn't deserve to be in the top 250.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Outstanding,"I have been disappointed with so many films in the last 2- 3 years it is great to watch a film that surpasses expectations, and with Bourne my expectations were already high.Outstanding in every way: fight sequences, suspense, chases, characters. Yes even cinematography.Cheesy dialogue is kept to a minimum or even non-existent. Action is gritty and unapologetic. Sentimentality is ignored and characters are developed only as much as they need to be.All this coupled with spot on pacing makes this one of the best action films ever made. My new favourite trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A technically incredible thrill ride,"So, I kind of love this movie, but I can't help but notice something really odd about its third act. Peeking ahead towards the fifth Bourne movie, they sort of try to address it there before simply giving up, but it introduces a great idea very late and then simply departs the scene. Up to that moment, though, the movie is a propulsive action spectacle with less on its mind than the second movie but done with more skill and panache than the first.So, the second movie ended with a quickly shot coda weeks before the film's release to give the film a sunnier ending (a move I disagree with, but I watch Tarkovsky movies for fun so don't listen to me). This third movie has to completely retcon that because it really wasn't the greatest idea in the world. In order to get there, though, the movie takes an hour through a new plot of an upgraded Treadstone called Blackbriar (that Ward Abbott actually mentioned at the very end of The Bourne Identity), and it's just quality spycraft and action stuff.Bourne, fresh from his emotional victory in Moscow, vows to take the fight to the CIA. In order to do that, he has to follow a new trail of breadcrumbs that starts with a journalist from the London based Guardian newspaper, Simon Ross, who has met a contact from the CIA with inside knowledge of Blackbriar. This is where this movie really shines, in its set pieces. Jason gets Ross to meet him at Waterloo Station while the CIA, led by Noah Vosen, surveilles Ross with every piece of equipment he has at his disposal, including several men on the ground. Jason leads Ross through the station, evading visual contact in a tense, active, and clear set of actions. It's capped with one of the new Blackbriar agents setting up behind a billboard to snipe both Bourne and Ross. It's a bravura sequence filmed guerilla style and told in Greengrass's sure handed visual style that combines frantic close up action with enough establishing shots that the geography never gets hazy.The action moves to Tangiers as Bourne traces down Ross's source, a CIA section chief named Neal Daniels. The CIA, with Pamela Landy's help, figure out where Bourne is going, who the source is, and where Daniels is as he starts to run, knowing that he's been caught. Bourne picks up Nicky Parsons, the logistics analyst from Paris and the first film, and they work together to track down Daniels and counter the CIA's action of sending another asset after Daniels and Bourne. This is the next extended thriller sequence, and it ends up being a multi-faceted chase through Tangiers, the roads, over rooftops, and even through buildings which ends with a fistfight in a small bedroom and bathroom. It's another expertly executed sequence.And then Bourne goes to New York and the movie starts cutting little corners. It's not enough to hobble the film by any measure, and some of it gets explained though I don't really buy it. How does Bourne get into America? He uses one of the passports he's had from the beginning that originated with Treadstone. Only Pam Landy and her assistant notice, though. Noah Vosen's team doesn't get notification about it. It's thin, but whatever. And then Bourne gets the majority of the deep cover CIA office in New York to leave its office for a chase, and he just walks in. I imagine there's a deleted scene that shows Bourne stealing someone's ID badge or something, but it's not actually there and he just walks into what is probably one of the most heavily surveilled and guarded buildings in New York without setting off a single alarm. Okay, whatever. It's small stuff, but a disappointment considering the clever ways Bourne had been getting in and out of places the entire series.Bourne gets what he wants from office which is the location of the original Treadstone training facility (through a code from Landy) and a file of kills Blackbriar had performed, some against American citizens (which is a huge no-no for the CIA in particular). And this is where the movie makes its late introduction of a great concept. Underlying the ideas of the whole series up to this point was that Bourne as he currently stands is only partially guilty for his previous actions. The implication was that he had reverted to the man he was before he signed up for Treadstone, that Treadstone had performed behavior modifications on him that turned him into a killer. However, we discover that Jason made the choice himself to become the killer. That's a great idea! Perhaps it should have been introduced with more than about twenty minutes left in the movie. You couldn't just shove it forward and leave everything else the same, but it would have been a great thing to explore. Instead we get a generic, though extremely well executed, plot about exposing CIA malfeasance.Now, Paul Greengrass thinks he's the modern Gillo Pontecorvo or Costa-Gavras. That's most evident in his movies like Bloody Sunday, United 93, and, in particular, Green Zone, but it was here that he began really weaving that impulse into the Bourne adventure (it becomes a much bigger part in Jason Bourne). The CIA spying is a real life concern, much more gussied up and snazzy here than in the previous films. He doesn't let the concerns overwhelm the story, simply letting the story play out on top, which creates the best mix for this kind of film.The movie is more purely an action spectacle than The Bourne Supremacy, and in that it excels with one of the best single sequences of the franchise (Waterloo) and a strong final car chase. The plot is relatively clear and Matt Damon anchors it all well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Greengrass added a much more human aspect to Bourne in 'Supremacy' all while adding just the right amount of action. I feel like there was a bit more of an imbalance in 'Ultimatum'. Certainly, the car chases and the breathtaking rooftop chase are great, but there are a few too many leaps of faith the audience has to take in terms of logic. Especially considering how grounded the first two films are.Even with the logic issues, The Bourne Ultimatum may be the most entertaining and heart stopping film of the entire series, with one thrilling scene after another. The aforementioned rooftop sequence in Tangier is one thing, but one of the opening scenes takes place in a London terminal, and it may be my favorite scene of the film altogether. It's usually not the high octane chases or visceral gun battles that get me, but the scenes in which Bourne is using his slick wit and experience to one-up those against him.Among the cast returning is Joan Allen as Pamela Landy. Although you can make the case her story ended with Bourne in 'Supremacy', the direction they take her arc in helping Bourne tear through his past made sense here. Opposing Landy is Deputy Director Noah Vosen, played by David Straithairn. Straithairn is very good at playing characters that get under your skin with frustrating decisions and Vosen is exactly that. So although I preferred Chris Cooper and Brian Cox in those roles, Straithairn is a solid counterpart to Damon. It's all the more impressive considering the very little screen time, if any, that the antagonists end up having with Bourne.Though it is now 2016 and there's a new Jason Bourne film coming out, watching The Bourne Ultimatum made me realize that there really never needed to be another entry in the series. The film comes full circle and Bourne's search for answers got to the point I hoped for. The end really feels like the end, so I sure hope the new film reinvents itself and doesn't retread the same story beats because Ultimatum certainly does.'Ultimatum' has its detractors and I can see a few of the complaints being warranted, but there's no denying the epic scope and thrill ride the film takes you on. It's the most cinematic of the bunch and the characters don't really take a backseat to action. I only hope there aren't as many leaps of logic next time around.+Scope+Rooftop and terminal sequence+Feels like the end+Landy & Bourne-Leaps of faith in logic9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Good, not great","Good action sequences, but I generally felt there wasn't much going on by movie's end. I also know the books are nothing like the movies, so that kind of brings it down. And all three movies are pretty much interchangeable: same basic plot, some fight scenes, car chases, and some nice foreign shoot locations. The shaky camera work is especially off-putting. Sure you get a sense of urgency, but you can never see whats happening until the last car crashes or someone dies. Even when nothings happening you notice a tremor. And ultimately, the plot is thin. It all comes down to who is REALLY responsible for turning him into a killing machine. At the end of each movie you think he's found them, but as always, its not over. Entertaining, but not the end of the world if you miss it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Grrrrreat!!!!,"Excellent storyline and tie ins from the second movie, show the subtle genius of the best Bourne at least since the first! There is a really great story and plot line and tons of excellent martial arts and car chase scenes. By the way, this should not be the last Bourne, since a forth book by Ludlum, reveals all and shows why the spy chose to become what he became; from what I've heard, it is the best of them all. There is a possibility that there will be one more movie, but who knows, I hope so. Matt Damon does a great job a the tortured super spy who finally comes in from the cold...or does he; the viewer must determine that. But you won't regret seeing this adrenaline rush of a movie, one well thought out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
okay,"it is hard to believe that so many people would rate this movie that high. First, the unsteady camera shots. I know this is the rave, but come on, it was directing 101-ish. Second, the director continued this motif by shooting each action scene close up. I suppose this saved millions on the shoot, but a close up of a rear bumper, then a turning wheel, then an eyeball, then a license plate, all combined to try and give the effect, when actually it just looked silly.As for the plot, it was your basic they brainwashed me and I'll come back and get them, like a Total Recall done 25 years go. We all love that plot, but combined with the terrible editing and cinematography, I have to give it a 6, just because I like Matt Damon. It really is a 5 without him.Love and Kisses, as always cary",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne Ultimatum is the best film in the series and spectacularly closes Jason Bourne's journey,"The character Jason Bourne, created by Robert Ludlum has become, over the past few years, synonymous with action and intelligent espionage amid so many generic action films released annually in the American industry. After two films launched with extremely favorable reception from critics and audiences, the long-awaited third chapter arrives in theaters, which promised to end a first trilogy, answering many loose ends previously discussed in another electrifying chapter. Again, Paul Greengrass leads this mind-blowing action that closes one of the best trilogies in cinema.At the end of The Bourne Supremacy (2004), we accompanied the ex-member of the memorial service fleeing the streets of Moscow. It is at this very point that The Bourne Ultimatum (The Bourne Ultimatum, 2007) begins, as if it had been done in the sequence. The chase is not over yet, and although the rush is still far from over, what motivates the film is Bourne's (Matt Damon) search for his real identity. The headaches and flashbacks continue and despite the explosions, shots and fights, Bourne continues to move towards the past that was erased from his memory.If in the first film we were introduced to a secret, dismembered spy who sought to save his skin from professional assassins and in the second we witnessed the beginning of the fight for revenge, now he is closer than ever to his own history, recalling crucial facts and about to reveal those guilty of the fate trodden to date. The best part is that this is an absurdly concise series. Each episode was made, thought and elaborated separately from each other, and in some cases having nothing but the title as a resemblance to Robert Ludlum's original books. And yet, it all makes a lot of sense. Plots as secret agents are almost a subgenre within North American cinema. But few are as serious and yet as exciting as the Bourne films. Everything Jason Bourne (Damon, accurately embodying the character, as surprising as it may seem), his attitudes and decisions are absolutely natural and convincing, as if we are reflecting each new problem beside him. The traumas he faces, the dangers overcome and the desired achievements are experienced by the audience in equal intensity, making each film a unique journey.One of the great highlights of the saga is the script by Tony Gilroy, responsible for the text of the entire character trilogy created by Robert Ludlum. He manages to harness elements of ""Identity"" and ""Supremacy"" in incredible ways. In addition to the surprising way in which ""Ultimatum"" fits into the chronology of the franchise, altering our perception of one of the scenes in the previous film, the various references that occur to the character's long past make the experience of following this trilogy unique. Just to cite an example, Operation Blackbriar, which is the narrative core of the film, had its origin shown in the final moments of ""Identity"", when the now deceased Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) presents it before a senate committee for approval, right after the Treadstone project was deactivated. Another example: at the end of ""Supremacy"", it seemed that Jason had been left alone by the CIA, after a quiet conversation - at a distance - between him and his stalker, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen). However, like everything in the world of espionage, that scene was not quite what it appeared to be.The change of focus provided by the plot gives rise to something increasingly rare in action cinema: the development of the characters. Jason Bourne is human. He suffers, gets hurt and has a moral complexity that makes him a real person, not just an infallible superhero. Although lethal and threatening, the character is emotionally vulnerable, embittered by the loss of both the person he loved and his own identity. Furthermore, Bourne is still plagued by ghosts from a past that remains in darkness, where all the murders committed further devastate his already weakened morale.The most fascinating aspect of the text by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burke and George Nolfi is the cat and mouse game between Bourne and his pursuers. It is not enough just to give the order of execution, in the case of agencies, or to flee, in the case of Bourne. It is necessary to anticipate the opponent's thoughts and actions, always to be one step ahead, through decisions usually taken in fractions of seconds. This intelligence of the script and the characters makes The Bourne Ultimatum a film that appeals to both adrenaline seekers and those who want to work their brains.In the cast, Matt Damon, once again, is the highlight. In addition to following his trajectory in search of truth as Jason Bourne, we have slight glimpses of what he was like in his past existence, something that the actor knew how to take advantage of very well. Julia Stiles returns as Nicky Parsons and, although her character suddenly appears in the film, she is essential to the conduct of the plot. The great detail of his appearances are the narrative rhymes between his scenes and those of Franka Potente in ""The Bourne Identity"", which draw a very interesting parallel between Nicky and Marie, leaving open a possible previous connection between the former Treadstone bureaucratic agent and Bourne. Joan Allen manages to develop her Pamela Landy, an extremely complex woman, trapped in the dilemma of either following her orders or her conscience. The great villain of the production, Noah Volsen, is masterfully played by David Strathairn. The actor, nominated for an Oscar for his work in ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", is adequately threatening in the film, living a character that is not driven by ambition or any other personal motives, but by patriotism, a recurring theme of those who cross the Jason Bourne's way.Maintaining the high level of the series, Paul Greengrass takes on the climax of the trilogy with the complicated mission of overcoming his own work in ""Supremacy"", an objective achieved with praise. In addition to being able to tell a highly complex plot superbly, Greengrass also created two action scenes that were already born classic. They are the chase on the streets of a Moroccan city involving Bourne, Nicky and a Blackbriar operative, who has several levels of action at the same time in a phenomenal camera work done by the director, surpassed only by the automobile chaos that occurs in New York in the last third of the film.Globalized like few others, the series keeps changing landscapes just like a spy changes his passport. From Moscow it passes through Paris, London, Madrid, Tangier (Morocco) and finally arrives in New York. But the first important clue comes from Turin (Italy), where someone connected to Bourne's past begins to speak to an interested and curious Brit. And it is precisely in London that one of the best orchestrated scenes in the film takes place. At the busy Waterloo train station, Bourne has to meet the Englishman and still escape from a killer who is on his trail.Greengrass builds - with the help of screenwriters Tony Gilroy and Scott Z. Burns - a spy film that has not been seen in a long time, that does not treat the viewer as a spoiled child, that needs to be taken by the hand until the end, and that it doesn't just depend on the special effects to survive. But those who deserve more credits are cinematographer Oliver Wood, editor Christopher Rouse - who managed to set the right pace not only for this very complicated scene, but for the whole film, giving a sense of urgency to even the most ""calm"" scenes - and sound effects editor Christopher Assells. The camera in hand, shaky and with millimeter zooms that punctuate the tension of the moment, and the perforated edition, but very well assembled, collaborate with the protagonist's anxiety. In the meantime, the everyday noise dirt gives the film the realistic edge, shaping what every good action movie should try to be. It is not by chance that editing, sound editing and sound mixing were duly recognized at the Oscar award in the edition following the release of the film. Finally, the soundtrack by John Powell continues to set the right atmosphere for the film's tense action scenes, in a praiseworthy work by the composer. The action is incessant, as is the soundtrack that leaves the audience with their heart in their hands at all times.The only sin for Greengrass and the writers is making Jason Bourne a more invincible good guy than in previous films. Not that he doesn't get hurt; Bourne still bleeds and suffers physically from everything that happens, but to a lesser extent than before. Bourne Supremacy, for example, ended with Bourne limping, sweating and bleeding. Here, in The Bourne Ultimatum, the character escapes explosions a few meters away, visceral fights and car accidents with just a few scratches.The Jason Bourne franchise brought back more adult action, with a political and current character. Closing masterly this narrative arc of the character, there is the expectation of whether or not we will see Jason Bourne again, whether in a new adventure or in a prequel. The Bourne trilogy came to modify the standards of the action genre (the James Bond of Casino Royale, for example, is derived directly from Jason Bourne), masterfully combining high doses of entertainment and intelligence. The Bourne Ultimatum is the best film in the series and spectacularly closes Jason Bourne's journey. At least until Universal decides it's time to bring new stories to the public.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The worst of the Trilogy but still a good film,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** Action, Action, Action. One amazing set piece after another absolutely terrific.... or so I thought. I actually missed an intelligent storyline, I didn't really get the motives of continuing to chase Bourne following the deaths of Abbott and Conklin. The story was out there and I clearly felt that at the end of Supremacy he was getting his memory back and was at a place where he could move forward.The first two films were intelligent and combined great action with a feeling that to watch the films and understand, you got a sense of how the intelligence service really worked.

I note some reviewers felt as I do, and some just don't mind - ADHD would be my diagnosis there - but in the final analysis a film has to treat your eyes better than this - very, very poor work, and a real slap on the face for Greengrass, who should have known better.

Born to be Bourne,"Central Intelligence agent, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), has found herself once again in a tiny room, surrounded by a team of people, all scrambling to track the notoriously elusive, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). At this stage, bringing Bourne in is not just her job but an obsession, one that has gone far past the point of hunt and capture and developed into a need to understand the man himself. In Paul Greengrass's THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, we are right there with her every step of the way. Only it's a much more enjoyable experience for us than for poor Pam. We have the added advantage of being able to see both sides of this chase from where we sit. From this vantage point, we see the C.I.A. constantly miscalculating Bourne's next move and, in what is perhaps their biggest misconception, mistaking Bourne for some sort of super human, incapable of infallibility. Jason Bourne is just a man. Yes, he's an incredible specimen with quick reflexes, heightened intuition and kick-ass moves but he too is just trying to figure out the mystery of where he came from and who he is. How can the C.I.A. pretend to know Bourne when Bourne does not even know himself? The Bourne paradox is what makes Jason Bourne one of film's mot intriguing action heroes and THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is a perfect answer to years of unanswered questions.To recap, we first caught a glimpse of Jason Bourne in THE BOURNE IDENTITY (directed by Doug Liman). He had no idea who he was and it was exhilarating to watch him awaken to his special brand of fighting style, while still infuriating to watch his struggle to understand how he came to be so skilled. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY followed with a new director (Greengrass) and a depressing change in tone after the death of his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), at the film's onset. The film could not help but be a more sobering experience after that. THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM changes Bourne's direction from less running away to more running towards. Tying all three films together is the constantly improving performance by Damon as Bourne. Damon brings a sleek brand of class to his characters in most of his films and he treats Bourne with a stealth speed and fiercely internalized stoicism. You might say he was born to play Bourne. His tormented mind has gone from wonder and awe in the unraveling of his rediscovered personality to a dark brooding. He has understood that getting close to others gets them killed and has cut himself off as much as possible to both avoid future tragedy and maintain his focus on the goal.Another man who found a stronger focus this time around is director, Greengrass. His direction for SUPREMACY was at times difficult to follow. Not only was the story not told as succinctly as in Liman's IDENTITY but Greengrass's now signature extreme-shaky aesthetic and jump-cut obsession made it visually jarring as well. After snagging an Oscar nomination for his direction of UNITED 93 last year, he has learned a stronger command of his unsteady film approach. The result is a visually more engaging experience that ushers in a different kind of American cinema. The British director follows the action through numerous international locations, from running across rooftops and hopping through windows in Tangiers to zipping in and out of the crowds in a busy London bus station. The world flavour only further serves to highlight the film's direct criticism of American home security practices post September 11th. Greengrass's portrayal of the C.I.A. is one hyped up on power and the authority to kill anyone whenever necessary and that power reeks of paranoia. Making the C.I.A. the enemy makes our hero's actions, choosing to spare life whenever possible, all that much more commendable. American cinema that makes Americans look bad is always refreshing. They're not all bad but it's obnoxious to pretend they aren't somewhat bad.The Bourne series should be commended for successfully accomplishing what so many others have recently failed at. It is a consistently enjoyable trilogy that never takes itself too seriously and has purpose in each installment that justifies the necessity of three films to tell a complete story, rather than just being an excuse to rake in more cash. They are all three intelligent and compelling works, with THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM serving as a smooth, sophisticated closer that is only disappointing because it draws the entire ordeal to a close. I would love to see the series live on but it will lack the one driving force that has made it so compelling for so long now. Now that Jason Bourne knows where it all began, he will no longer be in constant, compulsive pursuit of the ultimate puzzle, understanding himself. Is there any more gripping a pursuit to be had?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
One of the best action films ever made!,"Wow, wow, wow, what a way to end the Bourne trilogy!! As good as the previous films were, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is still more superior to them. This is easily one of the most exciting action movies ever made ('Die Hard' and 'The Dark Knight' are also strong contenders.)Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne, a character sure to immortalize him as one of the greatest action stars. The Bourne films are spy thrillers in the vein of James Bond, but - as mentioned before - they are far more realistic and therefore more believable. There are no fantasy villains here and the threats are real. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' continues where 'The Bourne Supremacy' left off, and Joan Allen returns as Pamela Landy, who now believes in Bourne's innocence and is trying to help him. With Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) out of the picture, there's a new bad guy on the block at the CIA who wants to eliminate Bourne at all costs - Noah Vosen (David Strathairn).Julia Stiles has a much bigger role this time around. She stars as Nicky Parsons, who had a small part in 'The Bourne Identity', and is one of the few people at the CIA whom Bourne trusts. In 'The Bourne Supremacy' she had a bigger role, and in 'The Bourne Ultimatum' she is one of the lead characters and on the run with Bourne.'The Bourne Ultimatum' is off to a thrilling, action-packed start, grabs you and never lets go. Not a single moment goes by that isn't exciting. The action is relentless and non-stop. The cliched running on rooftops sequence gets a fresh look here, and is incredible. This film elevates fast-paced to new heights. This is the most suspenseful film in the series, and makes for a fantastic conclusion to the trilogy. (yes, I know they made more films in the franchise, but I'm referring to the original trilogy).The film cleverly circles to connect with the ending of 'Supremacy', and then takes the story further from there. The photography is thankfully not as close-up and shaky as 'Supremacy'. Again, the film has a very effective score complimenting every scene. This is an all-round FANTASTIC production!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Brain and brawn served at a breakneck pace,"Jason Bourne is still trying to figure out his past and who he really is and how he became Bourne. Certain people in power still want him dead as Jason Bourne moves ever closer to the truth about himself...Tying in very nicely to ""The Bourne Supremacy"" this is a great tension packed conclusion to an overall great action trilogy. Like the previous two films this one has virtually nothing to do with Ludlum's original book save for that frenetic and relentless tone that Ludlum described so vividly and Paul Greengrass has put on screen so effectively. The chases, fights, and even plot developments are paced so that someone watching doesn't even know time is passing by. They are just nailed to what is going on.However, there is a critical slip in a key scene where Jason Bourne WILLINGLY gives away his location to the people hunting him. He knows that they'll descend on him like vultures and he hasn't even secured his exit yet. This is the first time in three great action movies when it blatantly feels that the protagonist has more luck than the cold and constant calculation he utilized before. If someone digs deep enough, even in the books, they'll see Bourne has lots of luck, as all action heroes, but it never quite felt that way. The action and plot always sailed smoothly over it. Here they both graze the tip of a dangerous iceberg, but the film quickly recovers for a strong conclusion.Overall the film trilogy is a great book-to-screen translation of three great books. --- 8/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action.

applause  to  the consistency of Greengrass,"have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me. Most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up, show off sexy models, and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window. With that said, the Bourne series has been fantastic. Doug Liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style, showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly. This is not the sci-fi absurdity that was Bond (before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less). There was a lot to worry for when the Bourne Supremacy came out. With director Paul Greengrass taking over, what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair. The stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it. Greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment, The Bourne Ultimatum. In what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy, the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised.Once again, Bourne is brought into the minds of the CIA by false pretenses. Someone has leaked information about the Treadstone upgrade called Blackbriar and once Bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story, he is assumed to be the mole. Only Pamela Landy, she who was on the case to find him in Supremacy, knows that he can't be the one. Bourne's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace. It has been the CIA who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them. What ends up transpiring is that Bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer. The film, then, becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends, or if Bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him.In what is probably the simplest storyline of the series, with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story, it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression. This is not a detriment at all, however, as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot. Admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight, between Bourne and the CIA's second asset, alone. The chase jumping through windows in Madrid is cool on its own, but when they finally meet up, we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you'll see. Also, rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films, we instead get around three small scale road races, just as intense, but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony.After five years of waiting, we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling. By the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him. No one could have done it better than Matt Damon. He has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences, but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him. Joan Allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job, but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how Brian Cox's character, from the first two films, took matters into his own hands. Needing a role in that mold, we are given a nice turn from David Strathairn. Like Cox, he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision. With as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the Blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country, you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing. Even the little guys do a wonderful job, like Paddy Considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything, Albert Finney as a man from Bourne's past and possibly key to his origin, and Edgar Ramirez as one of the CIA's operatives sent to take Bourne out. Ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by Clive Owen (Identity), Karl Urban, and Martin Csokas (Supremacy). He doesn't talk much, if at all, but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in Domino.In the end, one has to applaud Paul Greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them. His skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as Tony Scott, but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts. Rather than feel like over- production, his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action. Let's also credit cinematographer Oliver Wood, who shot all three Bourne films. He was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them.Evren Buyruk from California ,2007",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
You'll be on the edge of your seat so long as you leave your brains at the door,"Like practically all of the recent Bond films up to the frankly magnificent ""Casino Royale"", the first two Bourne movies were highly enjoyable if hardly memorable, (the problem with most of these films is that they all look and sound the same). Now we have the third, though probably not the last, in the Bourne franchise and if it distinguishes itself from its predecessors it's due almost entirely to being one long chase from start to finish. When it pauses for breath, which is seldom, it is as banal as any thick-ear action driven movie can be. It helps, of course, if you have seen the one before and recently since this seems to kick off where that one ended. It's still possible to enjoy number three, of course, even if you haven't seen the others though making head or tails of the plot may well prove impossible.As a high adrenalin action picture it's fantastic, literally as well as figuratively. It begins in Moscow, moves to London then Madrid, Tangiers and ends in New York while Bourne traverses the globe without baggage, money or sleep, (the 'superman' theme is stretched beyond credulity), pursued all the while by sundry assassins and it's in the chases themselves that the film really takes off. There is a wonderful, seat-edging sequence filmed in and around Waterloo Station, a chase through the alley-ways and over the roof-tops of Tangiers and a car chase through New York all of which are master-classes in timing and, although each is lengthy in itself, none of which seem to drag on too long.It's in the plot department that the film falls down, (Bourne is still seeking his identity), and a good cast, (in support, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, Joan Allen and Paddy Considine), are largely wasted. As Bourne, Matt Damon uses that chiseled Mount Rushmore expression to good effect, his granite chops never betray what, if anything, he's thinking but then that may well be the one activity that's beyond him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the scenes that I managed to watch, but it would have been so much better if they had just stabilized the camera for a lot of the scenes.The scene with Nicky saying ""you really don't remember"" with a blank, but slightly disappointed look on her face felt a little clunky.

I like it!,"The third installment of the Bourne Trilogy maintains the exceptional quality of its predecessors, delivering another thrilling, fast-paced espionage-filled action spectacle. Once again, the plot follows Bourne as he evades the relentless pursuit of the all-powerful CIA, depicted as a group of individuals entrenched in a high-tech surveillance hub. Their ability to monitor every communication, location, and financial transaction contrasts sharply with Bourne's struggle with his own identity, obscured by amnesia but hinting at a narrative of choices and repercussions. The film effectively explores themes of manipulation, with the powerful exploiting victims to serve their own agendas-a metaphor that gains resonance as the story unfolds. As with previous entries, the execution is impeccable, with gripping action sequences imbued with a palpable sense of urgency. Standout moments include a cleverly crafted espionage scene set in Waterloo Station and an intense chase sequence in Tangier.

"Awesome movie with every minute thrilling, and forget about the camera","First of all, let's just forget about the camera problems that a lot of people mentioned. It is not a big deal at all IMO. The fact is, the movie is directed and shot in its own style through which Greengrass wants to show a cruel and cold, fast-paced thrilling spy-world. For example, the most-criticized shots from behind Damon's shoulder is very intelligent, showing how dirty and miserable Jason Bourne's world is and how dangerous the information Bourne viewed are . I mean, it is deliberately made but not without a point. All the shaking camera scenes are affordable and wouldn't make you puke, unless you've had too much milk in the morning.I was not a very big fan of Bourne and Damon before. However this movie really made me one. The storytelling is simply clear and dramatic. Only a few filmmakers can make a no-surprising story looks so good on the big screen. The story begins with Damon being chased by Russian policemen, which is just following the climax of Bourne Supremacy, and maybe a little bit confusing at first, but will give you a surprise near the end. In the movie, Jason attempts to save a reporter, a spy-trainer and then an old friend, Nikki. However the harder he tries, the more professional killers are sent after him. Therefore the movie is filled with more actions and chasing scenes than the sum of the last two Bourne films. It will definitely be the most satisfying film by the fans of the genre.The other thing need to mention is the atmosphere of the movie. As a thriller, the story and the actions just pull up the sense of thrilling to the roof of the theater, where everybody was just stuck and astonished by the movie. Sometimes a little bit dark-humor dialogs are not bad at all. After you watch Bourne being chased for whole 15 minutes, you will find the very human side of the super spy. Seemingly he is an unstoppable killing machine. However if you pay attention to the whole trilogy, you will find Bourne's changing as an unhappy agent who is tired of killing, seeking for a narrower but right way to deal with people even those who will kill him without a second's hesitation. In Identity, he killed almost everyone who is sent to hunt him. In supremacy, he let go of the killer of his loved one, after finding him bleeding in a crashed car. In Ultimatum, you will be amused by the effect of this trend. The camera intentionally focuses on Bourne's face from time to time, showing his nervous, assertive, tough yet desperate, sad expressions. Meeting his victims' family means torture to him. The families simply presume him to be some sort of monster from another world, fearing him in every movement. However the sorrow deep inside Bourne helps compromising between them as weak humans more than enraged people with vendettas. This theme is emphasized in the second movie and becomes even more important in Ultimatum.There are so much to say about it. But I have to stop before speaking too much to spoil your appetite. In short, welcome back Bourne.10 out of 10 (to remember, this is the first 10 I gave in 3 months,and I've voted 644 titles on IMDb already)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A perfect  and amazing third for now a remarkable Trilogy.,"Jason Bourne now is one of my heroes. I am absolutely moved and amazed by this third masterpiece. Is now a perfect trilogy. Who would have thought that the very first ""Jason Bourne"" identity would have become one of the best trilogy I have ever seen. And probably not just in my opinion. This movie couldn't be better. From the incredible action to the emotional, this movie reaches almost perfection. After the two amazing ""Bourne"" movies, I had heard a rumor, just right after the second one, about the making of a third Bourne movie. So, after waiting a very long time I went to the theater with obviously some very high expectations. Well, the scenes and the story, they were all filled with an extreme even surprisingly excitement. Something like, ""I can't leave my eyes from the screen"" kind of movie, including screenplay, photography and the whole film altogether. This makes it as one of the year's best and personally one of my top. Go see it, you won't be disappointed even if you don't like the genre. -Alessio-",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
such action as to take our breath away,"Having enjoyed the first of the trilogy and been a bit disappointed with the second it has taken me a rather long time to get round to seeing the third. But, as with the first, what a great surprise. I enjoyed the first because the excellent script helped enormously in encouraging our involvement with the characters and thereby making the action so much more exciting. The second seemed too glossy and clever, too obsessed with the brilliant action cinema but somehow leaving us the viewer, wondering just what it was all for. Here with the third and the movie roars with authenticity, good script and such action as to take our breath away. There is not a lot of story but what there is, is believable and we are on the edge of our seats throughout. Well done Mr Greengrass you have learned from what I think were mistakes and pulled off a very fine film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Director Needs Rehab,"I would personally like to take the palm of my hand and THUNK the forehead of director Paul Greengrass for making me nothing but dizzy and near seasick by his herky jerky motion filming throughout this entire film. Went this afternoon in hopes of having a nice sushi dinner afterwards, however...Awesome story, writing, acting, etc., LAME direction. Monsieur Greengrass, are you on meth? Could you NOT hold the camera STILL enough to at least let us read the dossier's and text? You're not shooting NYPDBlue or The Office and did you not get the memo that the feedback from herky jerky camera shooting just, well, says that it SUCKS?I stayed sodh could enjoy the film (and frankly I wanted to 'hear' the in which he leaned over and agreed that it was like a movie on speed. Between the extreme close-up shots throughout, and the chase scenes being so freaking fast they were blurry, I'd say keep your $$ and NOT see this on the big screen.Either that or bring your dramamine.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Headache ultimatum,"Why Hollywood thinks that 8 bazillion cut shots equals action I do not know. The amount of cuts required for this movie must have junked 3 or 4 cropping machines. When we got near the end of the movie I thought someone had put my head in a vise, all the while drilling into my eye as the pain from retina tore through my iris. Please make this stop.Snarkyness aside, the movie for all it's brain pounding camera work was still enjoyable. We saw an afternoon showing so the theatre wasn't too full. The dialogue was good. There was no star wars-esquire scenes of people uncomfortable with their lines. The acting was well done with woodenness down to a minimum for this action movie. The director did a good job of shot locations(when you can see them!) production was also good. Action is great and mostly believable, unlike transporter 2. No major gaffes for a great action movie. Just the choice of blue tint the entire movie and of course wild and wacky shaky camera /cut scenes. Would have been an eight or nine but the camera work just was too disjointing to get any feel for the real action going on...it almost makes one wonder how back in the old days they showed action without CGI and shaky camera.

"Overdone, anyone?","I went to see this movie at 12:01 on Firday morning; the earliest showing on the first day of its release. I absolutely loved the first and second movies, and was in such great anticipation of this third installment that I believed that the movie would do nothing but exceed my high expectations of it. This was partly because of the return of Paul Greengrass (the talented director of the kinetic and well-paced Bourne Supremacy) and partly because, hell, I wanted to see more of the clever and quasi-realistic action that had been initialized by the first movie and faithfully perpetuated by the second. Why should I think 'Ultimatum' would be any different? After seeing it, I still can't answer that question. Yes, there were still a few of the Macgyver-esquire clever moments, and blistering chase scenes, and plenty of bad guys getting the pudding beaten out of them, but it all just seemed so campy compared to the judicial placement of sequences like these in the previous installments. I think it will suffice to say that I didn't like the camera. Whatever effect Greengrass's choppy editing and washed-out color scheme did for the second movie, it was hugely overdone in 'Ultimatum'. What's the point of having a fight scene if the audience can't see what's going on? Instead of a clear view of the fight, the audience is strangely forced to focus on Matt Damon's left eyebrow, and the existence of loud punching noises. I also hated the potential love interest of *secret mystery character*. It was poorly placed, and a little contrive: there had been absolutely no reference, not even a hinting at the existence of such attractions in the previous films. Moments like this abound throughout the movie; inexplicable, arbitrary revelations and the convenient acquiring of crucial information take place, it seems, just for the sake of moving the movie along with little regard to adequate explanation. Furthermore, cheesy one-liners which, I'm happy to say, were absent from the first two movies, seemed to run obtusely against the grain of the established seriousness of the genre. Moments like the return of the quote first uttered by a dying assassin in the first movie could have been kinda cool, if they didn't play on the overdone and campy aspects of the movie. All of this, in conjunction with a flashback scene taken, it seems, straight out of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (you'll see the connection) and a terrible attempt at integrating music from a British punk band covering the original ""Extreme Ways"" by Moby into the end credits, seem to drown out the admirable struggle of Matt Damon to keep Jason Bourne as badass as he always was. It's possible that my expectations of this movie were simply too high to be satisfied, but I just can't help but think that the given formula of the other films offered Greengrass plenty to work with without him marring this one with kitsch and convenience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Incredible action movie,"This is the best action move released in a very long time. I read the reviews here beforehand, complaining about the shaky camera. I was prepared to hate this move because the complaints sounded legitimate and real.They were wrong. The shaky camera is there, but I found you get used to it after a short time. If you deliberately look for it you will see it, but if you just watch the movie normally its not a factor.Some of the best action scenes I have seen for many years, especially the fight with the first assassin. Later on there is an incredible car chase that also is awesome.The movie is almost non-stop action with a story that is simple but well told. Matt Damon is outstanding in the role, and easily outdoes his performance in the first two films.This was by far the best Bourne movie of the three.Highly recommended",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"segue segue segue segue, this film is over-edited","I got about one hour into this film and just had to stop watching, in spite of the fact I'd just bought it. I daresay there must be THOUSANDS of seques (how do you spell ""SEG-ways?"") in it, with most ""scenes"" lasting about a second each. It is dizzying, distracting, and considering the intensity and frequency, this over-editing is ridiculous. Combine that with the extent to which the film displays unbelievably frightening techno-ability, which I find INCREDULOUS, and it's a film you have got to have good reasons to want to watch. At present, I think I'll just have to be either really bored, or in just the right mood, to be willing to return to trying to watch it.Yeah, sure, it IS action-packed, but the camera changes with the frequency of an automated revolving door.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bourne Again!!!!,"Matt Damon showed why he is regarded as a high quality actor especially in the action genre. Working with the same directer from the previous two ""Bourne"" films Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a Man trying to rediscover his past and what he represents. The film has its usual high in suspense moments which I have to say kept me on the edge of my seat for 92% of the films duration. Im not going to give to much away but it had a thrilling middle an end. The film has similarities to the ""SAW"" trilogy with a whats going to happen next edge to the film.

"Still not loving the shaky cam, but at least it works here","The Bourne Ultimatum is the final entry in the original Bourne Trilogy. Matt Damon reprises the role of Jason Bourne, he does a great job, as usual, but let's talk about the movie.Pretty much everything I hated about the first and second installments is gone, made better. The movie has absolutely no pacing issues whatsoever, it's a fast paced action ride that never stops. The movie makes you think but the plot is never convoluted, and I love that in a movie. Talk about packing a mean punch, the movie is awesome. Every action sequence is expertly crafted and amazing. They also gave Pam Landy a shot at redemption, cause in the second film she was nothing but annoying.The only issue I continue to have with Greengrass' directing is the use of the skaky cam. It works a lot better than in Supremacy, but by the end of the film, if you're not feeling dizzy or have a headache, you're probably not human.But overall, The Bourne Ultimatum is a perfect conclusion to the trilogy, satisfying in almost every way, action packed, tightly scripted movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

"If this is the last film, I won't shed a tear","I went to this film with the hope that the weaknesses in the previous films would be improved upon and that this would be a solid flick. Of course, I ALSO went to the second one hoping for the same thing. In both cases, I was disappointed.I thought the first movie in this trilogy had a good thread throughout, but was a little inconsistent and rough. But, with the promise of at least one sequel, I figured that the people who made the first film would see the flaws, strengthen them, and produce a really good second installment.They didn't. Nor did they do so for the third movie. Honestly, these movies are pretty much interchangeable. Scant minutes of dialogue between chase scenes, and not much quality to anything non-action-related.If you just want action with nothing special in the area of plot, this is your film. If you want a true suspense and thrill, you can easily do better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Probably the Best Threequal of this Summer!,"Bourne dodges new, superior assassins as he searches for his unknown past while a government agent tries to track him down. So we're on this last chapter of this trilogy. Last time we saw Bourne, he was mourning over the death of his lover and obsessing over a black-ops program code-named Treadstone. In this film, he's still mourning and still obsessing to find out who he is. Caution for those who are going to see this: Please, go to the bathroom before you watch this film. You may never want to get up again until it ends.This movie will grab your attention from the beginning and will never let you go until the end. This is a fantastic kinetic spy thriller. You can't help but admit this is one of the few best spy thrillers you've ever seen. There's finally a mature movie not for the teens to go wild on. Like the other two films, this is still intelligent. The action scenes are still relentless. We're still hopping from one country to another. But there are some moments in which is repeats itself from the second film. I'm not giving anything away.If you've seen interviews from cast members of this movie, they're trying to keep it secretive. By the time you have finished this, you would know why. This third entrance of the series, based on Robert Ludlum's novels, lacks the emotion from the second, replacing with the questions ""Who am I?"" and ""Why am I?"".Matt Damon' performance is excellent. He seems to suffer without actually doing anything, which is a rare gift for an actor. Other returning cast members are Julia Stiles and Joan Allen, which both give good performances. There are also new cast members, most notably David Strathairn.With every chase after chase, we get to enjoy Oliver Wood's cinematography, shaking here and there. The scenery from each country is great. The action sequences are terrific that one has no dialog for at least fifteen minutes. Paul Greengrass also proves us once again that he's a great filmmaker. There's also the same score we heard from the second film, which was good.This film does not drag. The film is gripping and suspenseful all along the way. The sound work is amazingly done with the ear-splitting car accidents and every idea creative. The action is great and you'll get to know everything. So why not watch it? I don't know. Everyone is going to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Sadly not the best end to the trilogy,"Bourne 1 was clever and didn't rely too much on crash bang boom. Bourne 2 got sillier but 3 is the worst (not terrible but trying to put the 3 films into perspective). In 3, the camera work is often shaky making the viewer seasick and start to forget to watch the movie - is this good screenplay? not in mine and many others opinion - you don't need these ""effects"" if the story is good and well filmed and it wasn't needed in 1 or 2 so why change the style for 3? The story line was just a bit too far fetched in 3 - seems after the success of 1 the plots etc went slowly downhill with 2 and now 3.I was disappointed and was hoping for a more intellectual movie but I guess that's Hollywood for you. Maybe they can remake it or there'll be an alternative start/end and middle on the DVD when published.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Its just one big car chase,"I just saw my first Bourne film last night and I was quite impressed by it, but its basically one big car chase in several cities of the world. At the end it made me think of the introduction, ""Bond....James Bond"" except now I was thinking ""Bourne....Jason Bourne"". Many comparisons have been made recently but I think this is a superior Bond type film.It's good because its fast-paced, action-packed, and it's well done. The much mentioned hand held camera, works well in the chase scenes but it is distracting elsewhere in the movie. The acting of Matt Damon and David Strathairn are very good. Damon is in some decent fight scenes and Strathairn is the evil adversary at the CIA. It was funny seeing Paddy Considine playing against type as Guardian journalist with a man bag. I thought much of the other actors were pretty wooden lifeless characters.I liked the film but would not watch it again hence the six stars (just above average). The main problem is that it is a one dimensional, all action film with not much else to hold the viewer's interest. There are some beautiful locations in the film and the chase scenes are awesome. Although it's well made, there is no depth to the characters in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
I want a refund....,"That's rightI said it! I would like to have ½ the money back that I spent on my admission ticket for the Bourne Ult. I was only able to see ½ the action scenesand that is the reason for seeing Bourne anything! Why does the new wave of directors in Hollywood assume that we want to be dragged along after a bouncing, jiggling cameraman? I THINK the action scenes and stunts must have been outstanding, but who really knows? I have heard it said so many times, that this new way of filming action sequences is to give the viewer the feeling that they are in the movie, running or riding with the action hero. Word to the wisewhen I am running, I can still see where I am running!!! When I am driving, I can still see where I am driving!!! This film was without a doubt the worst of the new wave of action movies in delivering scenes that simply could not be made out at all. What a waste of Matt Damon and any of the other men involved in these scenes. Advice to the directorif you are going to continue with slop like thisjust animate it and save some of the money spent on actor's salaries. The whole point of seeing the Bourne movies is to see Matt Damon kick some butt! Some of these stunts and action scenes were so bad, I turned to my sister and said, ""Let me know who wins, will yaI think Uncle Wally filmed this at the last reunion."" (C'mon we all have the one uncle who insists on using the video cam and leaves us all with a nauseating, bouncing, jarring film of just the top of people's heads!) Sorry to admit, I am nearly 40 and grew up in the BIG action movie erathe Rambos, Lethal Weapons, Die Hards, etc. If they could make amazing actions scenes, in which you knew that the actor was still in the scene, then why not now? The directors knew how to squeeze every last ounce of action out of their actors back then and they knew how to share it with the audience.Other than that, the film lives up to the Bourne collection: Matt Damon is excellent, Julie Stiles is lovely (although their conversations consist mostly of sentences left hanging without managing to be intriguing) and of course, Joan Allenfantastic! Great continuation of the story and plot. I look forward to part 4 if there will be one, and can only hope that another director will make it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Gripping, Heart Pounding, Intensity. . . and StoryLine almost keeps up.","The Bourne Trilogy having the benefit of Ultimatum as its closer serves up one of the best modern trilogies. The cat and mouse tactics between Jason and his pursuers is what makes the final segment of this trilogy a required viewing. These scenes are at first compressed into a majority of the first 40 minutes. The beauty of these scenes is that they simply take human nature and inject the highest level of awareness, reflex, and intuition. Its not as though Bourne's act is believable, but its not unbelievable either. The movie eventually tries to down shift, but even in the scenes of circumspection where characters try to process and react to the last crazy action sequence, intensity is rarely if ever lost. Bourne is so fluent in the language of covert tactics that we see notions of evasion, manipulation, and anticipation taken to the highest level. Of course, Bourne's efforts, while amazing are stunningly short lived, equally cool is the way Greengrass portrays the CIA as momentarily hoodwinked, but back on the trail within seconds. Greengrass, the director deserves accolades for his use of the hand-held cameras that give the footage a ""live"" type of feel, and implant the moviegoer into multiple P.O.V's in split second takes. I know this was done in Supremacy, but Greengrass has clearly mastered his own technique, and the manner these scenes are shot in differentiates the movie from your run of the mill action genre.With the movie taking a running start, filled with action sequences, its noticeable that the actual plot lines were never the bread and butter to this movie. Unlike in Identity""where the omnipresent theme of amnesia acted so as to give Damon a boyish innocence/experience identity crisis, and made his romance and battle with the CIA emotionally significant. Ultimatum is more similar to Supremacy in that the plot is now a more bright line ""search for the answer to who I am, and who is to blame"" theme. Bourne finds some answers which do infuse some emotional depth into the robotic plot, but it just seems watching Bourne deconstruct scene after scene of entrapment is more robotic, because we know Bourne, and expect as much. Additionally, as Bourne learns more about himself, the mystery of who he is, and the impact this had on Bourne in the earlier parts of the trilogy vanishes.Lastly, Ultimatum provides a fissure within the CIA in how to handle Bourne. We all know that Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) appears sympathetic to his plight, but now we see Noah Vosen (David Straitham) who is sympathetic to the CIA's plight in keeping secret the truth about Bourne and the program that trains/creates similar black ops. If Landy can see a shade or two of gray, Vosen sees only black and white. This allows for the final match point to develop, in a mad dash through Manhattan. Through all of the location shifts, and cat and mouse games, I think the actual plot and dialogue falter at times, perhaps only because they wind up being truly secondary instruments as compared to the cinematography/action sequencing. I wont hold that against the movie, I still think its top flight cinema that far far surpasses the vast majority of modern day action/thriller movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
just fantabolous!,"I think,this is one the best action movies.

You know what, those Russian people actually speak Russian! they don't speak fake-Russian accent English.My only problem was with Julia Stiles, I still can get used to this girl,she seems very talented but her act never looks convincing to me.

There are no unnecessary scenes, subplots or even dialogs. Everything exists for a reason. It is streamlined and yet it still lasts for two hours, meaning that it has so much action and thrill to offer. The hand held camera adds realism and a sense of urgency throughout the film, without making me nauseous like ""Cloverfield"" did. The music score is excellent, it propels the tension and helps sustain the suspense. In addition, there are no contrived romance or soft porn sex scenes to help sell the film. This helps the film to be focused as a action thriller.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Ultimatum is the ultimate spy story: the year's most satisfying thriller,"In 2002, The Bourne Identity gave the action/thriller genre the shot in the arm it so desperately needed. In 2004, The Bourne Supremacy improved on that, standing out as one of the boldest, most interesting spy films ever made. And now, with The Bourne Ultimatum, the year's best threequel, the trilogy ends triumphantly.Set six weeks after the Moscow showdown at the end of Supremacy (the final scene, where the amnesiac hit-man learns some vital information, is actually part of Ultimatum's narrative), the film shows Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the run once again: even though he contributed to bringing down double agent Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), the CIA director is still convinced he is a threat, with only Pamela Landy thinking otherwise. Things don't get much better when a British reporter (Paddy Considine) writes an article about Bourne and several illegal operations, prompting counter-terror officer Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) to initiate a manhunt that will take the hero (and the viewer) across the globe and closer to the truth, as Bourne starts to remember things and realizes his only choice is to find out the definitive truth about his mysterious past.Roger Ebert cleverly pointed out that in five years and three movies the quest for the truth has almost become, like Hitchcock would say, a MacGuffin, an excuse for the protagonist to run for his life and kick villainous butt in increasingly breathtaking set-pieces. He has a point, as director Paul Greengrass, whose hand-held, edgy approach made The Bourne Supremacy a unique summer blockbuster, ensures the adrenaline level stays sky-high for the entire duration of the film: The Bourne Ultimatum has more action than the first two movies combined, 75% of the picture containing the most inventive chases or fights (hardback book as a weapon, anyone?) since, well, the previous Bourne outing, and it is a real pleasure to watch Damon, who now wears the role as if it were a tailored suit, take the character to new extremes.This doesn't mean the plot is sacrificed in favor of the style, though: the script is solid and intelligent, the traditional intrigue element being treated in a new way and allowing Damon's co-stars (the ambiguous Strathairn and scene-stealing Albert Finney most of all) to play their parts in a three-dimensional way that is unheard of in most action flicks. Heck, the movie is even audacious enough to reuse the second film's ending and give it a whole new meaning, proving once again the Bourne franchise is a lot of steps ahead of average genre pictures.And that's without mentioning the brilliant conclusion: having revealed only what is strictly necessary, Greengrass exposes all his genius in the last images which, while hinting at a possible Bourne Legacy (unlikely, but possible), represent the perfect closure of a series that has raised the bar for action films for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Satisfying but has some weak areas,"I love this trilogy, and as seems to be typical with series, those that come after never live up to the first, and I feel that's the case here. The Bourne Ultimatum did deliver; it's non stop action, but I feel that's a bit of a sell out. This story could have had much more depth and character, as the first did, which is why I liked it in the first place.For example, they could have shown us what Bourne had been doing with his life since the last film, but they didn't show anything. Basically, there was very little dramatic story here; it was all action sequences strung together. I feel that's a cheap way to go. They could have really dug deep to give the audience more story for all that action, but didn't. Also I knew there would be plenty of violence in this one, but didn't like how much of it was graphic in the extreme. It doesn't take talent or skill to show someone getting their head blown off, and is it really necessary to show intense fight scenes resulting in murder, time and time again? They went way overboard with it in my opinion. Sometimes ""less is more"".And one thing that I always find annoying is this hand held camera crap. It might seem suitable for a low budget documentary, but for a film of this size? I felt all the camera shaking was ineffective and detracted form the picture.The film did satisfy, especially at the end, I thought it was brilliant. But I would have shot it very differently.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Gripping fast the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" never lets go until the very satisfying end.","I never thought I would run across a spy movie that would earn a perfect ten. The ""Bourne Identity"", ""Bourne Supremacy"" and ""Bourne Ultimatum"" are perfect examples of NON-Campy spy movies that the public has starved for since the deterioration of the Double 07's. Given, ""Casino Royale"" established a new look-Bond, there was still the womanizing agent who had a defibrillator in his car. Congratulations on the more realistic approach Martin Campbell brought as director of ""Casino Royale"".Realism is what brings Bourne into the spotlight and keeps the taught storyline, pulsating pace and very well developed characters into very symmetrical movie that is hard to keep your eyes off of. You can relate in so many ways to Bourne's struggle for meaning and the struggle of CIA agents who are conflicted in doing what is right versus what they feel is their duty.It was also a classic depiction of a government agency fitting a persona that America believes it to be, an agency with no regret and hardly any regulation.Revelations are abound in this movie and a perfect well-scripted and storyboarded movie it is to the most. A perfect end, or maybe not, to a trilogy that deserves praise and all the money it would make at the box office.As for the steady camera effects or lack there of, it wasn't to where I couldn't distinguish what was going on, I just had to pay closer attention.

Plain and simple Paul Greengrass ruined what looked (at least through all the shaking) like good movies. He's the Uwe Boll of Spy/Action movies.

A third instalment finally delivers!!!,"Having come the the Bourne trilogy relatively late (I saw the second one only a couple of months ago) and having already been disappointed by the influx of third parters this year (Spiderman anyone??) I went into the cinema with low to middle expectations (trailers aside). I could not have been more off the ball. Ultimatum delivers and delivers in spades. A myriad of exotic locations, amazing chase (car & Foot) scenes, extremely well choreographed fight scenes, very clever dialogue and a good end twist/sequel possibility. I have never read the books but the three films stack up well as a trilogy and all credit to Robert Ludlum (Why did my Dad never tell about THESE BOOKS???).

Great finale,"I just saw Bourne 3 and thought it was the best of the series.The movie ties everything together nicely, and keeps it fast paced with nonstop action. As a spectator of Bourne's life you are taken of a fast paced,action packed journey through many countries. I love the use of the shaky camera because it is how Bourne would be seeing these countries. He does not have time to look around and enjoy the sites while he is on the run. Also, I like how the movie is tied into the last one of how he got from Russia to the US. Paul Geengrass has stepped up and become one of the best directors out there. Honestly, I would love to see him tackle the horror movie scene. His style of making films would work great in the horror world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Perfect.  The Best in the Series,"In a summer filled to the brim with threequels, none have managed to tie up a trilogy as well as The Bourne Ultimatum. A big fan of the series, I had high hopes for this movie. Not only did it surpass all my expectations, it raised the bar for what I expect from action films, as well as all films in general. This engaging, well-developed script is brought to life and taken to an all new level with the brilliant cast. It should come as no surprise to Bourne fans, who have seen Matt Damon play Bourne with incomparable depth and complexity throughout the series, that it is his performance that not only carries this film but launches it into the stratosphere. In my humble opinion, he deserves (Dare I say it?) an Oscar nomination for his portrayal, but perhaps that is just wishful thinking. He's had me so convinced that he is Bourne that I have had to check the database to make sure his name is really Matt Damon. Outstanding. Don't even get me started on the rest of the cast.Of course, what is an action movie without...well...action? This is far and away the best of the series in terms of cinematography and choreography. I was ready to jump out of my seat throughout the movie. Truly some of the best action I've seen in a film to date.I left The Bourne Ultimatum with a smile on my face and I have not been this enthusiastic about a movie's quality in quite some time. I recommend those who haven't seen the first two to view them before jumping in, but you don't have to be a fan to appreciate this action masterpiece. Perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Matt Damon shines yet again  !!,"The third installment in the Bourne franchise does not disappoint. This is an adrenalin charged actioner (cliche), with very little time spared for any subtle or quiet moments. Even in the talkie parts the director chooses to keep the camera moving unlike the first two.The filmmaker tried to induce a sense of confusion and realism in the frames by constantly keeping the frame on the move and not stagnant at any point for more than 3 seconds. It works well if you sit really far from the big screen and view it .Coming back to the film, it sets its pace right from the beginning and never lets up. Its a thrill every minute to see Bourne use his skills against the people who trained him to be what he has become.It has enough action and story to keep you engrossed for two hours and the actors wont disappoint you. There are some new faces compared to the last two films but that is not a complaint because very sequel needs new blood to keep it fresh. Matt damon gets full marks for an electric performance and joan allen is her usual best.If you expect to watch a movie whose main premise is to showcase its incredible chase set pieces, you won't be disappointed.8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne - Disappointment,"If you like to see stupid men uttering stupid Hollywood/CIA-clichés, if you're into nervous and annoying camera movements that camouflage nothing-but-mediocre action shots, if you cannot get enough of cars being demolished over and over again, this could be a film for you. The fuzz about this movie has no real reason at all - I guess people are like parrots, repeating what others say without thinking themselves. After one hour this film really started to bore me but somehow I made it to the end, just to know if the last minutes could somehow make up for wasting my time. They could not. Is Jason Bourne supposed to be the Six Million Dollar Man of the 21 st century or what? I couldn't help laughing my a** off! This guy is supposed to see people he wants to see at a distance of about 100 yards - in a crowd in narrow streets an being chased himself!!! It's just ridiculous. This is only one example in a movie that had no real depth or plot - it's just chasing and running away over and over again, and in that respect nothing better than Part 1 of the trilogy (which was very simple-made). This is definitely a film for teenage boys or men that lack the ability of growing up mentally.",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Recycled,"Same boring Bourne BS that you saw in the first two. Regardless of whether or not you're a fan of this series, this movie does NOT deserve the spectacular IMDb rating that it's received thus far. As I've stated in past comments, IMDb ratings are no longer a reliable metric for movie ratings. Despite obvious effort to posture the movie as if it contained interesting plot twists or mind bending revelations about Bourne's origins, I'm afraid it is nothing more than its two predecessors - mindless tripe. So if that's what you're looking for then this is your movie, otherwise, spend your time and money elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Bourne Returns Strong,"Matt Damon as Jason Bourne comes home to exact revenge in Paul Greengrass's ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", and it is well worth the wait. Greengrass and screenwriter Tony Gilroy return in this conclusion based on Robert Ludlum's ""Bourne"" trilogy. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a smart intense action packed thrill ride. Matt Damon is powerful as Jason Bourne, the government assassin desperately in search of his past and those who created him. Bourne says, "" and this is where it ends."" Bourne (Damon) escapes termination in Russia, and recalls vestiges of his origin. He tracks down British reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), who has written about Bourne and the training program he was a part, to determine who is the source of this information.This soon leads to a clash with Black Ops director Noah Vosen (the great David Stratharin), who enlists CIA Operations Lead Pamela Landy (smart and sexy Joan Allen) to hunt down Bourne. All is not what it seems; Noah is somehow protecting Director Ezra Kramer (strong Scott Glenn). Noah leads a successor to the Treadstone program that created Jason Bourne (Damon). Pam pleads to Noah that Bourne must be taken alive to resolve this intelligence breach. Ignoring Pam, Noah orders Bourne be killed on sightactivating assassins to kill him. Bourne finds an unlikely ally in Nicky Parson (Julia Stiles, also in the previous movies), who may have had a past relationship with Jason which he does not remember.""The Bourne Ultimatum"" has one the best fight scenes, ever. The fight with Jason and Desh (Joey Ansah) is brutally electrifying. Renowned stunt choreographer Jeff Imada said that he used kali in the scene. There are also elements of jeet kune do and aikidoand others I don't know. The fight is realistic and exquisitely executed. Ansah is an accomplished martial artist. Damon, who is in great shape, looks amazing in this knock down fight to the death. Aside from the appreciation of the great skill, this is a signature of the story. Bourne is old school. Desh represents the next generation of assassin: young, strong, and merciless. Desh accepts his mission to kill Bourne without question. Bourne on the other hand, is haunted by his past. At one point he confesses to Nicky (Stiles), ""I see all the faces of everyone I killed"" He also accepts that he can never be forgiven for what he has done. This declaration in a sense makes Bourne honorable in this cloak and dagger world.I agree with Richard Roeper that Matt Damon gives an award worthy performance as Jason Bourne, but that is also unlikely given this is an action movie. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a great action movie, largely due to Damon's performance. Damon is a powerful and physical presence. He eloquently balances the impeccable action scenes with the quiet introspective moments. Joan Allen is great as Pamela Landy. She commands a natural authority and respect, at the same time hinting at a weariness of the cost of freedom in the intelligence war on terror. Allen always brings an acute intelligence and strength that I find so attractive. David Stratharin is masterful in capping Noah's capabilityjust shy of Bourne's. His Noah is the obvious villain of Bourne maintained more as an undercurrent. Stratharin is amazing. Julia Stiles is smart and tough as Nicky; however, she isn't given much noteworthy to do. Here she may just be a pawn of the story.Paul Greengrass (""United 93"") elevates the action movie to another level in ""Ultimatum"". Greengrass blitzes through the story across different countries, eventually concluding the States. His narrative style is focused and coherent throughout, effectively managing the spectacular action scenes along with Gilroy's crisp dialog. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is one of the great action movies, and I would welcome another return of Jason Bourne with Greengrass and Damon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The best in the series,"Ultimatum is by far the best of the trilogy. Full awesome action that thanks to it's great editing and directing, is easy to follow despite all the shaky cam and quick cutting (the amazing fight between Bourne and Desh is a huge step up from the headache inducing kitchen fight from Supremacy).Small moments like Bourne repeating The Professor's line at the end and the implication that he and Nicky may have been in a relationship before Treadstone give this movie and its predecessors a lot more weight and emotion on rewatches.I haven't seen Legacy and it's been forever since I've seen Jason Bourne (though I don't remember liking it that much), so I might watch them too, but honestly, as a trilogy, this is one of the best. Each entry is better than the last one and it has one hell of an ending. More sequels were not needed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A Plodding Cartoon About Bureaucracy,"I counted about 4-5 action sequences, and the rest was the trite cliché of a bunch of agents in a dark room playing with computers that create only-in-the-movies graphics and speaking to each other through dialogue was as mundane and predictable as the acting. If you're ready to sit through two hours of dark rooms and suspicious looks and obvious foreshadowing and sinister motives made by people you assumed were sinister to begin with, then this is right up your alley.

excellent viewing!,"A fantastic conclusion to this trilogy, Matt Damon is back in fine form, no topless scenes though girls and i'm not sure if he looks like the 37 years old his character is meant to be, never mind. Lots of wobble cam moments but I found this only added to the gritty and real nature of the movie. Top notch acting, great country and city scape scenes, and only a couple of unanswered questions left to keep me wanting more Bourne! I'm pleased it starts right where the second ended. I would recommend you watch the second right before you watch this. Bourne, eventually finds out where it all began and faces many challenges along the way. Great chase scenes especially a one on an old rusty motorbike through Tangiers. I hope the film writers, decide to write another even though Robert Ludlum didn't.

I watched this movie, twice on the same day, mostly because I had nothing else to do that day.My wife had to work that day and I, for having watched all the past Bourne movies, could not miss this one. There were other movies I watched after this one, but this was the best movie I've seen that day.Shortly after watching this movie, Rush Hour 3, was released and the Bourne Ultimatum slipped down at the cinemas.I recommend this movie to anyone that want to see excessive amounts of action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Matt Damon and David Strathairn went from serious roles to this?,"Sorry if I have a hard time accepting high action flicks as anything Oscar-worthy, but they just don't appeal to me. Therefore, if you're the type who loves action movies more than anything else, you might as well stop reading this review and instead seek another one. But if you choose to continue reading, then I'll say that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is not an awful movie. It's just that after Matt Damon starred in ""The Good Shepherd"" and David Strathairn starred in ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", this seems really lame.The movie's strength lies in looking at the government's surveillance apparatus (it must be weird to work in that kind of environment). But seriously, after the two male stars played roles alluding directly to events in the world today, a Bruce Willis-style vehicle hardly registers. OK, but don't make it your first choice.

A Nutshell Review: The Bourne Ultimatum,"Move aside Transformers. Retire John McClane. Matt Damon is back as the best of the best prototype secret agent-assassin Jason Bourne, and his Ultimatum wins the best action movie of the summer, hands down and without a single thread of doubt! Loosely based on the Robert Ludlum novels of the same name, the movie version starring Damon in the titular role, have already established itself as serious, slick, and got almost everything right in the spy movie genre. It owned James Bond, and in my opinion, possibly one of the best franchises out there.Though the poster of the movie had Damon in a pose resembling Mark Wahlberg, the Bourne series is clearly the movies that boosted Damon's bankability as an A-list star, as we follow with much interest how Jason Bourne suffers from amnesia from Identity, to being hunted down and out for personal revenge in Supremacy, before coming back home to discover the background and truth of his identity in Ultimatum, which for some parts, had Wolverine styled flashbacks into a highly top secret project within the depths of the CIA.In this cat and mouse game, he becomes both the hunter and the hunted, interchanging between the roles as he tries to outwit the slew of assassins coming after him, since he's accused of committing treason and being the source of a leak. He's been on the run for three years, and there's no letting up, no thanks to Noah Vosen (David Strathaim) from the CIA, out for his blood, and who reports to someone who might hold the key to Bourne's own past. It's suspenseful action from the get go all the way to the end, and once it grips you, there's no letting go. The adrenaline you get from watching Ultimatum, is simply an indescribable feeling of joy for any action junkie out there.With tight links to the earlier movies, it pays if you have watched them prior to this, as Bourne maneuvers his way to find out who he is, and at the same time, build on the trust already established with his previous hunter Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), who becomes his off the record source of help from the inside. Julia Stiles returns too as Nicky Parsons, and fans of Stiles will be glad with her slightly expanded role here providing that tinge of sexual tension between herself and Jason Bourne.The action scenes marked a slight departure from its predecessors, but for the better. The close quartered fisticuffs combat in the earlier movies have rather been quite a hallmark, as Bourne dispatches his opponents with hard hitting series of punches and kicks, and contained what is probably more realistic human to human fights which doesn't seem choreographed given its realism. But having too much of a good thing becomes a repetitive bore, and thankfully, such scenes are kept short and sharp, and few and far between. What is excellent here, is how Bourne utilizes more of his smarts to outwit, outplay and outlast his opponents, and those sequences in England and New York are testament to that - smart, adrenaline pumping, thrilling, and at the end of it, you can't help but to cheer!Like any self-respecting spy movie, Ultimatum had its fair share of jetsetting locations in Europe clocking up frequent flyer miles. Nothing beats having to go to new location after new location where the story takes you, and being a man on the run, this is but part of standard protocol. And the movie can't be complete without the complimentary car chase sequence, and this Paul Greengrass directed installment could possibly have one of the best I've seen in re cent years, with the car as a battering ram, and everything going boom and bang right at your face, directly to the camera. I reckon if watch on the IMAX, you'll probably start to cower and shield yourself from the flying debris.The Bourne Ultimatum is a winner, and a fine wrap up of the franchise should it choose to end at this point. Besides the ending of Smokin Aces, the ending here will also be one of my personal favourites, as it cunningly showed everything coming to full circle, and with Moby's Extreme Ways, the theme song used in all the Damon-Bourne movies, comes blaring through the speakers, it's just plain sweetness...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Remember Everything. Forgive Nothing.,"Here's a tip: don't eat before you enter the cinema. This is one stomach-turning film.I say that not as a criticism of its quality. Quite the opposite in fact; this film represents the new elite of Hollywood: brainy AND ballsy, edgy without preachy, fun without betraying the characters' cores.The camera-work is what will kill the stomach. It moves with such velocity sometimes that I found myself squinting to make out what's going on. A marvelous tool to bring reality to what would otherwise be a difficult-to-believe plot line. It makes you feel not like you're some static viewer, but someone whose been thrown into the pit of this chaotic tale and you're constantly chasing the characters as they blast and bark their way through scenes.Which brings me to the acting: effortlessly perfect. Damon is a brilliant actor in my mind. Most main stars would be all-too-tempted to be showy and just begging to throw soundbites here and there. (I'm looking at you, Cruise.) Matt has the modesty, temperance and understanding not only to hold back with dignity, but be damn-near silent throughout most of the film. This in turn allows him to play the real character: an unstoppable weapon of destruction hell-bent on wreaking justice on those that took away his life and his love. Words are seldom used on his part because they are seldom necessary. When he does speak, it's mostly terse commands or direct inquiries, with a gun in his hand. A comment on government style these days, perhaps? Joan Allen is another excellent performer. She really pulls off the role with style. She makes her work seem effortless in all the films she's done that I've seen, but especially in this film she shines as an actress fully-capable of immersing herself in the character. By the end of this film you can fully relate to how she's changed from chasing Bourne to...well, you'll see.Julia Stiles is not my favourite actress in the world, but maybe that's only because I'm not a major fan of her films. they always seemed to be in the teenybopper area, which ain't my cuppa tea. This film shows her to be a very mature, and restrained actress. Again it must take discipline to be able to hold back, remain cold, on a big Hollywood film. She does it admirably. Whilst still not being the best at emoting---or perhaps that's the point of her character?---she does however give us another viewpoint on the plot line, another angle on Bourne, and that's more than can be said for most actors out there.Director Paul Greengrass is a gift from God as far as I'm concerned. He seems incapable of any ego-ish actions. Most directors when standing on the pedestal of cash handed to them by their thankful and greedy producers, tend to display all the restraint of a five year old with ADHD. This their chance to shine and they frequently blow up instead. Greengrass takes the world by the unmentionables and shoves it in our face, shows us the ugly as well as the beautiful, takes the grit of real-life espionage and rubs it in our eyes til we're war-hardened and tired. And that's exactly the point. It's no secret he and his fellow castmembers harbour reservations when it comes to the USA foreign policy. This film is a direct FU to those people, but done in an intellectual and entertaining way.These, to me, are the essential attributes of an excellent film.The upside: bombs, guns, chases and riveting dialogue.The downside: stomach-quaking camera-work, you have to see the previous two to really get emotionally involved.The sum-up: see it, and think on what the world we live in really is all about.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
An Improvement From the Previous Bourne Movies,"As a fan of the Bourne franchise, I was a bit let down from the previous outing, ""The Bourne Identity"". Having read the novel, I had high expectations going into the theaters that I was in for a treat. But all my hopes became shattered. But ""The Bourne Supremacy"", released two years later lived up to its name by being more supreme than its predecessor. This movie itself got me interested in the Bourne series. I soon began to realize that director Paul Greengrass and script writer Tony Gilroy and company collaborated to create a new action hero that will appeal to the younger audience in this generation. Much like, Ian Fleming did for James Bond. From the mind of this unusual hero, we know he's done bad things in his life, but because he has amnesia, he doesn't remember exactly what they were. Set in our modern society where even the good can't be trusted, the Jason Bourne character is the definitive answer towards morality.""The Bourne Ultimatim"" is the third addition to the series based on a novel by Robert Ludlum, is where narration is at its zenith. It's positive message and nail-biting scenes will have you captivated in its almost two hour running time. Once again, Matt Damon is back again and seems more at ease than he was in the other two movies still wondering how or who put him in the predicament that he's in now. This time Bourne is in London and a reporter (Paddy Considine) informs him of an organization called Blackbrier, a more menacing organization than Treadstone that's run by an evil CIA agent (David Stratairn), who wants Bourne dead. Also in pursuit of Bourne is a girl named Pam Lundy (Joan Allen) who has faith, that Bourne is not a threat that the CIA assumes he is. And the city-hopping is off in full swing up to his final destination in New York where he fights off his ex-handlers.Though not a thinking-movie like ""The Bourne Supremacy"", this movie depends more on action and non-stop chases, for all action fans. And anyone who gets in Bourne's face, will likely get pummeled. Bourne has Blackbeier's henchman after him who seem to expose similar traits as him. But Bourne is more well-versed than them, so that gives him still the upper edge. Very tense scenes on the rooftops of Tangiers to the traffic-laden streets of the Big Apple, the chase reign supreme.In ""Ultimatum"", in spite of the surreal settings and chase scenes, a surprising element you don't see often in action films is that in this movie the characters are believable. The bad guys depicted here look the part as bigwig corporate monsters trying to bring down their man. This portrayal gives you all the more to support Jason Bourne. Damon was made to play Bourne, he never stops to pose, or takes his role uber-seriously, but understands his character and tries to go through to him.The supporting cast was excellent, especially the interactions between Stratairn and Allen as the two antagonists from different worlds trying to bring down Bourne. It was nice to see Julia Stiles back as Nicky with more secrets about Bourne. And Scott Glenn is noteworthy in another top official as a CIA director.The direction by Paul Greengrass was exceptional as brings new light to the Bourne chapter. With the help of screenwriter Tony Gilroy, Greengrass was able to adapt something new to the final chapter where Bourne has to accept what he has done and to accept the consequences. The score by John Powell won't appeal to others, but fits in with the scenes.Overall a very riveting action film, that's very believable and exciting to watch and never insults its audience. This movie calls for multiple viewings and a satisfying addition to action movie fans. One not to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne Superb.............,"Well yet another exceptional Bourne movie to add to the list.......This movie has everything that a film of this genre needs, high speed action, edge of your seat tension, a great action star, a brilliant enemy and loads of crashes and explosions.

His supporting cast also hit the mark, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Julia Stiles and even though smaller parts Albert Finney and Scott Glenn all give credible and believable performances.The Direction is superb, Paul Greengrass certainly has ability in the buckets full. The tension never really drops, the action never really drops and the quality he gets out the cast, from the big guns to the bit players never really drops either.The script like the previous two movies is first class, nobody in the movie has any uninteresting lines of dialogue or any over the top scenario's.I have to mention the action in more detail. Whats exceptional about it is it feels real and plausible. Its no CGI monster this one, the visual effects and stunt coordinators earned their money with some out-standing set pieces. The hand to hand combat in my opinion is second to none, and the car chases leave you with white knuckles.Overall this is a masterclass of action movie film-making, everybody performed well and everybody deserves credit, this falls into the ""must see"" bracket.....********* out of **********",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

What was with the jerky camera movements and fast cutting from scene to scene? The shots were all over the place and made me feel nauseous. The longest shot - from what I saw - was about 3 seconds long and thats being generous. There was no opportunity given to observe anything real, as though the director was trying to mask something from the viewer - maybe inept incompetence as a film maker. There are many other films made with the hand held camera approach to add a sense of realism; but not to this epileptic extreme.I haven't seen the first two 'Bourne' films, but this one had such a high user rating I was intrigued.

I don't even have to wait until Rush hour 3 hits the theaters to know that none of these characters will be equal to to Jason Bourne.Pamela Landy (Joan Allen): This is Jason Bourne, the toughest target that you have ever tracked.Pamela Landy: He is really good at staying alive, and trying to kill him and failing... just pisses him off.Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Supremacy) has established himself as the King of the Action Films with this delight.

A Welcome Addition To The Series,"There is the possibility that this film can be under-appreciated. The nay sayers will say nay, as they have throughout this series, but I suspect that they are opposed to taking pleasure in any film that exists solely for the benefit of entertaining audiences, which the Bourne movies do well, including this one.Bourne Ultimatum sets off head long into the throws of a story that picks up very shortly after the events of the preceding film's conclusion, which left very few characters to be revisited from the ever dwindling principal cast. Facing new opposition, these are the players which Bourne is forced to rely upon, to complete his self assigned mission, of reaching the source of his search, for the answers to the questions, who is Jason Bourne, & where did he come from?Does this film contain less overall plot development than its predecessors? Yes, but it is nearly unheard of to be able to claim the opposite, when referring to the third installment in any cinematic series. This is the only verifiable fault of this movie, & it's surely nitpicking too damn the film on that basis alone.In every other way worth noting, this film is a success. It travels in the directions that were virtually unavoidable, & though Bourne's hunters are no more prepared to face him, than their earlier counterparts, the characters are no less viable, nor are the actors' performances. The suspense continues to be taught, & the action is overwhelming.Matt Damon is true to the character, as it's become, & the supporting cast manages to deliver, in spite of there being less for them to work with. If this is truly the finale of Jason Bourne, then it does sew things up somewhat neatly, if not much else. I can't say that I'd be completely fulfilled were this to be the last film of the series, but then again there is no guaranteeing that it is. Such being the case, I can say no less than this is a welcome addition to the series, & entertaining to watch, & that they keep me wanting more",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Bourne Again, Again: A slight step down from 'Supremacy' but still good","Here we have the third film in the Bourne series, which is also the second of the films to have been directed by Paul Greengrass.

David Strathairn steps into the role of the latest guy who's out get Bourne and he does a decent job, though I much preferred Brian Cox. There are a few other noticeable names in smaller roles as well, including Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine & Albert Finney.The script is packed with the same brand of action that made the first two films in the series noteworthy. While a different approach would have been refreshing it was nevertheless satisfying to see Bourne in pursuit of the secrets that truly made him who he is.The direction by Paul Greengrass is very close to that of the previous film. There is a real uniformity between this film and ""The Bourne Supremacy"". I would have welcomed a bit of a change but for those who enjoyed the style of the second film this one is more of the same in terms of direction, editing, music and so on.I can't quite see why this is the highest rated of the three Bourne films to date, though. I prefer it to ""The Bourne Identity"" but it's a bit too similar to ""The Bourne Supremacy"" for its own good. That being said, if all you're looking for is more of the same then I doubt that you'll be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Damon Dynamic in Best of Bourne.,"This review contains NO SPOILERS for this movie - ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". There are some SPOILERS for ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"".Firstly if you're a fan of Robert Ludlum's books don't look to the movies as a comparison. The movies follow an entirely different plot through the entire series and there is no continuity between them.The Bourne Identity took us through Bourne's first ventures into self-discovery after waking up on a trawler without any idea who he was. The end of the story left him with his girlfriend (played by Franke Potente) romantically reuniting at her beach front store.""Identity"" was a defining thriller because it had been a long time since we'd seen a credible ""secret agent"" with a serious thriller tone that had a fulfilling plot and glut of fulfilling action sequences. Add to that a series of cameo characters (such as Children of Men's Clive Owen) and ""Identity"" had it all and rightfully has become a fondly remembered example of the genre. 8/10The first sequel - ""The Bourne Supremacy"" - took us directly from the end of ""Identity"" where very soon Bourne's girlfriend is shot dead and Bourne goes on the hunt for revenge and carries out his threat that he issued in ""Identity"" that if the CIA unit that created him ever came after him he would bring the fight back to their door.""Supremacy"" desperately seemed to lack any actual ""support"" from the supporting cast. Whilst Damon is an accomplished actor one man rarely if ever holds an entire movie. A Russian speaking Karl Urban did little to present a charismatic bad guy.""Supremacy"" disappointed in terms of the action sequences and in terms of a fully developed plot. The lack of any role for a supporting cast almost rendered ""Supremacy"" a thorough waste of time. There were, however, some bright moments, and some character development.6/10In watching ""Supremacy"" in fact it was my initial feeling that I had watched a movie that was simply intended as a bridge to another sequel. I feel I was right for more reasons than I could imagine but you'll have to see all three films to know what I mean.Cue the second sequel or ""Threequel""  a popular trend this year - ""The Bourne Ultimatum"".I would recommend anyone thinking of seeing ""Ultimatum"" to watch or re-watch both ""Identity"" but particularly ""Supremacy"" as everything will make more sense  particularly, and I think I can say this without spoiling anything, the sequence in New York City.As is now expected with a ""Bourne movie"" one is treated to vistas of cities across the world. It has a Bond-esquire feeling if only for the fact that we are repeatedly treated to the sounds and sights of spectacular cities and magnificent vistas.This time out the journey feels much more natural and plot driven and it takes us back to the roller-coaster feeling we had in ""Identity"".Matt Damon is superb throughout  his acting chops have considerably improved over the past decade or so since we saw him in the 2002 release of ""The Bourne Identity"".In ""Ultimatum"" Bourne is fearsome, awesome, and devastating. It no longer feels like it's just a character  this time Bourne has a persona  and he can be petrifying with every carefully choreographed movement.Julia Stiles has had a checkered career thus far  granted she's only 26 now in 2007. Sometimes Julia Stiles reminds me of a ""Star Trek"" holographic character  but one with only two or three programmed personas.Stiles has perfected and should have maybe patented the character I would call ""What-ev-r""  or ""Valley girl with bad attitude"". As for her other setting - she has always seemed to work to great perfection that character of ""Scared bunny rabbit"" or ""Deer in the headlights"". There is, I suppose a third, but to be kind to Ms Stiles - Let's quickly skip over her performances as ""Reluctant White Urban Dance Princess"".So  I'm writing about Julia Stiles, the actor, as 'Nicky Parsons"" and perhaps I should have always limited myself to that.Here in ""Ultimatum"", Stiles seems to have found a way to rewrite her own programming and has come up with a more than acceptable actress. She's not a Charlize Theron or a Nicole Kidman yet  but her improvements are unmistakable. Stiles seems smart and genuine even in this limited role.To summarize, This is by far the best of the Bourne movie series. You need to have seen the others to understand the whole story  but this is a definite high point in this franchise that can be enjoyed stand-alone.Matt Damon deserves acclaim for a truly memorable performance.The action sequences will leave you breathless, the story is intense and reminiscent of one of the Harrison Ford ""Jack Ryan"" movies, and the trademark shaky camera now seems successful in conveying the organic quality that was intended.""Identity"" felt like it succeeded on youthful exuberance taking it to the very edge. ""Supremacy"" felt like a dutiful but near-blind old workhorse, willing but unable to find it's true path. ""Ultimatum"" feels like a truly purposeful and yet unrestrained stallion of a thriller.See it in the theatre  it's well worth it for such a great ride.9/10Finally some notes on awards.Award worthy performances for supporting cast come from Joan Allen reprising her role as ""Pamela Landy"" and the excellent Albert Finney as ""Dr Albert Hirsch"".Notably, 71-year-old Finney has never won an Oscar, despite being nominated 5 times (most notably as supporting actor for 2001's ""Erin Brokovich"" and for leading actor in the 1974 production of ""Murder on the Orient Express""). It's about time, methinks.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Makes 007 look like Inspector Morse,"I am a fan of Morse, but the style is like filling in a crossword puzzle - hardly action-packed excitement. However Matt Damon as Jason Bourne makes James Bond - even Daniel Craig - look like Morse - although Jason has the intelligence of Morse, which Bond has never had. This film's action is like the violence in The Passion of the Christ - RELENTLESS - like the Faces album; Never a Dull Moment. I've liked Matt Damon's acting since I watched The Talented Mr Ripley, and he is the ideal Jason Bourne.I just hope there is another sequel with more Julia Stiles, and David Strathairn - the best ""straight"" baddie since Alan Rickman's humorous baddies in Die Hard and Robin Hood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Perfect action movie,"This is the perfect action movie and perfect action movie series. It has everything you want in a good action movie. Dynamite chase scenes, amazingly choreographed fight scenes, deep character backgrounds, a compelling story, and incredible and unique camera work. Also, the story leaves off at a cliffhanger. This opens the door to even further sequels, which i'm sure would only make everyone happy.Usually sequels to movies turn out to ruin the series, especially when you get to the third movie. I think this movie puts the ""Bourne"" movies into the upper echelon of action movie series. Don't be surprised if you hear people say that the ""Bourne"" series is better than the ""Die Hard"" series. I certainly believe that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Ultimatum Lives Up to Its Predecessors,"http://www.ParcEntertainment.comhttp://FrameRate.blog.comI quickly found out by watching The Bourne Ultimatum that I can hold my breath for about 100 minutes. The intensity and energy of this film is unbelievable and easily lives up to the previous two installments. Ultimatum rounds out the trilogy nicely, but it left me hoping for a fourth adventure.Part three begins exactly where part two left off. In fact, as complicated as it may sound, some events in Ultimatum actually coincide with events that were seen in Supremacy. The chronology of the two films overlap in places, which I found quite a remarkable achievement for the writers and continuity people on the crew. For example, the very last scene of Supremacy shows up about 3/4 of the way into Ultimatum, and yet the two stories are completely different.Matt Damon again reprises his role as the infamous forgetful assassin, Jason Bourne - the product of a top secret CIA behavioral moderation program. But the memories of his past still prove elusive and he still yearns to put all the pieces together. His hope of uncovering the past lies with a British journalist, Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) who has a source within the CIA who holds the answers. As Bourne picks up the trail to find this informant, top CIA man Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) and his team work tirelessly to keep the lid on tight. And if that means killing Bourne in the process - so be it.The action of this film starts at the very onset and doesn't let up. The viewer is taken to locales all over the world, including Turin, Italy; Tangier, Morocco; Madrid, Spain, and New York City. Once again Bourne proves to be a smart operative, dodging the CIA's hit squad and staying once step ahead of the guys in Langley. The entire film is hip, intelligent, and clever, without being overly-complicated. The plot is easy enough to follow, but is similar in places to The Bourne Identity. The story doesn't quite separate itself from the original as Supremacy managed to do.Paul Greengrass, who helmed Supremacy, once again takes on the chores of directing. His documentary style of shooting puts the audience right in the action, with enough subjective hand-held shots and shaky camera work to make anyone nauseous. Greengrass would have done well to pull out on some of these fight scenes and car chases to give us more establishing shots. It's very disorienting to the point of distracting. Often it's difficult to tell just exactly what's going on.Matt Damon fills the role of Jason Bourne nicely, blending cold intensity with a sense of vulnerability. However, more attention was placed on characterization in The Bourne Identity than in The Bourne Ultimatum. It seemed to be all action with no depth of character. The fault here lies with Greengrass, who apparently didn't want to take the time to flesh out the characters and their motivations. What comes across is a cast of so-so performances, when (with a little attention) they could have been just as explosive as the action.In all, The Bourne Ultimatum is raw and intense with a ton of action - spectacular fight scenes, car chases, and gun battles. Bourne is the new Bond.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Ultimate thriller , engaging viscerally and intellectually","It is rare for Hollywood to make an action movie that can keep audiences captivated for its entire duration. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is that rare gem of an action movie that is engaging viscerally and intellectually.Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne in this third of the Bourne movies - based on the popular Robert Ludlum novels - along with director Paul Greengrass, who also helmed the second installment ""The Bourne Supremacy"".Damon's Bourne continues on his quest to find out what his motives for killing people are: He is fully aware that he is a killer but has no idea how he became one. And since he has amnesia he has to depend on vague fleeting memories to piece together the puzzle.He might be troubled but he is also resolute. He wants to find out how he became what he is. It is this resoluteness and the quest that is the heart and soul of the movie.The most exciting aspect of the movie is the momentum of the action. In essence it is just one long chase scene. It sets the pulse from the word go and for its entire duration does not miss a beat.The movie begins by jumping in exactly where the second movie ended and doesn't bother to provide any background details. For those who have not seen the first two installments, this movie will be slightly confusing.The chase scenes are exhilarating but not in a stylistic way. The director employs the hand-held camera technique, which makes us feel we are in the centre of the action. The action has an organic feel to it.In a one-on-one fistfight sequence there is no background music but just the sound of heavy breathing and cracking bones. Since it is in an apartment the two fighters resort to using a book, a rag and a toothbrush. It is a testament to the genius of the director that he creates engrossing action without resorting to explosions and blood.Damon fleshes out his role with great subtlety. And the cast is rounded off well by some fine performances. Joan Allen returns as Pamela Landy, the CIA boss who is responsible for catching Bourne.Scott Glen appears briefly as CIA director who just wants his subordinates to get the job done without involving him and the Oscar-nominated David Strarthairn is a company representative who is muscling in the operation to nab Bourne.The legendary Albert Finney drops by to play the man responsible for making Bourne a killing machine. Julia stiles is Nicky Parsons, a young agent who has known Bourne from the beginning and provides what little information she can to him.Another merit of this movie is the global locales. It jumps from London to Moscow, Paris, Tangier and New York. In ""The Bourne Supremacy"", a pivotal development of the story where a key member gets killed takes place in Goa.Bourne speaks every language he will need to know in any place he finds himself in. Though the movie shifts locales the thread of Bourne's purpose runs clearly through and the pulse is steadily maintained.The movie has fared well at the box office internationally and is sure to boost the fortunes of Damon and the director. But on a cinematic level, the movie has just raised the bar for action movies and Hollywood is going to have to scramble to keep pace with Bourne.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Ultimatum trilogy of all time!!!,"I don't often write user comments here. But now i just have to. And sorry for my bad English.I have not read the books but i have seen all three movies and that's the point at this website.This movie(s) got it all. It's ""on the edge of the seat"" movie(s) all the way to the end. I think of all the three Bourne movies as one long Bourne movie. Cut it in small parts and u got a totally great TV-series. It's about spy's, mysteries and conspiracy. What more do you want? I don't know how they do it but the actors fit in all the way. When i watched this last Bourne movie i got tears in my eyes, and I'm not kidding. This is REAL art!!! Matt Damon once again shows what a great actor he is. No one could do Bourne better than him.Bourne once again starts to remember things about his past. Bourne is getting closer and closer the truth about himself and CIA wants to close him down by killing him so there jobs in CIA can be saved. I don't want to say to much about this movie....just watch it and get amazed! I have heard rumors about a 4th movie and i really hope it's true. And i think there is room for a 5th movie in the Bourne series.Just watch all the three movies and enjoy!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne ultimatum!,"Another gritty spy movie! Before commenting on this movie, I have not watch the last two movies bu I roughly know the story. In the last two movies, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon)is trying to find out who he is. He is trying to search his unknown past. That is all I know. It seems interesting and it is interesting. It boasts great intense car chase scenes which is amazing but I can't really stand the shaking hand of the camera man. They wanted to make it more gritty. The shaking scenes gave me a hell lot of headache. And almost all the action scenes, they had to shake the camera.It is good, it has great action and has suspense too. I was actually only interested if Jason would die. That is why I watched this film. I must say I am pleased with the action. If you are the type that you will die if you don't watch the last part of a suspense movie immediately, I am sure this will kill you. It does have a great deal of suspense. It is good to watch it in cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Bourne Ultimatum One Of The Best Films Of 2007,"The Bourne Ultimatum was one of the best movies of 2007. It had tough competition with Spider-man 3 and Pirates 3 which at least to me were big disappointments compared to the Bourne Ultimatum. Matt Damon continues to prove how good of an actor he is in this film. He's the perfect choice as Bourne a highly skilled former CIA assassin who's trying to discover the secret behind his mysterious past. The rest of the supporting cast including Julia Stiles, David Straithan, Edgar Ramirez, Albert Finney, and Joan Allen are all great in their roles. I can't think of one thing I didn't think about this film. The ending fits the film and is a worthy addition to add to the impressive spy trilogy. As long as Matt Damon is up to playing Bourne again I can't see why they couldn't make more. Because all three Bourne movies have been good and is one trilogy that didn't end up being a disappointment. I was very impressed with The Bourne Ultimatum and is now one of the favorite movies. If you haven't seen this film yet then go see it now. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Random Violence,"Robert Ludlum is, for me, unreadable. He writes techno-thrillers burdened down less by real thrills than by boring compilations of weapons specifications. Movies made from his books are, for me, only slightly more interesting. This was my first Bourne picture. The scenery -- Madrid, Tangier, even Manhattan -- was pretty. The action sequences were repetitive, unbelievable, predictable in their outcomes, and randomly violent. The characterizations and plot development were missing in action.Black operations surely exist within the U.S. government run by pointed headed bureaucrats who truly believe that, by skirting the law and the bounds of moral decency, they are saving the Republic. The tables are turned in this movie, arrests are made, and Congress launches a public investigation. How unrealistic can a film-maker get?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Like a fine wine, ""Bourne"" improves with age","In most spy thrillers, the villains are people from outside the U.S. who run roughshod over the world with their military, political or economic machinations. But not since Rambo has a cinematic hero taken on our own government as the bad guys. Like Rambo, his training has turned him into a nearly invincible fighting machine, who ironically now opposes his former bosses. As each sequel has progressed from the first BOURNE outing, Jason has attempted to come back home, like a loyal dog, but his masters keep barring the door. This dogged pursuit of his goal has made Matt Damon's character a screen icon right up there with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan. This latest ""Bourne"" installment, which I caught at my favorite Garland cinema house, is as equally well-made and entertaining as its predecessors. Great locations set the scene for great action sequences like the chase scenes on the streets of Tangier and New York City, and the fight scene in the bathroom with the asset is arguably Jason's best ever albeit shot at a little too fast a pace. Throw in some fine character development, a good musical score and a story full of suspense, and you'll find yourself strapped in for a great thrill ride. And without giving too much away, the story comes full circle back to the same physical environment from where Jason began his odyssey. I'm really looking forward to popping the cork on the next entry in the series, especially now that Jason seems to have picked an an ally and possible love interest in the form of Nicky Parsons.

This Movie Is Boring!,"Should be renamed ""The Bourde Ultimatum"" because it bored me to death. At least 80% of this is chase scenes. If that's all you want in a film, then by all means this garbage is your cup of tea. It isn't mine. Here's the synopsis; Bourne gets chased through buildings. C.I.A. tracks the chase. Bourne gets chased through crowded city streets. C.I.A. tracks the chase. Bourne chases hired assassin on scooter. C.I.A. tracks the chase. After scooter mishap, Bourne chases assassin on foot.

Hypertastic Delivery of Fast Paced Action,"The best Bourne in the series so far takes things back to action basics, and twist a slice of intelligent cat and mouse thriller into the cocktail. So far I've been reasonably entertained by Identity and Supremacy (the other two films in the series), with the first film being better than the second and honestly I wasn't expecting this one to reach the heights that it did. It is nice to be surprised by the effectiveness of a leading character, and Matt Damon slips into the action sequences very comfortably; my favourite parts come toward the end when the cat and mouse scenario begins and Bourne starts to give his old employers the run around. Its classic payback stuff and if I may say so very well scripted; at the end you leave the cinema feeling justice has been served and you've just watched a killer action flick.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Best Bourne Yet!,"This summer has had its fair share of hits and misses. Sequels have been mostly blah will originals have been great. With the summer ending The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the last movies of the summer. With two great predecessors how does the end of the trilogy do? Well it does AWESOME making it one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Once again Matt Damon plays a great Jason Bourne. he really understands the mood that Jason Bourne has been given. The action scenes are intense with everything from guns, punches, and makeshift weapons. The shaky cam might throw off some people but personally I didn't mind it. This is a must see and if you haven't seen the other two Bourne's yet go see them!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Heart-pounding action thriller,"Wow, I think this is quite possibly the best sequel this year to me.A action thriller in the true sense of the word, with a dangerous game of cat and mouse being played from beginning to end.

The shaky camera work may be annoying, but it does fit in with the film's general atmosphere.All in all, it was a great birthday present!",,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
What's all the fuss?,"I watched the Bourne Ultimatum. Actually, I was hoping for a bit of Daniel Brühl, and that's all I got. Why bother hiring a brilliant up-and-coming young actor like this and then not give him any screen time? The movie itself was okay--pretty standard spy vs. spy stuff. What bothered me was the camera work. Can't anybody in Hollywood hold a camera steady these days? The cuts were so quick, you couldn't really make out what you were watching half the time. I guess that's the point; the loss of detail covers a multitude of sins and is a special boon to the stunt-persons, who can step in and out of the action practically without being observed. Just turn the sound effects up and no one's the wiser. That being said, I did enjoy parts of the movie. Matt Damon is very effective when he doesn't have to act (think of his Thespian turn in last year's The Good Shepherd). Julia Stiles had the best moment in the film, when she finds a reason to smile. The villains were interesting, especially the hit men, all of whom, like Brühl, deserved more screen time. So, I liked the film; I just don't understand why critics think it's the second coming of the spy genre. Producers, please note: three Bournes were at least two too many. That well is now officially dry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"After the events of the Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne searches for the people who trained him into an assassin.","This has got to be the best action movie of 2007. The Bourne trilogy is by far the best series of spy movies in my opinion. The story goes really fast just the first two movies, but it's slow enough for people to understand its contents. What I love about Bourne Ultimatum is its aim to look realistic. There aren't flashy gadgets such as those in the 007 movies. The shaky camera technique was done wonderfully, even though many people have been complaining the camera was too unsteady. What I would recommend to people who get motion sickness from watching movies like this is try to watch it on a smaller screen rather in the theater. The story is still enjoyable on the the smallest screen. Anyways, the movie, just like the previous Bourne movies, has some of the most memorable foot and car chase scenes in movie history. The action is really well choreographed. They're really tense and the beautiful soundtrack composed by John Powell fits perfectly into the action. I got goosebumps from listening to the music. Overall, The Bourne Ultimatum is a great conclusion to the Bourne trilogy and I really appreciate it that the producers and the director, Paul Greengrass, didn't disappoint their audience as did the other noticeable trilogies like Austin Powers: Gold Member, where it has gotten lazy and has stupid, immature jokes, or like Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End, where it got too crazy and there's too much crap happening at the same time. So I would recommend that people watch this movie to get the sense of how an action movie should be like.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

"People, he's on the move or oh, my shaking hands","First things first: with The Bourne Supremacy and now Bourne Ultimatum, director Paul Greengrass has used up his hand-held camera privileges (hereafter referred to as ""fidgetcam"") for the next 10 years. The fidgetcam technique, when used for a realistic work, like Greengrass' own Bloody Sunday, is an effective one. When used in an action film filled with fight scenes and car chases, it makes what could be exciting just a continuously out of focus blur. And out of focus ain't what I paid $9.50 for, okay? Ultimatum is a remarkably silly film and I was giggling within the first five minutes, as I was whipped cinematically between oh, five or fifteen cities. But who got the chance to count with the fidgetcam running at full speed? Which is pretty much all Matt Damon's Jason Bourne does: walk purposefully down hallways and streets, through hotels, parking lots, malls and office buildings. Every so often he'll stop to pummel 3 or 4 people, point a gun or recite 2 lines of dialog before re-starting his endless, fidgety walking tour of the world. Not that the lines in the script are terribly interesting anyway, unless innumerable scenes of people snarling into cell phones, banging away at lap tops magically connected to every camera and phone in the world or David Strathairn and Joan Allen doing snippy, steely-eyed spy routines while shouting ""People"" or ""He's on the move"" push you to the edge of your seat.

"Sir, He drove off the roof","Greetings again from the darkness. This is absolutely one of the best and exciting action films ever. Nothing really new from the story side, but director Paul Greengrass (back at the helm after ""Bourne Supremacy"") is a master of chase scenes and tight space action. And as I have said before, Matt Damon is Jason Bourne ... it is that rare perfect blend of character and actor.New faces include some terrific acting from David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine and the always great Albert Finney. The regular ladies are back as Julia Stiles and Joan Allen remain the weak links in the series.What makes the Ludlum franchise so wonderful is that you can't always immediately tell the good guys from the bad guys. The perfect example is Jason Bourne. After the first two films, we know the guys has some darkness in his past, but we are pulling for him all the time. Should we be? This third installment provides some answers, but make no mistake, what sets this one apart is the action. Director and star are in prime form and it is quite a rush!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
More of the same makes this top notch fun!,"The last time we saw Jason Bourne, he was on a search to find the one's who killed his girlfriend, finding those responsible he dealt with them. Before that he was on a path to recovering his mind with questions flying everywhere. Fighting his way through two movies with a strong silent sadness, we all know what he's after. Answers. Where did he come from? How was he made? Is he just the product of a company running experiments on mind control, or is he something special? This is a man, who can't remember his past, or how he can kill the way he does. All he wants to do is rememberand he wants it very, very badly. If you've been living in a place that doesn't recognize some of the best spy-thrillers in recent years, The Bourne franchise is an espionage Hollywood actioner based on the books by Robert Ludlum, and helmed by director Doug (Swingers) Liman and since the second film, Brit maker Paul Greengrass. What makes these films affective is that it is blockbuster action, done by filmmakers who are very comfortable in the low budget independent world of film-making. Without the use of over the top special affects and unbelievable plot lines, we have a new franchise that is taking things back to basics, successfully drawing in the audience with its powerhouse rawness and suspense high enough that the skin around the tips of your fingers will surely bleed due to the absence of fingernails. So in the third and unlikely final installment of this now trilogy, how does director Paul Greengrass keep the hits coming? Merely days after The Bourne Supremacy, Bourne gets sucked into the killing of a British Journalist who was close to uncovering the truth behind the CIA's involvement within the Treadstone project. A new conspiracy emerges, people start chasing him again, and so Bourne follows his new leads with the help of some old friends. The story gives the audience answers, and since Greengrass has more than proved how capable he is at handling this material (""Supremacy"", ""United 93"" anyone?) he raises the bar with the action even higher. The film moves with a pace so fast you can get lost in where a cut is made in the editing, and where another begins. The shaky camera work (although hated by many) stems from an independent field of movie making which beautifully and sometimes disturbingly puts the audience right in the middle of Bourne's confrontations. This is more than ""edge of your seat action""; this is an adrenaline cocktail of stunning camera work, great choreography and state of the art stunt work. Its swallows other films of the genre with an expressionless modesty, with the director unwillingly proving to us something he already knew long before we did. Paul Greengrass has to be the most promising filmmaker of the genre today, and his time to shine is very much upon us. With a satisfying gulp of closure oozing down the throats of those going to see The Bourne Ultimatum, the long hard impatient time of waiting for the follow up will begin the moment the credits role. Or if we are lucky enough, our man from London may grab the reigns of another soon to be made project, which will undoubtedly hold infinite possibilities in the progression of indie film-making, and some solid action movies. This films holds a lot of what many of us have been waiting for, and feeds us more Bourne than many of us will know how to chew. An action trilogy is now complete, yet many of us will still shout out ""Bring on Bourne 4"", oh please do.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Operation Blackbriar,"This movie essentially begins where the previous film ""The Bourne Supremacy"" left off with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) leaving Moscow and traveling back to Europe having given a the Deputy Director of the C.I.A. named ""Pamela Landy"" (Joan Allen) a taped confession from another senior C.I.A. official of heading a secret-but highly illegal-operation code-named ""Treadstone"". Having provided Pamela with this information he also warns her to call off any further attempts on his life. What he doesn't realize is that ""Operation Treadstone"" has evolved into something much more sinister code-named ""Operation Blackbriar"" and that neither the Director of the C.I.A. ""Ezra Kramer"" (Scott Glenn) nor the official in charge of ""Operation Blackbriar"" named ""Noah Vosen"" (David Strathaim) have any intention of allowing him to live and possibly jeopardizing this deadly new program. So once again Jason Bourne has no choice but to carry the fight to those responsible. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had the same high-octane action as its predecessor but also seemed to flow more smoothly from one scene to another which made for a slightly better overall picture.

The perfect end to the series,"Right on par with the first two, making this series one of very few trilogies to keep a high level of quality through all three films. It's nearly impossible for me to pick a favourite, as all three are pretty similar and equally excellent, but this one certainly is an option. The action is even more intense and the story is a natural progression from Supremacy, but the film keeps the trademarks of the series and ties off a lot of the lingering plot points. While the trademarks are all there, I loved how the film updated and changed them to reflect the evolution of the character and the series. For me, the numerous references to minute plot details from the first two films made this series seem much more like a trilogy than most other film series. The acting was great, the story was gripping, the direction was superb, and the action was incredible. Pretty much a perfect summer blockbuster.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Good Action, The Best Bourne?","Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) dodges a ruthless CIA official (David Strathairn) and his agents from a new assassination program while searching for the origins of his life as a trained killer.There are some concerns about this film. First, the continuing use of Julia Stiles, who has proved herself to be a very average actress. Although she showed promise in the 1990s, it never seems to have panned out. But, at least, she is in relatively few scenes.Second, the use of the shaky camera. While this may be effective for chase scenes and to suggest fast-paced action, the film tends to use it in almost every scene. More often than not, it is not necessary and just gives the impression that the crew had attention deficit problems. (Director Paul Greengrass likes his shaky camera, but he also knows how to keep it under control for films like ""Captain Phillips"").As far as a straight action and spy thriller, this is excellent, and very entertaining. Exactly why it gets the critical praise it does is unclear; the Academy was right to nominate it only for technical aspects. But sometimes fun is all you need.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Matt Damon was born to play Jason Bourne!,"Matt Damon was born to play Jason Bourne! His is not a pretty boy mug but it's likable and interesting enough, intelligence, earnestness and determination is alive in his eyes, and he has a bod that seems developed by actual fights and not by some cushy gym, all of which comprise a winning combination that makes him believable as Hollywood's fave spy of the season.Julia Stiles reprises her role as CIA Nicky Parsons. She finally has a meatier role in this installment of the Bourne series, and she proves she is built of equally strong stuff, not necessarily physically, as she holds her own screen presence with Damon. The tension and mystery is sustained (are they ex-lovers? Siblings? Partners?) and her wordless expressions are just as raw and powerful as Damon's adrenaline-pumping fight scenes.Director Paul Greengrass (United 93, Bourne Supremacy) really made the most of the singular, tying-it-all-together plot, despite it having a not exactly neat ending. The supporting cast is just as solid: Albert Finney as the mysterious Dr. Albert Hirsch who recurs in Bourne's flashbacks, Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, the most powerful woman in the CIA who knows how Bourne operates best, and David Strathairn as CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen is so hateful you could imagine him to probably be the kid everyone picked on in school.The action sequences and the spartan storyline is refreshingly old school and you don't feel manipulated in a way that the effects are out to wow you. You just feel for Bourne as he tries to discover who he really is, even if it means ending everything he's known for the past three years that he's lost his identity.The series are just based on the Bourne books by Robert Ludlum, so don't bother comparing the two because they are not identical (i.e. Nicky is said to not be in any of the books); appreciate them separately.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
This (or any) summer's best action flick.,"Java Man Reviews "" The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007, PG-13). Directed by Paul Greengrass. Written by Tony Gilrooy, Scott Z. Burns & George Nolfi, based upon the Robert Ludlum novel. Starring Matt Damon, Julia Stiles, David Strathairn, Joan Allen, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine, Edgar Ramirez & Albert Finney. Running Time: 111 minutesOVERVIEW:Jason Bourne (Damon) is still on the run from the mysterious government agency that turned him into a black-ops killer and now wants to get rid of him. A London investigative reporter (Considine) unintentionally unmasks Bourne, and the two of them embark on the first of several intriguing and complicated chases. But as the CIA pursues Bourne it is really he who is doing the pursuing, trying to find those responsible for turning him into a killing machine. After London he heads for Madrid, Tangier, Paris, Moscow and, finally, to New York City.Heading up the quest to eliminate Bourne is Noah Vosen (Strathairn), the hiss-worthy G-Man in charge of the CIA's killer spooks. Reluctantly, he must recruit the assistance of Pamela Landy (Allen), an internal investigator who has also been chasing Bourne, but who has developed a professional respect for him and wants him alive. In Tangier, Bourne encounters field op Nicky Parsons (Stiles), who works for Vosen, but has become disillusioned with her boss's methods. She joins Bourne on the run as he continually beats the agency at its own game, outwitting its surveillance systems and besting its top killers.REVIEW: 3 1/2 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGSIt's a simple formula, but it works: Keep Jason Bourne in a state of perpetual motion. But even though the film is one continuous chase, it still manages to create memorable and believable characters. The credit for that must go to director Greengrass, a Brit whose work is a cut above the current crop of crash-it, blow-it-up action hacks. In addition to the Bourne franchise, he has also directed some of the best docudramas ever put on screen, namely Bloody Sunday (2002) about the troubles in Northern Ireland and United 93 (2006), about the passengers who thwarted terrorists from blowing up our nation's capitol. He keeps things moving fast and keeps us involved; we are in on it, as though joining Bourne on the run.Damon's performance is first-rate as usual, in what now has become his signature role. Pros Allen and Strathairn provide a revealing contrast between the two sides of the espionage coin (the dedicated pro and the sinister spook). Stiles sparkles as the quiet, smart G-woman who helps Bourne. Later in the film, Finney has a few crucial scenes to wrap up the series. Glen, as the Machiavellian mastermind who heads the CIA, will likely play a major role if a fourth Bourne is mounted.As for the story, there is no real need for a complicated plot, just a reason for Bourne to be in a given city when Greengrass is ready to stage the next set-up. Spectacular cinematography and involving editing, combined with challenging location work, make this by far the summer's best action flick.Will there be a fourth Bourne? Though Ludlum has passed on, Ian Fleming's death did not stop James Bond from saving the world for nearly half a century now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Best govt. Agent movie in years!,"I saw it at opening at midnight. Then I went back. I loved the first two movies of the Bourne trilogy, but Ultimatum is by far the best.The agent v. agent fight scene (Tangiers?) is one of the best fight scenes ever put on film. I was wound up so tightly watching this fight sequence I couldn't breathe until the end.Not just quick and tight, but sooo SMART.I want to go back and count, but I only remember Jason shooting a gun ONE TIME in the movie--and NOT at another character. I consider this a strong tribute to Greengrass's directing: always making the smart action choice, not the loud one.The pace was GREAT, and the lag between masterful action/suspense scenes was minimal.Get over the shaky camera, people! Ultimatum is the best you will see for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The 3rd film in a good series,"This outing is pretty good, though there's trouble, as in the second film, with casting. For whatever reason, Joan Allen is till in the cast and the addition of Albert Finney is another casting mistake. Finney is a fine actor, but he's simply wrong for the character of Dr. Hirsch. Another mistake is in the writing: the repetitive flashbacks from the second film is continued and expanded and proves to be an annoyance and a distraction from the story. While this 3rd film is still enjoyable, it is simply OK instead of being great or even very good. Subsequent installments will need a near total elimination of the flashback method of storytelling to avoid the feeling of having the story dumbed down for viewers who haven't seen any of the earlier films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Anyone but Greengrass,"The Bourne Ultimatum has an excellent story, excellent actors, music and nearly everything except Director. There is no doubt that Bourne is a major opportunity for everyone involved and in particular the right choice of director could have set Bourne up as a major action series that would rival other major movie series. The books were great and the movies should have been winners. The first film was a major success and set the stage for the series. Then what happened? Some goose went and put Greengrass in charge of the next two films. What we got was fast editing and someone shaking a camera (I was told by a friend that the camera was in a blender). I found during the film that I was expending so much effort trying to adjust to the shaking camera and fast editing and was not able to enjoy some of the action scenes. If you have seen The Bill on TV then you will be aware that a hand-held camera can be used if it is done well. But Greengrass seems determined to be remembered as the person who shook the hand-held camera more than anyone else. What can I say, anyone but Greengrass. He has destroyed what would have been a great series that could have been watched again and again over the years. Greengrass please go away.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

*Insert your favorite play on the word 'Born' here*,"Extremely entertaining! It was my least favorite of the three, but still better than most other movies out there. The steadi-cam horse has pretty much been beat to death, so I'll leave it alone and move on.In the first movie, treadstone was portrayed as a niche of bad guys in an otherwise decent government machine. Somehow, we've shifted to the idea that pretty much everyone except the two attractive female costars is either spineless or evil. And while we're on the subject of the Bourne-girls, I have to wonder why they even invited Julia Styles to show up. Admittedly, I haven't read the books, so I don't know how much (or how little) a part her character played. She's an amazing actress, tho, and could really have kicked this movie to a higher level if they had just given her something to do. Maybe that's in the works for Bournes 4-6, I don't know.All said and done, tho, this series is about kicking a$$, taking names, and finding new and creative ways to use books, towels, magazines, and oscillating fans to survive against the odds. In that arena, no other movie in recent history (since the last one, in fact) comes close.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
Continues in the grand tradition of the series.,"Continues with the tradition of the series so far. Once again, the series excels at being an intellectual, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat thriller that starts with a bang and never lets up. It's a gritty, stylized espionage thriller that is certainly one of the most exhilarating and visceral experiences I've had in recent memory. Greengrass implies the ""in your face"" techniques that he used in Supremacy which makes the action seem authentic and really puts you into the point of view of Bourne, getting your pulse racing and your eyes completely attached to the screen.The cast is all great, as usual. Damon and Allen add the intellect and commanding power to the film. It was great to see Julia Stiles getting a more pivotal role, since I felt she was pretty underused in the previous installments. The addition of David Straithairn and, more importantly, Albert Finney was absolutely brilliant. They just continued the tradition of brilliant, insanely commanding actors playing the generic ""hunt him down"" role. They certainly added a lot to what could have been very flat characters. The style used is gritty, suave and very authentic.However, it can become a bit too stylized at times. It can cut too quickly and zoom in and out and tilt all over the place, and the editing could be pretty sloppy from time to time. Other than that though, I don't really have much to complain about. If you liked the first two installments, you'll surely be pleased by this one. If you didn't, then this obviously isn't for you. I was a big fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

Great ! -- but shaking camera overused.,"Great movie, very entertaining and great ending....but geeezz...I had a headache 5 minutes into the film! Every scene- regardless of mood - was shot with an excessive amount of ""shake, vibrate, move, quick-pan, zoom-in, zoom-out, etc"" technique. :( good grief!The following is very ""opinionated"" and subjective I suppose...I like the use of these techniques(shaking/zooming/partially obscuring subjects with foreground objects or people) in films like Babel or Saving Private Ryan, but this one went way way overboard with it and hence the effectiveness (of the camera) is quickly destroyed, because there's no visual dynamic to contrast dramatic to subdued scenes.Its great stuff at times, but I shouldn't have to guess at what MIGHT be happening in the fight scenes, and sort of make up my own version as it plays out in front of me... ""ok, I guess there he twisted his arm and, wow! that must have been a kick or something...and oh dude! what happened then? I guess maybe he stabbed him or something"". And I shouldn't have to wonder ""why is the camera shaking, jerking, zooming, panning left/right during this subdued scene with regular conversation between 2 people??""Music varies with scenes to convey the intended mood, right?... Well, if there's no effort to vary the cinematography techniques to convey the mood of individual scenes, isn't that like painting a picture of a grassy field against a sunset and using red for the grass and red for the sun and red for the sky? ...imho.I don't know - some people might like it constantly shaking with no attention to ""composition"" (in its classic sense) and no slow steady dramatic pans- but I need a little break from the jerky movement occasionally.Great film otherwise... great ending too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
A daily comment from Midget Emma: The Bourne Ultimatum (2007),"Couldn't have asked for a better ending to the trilogy.This was one of the best movies of 2007.Non-stop action from start to finish.This movie had me on the edge of my seat literally.Matt Damon was excellent as Jason Bourne.He is the new James Bond. Bourne identity and Bourne supremacy must be watched first to understand the plot and what is going on. This shaky camera that i have seen some people saying bad things about was great in the film it made you feel like u were with Bourne and in the scene with him. The writing in this movie was smart and there was no point in the movie where no twists and turns were not being dished out. If you are a Bourne fan or just like a great action movie you must see it.

the best out of all three Bourne movies that still leaves plenty of room open for another installment,"Both ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" were and still are, some of the best of the modern action movies. They were intelligent, clever, powerful in action, utilized the important aspects necessary and limited the aspects that weren't'as vital to the storyline, and were overall, great rides for the audience. And ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" does that same thing again, only this time, it's far more powerful.""Ultimatum"" has a more complex storyline, because it is a more complex film. Sometimes it might get confusing, but that's kind of the whole idea, for what confused you might have confused the characters, who have to figure it out as you are as well. Here, Bourne is not just entirely being hunted. He now has allies who will side with him and still maintain a high position of authority. Still, that doesn't present any obstacles for the people who have been trying to kill him, and the methods they are taking against him are better and more destructive than ever.Character development in the film is the best it's been in all parts of the trilogy. Bourne is now the ultimate action figure for everybody and he is a little bit merciless now in his tactics in defending himself and those he feels he should defend to find his answers. Bourne has lost some of his generosity and when he's trying to find an answer, it doesn't mean as much to him if somebody gets hurt in the process. But yet, he hasn't lost it all, which makes him a more likable character. And he's still a clever fighter who uses whatever he can to his advantage. He can use even an object as common as a bathroom towel to help him fight somebody off, in ways you would not expect. He can tell instantly now whether an approaching person is friendly or unfriendly, he knows when he's being spied on, where his enemies are even if he can't see them, and many other ways that almost seem inhuman.The assassins Bourne must battle with are the best he's ever gone up against. The character of Desh, who appropriately has no dialogue, is presented as being like a killing machine. He doesn't speak, he doesn't look anybody in the eye, he looks suspicious, he's intelligent, and above all, a powerful fighter and a deadly shot with a gun. He's called ""the asset"", and he is to the people he works for. Desh is a presumable representation of what Bourne was like before his landmark incident in the first film that ultimately changed his life and the lives of many other people at the same time.In ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" it seems as if most of the questions are now being answered for both Bourne and the audience and it leaves us with one open question until the ending: is Bourne going to survive the events of this film? What is his fate going to be now? But like the first two films, it will continue to leave open spaces that make us wonder what exactly is going to happen and whether or now the filmmakers are going to make plans for yet another sequel. Whatever the case, I say that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is the best out of the entire trilogy. It did become a little bit slow toward the end, but I thought it was an amazing action movie.

"BYE BYE Mr. Bond, Mr. Bourne is here!!","Well, I haven't watched the earlier parts of this extraordinarily riveting trilogy and watched first The Bourne Ultimatum at a friend's house and guess what, it compelled me to watch the previous movies instantly. After watching all the movies of Bourne series I read the novels by Robert Ludlum and came to the conclusion that the movies indeed preserved the legacy that Ludlum created already. Though maximum part of the story was clear to me still a little remained fuzzy, that was cleared after I saw the previous movies. However, The Bourne Ultimatum is the best in my opinion among the three. Fantastic as it is with Matt Damon giving perhaps the best, the movie is thrilling, so much realistic and engrossing. Stunts and action scenes were executed almost perfectly with awe inspiring sound effects and sound editing which brought Bourne Ultimatum 3 well deserved Oscars. I would keep this to the very top of my action thriller list and yes one more thing, this is way better than 007 movies. There is no doubt that this was one of the best movies of 2007 and I am confident that even after years the Bourne legacy will prevail its supremacy quite convincingly. 10/10 from my side, great adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Cool, fine, whatever","I'm not a fan of the Bourne films. I don't hate them but I was never hugely invested in Jason Bourne's quest to uncover his past. Identity was boring and aside from a gritty tone didn't bring anything new to the table although to be fair to it, it has its moments and we needed it after James Bond surfed a poorly rendered tsunami, drove an invisible car and descended into self parody with Die Another Day. Supremacy has a few problems but benefited from Paul Greengrass' shaky camera-work. This is probably the best of the trilogy. Jason Bourne finds out the truth at last. It's highly regarded, but it's certainly not a great film or deserving of a place on IMDb top 250. It has the dullest action hero of all time with Matt Damon, who is no more than a zombie with muscles and although the seriousness partially works, the film often seems to suffocate itself in its own grit and at times gets rather dry.There are some good bits, notably the final chase and an interesting set piece at Waterloo Station. The building jumping sequence was over-hyped as you can't really tell what is going on, but you have to admire Paul Greengrass as a filmmaker. The script is average, although there is a human side to it. This is a decent film with plenty of good moments but after a while the grittiness and constant downbeat conversations and conspiracy become boring and the trilogy ends on a somewhat abrupt note. Unfortunately, James Bond the year after this was released was almost impossible to tell apart from Jason Bourne. Despite its overload of grit, it is diverse with several different locations and types of scene covered and it is interesting to finally find out who Jason is. A satisfying conclusion overall and a watchable well made action thriller. A little actual sunshine wouldn't have hurt.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"

"A few cracks, but overall solid","The final piece in the original Bourne trilogy and the culmination of a story. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues to unravel the mysteries of his past, digging deeper into Operation Treadstone, the program that created him. Unfortunately the program doesn't seem to be as dead as he has been led to believe.The Bourne Ultimatum is a solid crime action thriller. The character of Jason Bourne is once again beautifully realized by Matt Damon. I really like the way he can pull off these amazing action pieces and fight scenes, while still retaining that close to earth everyday guy vibe. It almost makes it seem like I could pull off these things, whereas someone like James Bond has always been much more a pleasant fantasy.Pamela ""Pam"" Landy (Joan Allen) is also a welcome return, and she works as a great bridge between the movies, alongside Bourne himself. The film overall works the semi-ending of the second film beautifully into the narrative.Unfortunately that cannot be about the plot in general. The first two films had room to build the mythos, to leave things unresolved, to make allowances for mystery. Whereas this film tries to answer all the questions. And it feels forced. There are certain scenes, certain conversations between characters, that are purely there to nail down all the loose strings, even those that could have been allowed to leave hanging. The curtain is pulled back all the way and unfortunately the reality does not match our imagination.There's also way too much shaky-cam, which ruins the action scenes.Still, if you've liked the previous two, this is by no means a bad film. The characters are enjoyable, the initial plot is interesting - even if the execution could have been better - and it's a very professionally made piece of espionage entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
"Good, but the pace slowed","Jason Bourne (Damon) is still trying to discover who he really is and the CIA still believes Bourne is a threat to them and they keep trying to kill him. Oh, oh.The editing on this movie is fantastic and reminded me of the editing job on Enemy of the State with Will Smith. Very good. The acting all around is Oscar worthy (What? Does it always have to be an English Classic?) The cinematography, dialogue and stunts were all terrific. Music could have made more of an impact, but it didn't.Yes, a very good thriller again, but the pace has slowed somewhat when compared to the previous two Jason Bourne movies. Maybe the story dictated this. They tried to pick the pace up again when Bourne is running across rooftops and thru people's apartments as he tries to intercept the hit-man going for Nicky (Stiles). However, that chase went on for too long a time. (Hey, I don't have all day. Have to watch Judge Judy, you know.) And, when Bourne does catch up with the hit-man (Yeah, what am I giving away? Like you didn't know he would catch him?) it takes Bourne about 10-mintes to put him away in a very good fight where I had to duck a couple times. But previously, Bourne put the bad guys away with some fantastic moves in a matter of seconds. Here, it took a long time (Remember, I have get back to Judge Judy).Julia Stiles is simply beautiful and has that Priscella Presley pouting look. Very sexy. I am in love again. You will hate David Strathairn in this movie and love him in We Are Marshall. Go figure. Guess that is the mark of a terrific actor and he is that.And, it cannot be said enough that Matt Damon is a quality actor and why isn't he nominated for something in these Bourne movies?

I loved this movie,"To tell the truth, I wasn't even that big of a fan of the Jason Bourne movies until I saw this film. ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" provides the perfect conclusion to what I now realize is a great series. This sequel takes place in both Russia and in America, and once again Bourne (Matt Damon) must find out who he really is while evading those chasing after him. The film is highly suspenseful and action-packed, and it provides more entertainment than your average action movie. Watching Bourne's clever ingenuity and ability to escape his enemies in the most impressive ways is what really makes this film so fun to watch. Joan Allen and Julia Stiles are great co-stars once again, as is David Strathairn (lesser known but brilliant actor from films like ""Sneakers"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck""). After seeing this, I had to go back and watch the first two again, and I enjoyed them even more than before. This film, however, is easily the best of the three.

I'm sometimes unsure of where I should be looking in a scene. I feel dizzy. I'll keep watching you, but after you I think it's best that we only be friends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
it's in MY top 10,"There is only one word that can capture this movie's essence: amazing. I am almost at a loss for words in attempting to describe the genius of this film. Greengrass has attained a new level in direction; the shaky footage made the film more real, as though it were unplanned, that everything was happening right then, right there. He seemed to take a spy's approach - coming into shots at different angels and making quick cuts as Bourne surveyed his surroundings. As it ended, I let my chin dust the floor, overcome by a sense of awe. What great minds must have imagined such a story and how they did it.. is so unfathomable to me. Wow. I will never forget this film, nor its predecessors. While one may it describe Ultimatum as having nonstop action, that does not imply that it lacks in plot or genius. It is the epitome of a complete package. It does not insult the viewer's intelligence; not everything is spelled out for you and that is exactly what makes it so incredible. If anyone were to ask, I would not hesitate in advising and encouraging them to watch this movie, unless, of course, they are very squeamish, because there are some intense fight scenes. Alright, my tangent is done, but for four words: GO SEE 'THE ULTIMATUM'!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
The Adventures of Government Agencies That Go Unchecked,"In 2007, one expects nearly every big-budget American film to be less than impressive. I saw The Bourne Ultimatum and was thrilled the way action movies don't always thrill anymore. It thrilled me because there is definite mind paid to the film-making and screen writing. The action sequences are not a commotion of loudness, fast cutting, and violent movement. They are masterpieces of that good old friend suspense and inimitable tension. Take the sequence at Waterloo Station for instance. In a crowded place, there is Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon with a riveting assertion of each of the major elements of his character from his lack of memory mixing with vengeful aggression towards those responsible to the rigid and infinite training he must've completed in order to be realistically near superhuman. In this place compressed with endless streams of people, he must perfectly guide a person by phone so as to evade top-notch surveillance by the CIA's leading forces while beating up or killing guys following that person, all without drawing the attention of the overwhelming crowd in the terminal. That's a suspense sequence. Sir Alfred Hitchcock is turning to his side and fluffing his pillow in mid-dream in his grave.There is a fight scene in this film between Bourne and a rotten-to-the-core assassin in a crumbly apartment that is so intense that one feels as if they are involved in the fight first hand. That is what the ideal fight sequence is supposed to do. You are supposed to love the good guy, boiling with anger at each hit he suffers, and absolutely relish every hit suffered by the bad guy. Shot in such a way that sustains a rhythm of speedboat rate, and also one of those rare action sequences where dramatic acting comes into play even amidst the ultrajittery camera-work and editing, create this beautiful effect that other action films, especially the shallow ones that only serve as cash registers, wish they had.A peeve of mine, while we're on the subject of flimsy Hollywood blow-em-ups that serve as one of the many reasons why the rest of the world laughs at us, is the constant use in many of those films of musical score that is orchestral yet lathered in techno beats and sounds. I really cannot stand that kind of score. The Bourne Ultimatum is one Hollywood action film that does what I never thought one would do again, which is underscore with great orchestral music. Making film score fast and suspenseful can be done with an orchestra, you know. In fact, I don't think technologically synthesized music is very engaging at all. The Bourne Ultimatum knows this. Just thought I'd add that.Director Paul Greengrass uses cinematography throughout the film that, though it is glaringly dizzying still has a subliminal effect on the audience, leaking a paranoid, nervous feeling into each scene, and we thus know, by the excessive conspicuousness of it, that we are being manipulated, putting us in Bourne's position, fueling us with a riveted clenching of our hands to the arms of our seats, bruising the forearms of our dates and mothers. Not to mention that the scenes in New York City are some of the very very best I've seen in any recent film. Winter in New York, giving the climax of the film such unexpectedly affecting urban twilight atmosphere.The tight, very professionally structured script is engaging in its use of the mysterious operation Black Briar, a truly effective title for a truly evil-sounding operation, the contents of which I cannot disclose without spoiling anything, contents that are pretty topical around the edges right now for America. Let's keep making movies like this with indirect affronts to unconstitutional goings-on, giving the characters involved the same wryly indiscriminate portrayal as David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, and Albert Finney do here.This was a pleasant surprise. Save for the silly, very needless and obvious final shot, this is a genuine showcase of the stuff real action adventure thrillers are made of.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Mystery"
