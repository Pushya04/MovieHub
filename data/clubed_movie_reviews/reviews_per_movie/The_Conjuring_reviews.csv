A modern classic.,"It's several years since this film was released, and I have to say that none of the shine has come off it, the quality is still very much there, the film is a classic. As a horror it packs in some real scares, but there is so much more to it, it has tension, a story, and some real intrigue, possibly because of the fact that it was inspired by real life events.Several films have followed, sequels and spin offs, but none of them come close to this, the only Horror film for many years to actually give me a few scares.Many of the scares are so memorable, because they are so well executed, they got the balance just right.Incredibly well acted, the performances are one of the film's best assets, but there are many besides.I'd have moved! It's a classic, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"It's November 1st, 1971, I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.","The key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about ""nothing new on the table"" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.There's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that ""haunt"" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.Forget the ""based on a true story"" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means ""this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit"". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.Story essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.There is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.The script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.Met with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
New life breathed into a classic sub-genre,"""Don't summon the devil, don't call the priest ...""I was one of a lucky few to have seen The Conjuring at a preview screening for FrightFest 2013.I went in totally cold, not having seen a trailer, nor knowing anything about the story or plot and it turned out to be one of the best scary horror movies I have ever seen.The Conjuring is a nail-biting, hiding-behind-hands movie. If you've been disappointed with the likes of Paranormal Acivity and Insidious, this one is likely to deliver in areas where they failed.It tells the supposedly true story of two paranormal investigators, who aim to rid families and properties of their suspected supernatural visitations, either by disproving them (if they turn out to be just creaky floorboards or slamming doors) or tackling them head-on if not. A leap of faith is required to buy into this theme but if you're okay with it, then the movies plays out pretty well within its genre confines.The particular incident they are brought in to deal with is described as surrounding a spirit 'so malevolent' it was hidden from the public until only now. In fairly Amityville-like circumstances, a family move into a new house and discover the basement is sealed; boarded-up behind a doorway.It's not at all surprising what follows, once they decide to take a look in the basement but it is surprising how James Wan has managed to take such a tired theme of haunting and possession and revive it so convincingly.I am no stranger to these kind of movies but this one truly tops them all for tension and terror. I really enjoyed Sinister recently, which I found to be equally as scary but it lost its way a bit towards the end, whereas The Conjuring keeps tempo and has a fairly satisfying conclusion.I particularly liked the way the film took a turn for the comical somewhere in the middle, only for perhaps five minutes, then came back firing on all cylinders as it headed to the finale. If this was intentional, to lure us into a false sense of security, it worked beautifully.If you're the type to poo-poo this genre in general, I can't see you suddenly being converted to a believer but, if you enjoy classic horror like The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror and Poltergeist, I can almost guarantee The Conjuring won't disappoint.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
By far one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while.,"I'm an avid horror fan. Lately I've been thinking there isn't much that can scare me (though Sinister got under my skin). I appreciate James Wan's films, I love the first Saw, Insidious was a damn good modern ghost story, but like all reviews have stated for it, the movie kinda loses it's momentum in the final act.The Conjuring is better, scarier, and more tense than Insidious. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's one of the best horror movies of the last 5 or 10 years. It goes back to the classic rule of horror film making, never show the bad guy fully to your audience. Plus this movie knows suspense, I tell you, I almost threw a water bottle at the screen from sheer terror once the scare finally happened. There are no fake jump scares, the movie earned an R rating without any blood, sex, or profanity, it's all from the terror that this movie builds upon.Not only is the movie scary, but as a film itself, it's almost a masterpiece. The script, acting, direction, style, tone, etc were all simply top notch. Wan's camera-work here is by far his best out of any of his movies. The choice to set the movie in the 70s was a stroke of genius as it feels so authentic and all the more real. If this story were set in the present, it simply wouldn't be as a effective or scary. The 70s style film making, costuming, and hair styling are a great throwback to likes of The Exorcist & The Amityville Horror.Though there are a few (extremely minor) flaws, such are length, repetitiveness, and a resolution that happens way too fast. I don't care, every horror movie (or movie in general) has it's flaws. There will never be a perfect horror movie, if there is one, I haven't seen it yet. But all I know is James Wan's The Conjuring is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time, and it's been a really long time that a movie has scared me this badly.10/10 Don't miss this one, it's an amazing theater viewing experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Conjuring,"""The Conjuring"" is one of the most thrilling horror film to have come out in recent times. It is up there with ""Sinister"" as one of the scariest films I have watched. Since it's based off of ""true events"", it makes it even more interesting. I can't quite give it a full 10 star rating because it does have quite a few jump scares, but at least a good portion of those jump scares add to the atmosphere of this movie. If you are a first time watcher of this movie, it will certainly disturb you for a while. It doesn't stick with me like ""Sinister"" does long after, but The Conjuring is a fun watch and I always love coming back for a rewatch every now and then.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
James Wan at his best,"""The Conjuring"" is a high class horror film, its hard not to be scared by it, we care for the characters and the story is compelling enough to make you feel interested the whole time.Based on true life events, Ed and Lorraine Warren are paranormal investigators set to help a family terrorized by a demon, said to be one of the most terrifying cases of their lives which they hadn't shared with anyone...until now.First of all, I loved that it takes place in the 70's, I agree completely with director James Wan's point of view that it is almost impossible to make a horror film set in the present. For example, the teenage daughters of the haunted family would be taking pictures of the demons with their iphones and would be posting them on posting them on instagram, basically the demons would turn into the victims and the humans would be the bad guys.The movie isn't perfect though, there are a few plot holes in it, but still it does have some great scares in it that had me jumping out my seat and I liked the way it builds up tension and lets us know the characters before it starts with all the craziness. Not only is the movie set in the 70's, but it also has the feel of a 70's horror film, with slow zooms and filming styles you wouldn't expect from a modern movie. I really believe James Wan has outdone himself with this movie, I'll even go so far to calling it the scariest movie I've seen in my life. Thank you James Wan for this great movie and good luck with Fast & Furious 7.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great horror film, I guess it gives the feeling audiences must have felt when watching ""The Exorcist"", ""Don't Look Now"", or Poltergeist"" for the first time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An instant gem among the classic horror titles.,"I got a chance to see this movie at the film festival, and boy was I TERRifically surprised! James Wan's 'The Conjuring' is one of those rare gems in the horror industry that finds a spot beside the classic titles of horror, 'The Shining', 'Poltergeist', and 'The Exorcist' due to James Wan's ability to balance an atmospheric dreadful tale involving wonderfully crafted characters with a haunted house that had my palms sweating and my heart pounding during some of the most horrifying moments (There are a few of those; make sure you empty your bladder BEFORE entering the theater).The things that make 'The Shining', 'Poltergeist', and 'The Exorcist' good is that if the editor were to chop out all the jump-scares and those sequences that fry an image into your brain, you would still have a moody, edgy story that makes you sympathies for the characters and their struggle. This is what Wan does right in this film, and it's then that you realize horror is more than what pops out at you, or what makes you scream. Rather, it's that feeling of dread you get that escalates into sheer terror and suspense, aided by shocking scares.BUT WAIT! All this not to say 'The Conjuring' doesn't have its share of frightening visuals and pee-your-pants moments; believe me when I say I also rank this as one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Yet, Wan realizes here that jump scares aren't what moves a story along, but what defines that classic image everyone gets in their head when someone talks about a certain horror movie that frightened them the most, kind of like a celebrity's autograph in the corner of a huge poster of their face.All of this hence to say, ""The Conjuring"" is an exceptional piece of film that pulls all the right stops to frighten the audience, leaving a lasting impression on your mind as well the recently tired genre of horror.Movie Score: 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Bringing Back The Terror,"The Conjuring claims to be based on a true story about one of the Warrens' paranormal investigations. At this point, that fact doesn't quite matter, especially when this is mostly designed as a horror movie. And as a horror movie, its job is to offer real terror and take any ghostly elements seriously. The film isn't actually trying to give newer scares. This is old school stuff, but good old school horror movie stuff. This is the kind that gets to do more than pull off another jump scare trick. Another benefit the movie got is its director, James Wan, who delivers a crafty storytelling. The Conjuring is not terribly innovative, but I don't think it needed to. It's the execution that keeps everything so gripping, and I think we needed that in this suffering era of the genre.The story is actually more than the haunting of the Perrons. The first act juxtaposed between their situation and the life of the Warrens. The Warrens side is a fascinating little exposition of their daily life and job, while the Perrons are introduced like any typical horror film that has a haunted house and family in it, the danger is slow burn until they get to realize they needed help. What makes this somewhat different from those clichés is we are also supposed to root and care for the investigators, like we do not want them to be harm by the spirits as well. For that, the tension becomes much effective.Even at the less scary scenes, the film is also interesting. And yes, all the characters are worth rooting for. The major ones get their own stories told at the beginning and some flashbacks in the middle of the mystery. The performances are pretty enjoyable as they take the viewers into the characters' mind. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent at exploring their roles and whatever they do are totally intriguing. Lili Taylor is engaging enough for shifting her character's innocence to something terrifying.Most of the credit goes to director James Wan who makes it all compelling. We already accepted that jump scares are inevitable to our modern horror movies, but the better scares go when it shows its campiness, like the creepy update of the Annabelle doll, and some demonic masks and makeup. They are unlike to today's tricks that depend on gore and repetitive noise. There is also genuine terror can be felt in the quiet scenes. The finale is kind of ridiculous, but it's filled with energetic action which makes the ride even much fun. Apart from the scary stuff, the film continues to employ its style that serves a lot of magnificent shots. This could be one of the best looking movies I've seen this year. The music score brings sorts of good chills.The Conjuring is no groundbreaker, but the film is best at recapturing the classic horror. Extra merit is fleshing out and adding depth to the story which made the ghost hunting investigation more thrilling. The craft is amazing and the performances are terrific. I think it has most of the things that lack in our horror films today; curiously setting the pieces together, relateable characters, good creeps, and full insanity. The Conjuring isn't meant to change the game, but because of the filmmakers' ambition and love for the genre, it is a marvelous experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fairly good classical exorcism type horror movie,"The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror/haunted house/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting? This is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.One thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970′s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this ""ghosthunter"" make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.The we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but Christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.Anyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Holy F*** is all people with me said while watching it throughout.,"This film was easily one of the scariest films of the decade, complete with a horror package that will make even those new to horror love it, if they are a fan of fear that is. This movie had every guy in the group at the edge of their seats with their girlfriends....it was an intense experience that cannot be missed in theatres. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmega hold their own as the Perron's and EVERY SINGLE child actor owned the screen. All acting was top notch and gave the viewer a throwback to original days of good horror, not the stuff we've seen nowadays. Time can only tell when a movie like this will come out again but we know now that James Wan is one of the best horror directors of our time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Successful and effective chiller  movie loaded with devilish horror , thrills and  nightmares","Adequate and decent horror picture in which a family falls into supernatural terror filled with scary events , chills and lots of scares . Another creepy film in which keeps horror with yet another haunted house that causes creepy goings-on in a family such as the followings classic pictures : the original ¨Exorcist¨ film (by Friedkin) that spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as ¨Changeling¨ (by Peter Medak), ¨Amytiville ¨(by Stuart Rosemberg) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Supernatural terror plenty of weird phenomenon , frights , scary beings , shocks , and eerie happenings . It deals with the Perron family formed by father (Ron Livingston) , mother (Lili Taylor , she researched The exorcist (1973) to prepare for her role) and five children move into an old house . Eight generations of families lived and died in the house before the Perrons moved in , but little do they know that the house is haunted . And some of the spirits from the families never left , deaths include two documented suicides, a poisoning death, the rape and murder of an 11-year old girl, two drownings, and the passing of four men who froze to death . Most deaths occurred within the Arnold family from which the nasty ghoul Bathsheba Sherman was descended . Paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson , this movie marks the third collaboration between James Wan and Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) work to help the family terrorized by a dark presence and ghastly mysteries in their farmhouse . There are three phases in this strange process : 1 : infestation , 2 : oppression and 3 : possession . They are attempting to find out the bottom of rare deeds by ways of the cellar and soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks . The mediums seek to uncover the fantastic secrets that has left a witch dangerously connected to the real world .This is a haunted house movie that contains restless horror as when the invisible and threatening beings attack .

Based on real events , in fact Lorraine Warren and Andrea Perron served as consultants to director James Wan and the screenwriters , they both claim the movie is accurate to the real story of what happened to the Perrons during the 10 years they lived in the farm house ; as they investigated the Perrons' Rhode Island farmhouse in 1973 and 1974 . The film was given an R rating by the MPAA . The MPAA said simply that the film was so scary that there were no cuts or edits possible that would make it a viable PG-13 film ; the filmmakers did not want to alter the film's tone and accepted the R-rating without any appeals . The movie broke box office records after bringing in a total of $41 million at the box office during its opening weekend . It stands as the third highest grossing opening weekend for an R-rated horror film behind Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) and Hannibal (2001). The Conjuring made a total of $137 million at the box office.Eerie musical score by Joseph Bishara creating a spooky atmosphere ; not only marks the second film composer Joseph Bishara has scored a James Wan film, but it is the second time he has played a demon figure for Wan , as he portrays the demon embodiment of Bathsheba Sherman and previously played a lipstick-faced demon in Insidious (2010). Dark as well atmospheric cinematography by John R. Leonetti who modeled the film's cinematography and atmosphere after vintage 1970s horror films. The film was well directed by James Wan and it was shot in just a few weeks . Wan is an expert writer and filmmaker on terror genre as he has demonstrated in ¨Saw¨ saga , ¨Dead silence¨, among others . James Wan also directed his biggest success ¨Insidious¨ equally starred by Patrick Wilson and similar technician team , cameraman : John Leonetti and musician : Joseph Bishara .

This movie is amazing,"Just saw it yesterday in Nocturna Fim Festival. It was an outstanding film. So well done, scripted and acted. The movie doesn't have any mercy on the audience and it's so disturbing you won't believe until you see.I'm not gonna enter in details or spoilers, just gonna let you now it a movie that gonna stay for you for a while after you see it. It also opens a door for becoming quite a paranormal investigator myself, looking up for all the details mentioned in the movie, and getting amazed by it' accuracy.This film it's made to become a new classic in the horror genre, not only because it's quality, but because it's fright factor.The first half of the movie it's paced down, let you know and love the characters. but the second half! oh boy! it's so damn chilling it will keep you gasping and crawling your hands.Very well done",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A Gripping, Tense and Overall Masterful Genre Revival","Like comedy, the horror genre can be a very subjective beast, finding or missing its mark as much do to its craft and execution as it does the particular individual who plops themselves into a theater seat. If something isn't scary to someone – someone who earnestly believes that of course – then a fright flick has failed at its core intent. Then we have something like James Wan's The Conjuring, an artful, confident throwback that succeeds in maintaining a high tensile level of pressure on our senses, crafting vital jump scares, a potent human element and all encompassing technical prowess. This is the type of brave, but stripped down horror filmmaking that forces you to analyze other elements besides just the full effectiveness of its frightening intent. Plus it's scary as hell.The Conjuring completes a modern supernatural horror film trifecta started with Wan's own Insidious in 2010 and bridged by last year's unsettling Sinister. With these films the genre has proved that this is far from a dead, now inherently clichéd area of cinema and this effort is perhaps the best of all three. After breaking onto the scene in a big way with the trend setting Saw, the director took a bit of creative detour in the eyes of most with revenge thriller Death Sentence and supernatural doll flick Dead Silence (which is vastly underrated by the way) before rebounding with the aforementioned Insidious. For The Conjuring it seems Wan has taken everything he's learned – congealing everything he's found to be effective – and assembled them exquisitely and with ample new flare to boot.The Conjuring pulls its inspiration from a case file of famed demonologists and paranormal investigators the Warrens, the husband and wife team who's other journeys inspired films such as The Amityville Horror. Here they are played respectively by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga who are now both genre regulars with roles in Insidious and the upcoming Chapter 2 due this year for the gentleman and Orphan and television's Psycho prequel Bates Motel for Farmiga. We've all seen the painful trope of priests, exorcists, psychics and every nut-job in between showing up at the eleventh hour to save a haunted family but the way they're approached in The Conjuring stands as one of the film's greatest strengths.Though it's something that should be completely obvious out of the gate (but still something those inspired by the Warren's stories forget) this is just as much their story as those experiencing the phenomena. In giving nearly as much screen time to this duo as it does the Perron's (a seven family troop lead by actors Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor and their five daughters) we grow and involve with these nine individuals so when things get terrifying we not only feel just as much for everyone on screen but everyone gets a satisfying arc. It's something so rare in most horror films. Though this dynamic is certainly not presented through these two separate camps – the fearful and the experts – but the men bond over their love of cars and their wives and the women over the unfathomable: harm befalling their children. It's a satisfying an utterly untapped approach for the genre.But ""wait, wait"" you proclaim ""this is a horror movie after all, stop talking about the little girls and get to the scares!"" Graciously, somewhat rude reader. The Conjuring is creepy, intermittently nightmarish, tense, gross, unsettling, and in its purest form, scary. This is the type of film that dares you not to hug yourself or laugh nervously in the hopes you deflect some iota of the sensation of primal fear. But these emotions are never extracted in a manipulative fashion and the jump scares are orchestrated effectively through physical objects falling, bumping, banging and generally causing off-putting noises, not blaring, out of context musical chords.The camera work is also fantastic employing every angle imaginable and even some very impressive point of view and upside-down-spin shots. It's easily Wan's best directed effort to date but never one that lets its style eclipse the mood. Similarly his use of sound both in the score (which utilizes your average brooding options as well as sharp, grating notes that call back to horror of days gone by) and practical noises such as a strained rope swinging or a door slamming shut. Again, it all adds to the experience and in eventually pulling of the major frights.Like most fare of this nature, the restrained tension does take a bit of a hit heading into the finale, as subtlety is sacrificed for more overt horror to resolve the story. Thankfully this change in approach is handled with just as much aplomb and also manages to deliver one of the most effective exorcism sequences in recent memory – a victory made all the more notable thanks to the generally overexposed and silly nature of that staple. It's not the perfect ending that the previous acts demanded but one that by no means insults the audience and still remains scary (if in a more upfront manner).Perhaps the biggest compliment I can pay The Conjuring is that it actually deserves a sequel. There are tales of the Warrens left to tell and the acting is uniformly strong enough that revisiting these characters would be more a treat then a chore. It takes a skillful filmmaker to take well worn themes and approaches (while avoiding gore and a high body count to boot) and make them seem as original as ever. Coming from a huge horror buff and one that experiences more disappointments then the average soul can handle, I can earnestly say The Conjuring is one of the best ever and what can serve as a fantastic induction into the genre for the uninitiated.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Conjuring terror,"Decided to re-watch both 'The Conjuring' films, with memories of really liking both, after watching, and not liking all that much, 'The Nun' (which was watched as part of my watching as many films of 2018 as possible quest) very recently. Just to see whether they held up, as good as remembered and whether they succeeded where 'The Nun' didn't and didn't make that film's mistakes.On re-watch, 'The Conjuring' does hold up very well and actually just as good as remembered. It succeeds splendidly in where 'The Nun' failed and has none of its mistakes. 'The Conjuring' is not a perfect film, but it is very atmospheric, well made and genuinely scary, or at least to me it was. It is a very familiar premise, done to death actually, but the atmosphere stops it from being too predictable and there is enough freshness.'The Conjuring' is overlong but its biggest, and only big, problem is the final act.It did become repetitive and lost momentum at this point and the very end felt rushed.Other than those, 'The Conjuring' is very good. It looks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The music is haunting and not over-bearing, recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere (which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regard).Script is not too awkward and is structured coherently, with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour. The direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material. The story takes time to unfold but doesn't get dull. As said too, 'The Conjuring' is genuinely scary, with actual tension, suspense and dread, in a palm-sweating and heart-pounding sense at its best, while not relying too much on jump scares (they are there but have build up and were surprising).Found myself liking the characters more than expected. The leads were ones worth caring for, didn't get frustrated with them, wish for more personality or annoyed by them. The antagonist was frightening, was neither over-used or under-utilised and didn't look cheap. The acting also comes off well, especially Vera Farmiga while also impressed with how Lili Tyler coped with a role that on paper seemed limited.Summarising, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Glad to see an R rated film do so well, but not sure why it is","I love horror films and I think a true horror film should be rated R. Unfortunately, over the years, the makers of films have tried their hardest to make everything they can into a PG-13 film, for reasons I cannot quite explain. As if there are that many 13 to 16 year old's whose parents will not take them to an R rated film to doom a good film to failure without them. Well this film is proving that they are not needed! For that I salute this movie and wish for its continued success. However, at the same time I am baffled as to why it is exactly doing so well. I went to this film and I have to say about the only haunted house cliché they were missing in this film was a cat scare. I was bored for a lot of this film to be quite honest. This film had some interesting story aspects and it also picked up near the end, but I just do not see what the fuss is about.The story has a couple moving into a new house with their five daughters. Meanwhile, we are introduced to another couple who investigate paranormal activities. The family who moved into the new house seem to be coming under attack by a spirit and soon the paths will cross as the ones who investigate the paranormal come to the aid of the family. Things become dire when the mother of the family begins to act oddly and the strange presence that is tormenting the family finds its way into the home of the couple who investigate the strange happenings.The acting is fairly decent which helped the film out immensely. As I said, I was getting bored here and there and it was only the acting that kept me awake. The scares were the typical loud noises in the night and at times I was reminded of various other haunting films such as Poltergeist, Amityville and a myriad of others. The film switches a bit in tone and turns into more of an exorcism movie, but that has been done before too in Amityville II: The Possession.I do not want to give the impression that the film was bad, just a movie I have seen on more than one occasion. I find it strange that people are calling it original. It had good acting though and there were aspects of the story I enjoyed and thought interesting. To often though I felt that they used the book of haunted house clichés and were crossing off the ones they used. Like I said, I think they crossed off everyone, but were not able to cross off ""Open door and cat jumps out.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Looks like a rip-off of so many horrors at once...,"About 2 months ago I found out about The Conjuring and it got me really hyped up. Based on the trailers and other reviews it seemed like the next Amityville Horror or even something better. I have never been that disappointed...The beginning of the movie was quite formidable and original but after the first twenty minutes it began to spin out of control. Piece by piece The Conjuring began to display elements stolen from other horror movies. Specific scenes that even a horror rookie can associate to some of the popular horrors out there, have been implemented throughout the movie... And the number of haunted house clichés could not have been any larger.I am not trying to spoil anything but the ending was completely ridiculous. Last thing you want to do is to believe that this was based on real life events....The jump scares were as predictable as it gets and the plots are being twisted for no particular reason with no positive outcome in any one of themThe only good thing is that the movie gives you an insight into the paranormal world and does it quite effectively, I personally kind of wanted to go and read more about demonology. For this the movie receives a plus.If you haven't seen many haunted house or satanic horrors, you should definitely go and see this. On the other side, if you consider yourself a person who is quite educated in the horror genre, then you will be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Better Than Any Recent Horror Movie,"Hide and clap or clap and seek, whatever that game was it made me never want to play any version of hide and seek ever again. The Conjuring did something a horror movie hasn't been able to do in a long time. No, not scare the hell out of me but it didn't make me laugh. This movie was one of the scariest movies I have seen in a very long time. The jump scares were there but necessary and not as predictable. The story of the Warrens is one I have never heard about but the supernatural and demon possession is something I sort of believe in, and that made the movie feel more real. I really enjoyed this movie, let's see why.A family is struggling on money and buys a house in the country off a bank auction. Little do they know, this house is haunted and has an awful past. When they bought the house you would think they would do the research on the history of the house but that is just me. From the mysterious leg tugs to the creepy doll that moves on its own, this movie knows how to scare. The terror and horror in this movie is overwhelming and lives up to the hype. It takes a lot to scare me in a movie and I have seen scarier movie there were many different ways this movie had an edge.One of the first things I noticed was that all the characters looked pale. The opening scene is a side story with a few girls who are being terrorized by an old doll. Not only was the doll creepy but the poor girls looked terrible. There was no pigmentation in their face. In fact no character, even the Warrens had much color in their face. All the clothes the characters wore were dull colors and they were not vibrant. Almost every scene was dark. Even when the sun was out, it was cloudy and there were shadows everywhere. That was something I noticed early and it was the same throughout the entire movie and it made the movie scarier.The scariest scene is easily when the mother plays hide and clap or whatever that game was called. Yes, I was too scared to remember, okay, don't judge me. Everything in this scene worked. The scared mother made the scare more believable and the acting she did. The music blended in well. The idea of turning on the lights is used a lot but it always works. She is running around the house trying to find the ghost and the jumps and spooks were great. The theater jumped and screamed at the end of the scene which ended in darkness and terror.The major flaw in most horror movies is the acting. The acting in this movie, however, is actually pretty good. The family that is haunted has five kids and a few of them are stereotypical but they all do a good job. They each have a scene or two where they shine in their moment of terror. If they are scared then the audience is scared and the movie works. Seeing one of the youngest daughters sleep walk and bang her head against the closet was creepy and of course the entire movie starts with normal occurrences that are creepy and quickly elevate.Was this movie perfect? No, there were some scenes where the movie slowed down and got a little out of hand. There are scenes that are supposed to be scary but aren't and they were hard to believe. The key to a movie like this is the backstory and the ""based on a true story"" gimmick. The Warrens are real people who were paranormal investigators but there were parts of this movie where this could not have possibly been real. There were times where I was taken out of the movie because a girl was being dragged by her hair because of a ghost or something. It is hard to make a scene like that work because it looks silly.The characters of the Warrens themselves were unexpected. The movie focused on them just as much as it did on the family that was being haunted. The Warren's have a daughter of their own which was unexpected and she gets involved in a creepy scene as well. They had really good chemistry but their acting was a little weak at times. The Conjuring was a good time and I had fun with the movie but I don't think I would see it again. I think it only has the real effect once.Overall The Conjuring is a very good horror movie. Is that really saying much? Well, you tell me. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies. They are usually poorly made and cheap, but this one was different. It didn't rely on jump scares and cheesy tricks, but rather clever movements with the camera and limited CGI. The presentation of this movie was great and the writing clever. The backstory to this movie interesting and I bought it. I believe things like this happen but the movie needs to exaggerate it to make money and a good movie. I usually hate horror movies and laugh at them but this one was different. I was legitimately scared and I had fun. The scare wasn't constant and it wasn't there long but it was there. Some movies the scare is always there but in this movie it was here in bursts. For being the scariest movie I have seen in a long time it gets the WillyT Scaredy Pants Award. That's my horror genre rating so it also gets the WillyT Recommendation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Effective horror,"The Conjuring directed by James Wan is a great ghost story that tells the true story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, world renowned paranormal investigators, who were called to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in a secluded farmhouse. Forced to confront a powerful demonic entity, the Warrens find themselves caught in the most horrifying case of their lives. The Conjuring revels in great scares well placed. It has a strong cast and an atmosphere of real dread. James Wan has created a fun, scary and beautiful looking movie. The movie is an entertaining old-school freakout, one of the smartest and most effective horror in the last decade.Rating: 8,5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Well made, but why so predictable?","Director James Wan said that he watched loads of '70s haunted house movies before sitting down to direct this, his latest horror movie after the INSIDIOUS flicks. Unfortunately, it appears that the co-writers of the script also watched all the same movies, because this turns out to be yet another entirely predictable exercise in fear-building.I don't really have a huge problem with THE CONJURING, other than to say that it's all been done - and been done better - before. The old movies like THE AMITYVILLE HORROR and THE ENTITY just seemed to have more authenticity, better production values, and a freshness that made them more frightening. THE CONJURING, meanwhile, goes through the motions without ever offering anything even remotely resembling new.Saying that, it's pretty good by modern genre standards and a lot better than the schlocky INSIDIOUS movies, also starring Patrick Wilson. The characters played by Wilson and Farmiga are entertaining, not least because they're based on a true-life ghost-busting couple (although to credit them as the ""world's most renowned"" is insulting, given the reputation of other noted paranormal investigators in recent history such as Peter Underwood, Maurice Grosse and Guy Lyon Playfair).The film looks good, and the cast can't be faulted for really getting behind their characters. A shame, then, that Wan is severely lacking in imagination when it comes to the scares. Typically they involve spooky wardrobes, characters descending into cobwebby and unlit rooms, and loud noises on otherwise quiet soundtracks. All very predictable. And the ending goes down THE EXORCIST route again, which is disappointing. Like SINISTER, this is a film with bags of atmosphere and lots of potential which is well worth a watch for genre fans, but it lacks the magic spark to make it anything other than average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scariest Movie of Haunted House and Exorcism that I Have Seen in Years,"In 1971, the family man Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) and his wife Carolyn (Lili Taylor) move to an old farmhouse in Rhode Island with their daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy) and April (Kyla Deaver). The family finds a hidden basement which the entrance is locked with planks. Soon they are haunted by noises and ghosts and Carolyn meets the famous paranormal investigators Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson). They visit the house and Lorraine and Ed feel that the house is possessed by a fiend. Their further investigation shows that a witch has sacrificed her seven-day baby to Satan and has possessed other mothers that lived in the real estate to kill their children. Lorraine and Ed bring his friends Drew (Shannon Kook) and Brad (John Brotherton) to help them to collect evidences to convince the Church that it is necessary an exorcism to save The Perron family from evil.""The Conjuring"" is the scariest movie of haunted house and exorcism that I have seen in years and the best horror movie after ""Insidious"". The director James Wan, from ""Insidious"", makes another great horror movie using the usual clichés of the genre but with high quality. The escalating of tension is based on the atmosphere in the house and the terror experienced by the Perron family and supported by a great cast with Lily Taylor, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson and Ron Livingstone. Patrick Wilson, from ""Insidious"", switches position and now performs a paranormal investigator instead of a haunted family man. The magnificent camera work is impressive with unusual angles. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Invocação do Mal"" (""Conjuring of the Evil"")Note: On 10 July 2016, I saw this film again on Blu-Ray.Note: On 27 June 2024, I saw this film again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Still though, The Conjuring is a film that works though it does lack  originality.","If you say you like horror, you would have to know James Wan. He is a director who's only made a impact since the 2000's but it's a big mark indeed. He first created Saw in 2004 which was a clever and original torture film that later turned into six more films. Dead Silence came next for him which I've never seen but it has killer dolls in the plot that comes off as original even in pre-watch. Even though more of a physiological film, he created Death Sentence in 2007 which can be described as a crime film. He went back horror in 2010 with Insidious which felt something similar to the classic Poltergeist, with a family getting haunted by a demon and Insidious 2 came in 2013.With Wan announcing himself directing the next Fast and Furious, it's now safe to say that horror may be done for him and he's going in another direction. Regardless of where he's going, I'm going to support him because I am a fan of his. The Conjuring as possibly his last horror movie fits solidly into his filmography though.Based off a true story and set in the 70's, a family of six with five daughters move into a country house looking for a new start and really a new chapter on life. After what seems like random noises that could be found throughout any house, the Perron family starts to notice that these aren't random noises and they later contact paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Fleming) Warren. This is a haunted house film with also some homage to the 70's and of course it's horror.If you ever seen Wan's previous work, Insidious which we have talked about, then you know what the The Conjuring is. Like Insidious, The Conjuring has a family, investigators and Patrick Wilson was also in Insidious. Still though, The Conjuring is a film that works though it does lack originality.The list of why this works without originality is granted very long. Setting this movie in the 70's is fresh and innovating. Ed and Lorraine are the type of characters that are very interesting and the movie has a very cool premise. These are the type of characters I could watch quite often in movies to come. Lili Taylor in particular delivers a performance that stands above them all. The movie provides many scares, at least it did for me, and for a person who doesn't get scared by many things, that's definitely saying something. I can also appreciate the smart ending here that just makes you appreciate how much James Wan knows horror.With a sequel set to be put out in 2015 and spin-off film coming out the first week of October in 2014, the future of this film is far from over. It is something I am surely looking forward to. The Conjuring won't go down as Wan's best work but it won't be his worst work either. I would put it in the middle o his filmography.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An Excellent,Scary,Terrifying And Suspenseful Supernatural Horror Film. James Wan At His Best.","The Conjuring is an excellent,scary and suspenseful Supernatural Horror film that combines amazing direction,a great cast,non-stop terror and a creepy,intense score elements that make The Conjuring a great Horror film and is James Wan at his best.Based on a true story and set in 1971,The Conjuring tells the story of Carolyn and Roger Perron(Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston)who along with their five daughters have moved into a new house on the countryside of Rhode Island. While the Perron's are in their new house,the family discovers that the them and the house are being haunted by ghosts and evil spirits. With nowhere to turn,the Perron's ask for the help of Lorraine and Ed Warren(Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson),paranormal investigators to get rid of the evil spirits and save their family.The Conjuring is an amazing and frightening Supernatural Horror film that right from the beginning puts viewers on edge giving people a scary and emotional experience that no one will ever forget. The Conjuring is also an old school Horror movie in the truest sense because it's a movie that takes us back to the Supernatural Horror films of the 1970s and 80s combining a ghost story with a demonic possession story mixing together and combining elements of classics such as The Shining(1980),Poltergeist(1982),The Haunting(1963)with The Exorcist(1973)and The Evil Dead(1982). And While The Conjuring doesn't nessarily reinvent the Supernatural Horror sub genre,the movie gives a fresh and entertaining take on the haunted house genre. Another thing the is old school about The Conjuring is the movie's scares and suspense which are effective and done with great timing and detail with intense build-up that grabs you by the throat. Director James Wan uses simple things to make the film creepy whether it's someone or something knocking on wood,moving doors,showing things from a distance giving viewers a sense of dread. The jump scares are not just in The Conjuring because it's a Horror movie but are in the film because they have meaning and power. Another thing that I love about The Conjuring is the way the movie uses atmosphere to make the movie scary using the darkness,haunting sounds and the characters reactions to the chaos going on all around which adds to the film's dark tone and the movie works greatly without blood and gore(although there is a couple of bloody moments in the film). Don't get me wrong while I love blood and gore in Horror movies,The Conjuring didn't need or require it because the whole film is about messing with you mentally than physically. You can almost say that The Conjuring is a continuation of James Wan's other haunted house movie before this one the terrific Insidious which shares some similarities with this film. At 112 minutes The Conjuring moves at a steady pace and there is never a dull moment and when watch the film you will be craving for more. One of the great things about The Conjuring is that this film is more of a character driven Horror movie like The Exorcist,Poltergeist or The Sixth Sense because with The Conjuring there is enough time and length for viewers to get to know the main characters in the Warren's and Parron's. While we don't get to know about the past history of the two couples but we see enough to feel sympathy for the Warren's and Parron's because when the scary stuff starts to happen we want them to survive. What makes the Warren's and Parron's great characters is that they don't feel like Slasher movie stock characters waiting to get killed off in the first 15 minutes but feel like real people dealing with a drastic situation. I love that the movie takes it's time with build-up not only with the scares and suspense but also with the characters which in my opinion makes the movie effective and makes The Conjuring a great and remarkable film. The ending of The Conjuring is terrific,scary and at the same time surprising because it's open ended leaving viewers with questions rather than answers.The cast is outstanding. Vera Farminga and Patrick Wilson are excellent and memorable as Lorraine and Ed Warren,the paranormal investigators. Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston are brilliant as Carolyn and Roger Parron,the couple who's house is haunted. Shanley Caswell(Andrea),Hayley McFarland(Nancy),Joey King(Christine),Mackenzie Foy(Cindy),Klya Deaver(April)and Sterling Jerins(Judy Warren)do wonderful jobs as the kids in the film. Shannon Kook(Drew)and John Brotherton(Brad)give good performances as well.The direction by James Wan is brilliant and stylish,with Wan always moving the camera with tracking shots,hand-held movements and creative angles giving the movie a creepy and frightening atmosphere. Great job,Wan.The score by Joseph Bishara is terrific,haunting and intense and matches the movie's scary energy. Memorable score,Bishara.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Supernatural movies or James Wan,I highly suggest you see The Conjuring,an excellent,scary and suspenseful Horror film that is James Wong at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Average,"This is, without a doubt, one of the most overrated films I've come across in many years.For me, the film relied far too much on jump scares rather than the actual story: it took about 60 minutes until it got going. The acting was mediocre, and I say that because I didn't feel sympathetic for the characters. Personally, I preferred Vera Farmiga (Lorraine Warren) in 'Orphan' as opposed to 'The Conjuring' - I feel as if she was wasted a bit here.I never really got the director's intentions in this film and I feel there could have been more of a story to it. Films such as 'Martyrs' and 'Sinister', which I'd highly recommend, were both able to attach an equal amount of weight to the story as well as the horror.As for the ending, it was extremely weak. In fact, it was pathetic. I think the conclusion could have been dealt with much better.The film was okay, and I can definitely say I've seen worse horror films in my life, but I honestly can't see how people can rate it anything above 7. It just didn't do it for me, personally. I expected much more ""horror"".A good film? Yes. A good ""horror"" film? Not at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This will become a horror classic,"I don't want to sound like a shill for the studio but this is the truth. You don't want to wait for this one to hit DVD if you are at all a fan of the genre. The Conjuring relies a lot on things that go bump in the night and do they ever bump. It will lose a lot of its effectiveness on even the best home system. I was reminded a lot of the original Haunting by the loud sounds in the film and how they were used effectively to scare the audience.Lily Taylor rises above an overall solid cast to play the mother of the haunted family and she really delivers the goods. James Wan has made his best film to date with this solid horror film that hearkens back to the ones best remembered from my childhood, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, The Haunting, and Poltergeist. Being set in the 70's really helps give it the feel of those haunted house classics.The movie starts with a nice subplot piece with a couple good scares and then slows down for about a half hour or so of setup before revving up into one hell of a scare fest. I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, other than to say it sure made me curious about the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the investigators in the film that were also involved with the Amityville Horror. Now if the filmmakers will just let this one lie on its own and don't try to milk the idea for a series of films like was done with the other famous Warren case, things will be just about near perfect scary.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
jump out of your seat happenings,"I went to a sneak preview and the audience liked the movie as did I. Almost did not go because of all the terrible paranormal TV 'reality' shows which kept hammering the constant theme of 'what was that'? OMG. > commercial < 'oh it was a cat'.This is a real movie. With a real script. And real actors. And real drama. And a coherent story.Big difference.I thought the unfolding of the story was well done as were the paranormal happenings that kept increasing.A couple with several kids move to a house that they bought at an auction only to discover that it is 'haunted' with the ghosts of people who were murdered or took their own lives.Slowly they come to realize that there is some presence and get some experts in paranormal behavior to come and see and maybe perform an 'exorcism'. And yes, it has echos of other films like Exorcist, Amityville Horror and others.Well structured with thrills and mystery, it is a good film and a logical extension to the ""Paranormal"" security camera series of films to something more dramatic and with more camera angles, lighting and camera movement.Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best horror films in recent history.,"I haven't been this scared from a horror film in years. The Conjuring promises to freak you out, keep you on the edge of you seat, make you jump, and give you an awesome story that has elements to it that have actually happened to a family who is portrayed in the film. The actors/actresses were all great at acting. It was awesome to see Patrick Wilson in the film because of his role in Insidious...I thought it was cool that it basically tied in with that. This movie definitely gets its roots from Insidious and The Exorcist. I couldn't believe some of the jump scares they pulled off in this movie, I mean, they were so real, it seemed. I hope people learn from this movie: Horror films don't need to have gore and tons of deaths to be good, they need good scares and a good story, and this film gives you both.

As their is not margin of acting in Action and horror films but actors have tried well in this respect and their performance is mush better comparatively.All in all its thoroughly a horror movie.

Baptize your damn children...,"I went into this film fully thinking that it may very well be scary (something which isn't always true for horror movies), and a scary movie is certainly something I got. Frankly, if that was all I got then I would've walked away a happy man. What I fully did not expect, was a film that managed to both be scary, but also tell a compelling and interesting story. There are plenty of little things I could bring up that detracted from the film for me, but I don't think these are universal and certainly didn't significantly impact my overall impression or enjoyment of the film.If I had to compare it to anything, I would say it reminded me most of The Exorcist. Basing anything off demonic possession is going to naturally draw this comparison, but this one handles the ""realness"" subject matter well, certainly nowhere near as well as The Exorcist, and it isn't nearly as believable for that reason, but it was far better than I initially expected or what you get from most horror films. The liberties they took were also clearly moves to increase the horror of the film, which I can appreciate.Overall, this is a movie that is certainly scary but also tells a pretty interesting a rewarding story that you don't always see in the horror genre.

Nothing new here,"The main problem with a movie like ""The Conjuring"" is that it assumes that none of us have ever been to a haunted house movie before (perhaps not an entirely unwarranted assumption given that the characters in these movies clearly never have or they'd know better than to move into one of these houses in the first place).You know the drill. Unsuspecting family from the city buys an old place in the country. Weird things begin to happen. Ghostbusters are brought in to investigate. Turns out some restless spirits, the victims of various ghastly crimes in the past, are roaming around the place searching for someone to free them from their predicament so they can move on and find eternal peace. Supernatural pandemonium ensues. Roll credits. The End.This one is set in 1971 (the girls are watching ""Brady Bunch"" reruns in the middle of the afternoon long before the show ever went into syndication, but then I doubt that facts are high on the agenda for these filmmakers). Lily Taylor and Ron Livingston play the parents of five daughters who become bedeviled by some evil forces lurking in the dark recesses of the creaky old fixer-upper they've purchased in rural Rhode Island. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are the world-famous paranormal researchers, the Warrens, who attempt to exorcise the demons from the place.The kind of movie for which a spoiler alert is practically superfluous, ""The Conjuring"" is allegedly based on a true story, a come-on that might have been more convincing had the movie not seemed so much like every other haunted house movie we've ever seen. I'd like to believe that even ghosts can't be this boringly predictable.Maybe someday someone somewhere will come up with something new that will breathe some much-needed life into the genre. Till then, I guess, movies like ""The Conjuring"" - and there will be many more to come, I'm sure - will just have to do.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"The Conjuring works with the tried and true and delivers pure, unnerving terror and dread.","Horror, as a genre, just doesn't cut it in modern cinema. Audiences have become too desensitized to cheap images and loud noises to provoke a 'scare' that everyone has begun to believe that this is the norm. It has been the destruction of a great genre for the past 20 years and we've only had a shimmer of light maybe once a year, if we're lucky, on what truly can be done amongst the vast possibilities of horror. The Conjuring just shook the genre right back into place.Based on true events, however dramatized, of one of the most shocking events witnessed by controversial paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, The Conjuring lays out the era of the 70's in stylish fashion right from the opening frame and it brings you head first into the atmosphere of the film right away. From there only director James Wan can guide the way...and dare I say it, he has set himself as an auteur of modern horror. He knows not to tamper with a tried and true formula of old-school horror and just goes for the heights of pure, unflinching dread and unbearable tension in nearly every scene, setting up his frames beautifully and timing it all so well, teasing the audience and building the tension as slow as he dares to go within his rich and frightening atmosphere. He delivers a shock or two with sound, but its all set out to test the audiences limits before he truly unleashes a flurry of evil and terror that hasn't been done in such a film for years. I found myself more than once feeling completely unnerved. That is a tough thing to do with me. It was also a nice thing to see that even though the script isn't deep with character development, that the time is still taken to intertwine the family within the evil and show that the power of family is a godly thing.Great performances across the board are held higher thanks to a truly terrific performance from Vera Farmiga. She has had a fair share of dips in the last couple of years but 2013 is looking to be the year for her.The Conjuring has to be seen in theaters. Letting the sight of a large screen and the encompassing atmosphere really take you in will have you experiencing all the familiar horror beats, but delivered with such methodical skill and pure terror.

another quality horror movie from James Wan,"Director James Wan has really come into his own with 2013's ""The Conjuring."" He teams up again with actor Patrick Wilson (they collaborated on 2010's INSIDIOUS), to tell the story of a normal family who moved into a house in 1971, and the spirits that haunt the house and then the family. A slow unraveling of pieces to the story helps keep the audience engaged, as we find out about several historical events which have brought tortured souls back to torment the house's occupants.I found this movie to be suspenseful and scary, creating empathy for an otherwise normal family who did nothing to deserve the fear that was brought onto them, other than to move into a house whose previous occupants suffered unspeakable crimes decades before.

Enough Creepy Moments to Make Up for Final Part,"The Conjuring (2013)*** (out of 4)Real-life ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) are asked by a mother to come to her home where she, her husband and their five young daughters are experiencing something supernatural. Within minutes of arriving the duo realize that they're up against something stronger than they've ever known. THE CONJURING is a very good movie that certainly deserves a lot of the hype it's getting but I'm going to stop a bit short of calling it a masterpiece or one of the best films of the genre. With that said, there's no question that director James Wan knows how to use torture (SAW) as well as scares (INSIDIOUS) but this time out he goes solely for the scares and gets quite a few very effective jump scenes. Not all of them are those fake jump scenes that are so common in horror movies today where there's a loud crash through the expensive speaker system that would make anyone jump and it doesn't have anything to do with the movie. No, there are generally some creepy scenes here that I'm not going to ruin but you'll certainly never look at hide and clap the same way again. The director also does a very good job with the 1970s setting as the entire film really does look like the movies that would have been made in that decade. The film also benefits from some extremely strong performances with Farmiga turning in another excellent performance. She's really been doing some great work over the past few years and even in a genre that a lot of people look down on. Wilson is also effective as her husband as is Rob Livingston and Lili Taylor as the haunted couple. I think the film eventually falls off its tracks during the final thirty-minutes and once the possession stuff started I just slipped out of the movie. I guess we've simply seen this stuff a bit too often and there just wasn't anything effective during these scenes. Still, the tension and creepiness throughout the first two-thirds of the film are strong enough to make this worth seeing.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It has a You are There Feel Rather than a You are Watching. Mostly it is Understated and Chilling, Engrossing and not too Gross, but it Pulls You In by the Ankles and won't Let Go.

Spooky in all the right ways,"Not going to lie, I fought watching this for a long time. The whole ""clap, clap"" thing in the trailer annoyed me and I thought it seemed lame but my husband kept telling me how good the movie was. Fine, I finally decided to watch it.

Conjure up something better...,"I was more excited than a midget at a children's theme park to see this film. A horror film rated above a 7.0? That's unheard of! It must be amazing right?! Well, no. Not really.Don't get me wrong, it's a nice film. The director of photography needs some form of medal made out of some sort of metal for the disorientating use of shots that leaves you feeling seriously confused and uneasy adding to the tension.Hooooowever, the film is horribly paced. You go a very long time without seeing so much as a hint of a ghost child and when you are hit in the face with horror it goes on so long you either get pi**ed off with being on edge or it loses the effect.The film also seems a little confused about who it's main characters are. It gives equal screen time to both the parents of the family and the investigators and it's because of this overcommitment that you end up not really having enough time to care that much about any of them.Is the film scary? Yes. Will you jump? Probably. Is it any different from Insidious or Sinister? No. If anything, the smaller character focus of insidious and darker ending of sinister make them superior horror films.All in all, the film is like making the dirty love with Monica from friends; It's better than the phoebe's out there but it's not the Rachel you were hoping for either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
More comical than scary,"The tired old supernatural genre. Well, I have to be honest, I am not usually impressed by many of these. I did like white noise and a few others though. Sleepy hollow too. When a movie is more soundly based in the supernatural, I can enjoy it.But from the opening credits, I was internally rolling my eyes. It is heavily religious, and based in that world view. Which is another reason for the eye rolling. And in that confused Christian way.I couldn't finish watching it, I found it utterly silly. If you find demons laughable, or know what witchcraft or the occult actually is, or are just are not of the Christian persuasion, I suggest that you don't watch this movie. There are more effective scares for such people in other movies. If on the other hand, your world view is heavily colored by the church, this might just be your cup of tea.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Amazing Film,"What can I say about The conjuring. I am a horror film fanatic and I am going to go out on a limb her and say this for me is by far the best horror movie since The exorcist. And that movie scares the crap out of me, even to this day. The conjuring gave me that same feeling, I've never seen people leave the theater during a movie like I did for The conjuring, again having the same affect on people that The Exorcist had. The Acting in this was phenomenal, Vera Farmiga was hands down amazing and Joey King love her, she absolutely killed it. That Annabelle doll gives me the creeps. I want one. James Wan created a masterpiece with this one. If anyone still hasn't seen The Conjuring, go get out from under that rock you're living in and go buy it now. Do I sound insane for giving this movie a perfect score? No it's that dang good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not deserve 8 stars,This movie is very below from our expectations. I was expecting something very scary but i found it average movie with the same kind of methods and script used in supernatural movies. nothing was new although it was based on true story but they mixed up all things. It was not worth to 8 stars. There was few scene where they caught us but apart that it wasn't scary at all. Mama was much better than this. there were very few moments when they put the ghost before the viewers. and why the hell was police in this movie? there was no role for them. i would be surprised if there was any involvement of police in real story. Only positive thing with this movie was the Sound Effects. It made this movie watchable. and this is the only best reason i gave it the 6 stars.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I think some reviewers are over-exaggerating on the scariness of the movie,"This is a review coming from somebody who is not easily frightened. In an effort not to make a review that's overly long and drawn out (like all the others), I'll just keep my review simple.First off, the movie does have a solid storyline. A simple one really. A family moves into a house that's haunted, and supernatural hunters are employed to fix it. Nothing really much else happens beyond this premise.The movie as a whole (for those who have watched it and should take a minute or two to reflect upon the movie after reading this review), isn't really all that scary. That is to say; If you take out all the jump scares put into the movie, there's nothing else to keeping you on your feet and biting your fingernails.In some ways, if you think about it further, even the jump scares don't fit into the story. Heck, the story might have even been more eerie if the jump scares were replaced with the apparitions slowly coming into view. This would've made a more well-rounded setting as opposed to trying to make a movie half-scary and half-eerie. Horror movies can really either be one or the other, but not both.In summary, I would say to you that this movie is worth it to watch, but it's not really high priority. The story isn't really original, but the solid acting and nice execution makes for a good watch. My rating is a 7.5 out of 10. I couldn't give it an 8 because there wasn't anything else in the movie to scare you apart from jump scares.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Do not watch this movie alone,This is one of the scariest movies from 2013. This has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is scarier then The Exorcist. And that is not easy to do. This is very scary. There is one movie I can think of that is scarier. The Conjuring 2. Still this is a very scary movie. If you like really scary movies then you should see this movie. 7.5 is a good ratting. But this is such a good movie that 7.5 is underrating it. I give this movie 10 out of 10. This is scarier the A Nightmare on elm street. And that is not easy to do. This is scarier then Halloween and that is not easy to do. If this movie does not scary you no movie will.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creepy & Terrifying...Try Not To Scream !!!!,"Not being a lover of horror films, I never caught up with one in the theatres. The 1973 Academy-Award winner The Exorcist & the Bollywood horror flick Bhoot, directed by RGV was all I had watched from this genre. According to me, both these films had enough visual & sound effects to terrify the audience. As I was going through Bhoot for the second time, I noticed that the main source of terror was the sudden sound effect (irrespective of the screen showing a demonic creature or not) & RGV had used this trick to scare the audiences more than ghostly horrifying visuals.A very similar but an enhanced effect accompanied by some great visual effects is what The Conjuring (2013) stands on. The Saw director James Wan extracted a piece of story from the case files of Warrens and directed a supernatural thriller proving to rather more than just a mere horror film. It had the soul accompanied by a well-defined structure.The film opens up in a remarkable scene where a demonologist Ed Warren & his beautiful clairvoyant wife Lorraine who are paranormal investigators providing rational explanations to strange happenings, investigate a case of the Annabelle doll where a small doll suddenly becomes possessed by the ghost of the 7 year old girl haunting the house of two nurses. The scene remarks the introduction of the two researchers who research & provide solution to malignant ghost invasions in a person or in a accommodation.The film flies back in 1971 where Carolyn & Roger Perron, with their five daughters move into a bungalow in Harrisville, Rhode Island. Right from the day, they settle in the family experiences weird happenings in the house. Their pet dog Sadie is found dead outside the villa, the mother Carolyn gets strange bruises after she wakes up in the morning every day, an unknown entity takes to pulling the daughter's leg every night, the door creaks open mysteriously every now & then. These incidents go on culminating and aggravating as these small strange happenings magnify themselves to reveal large demonic presence in the house. The menacing situation ends up getting so severe and dreadful that out of fear & despair, the couple resort to the Warrens for help.The story is not just about the family of Perrons. The life of Warrens is also showcased parallel with the life of Perrons. The film is totally one-sided that you can predict that the lives of these two families are going to end up meeting at an unfortunate turn. The film is not recommended for people with a weak heart as the scenes are impressive but frightening. The demonic visuals are sudden, unexpected & fear- inducing personifying the directorial talent of James Wan since he succeeds effectively in generating chills down the spine.More enhancing are opening & closing credits in the movie, the weapon most under-utilized in modern cinema as the snapshots from real-life Warren Cases are shown. The film's cinematography also receives thumbs up as the cinematographer John Leonetti uses some swooping shots to capture characters as they run inside the house. The film appears to be a winning horror formula after some previously released horror flicks going deep under the ground. Above all, the director's clear fascination to horror films like Amityville horror, the Poltergeist & the Exorcist is clearly visible in the film. As the film progresses to the latter half, comparisons of The Conjuring to The Exorcist becomes totally unavoidable but the director has lived up to the expectations in The Conjuring & succeeded in giving an extra-ordinary film. For weak hearted people, my message to them is ' Try not to scream folks '.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Overrated!,"Never understand the love of the audience for this franchise. This movie is very predictable, boring in some parts and not scary. The actors are good some scenes aren't that bad but absolutely this movie is NOT a masterpiece. My rating is 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Forgettable,"This is well made but couldn't be much more forgettable. It utilises every trope in the supernatural possession genre without doing anything new.

"If You Don't Love to be Scared, this is not your movie","First let me say, I DO NOT like scary movies as a general rule. When I saw that James Wan was directing (of Saw Fame)I was even less enthused simply because I consider Saw to be torture porn. What got me to watch this movie, despite my misgivings, was the fact that the MPAA gave this movie an R rating. When the producers went back and asked ""Why"", the MPAA simply said it is ""just too scary"" well that piqued my interest. I mean how scary can a movie actually be. Watch this movie and you will find out just how scary a movie can actually be.James Wan did a masterful job in shaping this movie, there's really nothing new under the sun here, it has the same fair as a lot of other horror movies, but the way it's presented, particularly the last half, will have you putting your hands in front of your face. I swear I walked out of the theater and I was tired from watching this, wrung out, like I had just went 10 rounds with a heavy weight. This movie pulls no punches,there are parts that are hard to watch, but you will anyway.If you like horror movies, don't walk but run to see this.

"Scary in the Dictionary, with a picture of the movie poster for The Conjuring.","This movie gets my vote as one of the scariest things I've ever seen. James Wan is one of my directing heroes. I feel like the man puts a lot of thought into the scenes. He knows what works, what doesn't work. I can only aspire to be as good, when I enter that line of work in the future.Couldn't have asked for a better cast, I can't wait if and when he comes back to make a sequel. I love how he pushes the boundaries with the scares. As a dreamer, wanting to be a writing-director, there are things that happens in this movie, that I never would have thought of, but now that I've seen this movie, it gets me thinking.If you know this movie enough to watch it everyday, then you probably aren't a fan of movies altogether.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I'm 11 and wasn't scared,"The movie isn't very scary however the acting is done well. I wouldn't call it a scary movie as more of a drama mystery because in total not to many jump scares and not much horrifying content. If you want scary, watch 'sinister' The conjuring did not scare me it had freaky parts but nothing to scary. It all depends on what scares you and how brave you are but for me the conjuring wasn't as scary as I expected Many people played this movie up as scary when it wasn't but most kids my age would probably freak. I recommend it for brave 12+ The creepiest part isn't at all creepy but a jump scare so I was disappointed. I don't know why it got such a high rating but if I could choose it would only be around M/PG-13. I think the acting was so good especially from Joey King and Vera Faminga because they are very strong actors and a good addition to the cast. Overall, I didn't freak out, I wasn't scared and I don't think the movie is scary enough for an R/MA15+ rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's a great haunted house scare,"I'm not a great fan of James Wan... Saw was great. Dead Silence had it's creepiness and Insidious had some amazing scenes, but there were things I didn't like.The Conjuring is pretty much all of his techniques in previous films and put together into this gem. There's a creepy doll, there are some of the best scare techniques from Insidious and your standard haunted house theme. Think Amityville or the Changling with some of the great bits in James Wan's films and you get the Conjuring.Going into the film I was expecting a lot and I got what I was expecting. There are some parts when you can be cynical and say it didn't work, but overall I had a blast. The crowd was initially talkative (I watched it in Brooklyn), but by midway point no one said a word. Also, 2 people walked out during the most tense moments.Worth checking out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""The Conjuring"" offers more of the same, but Wan makes the most of it","James Wan must feel like he's got something to prove. The filmmaker has had success more than once (""Saw"" and ""Insidious"") in a horror genre that has been obnoxiously stagnant in recent years (everything is either a haunted house or exorcism film). ""The Conjuring"" is both, so more of the same for Wan.There's almost nothing original about ""The Conjuring."" We're talking spot-the-cliché drinking game unoriginal. So it begs the question: did Wan want to prove he could make a great horror film from overused genre hallmarks, or does he just have no interest in innovative filmmaking? Probably a little of both.The one unique angle of ""The Conjuring"" comes in the form of two non-fictional protagonists. Ed and Lorraine Warren are two paranormal investigators/demonologists who claim to have investigated upwards of 10,000 hauntings from the '50s to the '80s. They are most known for investigating the famous ""Amityville horror"" case that inspired two film versions (and frankly, ""The Conjuring"" is almost like a third).Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as the Warrens, who are brought in to investigate disturbances in the new Rhode Island country home of the Perron family. Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston)and their five girls have experienced a number of phenomena (moving doors, rotting flesh smell, a little ghost boy who's befriended the youngest daughter, etc.), and the Warrens can tell immediately when they enter that something particularly bad is here.Like any effective horror film, the build-up is painfully slow so that your mind moves into darker places than the film is going for the first half hour or so. All the occurrences happen predominantly at 3:07 in the morning, so the film cycles between day and night scenes in a way that'll drive you mad in the way that it teases a reprieve but that goes straight back into someone following a suspicious noise behind a door or under the bed.The scares of the film escalate too, from suspense techniques meant to elicit anxious anticipation of bigger scares to all-out fantastical mayhem, including a gruesome exorcism. It does so with a good measure of tact, but ""The Conjuring"" could have played the mystery angle longer than it does in order to earn some more points.One of the absolute standouts is Farmiga's performance as Lorraine, who is among the best characters I can ever recall in a genre horror film. A clairvoyant, she easily sees demon spirits and can sense what's going on. Farmiga gives Lorraine so much grace and courage that we clearly sense she is a woman who has seen a lot. At the same time, she gets frightened when we expect her to as well. She has some a subplot involving a traumatic past experience and her relationship to her daughter, but the film leaves us hanging by not finishing those arcs, presumably in a cocky ""save it for the sequel"" way.A scenario in which some people are completely unimpressed by ""The Conjouring"" while others consider it great seems a likely outcome. The market is stale for new horror ideas, while studios making horror films understand that familiarity gets people into the theater. So those looking for something novel won't find it, but those who want the tropes of the genre will be more than pleased.Wan in particular knows all the tropes, and better than anyone, he milks them for all of their worth. He does so with incredible technical prowess, but more importantly, the ability to understand the audience's instincts -- what they're thinking and expecting.For fans who know exactly what Wan offers them, consider ""The Conjuring"" on par with ""Insidious,"" only a little more cliché and with a more intriguing mystery.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

Exciting,"I was impressed normally by this movie.Of course the based on reality scenario, the screams of people and the effects of scenes were really frightening, haunting and also a good reason for people to watch this thrilling movie.However It wasn't the devils or exorcism that made me nervous and excited in this movie, it was the unexpected movements of people and a family's struggle to survive.Secondly and personally I believe in devils and their bad effects on human but this doesn't mean that devils seizing of human body and force them to do something in order to reach their goals.In normal life you can't see something like that.So there shouldn't be any horror movie talks about devil exorcism any more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Entertaining for what says is there,"Demonic possessions and hauntings are real and happen all the time – at least that's what the Warren family says. Here's the strange thing, it's not clear to whether the purpose of this movie was to terrify / entertain us or to make us believe that ghosts are real. Majority would say that the intention was for both reasons but that depends on one's experiences now doesn't it? Bring in someone who's not used to the horror genre and they'll believe anything you say,....but bring in regular gore hounds and nothing will phase them. I guess the whole concept is what you (the viewer) make it out to be.Anyway, this is the story of two famous paranormal investigators of the last quarter of the 20th century, Lorraine and Ed Warren. When a family named the Perrons' move into a farmhouse, they begin to experience some very strange things about the house. Once noticed, they become terrified and call on the Warrens to help them find out if there really are ghosts in their house. That's where things become high strung. And in some cases too much for even the Warrens. Unfortunately that's because they took on a case they didn't see coming. Yes, even ghost hunters have their off days.Acting wise, all the characterizations are believable; even for the no name actors who play the Perron family. But the two actors who do show that they were the right actors for the job was Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the Warren couple respectively. It's not that they gave their characters charm, but more on a human characteristic level. Although they could communicate with spirits, audiences will be able to feel that even with their special abilities, the risk is still high. That's the scary part that's what makes it dangerous. Both of their performances were the most memorable.What may surprise viewers and fans alike is how little the violence appears throughout the running time. And although it's directed by James Wan, the guy behind the brutal Saw (2004) franchise, the basis of this movie's horror is in the suspense - not gore. That's the goal; suspense equals terror. This is how one makes a scary horror film. But, that doesn't mean the scenes that were set up to be terrifying, were as terrifying as it was said to be. A lot the scare scenes involve the derivative action of sudden loud noises and long pauses of silence that lead up to the sudden loud noises. The typical scream tactic. It does work in some areas though but most events are predictable. I only jumped twice and I honestly was expecting a much stronger, scarier presentation.However, the scenes although typical in scares, did manage to pull off some very creepy imagery. Some of the sounds are really skin crawling - like old rickety wood cracking because it hasn't been moved in years. Or a door slowly opening with a very light creaking noise - oooh boy. The makeup looked good too. It some ways it resembled that of the Evil Dead (2013) possessed victims. The location of filming also helped with the imagery element. The house looked worn and petrified of dead souls to begin with. And lastly, Joseph Bishara's score to the film has a middling to effective listening experience. He definitely creates a dreaded theme with elongated counter string chords but it lacks the polish of other accomplished horror scores. Bishara's score is more bare bones than it is filling. It is an effective horror film but it's not as terrifying as it is said to be.The musical score and scares lack the terrifying trait that fans may want, but the acting by the main leads are solid and the imagery is downright cringe worthy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Conjuring conjures fear,"The Conjuring manages to be terrifying without being gory, which I suppose could be considered a feat, given the irredeemable amount of bloody body parts we have to put up with in today's horror films. I make it a rule to avoid horror movies in general, not only because I get frightened easily, but because horror films too often sacrifice important narrative and technical elements, including character, emotion, style, and coherence in favour of cheap thrills (often fuelled by gratuitous violence) that serve no purpose other than to keep you up at night, fearing that whatever was in the film is inexplicably standing at the foot of your bed. The Conjuring borders precariously on this edge between a solid film and a pointless, incoherent scarefest. However, a few neat scenes, a thrilling conclusion, and a surprising effectiveness without resorting to gore save it from succumbing to the tropes of its miserably empty genre.The Conjuring revolves around a threatening demonic presence due to numerous deaths on a section of land that once belonged to a witch. A family of seven (five girls) moves into this house. It follows standard haunted-house film structure, as seemingly inconspicuous events (birds flying into the windows, death of the dog, doors creaking, mother waking up with bruises, etc.), eventually lead to more and more terrifying events. The buildup is done quite well, evoking simple fright, each jump scare or sinister occurrence building upon the last. There is one especially terrifying scene where the mother is lured into the cobweb-filled basement, and the most thrillingly simple, yet petrifying happening occurs, demonstrating that she is not alone in the dark, silent basement. I, for one, was scared out of my mind.Eventually, the family is forced to call upon ""demonologists"" Ed and Lorraine Warren, who arrive at the house with an assistant and a police officer, setting up a paranormal monitoring network that is very, almost too reminiscent of the one in Poltergeist. Lorraine, who is a clairvoyant, begins to unearth the house's dark secrets, slowly piecing together the puzzle as the supernatural presence becomes more and more threatening, not just to the family, but eventually extending to the Warrens as well, introducing an unexpected, yet highly appreciated risk factor.The Conjuring is fun, if your idea of fun is revelling in gleeful fright. It has enough jump scares (some of which are admittedly awesome) and suspenseful moments to keep your eyes fixed towards the screen, anticipating, yet dreading what is going to happen next. The execution is slick, and the story, while borrowing from other horror films, manages to be unpredictable and fun. The dialogue, however, is quite often lacking in substance, relying on basic verbal clichés that occasionally make no sense given the circumstances. There is way too much on random Satanic based information and bits about the power of God. Also, the film has a difficult time establishing the mood, as it bounds haplessly from serenity to dread, often for no reason at all. But what eventually separates the film from other entries in the genre is its thrilling and surprisingly emotional ending, which includes a ridiculously awesome line, and an even more ridiculously awesome monster reveal. And of course, the ambiguous ending. I hate ambiguous endings.But what is extremely irksome about The Conjuring, is its refusal to set rules that make even the slightest bit of sense. We are left in the dark (so to speak) as to the abilities of the ghosts, the intentions of some of the ghosts, and their allegiances are so frantic and unspecified, that it is thoroughly impossible to understand why the heck everything is happening the way it is.For example: Ghosts have telekinesis. Everyone knows that. So why (if the ghost's intention was truly to kill everyone) not use your obvious telekinetic powers to chuck a knife into someone's head WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING? This is one of many galling plot holes that haunt the film .The Conjuring has to be the most frightening film that I have ever seen, but that does not in and of itself make it a good movie, because it is fraught with plot holes and poor dialogue. What makes it a good film (and saves it from its genre) is its glorious simplicity, its ability to elicit fear without resorting to gore, and its awesome ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Decent for the genre....,So my Conjuring-verse journey continues with the one that kicked the whole franchise off. I found it to be a fairly decent horror flick and it held my interest for most of the runtime although I do feel it could have been a tad shorter as it did drag a bit for me in parts.The performances were all pretty good. I enjoyed the chemistry between the Warren couple although I do wish we got more on Lorraine's trauma but maybe future installments. That story thread wasn't quite as impactful as I think they were going for. I also found the family to be believable particularly the younger child actors.I didn't find it particularly scary but it did hold my interest as they slowly put the pieces together when figuring out what was going on. I did feel some genuine albeit light moments of tension despite the obvious jump scare that would often follow. The music and cinematography were again overall done well and added to the film.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Those are some scary productions.The Conjuring is supposedly based upon a true story about a couple that are a demonologist and a clairvoyant who attempt to help a large family in rural Rhode Island rid themselves of an evil entity.I don't know if it was the innocence of the family or the wickedness of the apparitions but this movie gave me the chills. The family was a blue collar family that found a deal on a home. They comprised two parents and five lovely young daughters. Involving children in possessions and hauntings is nothing new, it always ups the creep factor. The Conjuring involved five kids and a mother and father thereby having wealth of hosts.The Conjuring wasn't all that unique but it was done really well. They had jump scares and escalating paranormal activity like every other scary movie but they made a better production of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Awesome Movie!,"A well done scary movie! From the start & to the end it kept me occupied, well not in my seat though! The movie has a lot of jump scares! :D Seriously awesome story based on true events & by far my favorite! It all seemed so real while watching the movie & I even got emotional & cried in the end! :') The audience I was among also enjoyed the movie as they screamed in terror, laughed hysterically during jump scares & they clapped & applaud because they thoroughly enjoyed the movie like me!

"Psycho, The Omen, Halloween...And Now The Conjuring","I went into this movie with a lot of skepticism. Faith-based scare- flicks rarely work for me, and I'd heard from a few people that it wasn't worth all the hype around it.Boy, were they WRONG!This film is the best-executed horror film I have seen in a long while. From the acting to the expertly-done effects to the unique storytelling, every moment was riveting, chilling, and utterly perfect.There is no contributing factor that makes anything better than any other thing in the film. The acting doesn't surpass the effects, the cinematography doesn't overshadow the script. This is a rare film where every element works in total unison to create a ridiculously cohesive and utterly terrifying film.10/10 - An absolute must-watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"I personally did not enjoy it, but it is very well made","This is perhaps the 10th iteration of an Amityville Horror film I have seen, and I happen to prefer the old ones. This didn't even feature the iconic home (for legal reasons, I'm sure.)
But I can't fault the movie too much for my own personal disappointment because it was incredibly well-made.
The cast is fantastic, and the acting is also very good. It is shot very well, which adds to the suspense throughout. The effects are very good, and the soundtrack adds to the enjoyment of the film. I'd still recommend it to others, but I won't be seeing it again given the choice to see other more interesting ghost/haunting films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Horror Genre has a new Come Back!,"My rating should give a good picture of how I felt about the movie as a whole. I must admit, I have not been that sincerely freaked out in a very, very long time. There was an absolutely amazing atmosphere throughout, and instead of the simple, childish jump-scares that we have been so accustomed to over the past decade. The characters are very likable, for the most part, and it even tends to work a bit of humor here and there to relieve the tension every once in a while. Then it draws you right back into a world of mystery and mischief. It would be bad to give away too much of the film. If you are looking for something to scare you inside and out, get this movie immediately, close out all of the light, and grab your teddy bear.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The scares that does not depend so much on blood,"(2013) The Conjuring
HORROR / SUSPENSEIt's basically centers on the Perron family of four daughters moving into a house unaware that it's possessed. And at the same time, we're also introduced to a couple of ghost hunters, a husband and wife team by the names of Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed(Patrick Wilson) Warren. They've had just quarantined a very scary looking doll who was said to be possessed, and are now speaking on front of seminars and universities. The first sign that the new Perron family house is possessed was that the family dog refused to get in there, and is later found dead practically days later after moving in. They don't call the police, but the youngest daughter started a liking to this very old music box. And whenever this girl plays the music box, she begins to talk to it. The Perron family and the Warren couple are eventually going to meet with satisfying results. Although, I thought the film was most enjoyable, one of the things the film refuse to address is what became of the house afterwards, since if it were me, I'd burn it down to the ground.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Modern classic,"Horror done the right wayNot a fan of modern horror movies but this absolutely ticked my boxes. Based on a true story, it builds the suspense whilst providing plenty of jump scares which are a must for me. Also impressively setting up a backstory and future franchise in the process. Granted I don't think much of the spin off movies at all but the conjuring movies are very good as a rule. This very much plays out like the amityville horror and I haven't done my research as it could well be the same true story that was based on.

The best!,"I actually kind of accidentally went to see 'The Conjuring'. My father told me about a scary movie about a haunted doll he thought was very frightening, and my stepmother thought it was this movie. It appeared to be the spin-off 'Annabelle' he was talking about, but before I discovered that, 'The Conjuring' had already put a spell on me.The first time I made the mistake of watching it alone in the middle of the night. You shouldn't do that... You really shouldn't do that! It scared the hell out of me and I had to watch it five times again before I actually could say I had seen the complete movie.Even though the effects are amazing, the scariest little thing to me was the clapping hands on the basement staircase.It is said this movie is based on a true story and that can be possible, probable, but I seriously doubt these events could happen to a person or a family this way.Vera Farmiga has become one of my favorite actresses because of her part in this movie, and also because of her performance as Norma Bates in the 'Bates Motel' TV-series.'The Conjuring' is perfect all the way and -to me- the best I've ever seen concerning supernatural horror-flicks.

Well made horror film,"The Conjuring is a well filmed, well acted, and yes, a well written film. Vera Faminga and Patrick Wilson have fantastic chemistry in this movie, and they acted very well here, they should be very proud of their performances. I love the visuals in this movie, the visuals really are high quality! Also, Lili Taylor was great here, she was a great casting decision, the casting all around in the conjuring is spot on. James Wan did a great job directing this film! The scares here aren't as scary as I thought it would be, which was slightly disappointing, but there still were some good scares none the less. The exorcism scene really was great! Scary/creepy visuals run rampant through that scene, which was how it was supposed to be! Overall, this film was a pretty well made film, but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be, but that doesn't mean it was bad. 7/10 for The Conjuring.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Which is scarier!?!!?: A house full of girls or a house full of ghosts? Or my review of The Conjuring,"""The Conjuring"" is a... well, is a great film. Much like my review on ""Elysium"" I was going to say ""is a great horror film"" but unlike my reserved genre labeling holding back my opinion of praising that film as a ""science fiction film"", this hesitation at such labeling as simply a great 'horror film' is actually in praise of the movie here. Horror films can so easily be dismissed onto the pile of shock gore fest splatter films and the like, that when a real well made scary film comes along, it really does stand out.I read some other review I don't remembers who's but they pointed out the first thing I too noticed. There is an opening prologue of sorts, with it's stark title card, revealing a previous haunting that made this movie have all the earmarks of the aspirations of making a movie to the likes of ""The Exorcist"". While it's fails to deliver on the scale of that horror epic that fact it comes close to that cinematic high mark in terror, is something to commend indeed.Compared to a movie like James Wan's previous excellent Insidious which dealt in parallel universes and plains of existence etc this one was shackled by ""based on"" or ""inspired by"" or whatever they framed this one with the ""true events"" setting. And while that gray area or ""dark"" gray area, if you must, may extend to a lot of leeway in the levitation people and objects etc... there are some things you just want to say are true for sure, like this family had five girls ranging from pre-school to high school age. In fact, the person I saw this with and I were humorously trying to keep track, when they had a shot of four of the girls heading to school and we thought we had it... until we were reminded of the pre-school girl! Any sane scriptwriter would have lessened the madness of the reality in this scenario!But like when the paranormal specialists are brought in along with a local officer the actual mayhem of a simple breakfast among such a crowd was almost comical in presenting this as a real situation. But any comic relief or quite moments were certainly offset with real scares and jumps.As film progresses you actually find time to separate out the girls, understand the foreboding of the paranormal specialist and her history, and the shear stamina of the parents played by Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston who obviously had their hands full even before they bought the to-good-to-be true countryside deal of a house from the bank.(When you buy something ""as is"" in an auction you're probably hoping for some simple water damage not a house full of ghosts...) Anyway the way the interaction of all these people happen really draws you into an investment to liking these people even the paranormal investigators Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson illicit great empathy for them and all the children actresses, and so when one girl starts sleep walking, or the covers are pulled off another, or one sees a little boy in the mirror of a toy, the creepiness factor really builds.Now eventually things build from the simple scare of a night gowned girl suddenly passing in the frame, to objects and people actually being thrown around the house, plus there's ""The Sixth Sense"" like visions people have of past suicides and such, that build up to the real scare of the mother slowly becoming possessed by the evil presence that was supposedly the start of all the others.And while it's true most of the chills and thrills are all done without any blood and gore I suppose it's the gruesome possession and exorcism that really give it it's R rating.The idea of ""specialists"" seems to have garnered weight ever since the creepy little lady in Poltergeist, for instance, even though the investigators Patrick and Vera's characters are based on real ""investigators"" Ed and Lorraine Warren that wasn't important to films like the original ""The Amityville Horror"" movie even though the same two were involved in the case because at that time the only ""specialist"" most people associated with evil in the movies would be a priest.Even though this movie supposedly took place around the same time as original ""The Exorcist"" that movie treated science as baffled and completely inadequate with what cursed little Regan. Whereas this movie incorporates the sympathies of science to assure the couple that they ""aren't going crazy"". With investigative tools of the time: automatic triggering camera, temperature changing sensors, and super sensitive audio equipment etc.. no infrared or ectoplasm thingamajigs of modern day, but you get the idea. But even here, of course, logic, science and all that tries to give the family foothold on sanity are subjected to pure evil that must be cast out with old fashion exorcismThe possessed devil doll from the prologue tying in with the Warren's daughter had some true suspension and horror to it, but was almost was like Wan had bitten off a bit more than he could chew unlike the mom who bit off a piece of the police officer's cheek causing them to throw sheet over her head..ha!comic relief So even though the daughter subplot was a stretch, and the ending is a bit extreme in it's chaotic deliverance from evil for the family as children are trapped beneath floor boards or in the car or I forget where all, the unrivaled suspense that got us there to the turmoil and whirlwind of an ending is truly terrifying and extremely well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Worst ad for the Catholic Church ever,"At no point was this movie scary. Every moment was entirely predictable. If a scary movie is not scary then what is it besides a failure? Sure it was written well enough I suppose would be the only positive to this movie. You will have to turn your brain off though, which is what they were aiming for to instill the fear of God in you, when stupid moments happen such as demons teleporting through metal. I am very certain after seeing this film that every exorcism movie is just an attempt to scare people into becoming religious. The oh so subtle nuances such as ""We're not what you would call a religious family."" ""You might want to change that."" and at the end of the movie, I am not sure if anyone caught this but there was a giant quote telling people to worship God and fear the Devil. Not to mention the convenience that you cannot move out of a haunted house, you need a priest to bless it. I guess the Catholic Church never grew out of the Renaissance days of forcing its need. If you think this review focused too much on the religious part then avoid this movie because they will shove it down your throat.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The conjuring,"I'm an avid horror fan. Lately I've been thinking there isn't much that can scare me (though Sinister got under my skin). I appreciate James Wan's films, I love the first Saw, Insidious was a damn good modern ghost story, but like all reviews have stated for it, the movie kinda loses it's momentum in the final act.The Conjuring is better, scarier, and more tense than Insidious. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's one of the best horror movies of the last 5 or 10 years. It goes back to the classic rule of horror film making, never show the bad guy fully to your audience. Plus this movie knows suspense, I tell you, I almost threw a water bottle at the screen from sheer terror once the scare finally happened. There are no fake jump scares, the movie earned an R rating without any blood, sex, or profanity, it's all from the terror that this movie builds upon.Not only is the movie scary, but as a film itself, it's almost a masterpiece. The script, acting, direction, style, tone, etc were all simply top notch. Wan's camera-work here is by far his best out of any of his movies. The choice to set the movie in the 70s was a stroke of genius as it feels so authentic and all the more real. If this story were set in the present, it simply wouldn't be as a effective or scary. The 70s style film making, costuming, and hair styling are a great throwback to likes of The Exorcist & The Amityville Horror.Though there are a few (extremely minor) flaws, such are length, repetitiveness, and a resolution that happens way too fast. I don't care, every horror movie (or movie in general) has it's flaws. There will never be a perfect horror movie, if there is one, I haven't seen it yet. But all I know is James Wan's The Conjuring is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time, and it's been a really long time that a movie has scared me this badly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Conjuring,"The Conjuring stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren, two paranormal investigators that are working to help a family being terrorized by a dark presence in their farmhouse. Since this movie came out in July of 2013 I have seen it 4 times, and each time it gets better and better. The Conjuring is the best horror movie to come out in years, and when you think about its not too different from anything that has come out recently. The concept is no different from two other decent horror movies in recent years, Insidious and Paranormal Activity, which both have a family's house being haunted by ghosts. But this one is so different and so much better. James Wan, the Director, who also directed Insidious, is the best horror director working today. That is because he understands the genre so well and knows how to make an actually scary movie, without the stupid jump scares. And yes, he does do it on occasion but only when it is actually earned and is not just a harmless character standing behind a door, but when it is actually something really scary. The Horror genre has changed so much through the years going from Monster movies to Slasher movies in the 80's and 90's and now the Paranormal movies. And in my opinion the whole genre is kind of fading away and there is really only 1 or 2 good ones every couple of years. And it is safe to say The Conjuring is it and definitely deserves a viewing from anyone who is a fan of horror. 10/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This movie works because the history is not that dumb. The script plays it safe, hitting all the beats from an average hounted house film, but without the stupidity those movies come with.
The actors do a great job, none of them suck, Patrick Wilson being the standout for me. Maybe the child actors are weak in moments, but never in a really low level.
The cinematography is beautiful, as usual in James Wan movies. There are some very memorable shots here.
The blend of old school and modern horror really is interesting, there are not many jumpscares. Thank god.

I wish this movie stayed good.,"The conjuring starts of with a really scary scene wich directly gets you interested and just a bit scared. You're afraid of what's to come. From there we see a lot of building up wich is also really terrifying. What is done really well is making you afraid of the unknown. Some shots show just a bit of the room and slowly shows the rest, sometimes something completely random and scary happens. There are also some great jump scares that have just the right amount. Although, after the building up the movie goes downhill. There are some cute moments but there are way less scary things and when they happen they are not scary ( In my opinion). The ending also is a bit quick and doesn't feel like the horrifying thing we were waiting for. But there are three strong scenes in the third act.

"Effective and good looking, but nothing new","The characters are likeable and the movie establishes itself pretty quickly, with some very effective scares and spooks. For anyone who like the typical 'family moves into haunted house' type movie, The Conjuring will be an enjoyable watch.But many movies like it have been made and The Conjuring doesn't add that much we haven't seen before. The one aspect I did like is how the psychics that get involved really get involved and the stakes are raised considerably during the movie.But like others have said, it's set in the 70's to make it work the way it does and this is mainly because horror movie writers and directors will need to get creative to make horror for the current age. Setting it in the 70's allows for all the familiar tropes and makes for a nostalgic horror environment. Asian movies like Ring show that there is room for something new and modern, so I don't agree that setting it in the 80's or 70's is a requirement for the genre.A niggle I had with The Conjuring is that the tone shifts quite a lot. After some considerable buildup, the movie loses a lot of steam and even though it does build up after that, it's a lot slower and I felt it never quite achieved the atmosphere it has about a third in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Real life scares,"Strangely compelling, ""The Conjuring"" and its sequels are not scary because of the frequent (limp and heavily telegraphed) jump scares, or the generic, factory-made ""spooky atmosphere"". Rather, the scares come from imagining Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the real-life Ed and Lorraine Warren, peddling their particular style of supernatural religious hokum to people desperate for explanations of unsettling events. As they confidently explain the laws of demonic possession to people struggling with domestic turmoil, the gleams of zealotry in their eyes send a shiver up the spine.

A chilling horror experience,"""The Conjuring"" is a masterfully crafted horror film that combines suspense, a chilling atmosphere, and a compelling storyline to deliver a memorable viewing experience. Directed by James Wan, the movie follows the real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, as they take on one of their most terrifying cases.The film excels in building tension, using a blend of eerie sound design, unsettling visuals, and well-timed jump scares to keep the audience on edge. The farmhouse setting adds to the sense of isolation and dread, creating an almost palpable atmosphere of fear. Wilson and Farmiga deliver strong performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their roles, while the supporting cast, including Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston, enhances the film's emotional weight.""The Conjuring"" stands out in the horror genre for its effective storytelling and character development, making it more than just a series of scares.

Opinion of a nonbeliever,"I don't believe in ghosts, demonic possession, God or the supernatural, but I do believe in good story telling and can enjoy supernatural horror if it's well done.The Conjuring starts very well if somewhat typically with a family arriving at there new home and strange things happening. The mood is built successfully with creepy camera angels movements and very good music and sounds. The actors are all very good including the children and we do care about them which is crucial in a film like this. After the very effective setting of a creepy mood we bring in the experts and this is where is becomes a bit slow and plodding as well as overtly Christian. The religious messaging is way to explicit, but if I set that aside the story gradually picks up again and we get some effective scares along the fairly formulaic way. Yes, it is formulaic. We have seen this before, but it is better packaged than usual and combined with the music, cinematography and acting it is still well worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Maybe fun if you're religious.,"It starts up pretty good and interesting but you'll soon figure out it's just a religious boring cliché after cliché movie. I mean, if you're an atheist like myself, these types of movies doesn't really get scary because we don't believe in this nonsense in the first place. Sure, I might lack imagination or something but I've seen it all before. Although I had high hopes in the beginning that maybe it would finally be a movie that shows something different from demons/ghosts/dark spirits and such religious boring stuff. Is it that difficult to come up with something new and believable?I was going to give this movie a 3 out of 10 just for the first 20-30 minutes that actually is pretty cozy, but nah, In total it's worth nothing more than a 1. It could be I'm fed up with illogical and stupid movies or that I'm not just that gullible.So as a conclusion I must say that you should probably only watch this flick if you're a child or religious.Peace out / TrollBob",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Welcome to the hell on earth,"The Conjuring is a interesting film. It is a unoriginal story about a Perron family of seven who buy an old house in Rhode Island from auction. Like all old houses, this house has an interesting histroy, which in this case, comes to haunt the family. Unable to find any logical explanation nor solution to the paranormal activities taking place in the house and taking toll on her family and unable to leave to the economic reasons, the mother seeks help from the Warrens, who have made name for themselves as paranormal investigators or demonologists.At first, Warrens are reluctant to help, believing it to be just another ghost story or hoax, but seeing how scared the mother is and since there are children in danger, they decide to visit the family. From the beginning, it is clear, that Perron family is not making things up, as the evil, unhuman presence is felt from the start. However, even the Warrens themselves are not prepared for what is waiting for them.However, The Conjuring is not just another ghost film. The real antagonist is only revealed in the end and its plot, its characters, its special effects, its horror creates a horrifying experience and from time to time makes you think, this may not have a good ending. This makes the Conjuring even more scarier, lets say, than the Exorcist, in which you know and see the antagonist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Enjoyed the Movie, But Not Scary","I really enjoyed the movie, but I was not frightened one bit. I enjoyed some of the tense moments and the unexpected ""entities"" that popped in and out, but the movie itself was not scary. It appears that Hollywood can no longer produce a truly horrifying movie since the Exorcist. But compared to the swill that is being passed off as horror, the Conjuring is pretty darn good. I just want to point out something that really pisses me off when it comes to horror movies. First, why does every demon possession movie have to get the Catholic Church's permission in order to address a demon?? What about a Methodist church or a Jehovah Witness temple?? Do demons only respond to a Catholic priest or to a crucifix?? And why does everyone assume that all demons can understand or speak Latin?? What about demons that may be affiliated with a Buddhist temple or a Hindu shrine?? What language would be spoken to them?? Second, why do people believe that witches worship Satan?? Witches practice a religion that worship nature, not Satan. It appears that whenever a movie mentions ""witch"", they pull out Satanism, evil spells, hexes, and possession. Witches adhere to the ""Do No Harm"" mantra. The movie itself was enjoyable, but it would be refreshing to have a horror movie that does not base its premise on a fallacious religion that not everyone follows. More and more people are turning away from Christianity and maybe Hollywood should too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This will always be one of the best horror movies,"This is the best horror movie that has been released for a long time. The story is great, also how it is based on a true story in a way. This movie is both scary and fun. The acting is good, and if your looking to find a good horror movie then this is it. There are several scenes where you might not know whats going on and then you find out that it is something very terrifying. Everything is smart, and all of it is pretty simple, but this is just a great movie. There are sequels that arene't good, and this is probably the scariest movie from a long time.

One of my favourite modern horror films of all time!,"The conjuring is based on a true story from the cases of Ed and Lorraine Warren which in my opinion all of there story's are true. The movie tells the story of a family with about 5 daughters who move into a new house when soon strange things start happening when they find out the last few owners had the same thing happening to them and it's all because of this witch that built the house and killed herself and cursed all the owners that would move into the house and they call Ed and Lorraine Warren played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmigia to stop and get rid of the evil spirits haunting the house. I watched this film and thought it was crap but then I decided to watch to watch it again and honestly I really liked it,the movie had really good actors like Vera Farmigia who starred in Orphan,up in the air and higher ground and I really liked Joey King who played one of the daughters who's from Oz,White House down and this movie. The conjuring is a brilliant horror film and one of my bests. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
When Too Much Hype Happens to a Decent Movie,"The nearly rapturous reviews from critics who I normally trust touting this as one of the scariest movies they'd ever seen had my expectations high. What a let down it was, then, when I actually saw the film.""The Conjuring"" does have some satisfyingly creepy moments, especially in its first half hour when we start to get only inklings of something evil lurking in a haunted house. But director James Wan, whose claim to fame is launching the ""Saw"" franchise, is far too literal and gives his audience far too little credit for having imaginations to sustain that creepiness across the length of the entire film. Instead, he decides to go all out, resorting to shock scares, special effects and histrionics, resulting in a climax that's more chaotic than it is scary. An exorcism that comprises most of the film's final moments is especially silly.Vera Farmiga, as a paranormal expert, stands out as the film's best asset, using her considerable talents as an actress to make far more out of a stock horror movie role than the film probably deserves.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Nothing new,"While I do think this was defiantly a good film, and I did enjoy it, it didn't bring anything new to the table. Everything here I have seen before and the film follows a familiar horror plot. One thing that does set it apart from most horror films is the presence of interesting character's and a complete story arc. Another negative though, is that for me the film failed to build tension or create a strong sense of atmosphere.

Spooky horror movie,"This takes place in 1971 and is based on a true story. A family with five daughters moves into this huge old house in the middle of nowhere. Almost immediately things start going wrong. There's a bad smell in some of the rooms, all the clocks in the house stop at 3:07am, the mother wakes up with strange bruises on her arms and legs and there's loud banging heard. The couple hires a husband/wife team of demonologists to check it out...and find out things are worse than they thought.This movie does work. There were many times in here when me (and the audience) jumped or screamed out loud. It builds slowly but it works because you get to know and care about the family. When things DO go overboard at the end it's all the more shocking because you care about the characters. The acting is good across the board. Patrick Wilson and Ron Livingston are OK in their roles but Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor are superb in theirs. There's no nudity, sex or gore but some blood and plenty of scares with loud noises and things suddenly happening. Also the 1970s hairstyles and clothes are frightening too!:) Even though it is scary it goes on just a little bit too long and has its dull moments. I give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The right atmosphere,"The Conjuring is a great and genuinely frightening horror movie that, given the right atmosphere, can scare anyone in to their deepest core. The story follows a case taken on by paranormal investigators Ed & Lorraine Warren in which they will attempt to rid a family of a demonic presence that threatens to destroy their lives. Congratulations are very much in order to the people who made the movie what it is ranging from the isolated location and its gloomy surroundings. The visuals involving the demons are also very well presented and make you gasp at what you are seeing. The players stick to their roles and give the performances the film needs to succeed.

Awesome Movie,I watched this movie in the night and i was really terrified after watching this. One of the best horror movies i have ever seen in my life and an excellent script. The entire depiction of the time when the family moved in the haunted house and the way it progresses has been screened well. Many horror movies don't have a solid backing and reasoning in the storyline. This one is different and really great. Must watch if you love horror movies and don't blame if it scares you to move around in the house esp. if you watch it during the night. I am eagerly waiting for Conjuring -II.

I'm curious why people liked this movie,"And why, in almost all these so called scary movies, ""Satan"" behaves like an immature child playing tricks and everyone in the movie falls for it. I mean really, these are petty jokes by what's supposed to be this terrifying being.Think about it. Loud or soft noises, stuff lifting into the air and moving around, scary faces and the like.In the end, the movie seemed rather ridiculous rather than frightening.That being said, the Warrens are and always have been two of the most annoying ghost hunters in the world. To them, absolutely everything is satanic if it's supernatural in nature in any possible way.And that room of haunted stuff?

Simple but good haunted house horror,"Horror movies don't scare me and this was no exception for me personally, but I can still appreciate a well made movie. And I guess this movie was pretty effective at what it sets out to do. The premise is almost as simple as a horror movie can get, a pretty basic haunting story, but it moves along and builds up the tension at a good pace.The paranormal researchers are an interesting touch, with the psychic but susceptible wife, and the husband who's more in control, but lacks his wife's supernatural senses. I really liked them as protagonists.If I had one complaint, it's that the dad of the family in the house seemed unusually calm and underwhelmed much of the time. I'd expect him to freak out a little bit more, seeing his family in danger.Anyway, I found it pretty enjoyable, even though I don't get scared by horror movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Did I miss something?,"I love, love, horror movies, I grew up watching them, my parents didn't care what sorta movies I saw as a kid so I'm used to watching all sorts of movies. So once I saw the preview to The Conjuring months ago I was so excited to see it because just the preview alone gave me the chills. I kept nagging my boyfriend for months about how close July 19th was and how much critics were saying that this movie was super scary and one of the best. He doesn't care much for the sort of movies I watch most of the time especially the gory/horror ones which I get, they're stupid but I can't help but be entertained by them, since that's the point of movies. And what made me more excited about The Conjuring was that it was getting great reviews which is almost unheard of for horror movies now a days and I told my boyfriend that critics were giving this movie 5 stars and such. July 19th finally arrived and I was excited and my boyfriend not so much since he was either going to kill me for making him go and be traumatized for life or for wasting money on something stupid. After the movie finished he said well that was dumb, he wasn't even scared in fact he said it reminded him of The Exorcist/Poltergeist none of which he had seen until I forced him to. He said he was glad he had seen those two movies because it made The Conjuring less scary and he said he had seen The Conjuring already by watching those movies. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think The Conjuring was a bad movie, I just wasn't scared, in fact once we got home I had forgotten about it, I was expecting not being able to sleep for a few nights. Did I miss something? Was I expecting too much? Did I let all the reviews and anticipation get to me? I'm happy that a horror movie has finally gotten great reviews perhaps now it'll be a turning point for these sorts of films. However, I just left disappointed with The Conjuring, which is a shame.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Average spooky house story based on the writings of two demonologist who many believe were frauds,"""The Conjouring"" is a run-of-the-mill ghost story that pretty much follows the same story format that Stuart Rosenburg's 1979 film, ""The Amityville Horror"" did. A happy family buys a house to start a new life and quickly find out that the house is not haunted, but possessed by demons. Things in the house start moving (or falling), everyone hears noises, doors slam, framed pictures break, and the children (all five of them) start seeing shadowy figures and are sometimes attacked by these figures. Even the youngest little girl befriends one of the demons. As I said, much like the 1979 film, ""The Amityville Horror"".Without going into too much more detail (spoilers), eventually the infamous demonologists, Ed and Lorraine Warren, are brought onto the scene after a 30 second discussion with the mother of the tormented family (yes, it really is about 30 seconds long, equating to ""My house is haunted"" and ""Okay, we'll stop by"").Obviously, when the infamous Ed and Lorraine Warren get to the house, we discover that things are more serious than we imagined. In essence, Lorraine Warren (with her special ESP-Psychic-Paranormal-Religious-Ghost Hunting abilities) announces that the house is not haunted....but POSSESSED! Everywhere she looks, there is a demon. Even the trees have demons and dead people. And now Lorraine Warren discovers that the demons really want to possess the family. YIKES! After that proclamation, we are treated to (as mentioned above) the run-of-the-mill scary house trying to torment (or kill) the people inside the house. There is no tension, no buildup, no horror, just jump-scare after jump-scare. Quite frankly, if you have seen ""The Amityville Horror"", then you have seen ""The Conjouring"".Even though the film is largely forgettable (at least in this reviewer's opinion), the film was a hit when it was released, and judging by most of the opinions of IMBD, the film is still favored to this day. Although I am not trying to be critical of my fellow reviewers and their opinions, I am somewhat baffled by the praise of this film and its success. Yes, director James Wan put out a successful film, and he should be credited with making the studio a lot of money, but although it is shot well, the film is pretty much unoriginal. Throughout the film, you can almost predict what will happen in every scene, down to the point of knowing when the ""jump-scare"" will occur. Nevertheless, critique aside, the film was a financial success, so therefore, it was a successful film (which doesn't necessarily mean it was a good film).On an aside, another point of the film is that one of the main advertising selling points is that it is based on ""true events"" or ""a true story"", taken from the documented writings of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Mrs. Warren was a technical adviser on the film.... Mr. Warren died in 2006). In reality, the chance of ""The Conjouring"" being a true story is non-existent. For people who ended up researching (or will research) the work of the demonologists, Ed and Lorraine Warren, they found that almost all of their cases were debunked (including ""The Conjouring"" case). In fact, the one case that the Warrens are most famous for, the Amityville case, was eventually exposed as being completely made up by Ronnie Defoe's lawyer, Mr. And Mrs. Lutz, and Jan Anson. Obviously, the Warrens are considered by many (and I mean MANY) to be nothing more than frauds who exploited frighten people for financial gain. This is the reason why in the film the Warrens are shown lecturing at a number of colleges, as well as showing one family why there house isn't haunted. It was to give the Warrens credibility, the appearance of being sincere, since in real life, their credibility was shaky at best. In fact, to release the rights of the Warrens' story regarding ""The Conjouring"", Lorraine Warren insisted that the contract stipulated that no discussion of the Warrens being continuously debunked, as well as the charges of Ed Warren's domestic abuse and sexual ""activities"", would be presented or allowed in the film. Now, I am not saying that the Warrens' personal lives, or possible fraud, should make the film any less successful. But the film should only be looked upon as pure entertainment, and nothing more.Again, regardless of its success, and the abundance of positive reviews, I believe ""The Conjouring"" is a well-shot, but extremely mundane and predictable, haunted house movie. Probably for most people, it is the kind of film that you would watch and forget about it by the next day. James Wan should be applauded for making a successful film, but for financial reasons only.If people are wanting to see haunted scary stories, I would suggest films like ""The Haunting"" from 1963, ""The Changling"" from 1980, or ""The Blair Witch Project"" from 1999 (the film did advertise itself as being a true event documentary until the directors came forward to admit the film was a ""mockumentary""). As far as ""The Conjouring"" is concern, you will find nothing but routine jump-scares, the same scares that you would find in any Halloween Haunting House that you see pop up around your area in the month of October each and every year.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Warren Files,"Greetings again from the darkness. The overdose of reality TV the past decade has resulted in at least a couple of Ghost Hunter type shows. Surely you have stumbled on at least one of these. Director James Wan starts this latest haunted house adventure off with the all-too-familiar ""Based on a True Story"" and then proceeds to fill the next couple of hours with scene after scene of horror film staples ... things we have jumped at many times over the years. However, this one is bumped up a notch thanks to atmosphere, direction and acting ability.The Perron family has moved to the country for a ""fresh start"" and here is what we learn:1. If the family dog won't enter the new house, then neither should you or your kids. It's time to move out. How many dogs aren't thrilled to follow the kids right in through the front door?2. If all the clocks (electric and wind-up) stop at exactly the same time, it's time to move out.3. If you stumble on a boarded up cellar/basement, just leave it boarded up ... and it's time to move out.4. If multiple birds fly full speed into your house, breaking their necks, it's time to move out.5. If your daughter discovers an antique toy that carries around as she talks to her new imaginary friend ... it's time to move out.6. If, over two consecutive evenings, your sleepwalking daughter bangs her head into the armoire left by the previous owners, it's time to move out.7. Having 5 daughters seems to make parenting exceptionally difficult. This is no reason to move out of the house.8. Playing blindfolded 'Hide and Clap' is not an appropriate game when you live in a 3 level home. This is no reason to move out, just find a game that doesn't require a blindfold.9. If you ever have to call demonologists to your home, there is no need to get defensive about not being a religious family. Just move out of the house.Director Wan gives us tastes of the haunted house/possession Big 3: The Exorcist, Poltergeist and Amityville Horror. It's not at the level of these, but it's certainly better than most horror films of the past two decades ... at least we don't get any stupid teenagers wandering through the woods. In fact, this one plays right off our natural tendency to feel safe and secure while surrounded by our family within the confines of our own home. The biggest scares come from the moments we are most relaxed.There are no spinning heads or pea soup, and the gore factor is exceptionally low considering Mr. Wan directed Saw, the film that kicked off torture-fest movie genre. The acting here is really good for a horror film. Patrick Wilson also starred in Wan's Insidious, and here he plays Ed Warren. With his clairvoyant wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga), the Warrens are well known ghostbusters, ghost hunters, demonologists, or whatever label you care to apply. We learn about their most famous case regarding Annaelle the doll, and we also see how they save a trophy from each of their cases ... and store it in their home (a seemingly dumb move). Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston are also strong in their roles as the Perron parents. Another thing I liked was that the kids seem like real kids ... especially the recognizable Joey King and MacKenzie Foy.Horror and Comedy are both at the mercy of personal taste. It takes talent to direct a horror movie and not really introduce any new ""gotcha's"", but still keep the viewers grabbing the armrests. So enjoy the jumps, cover your eyes, and keep in mind ... if your dog won't enter your new house, it's time to move out!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A Gripping, Tense and Overall Masterful Genre Revival","Like comedy, the horror genre can be a very subjective beast, finding or missing its mark as much do to its craft and execution as it does the particular individual who plops themselves into a theater seat. If something isn't scary to someone - someone who earnestly believes that of course - then a fright flick has failed at its core intent. Then we have something like James Wan's The Conjuring, an artful, confident throwback that succeeds in maintaining a high tensile level of pressure on our senses, crafting vital jump scares, a potent human element and all encompassing technical prowess. This is the type of brave, but stripped down horror filmmaking that forces you to analyze other elements besides just the full effectiveness of its frightening intent. Plus it's scary as hell.The Conjuring completes a modern supernatural horror film trifecta started with Wan's own Insidious in 2010 and bridged by last year's unsettling Sinister. With these films the genre has proved that this is far from a dead, now inherently clichéd area of cinema and this effort is perhaps the best of all three. After breaking onto the scene in a big way with the trend setting Saw, the director took a bit of creative detour in the eyes of most with revenge thriller Death Sentence and supernatural doll flick Dead Silence (which is vastly underrated by the way) before rebounding with the aforementioned Insidious. For The Conjuring it seems Wan has taken everything he's learned - congealing everything he's found to be effective - and assembled them exquisitely and with ample new flare to boot.The Conjuring pulls its inspiration from a case file of famed demonologists and paranormal investigators the Warrens, the husband and wife team who's other journeys inspired films such as The Amityville Horror. Here they are played respectively by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga who are now both genre regulars with roles in Insidious and the upcoming Chapter 2 due this year for the gentleman and Orphan and television's Psycho prequel Bates Motel for Farmiga. We've all seen the painful trope of priests, exorcists, psychics and every nut-job in between showing up at the eleventh hour to save a haunted family but the way they're approached in The Conjuring stands as one of the film's greatest strengths.Though it's something that should be completely obvious out of the gate (but still something those inspired by the Warren's stories forget) this is just as much their story as those experiencing the phenomena. In giving nearly as much screen time to this duo as it does the Perron's (a seven family troop lead by actors Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor and their five daughters) we grow and involve with these nine individuals so when things get terrifying we not only feel just as much for everyone on screen but everyone gets a satisfying arc. It's something so rare in most horror films. Though this dynamic is certainly not presented through these two separate camps - the fearful and the experts - but the men bond over their love of cars and their wives and the women over the unfathomable: harm befalling their children. It's a satisfying an utterly untapped approach for the genre.But ""wait, wait"" you proclaim ""this is a horror movie after all, stop talking about the little girls and get to the scares!"" Graciously, somewhat rude reader. The Conjuring is creepy, intermittently nightmarish, tense, gross, unsettling, and in its purest form, scary. This is the type of film that dares you not to hug yourself or laugh nervously in the hopes you deflect some iota of the sensation of primal fear. But these emotions are never extracted in a manipulative fashion and the jump scares are orchestrated effectively through physical objects falling, bumping, banging and generally causing off-putting noises, not blaring, out of context musical chords.The camera work is also fantastic employing every angle imaginable and even some very impressive point of view and upside-down-spin shots. It's easily Wan's best directed effort to date but never one that lets its style eclipse the mood. Similarly his use of sound both in the score (which utilizes your average brooding options as well as sharp, grating notes that call back to horror of days gone by) and practical noises such as a strained rope swinging or a door slamming shut. Again, it all adds to the experience and in eventually pulling of the major frights.Like most fare of this nature, the restrained tension does take a bit of a hit heading into the finale, as subtlety is sacrificed for more overt horror to resolve the story. Thankfully this change in approach is handled with just as much aplomb and also manages to deliver one of the most effective exorcism sequences in recent memory - a victory made all the more notable thanks to the generally overexposed and silly nature of that staple. It's not the perfect ending that the previous acts demanded but one that by no means insults the audience and still remains scary (if in a more upfront manner).Perhaps the biggest compliment I can pay The Conjuring is that it actually deserves a sequel. There are tales of the Warrens left to tell and the acting is uniformly strong enough that revisiting these characters would be more a treat then a chore. It takes a skillful filmmaker to take well worn themes and approaches (while avoiding gore and a high body count to boot) and make them seem as original as ever. Coming from a huge horror buff and one that experiences more disappointments then the average soul can handle, I can earnestly say The Conjuring is one of the best ever and what can serve as a fantastic induction into the genre for the uninitiated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Modern it may be but to call it horror is sacrosant to older films of the genre.,"'Horror' genre film that is set in 1971. It basically follows a large US family moving into a new farmhouse.

Hence the mother at her wits end enlists the help of a paranormal activity couple Ed and Lorraine Warren to purge the activity from the house once and for all.Is it me or do modern horror films just don't do it?

The family hires demonolagists Ed and Lorain Warren to investigate who or what is causing the paranormal activity to happen. They explore the back story behind the house past and I have to say it is very creepy. This movie inspired me to watch the rest of the ""Conjuring Universe"" movies.

"A decent supernatural thriller, despite the sub-par demonic spirits","The Conjuring is decent, especially for the very-difficult-to-do-it-well horror subgenre ""Supernatural Thriller.""The acting was good. But also the script: Early on we are told that this story is based on actual accounts of a haunted house as described by the notorious Roman-Catholic paranormal investigators Ed & Lorraine Warren. (Who also investigated the haunted house Amityville Horror is based on.)Then there is the semi-skeptical Ed Warren, who is quick to acknowledge actual demonic activity is rare, and tries at first to shrug it off as drafts and swelling and old pipes.Reminders that the Catholic Church recognizes demonic spirits and exorcisms in their doctrine also created some plays ability. (Coming from a country where XX % of people identify as Christian, this is important.)Patrick Wilson had a standout performance as Ed Warren; this character was the most interesting & believable. His eyes and demeanor portrayed the internal conflict of a paranormal investigator on the defensive against a world of skeptics, weighing his personal beliefs that he and his wife were chosen by God to fight demons against his instinct to protect her against the evil forces of the universe.You can tell a lot of love went into this movie. The Wilson's demonology room is AWESOME I wish I could poke around in there with all the creepy dolls & toys & supernatural conduits. The old wooden farmhouse was fantastic, especially the hidden passages and exposed copper pipes. The movie is set in 1971, Ed & Lorraine Warren's wardrobe is enviable.My only gripe with The Conjuring were the sub-par malevolent spirits: First of all, the demon possessed doll Anabelle. The whole 5 year old starved for attention, I'm going to write on the walls with a red crayon didn't do it for me.And then there's Bathsheeba, who is supposed to be one bad bitch. I was hoping for something a little more dynamic and psychologically terrifying than the ghost of some 18th century farm wife who is mean only because 'she loves Satan.' Her character was kind of stale.Overall this is a good movie. Solid storytelling, solid acting, and great suspense from the director. The evil spirits, however, were forgettable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Conjuring... Really?,"I waited several months for this to come out on DVD. Talked to several people who have seen it and read several reviews. ""Scariest movie of 2013"" Really??? I spent $14 on the DVD. The reviews said ""You won't be able to sleep!"" I tried my best to stay awake.Girlfriend and I got some Pizza, all geared up for an awesome night together...

Poltergeist meets Exorcism,"The Conjuring is a surprise, and I watched it when I saw a recommendation from the NY Times...Well, it is one of the best of its kind--certainly the finest scare-fest since Poltergeist, but without humor to offset the horror. I actually had a moment or two when I tingled...That experience hasn't happened quite like that since 'The Haunting' (original). True, the middle of the film is shivery delight at its best... But the rest is excellent...even the unexpected new feel for the exorcism scene. 'The Uninvited' and 'The Haunting' may still lead the best in the genre, but this, on second viewing, may seem even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not Animorphs,"It was OK. I got around to watching it after the disappointment of it not being Animorphs.

One of my top 5,"Brilliant. I would give this film a ten but it's not perfect. Then again, what film is? The 1970s film style shots, the variety of horror film features, the acting, the colours. Wan does a fantastic job and I honestly love and recommend this film to anyone who likes horror films. Whether you like hand filmed shots, gore, ghosts or emotion, this movie is for you. Some parts are creepy but fantastically creepy. James Wan is my favourite director and this has got to be his best work, better than Insidious Chapter 2. My only critic is a slight lack of colour variation to represent differing moods during scenes. I guess there is some brightness in the Warrens' house and at the hotel room but there could have just been more during happy scenes at the start of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Absolutely amazing horror!,"This is one amazing horror movie.The story starts in the 70s era with a family moving into a slightly isolated house for a fresh start. From here the story continues with a slow but steady pace introducing the scare elements one by one. Few good jump-scares here and there which definitely scared me! Also couple of comic elements add a perfect touch. Supposedly based on true events of Ed and Lorraine Warren (paranormal investigators), this movie surely gives the chills & scary elements as any horror movie should normally do.Some may say its a been-there-seen-that kind of a movie which is using the same old formulas to create the spooks; but believe me it sure can scare you good.If you are looking for hardcore blood and gore then this movie ain't for you. If you love your horror movies to spook you out, then this movie is definitely worth a watch. I especially enjoyed the exorcism scene, some good action there which is definitely creepy. Wont give more details on here, you got to see it to feel it ;)The ending I believe wasn't as effective as the entire movie, it could've been written better.All in all this is definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen after a long time.

Patrick Wilson (Who most people know from Insidious and The Phantom of the Opera) and Vera Farmiga (Best known for Bates Motel) have amazing chemistry and certainly pull off the power couple. The movie focuses quite a bit on their relationship while still focusing on horror.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Nothing particularly special about this.,"I watched The Conjuring for the first time a few days ago.

An Unexpected Masterwork - James Wan's Best Film Yet,"The Conjuring was a surprisingly excellent film. James Wan really is beginning to create a name for himself in the horror genre. Most garbage out there overplays every possible aspect of it, throwing pointless scares at it's viewers from all angles. In The Conjuring, there wasn't too much of anything - every jump had purpose, every detail really meant something. The first half built suspense properly without any clichéd horror tactics, the end of the first half and a period in the beginning of the second developed the characters, allowing the writing to really flourish, and the rest of the second half was sincerely terrifying. With some excellent cinematography and acting thrown in, this was easily the best horror film in recent memory. 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Over-hyped, but strong and occasionally terrifying","""The Conjuring"", does an excellent job of balancing tense and horrific moments, while simultaneously balancing itself between the ridiculous and the serious. I can say with confidence that although I wasn't truly frightened at any point, this film held me in suspense the entire time. It is important to note that in no way do I actually believe any of this movie, or any story with a similar premise, to be true. The focus in popular culture on ghosts, the supernatural, and the unholy is quite the snooze-fest for me. That being said, I'm open to suspending disbelief for a film about such subjects, provided that it isn't too heavy-handed and preachy. Director James Wan (""Saw"", ""Insidious"") does a masterful job of showcasing the ghost busting Warren couple (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) as a grounded, focused team that at least tries to use scientific methods to back their work up. In this setting, I'm game for that, and although we're given a couple of on-screen notes about the 'true' nature of this story, it isn't shoved down our throat. Again, a balanced approach.The film is centered around a single case the Warrens worked, albeit not the one they are most famous for (the ""The Amityville Horror"" is centered around that particular case). Until I saw this film, I wasn't familiar with the Warrens themselves. Apparently they investigated many 'supernatural' cases, and as the film tells us at the beginning, this one was the 'most harrowing'. Of course it was.The Warrens are at a speaking engagement when they are urged, at the insistence of the mother (Lili Taylor), to come and see an old house in the country that the Perron family of seven has just moved into. Things arehappening at the house that can't be explained. All the clocks stop at 3:07 AM. There are randomly banging doors. The family pet meets doom. The smell of rotting meat is prevalent. Most importantly, the daughters are frightened, and after a particularly harrowing incident, the weary family decides to take action. It takes the initially skeptical Warrens only a few minutes at the house to be clear that something is amiss.In a sequence of scenes straight out of the ""Poltergeist"" playbook, a metric ton of 'analyzing' equipment is brought in to help provide evidence that the Perron's house does, indeed, need an exorcism. That's right, a whole house exorcism. The family can't leave, either, because this 'demon' will follow them. Bummer. What follows, though, is a consistently tense stream of events, where the clairvoyant Lorraine Warren sees terrible images, and the presence in the house toys with everyone. Why does it toy with this family? The reason is given, but I would venture a guess and say that this entity can only grow powerful by striking at the heart of the family, and breaking their bonds. Destroying things like family photos, and killing pets, is one way to do such a thing.What could be ridiculous in ""The Conjuring"" is not- this is all well constructed and edited, for there are neither dull moments, nor wasted scenes of needless exposition. The tension level is high until the very end of the film, and never lets up. There's a point in any thriller where the film can stand pat, and things go as expected, or the boundaries are stretched. This is one of the films where the stakes seem higher, and the antagonist unpredictable. At one point, not only does the affected family deal with the disturbance, but the Warrens themselves deal with the spook's wrath. That unnerved me- the rules seemed to change on the spot, and I wondered what, exactly, the supernatural nemesis was going to do next.A few smaller details deserve mentioning. The title sequence of the film, which scrolls up, is a nice throwback to titles past. The font is oversized, and clearly not a subtle yellow. It certainly caught my attention, and got me thinking something unique was forthcoming, not to mention a grin on my face. I've also got to give the film credit, for there are many 'jump' moments, but they're timed just right. For subject matter we've seen many times now, I appreciated the attention to detail. The dark corners were somehow more menacing than I remember, the shrieking music at critical moments hit just right, the tree in the Perron's yard was appropriately jagged, and the visceral reactions from the actors gave what should be a throwaway film some gravity. Tonally, this film's got it where it counts.Interestingly, in the course of writing this, I've realized that it's possible I will never be scared watching a movie again. Either a horror film tries too hard and gives away an upcoming scare, there's too much gore and it becomes silly, or it's full of torture or shock 'porn', and I just feel depressed more than anything. Maybe that's what getting older is like. Maybe we're only scared by what we don't know or understand, and thus being scared is a childish reaction. Maybe (this is a stretch) we're so used to the world being more horrific than a horror film that nothing surprises us in the theater anymore. That being the case, I give extra props to ""The Conjuring"" for jarring me at all, and I dare any other film to do better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Slow start, but a wild finish makes up for it.","I've been interested in The Conjuring for a few different reasons. The most basic: I like scary movies, and I like them even better when they're based on true stories. On top of that, we got a very early look at this back in October, at last year's New York Comic-Con. The cast and producers gave the impression that they were personally touched by the story it's based on, and they really wanted to do this movie justice.But can you judge a ""based-on-a-true-story"" movie the same way you judge a normal movie? Better yet, if you have no inside track on this film, and know nothing about what it's based on...will you still find it interesting and/or creepy?I say yes...to an extent.This film clocks in at just below two hours, and, if I'm looking at it strictly as a movie for entertainment, it's a tale of two halves. The first half is going to feel very cliché. The usual scare tactics and predictable moments sandwiched in between plot development. The acting is decent enough, but the kids might annoy you a bit.Then, right around the midway point, when you've got all the background info you need, the movie puts its foot on the pedal. Without spoiling anything, there's a scene on the stairway that stands out, and it's from that point on that the movie finds its groove. You get hit with a hectic pace and some high-quality, satisfying scare moments that hit the mark, compounded with some fine acting and good music choices.There will probably be some mixed feelings with this movie. The slow first half may turn off some viewers, but patience will pay off nicely with the way this one ends. If you like the supernatural, possession-type scary flicks, or if you're at all familiar with the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren, then this movie is worth a look. The Conjuring scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.(Did anyone else notice that Ed and Lorraine Warren look like Robert and Rosalind Lutece, from BioShock Infinite???)(If you enjoyed this review, then I'd like to invite you to check out my humble little page... www.facebook.com/TheBDBOS.

Doesn't live up to the hype,"This movie is not scary, plain and simple. I hear all these people talking about how this is the scariest movie of the decade and it'll terrify anyone who sees it but it's simply not true. I went and saw this with a friend and we laughed throughout the movie. Don't get me wrong, the acting and special effects and everything else in this movie is very well done, but the story has been done too many times before. A family moves into a new house, weird stuff happens, and they call a demonologist up to try to fix their problem. It is just so predictable, and when you can see something coming it doesn't scare you as much as it could have if it had been a surprise. All in all I am very disappointed, I don't scare easily at the movies and I was really hoping for a good one out of this one but I just didn't get it.

There was absolutely no way you couldn't count down to 3 and expect some shock moment. If I'd have to be honest I wouldn't have dragged all my friends to come see this movie with me.

An authentic review,"The Conjuring is an enthralling, beautifully filmed horror movie that stays with someone long after they've finished watching it. It depicts the true story of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren and the most malevolent case they've ever encountered. The film immediately grabs the viewer in its opening commencement, and doesn't let go until the climax's reached and resolution is affirmed. The screenplay and honest, authentic portrayal given by all the actors brings the film to life and makes the audience solely focused on the characters and not the scary, traumatic events constantly occurring. The pace of horror movies seems like such a patent thing to get correct and yet so often is overlooked and results in discontent for many viewers. Another rare feat of this riveting, complex film is it exclusively scares its audience without gore or excessive violence. The direction of James Wan is also incredibly invaluable. These focal points are some of the prominent reasons why critics are calling The Conjuring ""The most effective haunt of this generation!"" The dialogue between the characters gives the audience a genuine feel of whom each character really is without taking time away from the central plot. This presents the audience with a unique opportunity to sympathize with everything the characters are being put through. It is utterly unconventional for an audience to feel (or want to feel) any kind of emotion or anxiety for people in horror movies. The audience ultimately wants the characters to overcome the insidious obstacles the haunted home of the Perrons has in waiting for them. The film's success is related predominantly to one individual: James Wan. James Wan is the director of The Conjuring and consistently becoming more and more well known and respected in the horror movie genre due to this recent masterpiece. Wan takes common themes and aspects from modern horror films while being able to incorporate tricks from Old Hollywood and still make it all compatible with each other. Wan himself stated himself that the MPAA could not take anything out because the entire thing was just too frightening. The pace of any movie is so imperative to the viewers engaging and staying interested in the film. The Conjuring is interesting from the very beginning to the very end because of its impeccable pace. The film starts off by introducing the Warrens and how they go about handling their paranormal investigations. The tone in the very beginning is eerie and makes the audience feel somewhat unnerved because of the few, subtle inklings given. The ambiance of the film intricately takes on a creepier tone when the Perron family is introduced. The Perrons' home is brimming with infinite entities that are the stuff of the most disturbing nightmares. These incredibly unsettling, early incidents include helpful sleepwalking, the death of their pet dog, inanimate objects being thrown, etc. These supernatural happenings occur much more frequently when the Warrens get involved and start investigating the Perrons' home; the disturbances then take on a whole other terrifying level. The scares of this movie aren't rushed, but yet the audience doesn't feel like they're waiting an eternity for them either. The scares that many label as ""jumpy scares"" don't just momentarily frighten you; they genuinely startle you and make you more discomposed and anxious than ever before. The pace of the film is executed to perfection. The Conjuring is rated R for one distinct reason. The film itself has no nudity or sexual conduct, no foul language, or any extreme blood and violence. Why then, one may ponder, is the film rated R? Well, it is in fact rated R because of how terrifying it is. The movie leans on anticipation scares throughout the duration of the film. The scares are so accurately placed that throughout the entire movie, even when insidious events aren't temporarily occurring, there's still a creepy sentiment behind it all. The aurora of the film is constantly a ghastly reminder that more sinister things are still yet to come. The story/plot is just incredibly spooky. When ghostly figures, inanimate objects, and precarious scenarios are consistently unfolding it takes every bit of willpower a person has to not look away from the screen. The Conjuring is an original, awesome, paralyzing horror movie with substance unseen in numerous other horror films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A surprise out of nowhere, a little formulaic but well done and earthy","The Conjuring (2013)Very very well made and ""convincing"" as much as these far-fetched events can convince. The acting and filming (including some cool camera-work) are first rate, really good. And so the direction, under James Wan, deserves a lot of credit.What this movie lacks, though, is plain old originality. Somehow you might not mind, since it sucks you in fast and makes it interesting all through. But there are many movies (many) that deal with similar ideas, even with a kind of pseudo-documentary aspect built in, and with more creative aspects, too.The classic influences here are pretty well laid out. ""The Exorcist"" which was shot and released during the same period this movie was set is a clear parallel. And for its own originality, and for a more disturbing aspect as well as a somewhat more ""grand"" and oddly lyrical take on the ideas, that first version outclasses this one. (If you haven't seen it recently, give it a look before you doubt.) Then there are little hints of lots of other movies, various haunted house films of course, and even a nod to ""The Birds"" which you'll see several times.The movie that this owes maybe too much to is the rather well done recent ""The Awakening"" set in a British boarding school. It has an all too similar set of strategies, with cameras and remote devices meant to catch the spirits in a tangible way. In some ways that was a better movie, with a really terrific leading women, but this one has some extra layers of possession and exorcism that give it an over-the-top craziness by the end.What really floats this boat (""The Conjuring"") for two hours is the convincing core cast playing things in a real, unsensational way (as much as you can when you're possessed and flying through the air). And here I mean mostly the two woman and the husband of the demonologist couple. (The father of the family is a bit bland.) And then there's the camera itself, which almost becomes another character the way it moves and inhabits (possesses?) some of the scenes. The photography ought to be up for some award nominations in a few months.You'll find this all harrowing stuff if you let it. It could have pushed some new boundaries, for sure, and maybe avoided some implausible aspects (people might not fall through a crumbing building with only a tiny scratch). But hey, then it wouldn't be supernatural, would it? A great summer escape movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
First half is perfection,"""The Conjuring"" stands as a modern masterpiece in the supernatural horror genre, delivering a chilling and intense experience that resonates with both horror enthusiasts and general audiences alike.Once the possession starts, it gets a bit too much, but up until then, its terrifying.Directed by James Wan, the film masterfully combines a gripping story with an unsettling atmosphere to create an unforgettable cinematic journey. Set in the 1970s, the story revolves around the real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, as they assist a family plagued by malevolent spirits in their newly acquired farmhouse.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to evoke fear through subtlety and anticipation. Rather than relying solely on jump scares, ""The Conjuring"" builds tension through well-crafted pacing, eerie sound design, and atmospheric visuals. The slow unfolding of the haunting, coupled with the family's increasing dread, results in a sense of foreboding that lingers long after the credits roll.Wilson and Farmiga deliver exceptional performances as the Warrens, bringing depth and credibility to their roles as paranormal investigators. Their dynamic serves as an emotional anchor amidst the escalating supernatural terror, making the audience genuinely invested in their mission to confront and defeat the demonic presence.The film's cinematography and art direction contribute significantly to its effectiveness. Wan's signature use of camera angles and movements adds to the unease, while the dark and shadowy visuals enhance the sense of the unknown. The film's rural setting, a seemingly peaceful farmhouse with a sinister history, becomes an integral part of the horror, creating an environment that feels both inviting and menacing.""The Conjuring"" effectively taps into the fear of the unknown, offering glimpses of the supernatural while leaving much to the imagination. The restraint shown in revealing the malevolent entities adds to the terror, allowing the viewer's imagination to run wild.While ""The Conjuring"" is rooted in the classic haunted house motif, it brings fresh life to the genre by skillfully navigating the psychological toll of the haunting on both the family and the investigators. The Warrens' compassion and determination to confront the supernatural evil lend a sense of hope and courage amid the horror.In conclusion, ""The Conjuring"" is a standout in the realm of supernatural horror, masterfully blending tension, atmosphere, and compelling characters. Its ability to evoke fear through suggestion rather than explicit visuals sets it apart in an era of more explicit horror. If you're seeking a genuinely chilling experience filled with ghosts and demons, ""The Conjuring"" is an exceptional choice that will leave you unnerved and captivated.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
remarkable,"a return. to the rules of classic horror. the comeback of tension and authenticity and role of acting as more than ingredient of screams.

"The Scariest Movie I Have Seen as of July 20, 2013","James Wan directed 'Saw' in 2004, which showed America a different type of horror when it came out. It got six sequels and did very well. Then, Wan directed 'Dead Silence' and 'Death Sentence', which didn't do so well. Wan teamed up with producer Jason Blum for 'Insidious', which came out in 2011 and terrified audiences (I didn't think it was very scary). Now, based on a true story, comes 'The Conjuring', a film that did so well at the film festival it streamed at, that it was put right in the middle of the summer movie season. It had terrified audiences even more than 'Insidious'. I thought this one was scary.In the previews of this movie they showed that this movie isn't just loosely based on a true story, it has the same characters, same story, same situation, and the real people say that this is how it went.'The Conjuring' was very scary, but it had a few jump scares. It's not like the image that pops up is what's supposed to scary you, but it's the fact that somethings unexpected happens. I thought this movie would be better than that, but when I think back on it, 'Insidious' had about twice as many jump scares. There were only a few in this movie, though. The first half of the movie didn't have as many scares as the second half, and the scares were different. The first half build up on suspense and trauma that had me digging my nails into my legs, which were on my seat. It was so intense and suspenseful, but it would end with a jump scare. There were a few things with scary imagery, but most of that came in the second half. In the second half the scares had to do with imagery. There was only about one jump scare then, and it had to do with the fact that this dead thing was doing this to the family. There were also some suspenseful and intense parts in the second half of the movie, too, but they mixed imagery with that to make it stick with you, too. They pulled that off well. The imagery was very scary, and they didn't use it too much. There are some other things in those parts that made them scary but I didn't want to spoil them. At the end there were some scary things, but I don't want to spoil those, either.The acting was good, and the writing was good, except for one thing in one part, but I didn't like the music very well. Something little would happen and it would play really loudly, and it wasn't that good, either... But I understand it was supposed to be like a 70's movie, so that's not really a bad thing. The movie was slow and kind of boring in some parts that I think it shouldn't have been, but all those parts were after a scare and were only about two of them. The main problem I had with the movie wasn't about the movie. It was the marketing that was the problem. Many scares in the first half were spoiled because of the previews, but in the movie sometimes they were longer and actually scary.'The Conjuring' was very interesting. I very much enjoyed the film and it went by quickly. It had a few boring parts, but it was still exciting. During the whole second half, it was intense, suspenseful, scary, and very good. The first half was also good, too, it just had more problems.The movie was very scary and great. It's a horror movie, so it being scary goes for the rating, and it bothered me later, so that adds to the rating, making it a 10/10, which means excellent. It didn't bother me later very much, but it did throughout the whole time I was home. 'The Conjuring' isn't perfect, but it's still excellent. I don't think I liked it as much as I liked 'Sinister', but it was very close. 'The Conjuring' was scarier than 'Sinister', though. I will probably buy this movie on Blu-Ray and DVD when it comes out. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is thinking about seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Lili Taylor has the Linda Blair role here; she gets to spin upside while tied to a chair, vomit up blood through a bed sheet and speak in a guttural voice, ""You're all going to die!""

What is Scarier than a Demon Possessing a Person? Having it be a True Story.,"The main goal for any horror movie is to make you too afraid to leave your closet open at night or to have your feet sticking out of your blankets while you're sleeping and The Conjuring does just that. Director James Wan does an amazing job to create a spine-chilling experience while at the same time having you fall in love with the characters and their family
Wan starts off the movie with great suspense by using intense music to lead to a back story of the doll who started it all. Two young nurses tell their story of how they allow the spirit of a 7-year-old girl named Annabelle to move into the doll they have in their apartment. They continue with stories of the doll moving and doing things all over their apartment such as drawing on the walls and destroying everything. This is how we meet paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. They are the ones who introduce the demon and explain how he used the doll and Annabelle as a way to get to the girls and possess them. Wan uses this to give the viewer information on demons and paranormal spirits that they might need to help explain later scenes. It then cuts to a family of 7 moving into a new house. That we later find out has a demonic presence in it that tries to take over the family. Once the family experiences this presence in many different ways they turn to Ed and Lorraine to help them out. They end up finding out that a woman who lived in the house when it was first built had a history of witchcraft proclaimed her loved to Satan and cursed anyone who moved there along with many other disturbing details. Ed and Lorraine continue to work with this family to try and get rid of this nasty demon.
James Wan does an amazing job to connect all of the stories in the Conjuring universe together. This includes both of The Conjuring's, the Annabelle movies and The Nun. Whether it be using the same doll or the same characters, it really impacts the overall story. Wan has also directed other very popular movies such as The Insidious series, Lights Out, the Saw movies, Furious 7, and Aquaman. Major props to this man for being so creative and being able to find ways to leave impacts on people with these movies.
One of my absolute favorite things about this movie is that is based on a true story. At the beginning of the movie one of the major ways he shows the viewers this is by putting text on the screen about who the Warren's really are and then ends the paragraph with the isolated sentence of, ""Based on the true story."" I think the way he made that sentence stand by itself was very powerful and made the movie become so much scarier for the audience. Also at the end of the movie, they literally added pictures of the real-life Warrens and Annabelle doll. Doing that gets rid of all the doubting thoughts that come to mind and makes it even more astounding. After seeing these pictures, I for sure wanted to learn more about the Warrens and their stories so I looked them up on the internet and found even more information about them. It is a big thing when you can say a story is true because in my opinion what really makes a viewer terrified is the fact that things like this could happen to them. If the movie is super unrealistic the director really has to focus on incorporating other blood-curdling aspects to add to make it scarier.
Another aspect of James Wan's work that is very expressive is the way that he uses very dark rooms to represent all of the evil. I think this is a good technique because we associate the dark with sinister, scary things and the light with the good, virtuous things. We also associate the dark with unknown things which makes the perfect opportunity for jump scares which Wan is very skilled at integrating into his scary movies. He makes sure to build up the intense music to make the shock even greater and jump even higher. I feel like adding suspenseful music and sounds make the anticipation so tremendous and just adds the serious thrill to scary movies.
I will admit you can definitely see some things coming but, they crafted the movie so well that it'll still get your hair to stand on end. Not only is it scary but it has such an appreciable plot that just makes you want to keep seeing more from the Perron and Warren families. By the end of the movie, I was so emotionally connected to the characters that this will forever be my favorite series, even though it may leave me to believe I am seeing things in the shadows late at night.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"At last a recent, genuinely spooky film...","It makes a nice change to have an original and dare I say, scary film.The Conjuring, despite what you are led to believe, is based on the charlatans and con-artists Ed and Lorraine Warren who deceived and lied their way to earning a fortune by making up childish stories about ghosts, possessions and haunted dolls without presenting a shred of evidence. The public, of course, believed them.The story is true in that the story exists.The content is pure fabrication set out to appeal to the gullible.Sorry to p*** on your chips folks but ghosts don't exist.That said, it's a decent watch but about as true as Bambi or Star Wars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror done right,"Everyone has a ghost story or at least knows someone who does. Some people use these stories as a game, something you do while you sit around a campfire or something. To others those stories are not to be retold, instead they are locked away and you hope you can forget. I have heard stories from people that I couldn't believe and would never want to experience them personally. The only things I have seen that terrified me have been on a movie screen, and I have seen enough of those to know the rules. You never go and investigate a noise in a cellar by yourself, also if things start moving by themselves just get out, and finally never buy a house or some land if you don't know it's history. Unfortunately for the Perron family they didn't follow any of those rules.""The Conjuring"" is a story of a family in the 1970's who buys what they think is their dream home in Rhode Island. Not long after moving in, things start to happen that are unexplained. Things like the house being cold, doors opening and closing on their own, and seeing people that were not really there. After a few months of these things happening, the family seeks out Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are experts on such unexplained occurrences. What the Warren's find is the worst thing they have ever investigated. Let's face it; we all like to be scared. We want to find that horror movie that makes us fear the noises we hear at night when the lights are off. With so many stories out there, you would think that they could make a movie that did that. Well ""The Conjuring"" is not there, but it is pretty close. Not since watching ""The Exorcist"" as a child, have I experienced the chills that ran up my neck. This is not a ""jump out of your seat"" scary movie, this is a tense and at times terrifying scary movie. Making you jump is easy, have someone appear out of nowhere, or a loud noise break dead silence. The trick for me though, is feeling like I should leave the closet light on because of the things I saw. Ed and Lorraine Warren's case files have been used as basis of a few films. Films like ""The Amityville Horror"". ""The Haunting in Connecticut"", and ""The Haunting"". Just like in ""The Amityville Horror"" in 1979, ""The Conjuring"" brings a story that will make you believe in things that are unbelievable. I think the best review I can give this movie is after the credits rolled, I believed what I just saw really happened. Imagine that, a based on true horror story that I believed. This is a movie that will have some of you watching it through your fingers. It may not answer all questions or prove to you that some things really exist. What ""The Conjuring"" will do that most movies like it don't, it will remind you of a time when horror was good and scary.Brian Taylorhttp://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Spookily Good Start To A Haunting Series...,"I'd heard bad reviews about this film from some friends so it took me a little while to get to it on my watch list... I've learnt a very important lesson from this, sometimes you're friends can me wrong...In this day and age of average horror flicks, it's so nice to come across a true eerily chilling masterpiece, which this is. I loved the fact that this story, and the other conjuring tales, is based on reported ghost and possession stories. I won't go as far as to say that these stories are real, though I do believe. Of course, they have been ""Hollywood""'ed up to entertain the paying masses and get bums on seats. It's in this respect that both the writers, Chad & Carey W Hayes and director James Wan draw a perfect line to get the story across while making it entertaining.Wan is great at giving a scare too as he utilises everything in the ""Boo!"" scare-book. From noise shocks to near-silent ramped up the tension. He plays with light and shadows to give you a nice scary atmosphere. This is something I've missed.Added to this, great performances from the cast, especially the kids as they truly make you believe they are being terrorised by an evil spirit. The section in the bedroom, where Christine (Joey King) is pulled from the bed and then warns her sister that he's behind her is the constant to this. These two performances, along with Wan's direction that make you believe there may be something in the deep shadows.All of this had me hooked right from the moment I hit the play button.Should you want a good scare and a film that will stay with you for a while, then this is the movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Well-Done Supernatural Thriller with Respect for the Genre,"I don't know. Maybe I'm just jaded but I wasn't all that frightened by director James Wan's 2013 hit, THE CONJURING. I'm a tough person to engage with a horror film or supernatural thriller because it really needs some special to grab my attention. I was never bored while watching THE CONJURING, and I was even a little creeped out by the end of it all, but there's just nothing here to raise this movie above any other supernatural ghost tale. It never quite reaches the entertainment value of Wan's previous ghost story, INSIDIOUS. This movie has the added bonus of being based on supposed actual events, if that helps increase the spook factor for you at all. It's about Ed and Lorraine Warren (portrayed in the movie by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), a famous husband/wife team of demonologists who've claim to fame include such cases as the Amityville House. Seeing as how Amityville has been done to death, this movie focuses on another of their cases: the Perrons. The Perron family begins experiencing unusual phenomena after moving into a little farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971. When it becomes apparent that whatever spirit or spirits haunting their home are aggressive, the Perrons seek out the aid of the Warrens. The Warrens soon discover that the Perrons' new home has a dark past that continues to torture the inhabitants of the home, and they must gather enough evidence for the Vatican to agree to an exorcism before the evil can claim new victims.I suppose I respect THE CONJURING and enjoy it to the extent that I do because I understand what it's trying to be. James Wan isn't hoping to reinvent the wheel with this movie. Haunted house and possession movies are a dime a dozen anymore. Exorcism movies are the new ""big thing"" with a handful of them creeping into theaters each year, and most of them bombing. With THE CONJURING, Wan just wants to create the best film of this genre that he can, using all of the tools (and a lot of jump scares) that have been established for this genre. In that regard, the movie is a success. It's one of the better haunted house/possession films I've seen in the past few years. It was successful in at least creeping me out by the end of the film but I wasn't as blown away as I'd expected. The movie is sort of a victim of it's own hype machine. All of the advertisements and a lot of the reviews promised THE CONJURING to be one of the scariest movies in years and, well, no. It's got some nice bits, especially an introduction to the move focused on another of the Warrens' cases: Annabelle, the doll. For whatever reason, busted porcelain dolls are inherently skin-crawling and one that supposedly stalks its victims is a guaranteed spook factor. The final act of the film with the big exorcism isall right. Again, it's nothing I don't feel like I haven't seen before and it's hard to get excited for it.The movie's biggest strength (aside from its director's obvious love/respect for the genre) is its cast. We've got Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren. Wilson is a man I'm surprised doesn't get more mainstream work. He's developed a nice history with James Wan, starring in both this and the INSIDIOUS films. Wilson's a great talent in the film and he's got strong chemistry with Vera Farmiga, who stars as his wife Lorraine Warren. Farmiga's another who brings a little class to the cast and these two starring together in the main roles brings the movie a little extra clout. Ron Livingston, one of Hollywood's best everymen, is Roger Perron, the head of the household who puts his family's life into the Warrens' hands even if he doesn't quite understand the situation they've found themselves embroiled in. The film also have the benefit of having child stars with decent talent. Child actors are an easy way to kill the fun but the girls who play the Perrons' children do a fantastic job. Everyone is bringing their A- game to the film and it never devolves into cheese. THE CONJURING works because everyone involved have a respect for the genre and unite in their aim to create a great modern ghost flick. And they do. Unless you're a naturally jumpy person, I wouldn't walk into THE CONJURING expecting the scare of your life but it is a well-done supernatural thriller with a handful of good, creepy moments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It is a must watch masterpiece in horror movies!!,"The Conjuring pulls its inspiration from a case file of famed demonologists and paranormal investigators the Warrens, the husband and wife team who's other journeys inspired films such as The Amityville Horror. Here they are played respectively by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga who are now both genre regulars with roles in Insidious and the upcoming Chapter 2 due this year for the gentleman and Orphan and television's Psycho prequel Bates Motel for Farmiga. We've all seen the painful trope of priests, exorcists, psychics and every nut-job in between showing up at the eleventh hour to save a haunted family but the way they're approached in The Conjuring stands as one of the film's greatest strengths. The movie sends chills in the spine. It is an epic masterpiece of direction and story. The Effects are ultimate and the story line is pretty interesting. The cast is brilliant . The End how ever could have been better. And we hope the sequel comes soon :) . Mustwatch for all horror fans !",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Well acted and artfully crafted, The Conjuring is surprisingly fresh and totally works","Smartly crafted, truly convincing and surprisingly well crafted, this horror thriller is quite the success. The cast does a great job creating a believable story, especially Ed and Lorraine Warren (played by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson). Based on a true story, The Conjuring has the Warren couple facing their biggest challenge in a particular case with a family.Despite the plot sounding rudimentary, it was surprisingly well told and was way more interesting than I had expected. It's the sub- plot of the Warrens that truly shines. It enables the audience to care for them, a character dynamic that usually is completely untouched in horror film. The rest of the cast is strong, creating something that finally isn't cheesy or cheap. There are barley any jump scares, which richened the experience. It was all tense build-up and the ""fear of the unknown"" that kept everything moving and my heart racing.The film is also really well shot, and creatively done so too. The cinematography captures the nuance and subtlety that most horror films forget to included entirely, which was a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack fits the film well too, creating an intense experience. I really liked the multiple stylistic references to films such as the Exorcist and The Shining; they were smart and subtle and there purely for film junkies like me! There were a couple of cliché scenes and the special effects could have been better. Also, the characters introduced later in the film are pretty paper thin, and there are a couple of earnest comedic breaks that feel out of place.Overall, I was truly surprised about how good The Conjuring was. I haven't seen a horror film in theaters...ever...and this was a good one to start with. The experience was rich with terror and scary without being cheap. I enjoyed The Conjuring, it's underlying messages, and the truly well done performances from that cast despite it being so large. A surprisingly solid horror film to truly bring some fresh perspective to the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""The Conjuring"" does bring down the house!!","I made a conjugal visit (well, maybe not conjugal) to the horror flick ""The Conjuring"", and it was pretty satisfying. The movie stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed & Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators in the early 70's. Ron Livingston & Lili Taylor co-star as Roger & Carolyn Perron, parents of five females who move into a two- story haunting, I mean haunted, farmhouse. So who you gonna call? The Warrens of course for a Warren investigation to lift the spirits, away that is. Director James Wan does wanna keep us spooked, and does a good job of it.

"A solid, professional effort but not quite there.","It feels bad in a way to criticise this film because it is trying so hard to be good. However the fact is that it just doesn't come together in a way which genuinely taps into our fears and releases them. Yes, there are crashes and jumps that startle, but one is never drawn in deeper.It's a pity because there are a couple of good performances (Lili Taylor stands out) and it's certainly photographed well. I think it is the direction that is a bit off. It feels more like a paint-by-numbers approach to the genre than someone who is genuinely conveying what makes him personally afraid. (I don't think I've ever seen a film with more people walking backwards into the open frame behind them.)So does it work for a Saturday night popcorn-jumper with the right audience? Sure. It will put the receptive viewer through the standard paces, and he or she will likely leave satisfied. But it's nothing that will have you starting at shadows when you go to bed that night.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Undeniable fun even for non-horror fans.,"I've never really been a fan of horror films and unfortunately the state of horror today feels more unappealing than ever. The scares are objectively cheap with these ultra-low budgets and flimsy concepts where few audience members come out praising the movies they pay to see. That said, I really liked the first Saw when I saw it a few years after it came out when I was much younger. Simply, it was a thriller that thrilled me for every second. Sure, I could end up watching it now and pick apart the acting and story, but I'm certain it still has a great nostalgia value. So when The Conjuring started to get praise calling it an instant classic from people who don't regularly like horror films, I decided I'd trust James Wan enough to check it out. And it certainly was a surprise. It may be creepy as you'd expect, but it isn't scary. However, I had a huge grin on my face during the scares because it's so much fun.What the film has to boast is the great production value which it flaunts in every dynamic swooping shot. Like The Cabin In The Woods, it's utterly crammed with fun ideas that it wants to do them all at once. But this brisk pace is a blessing and a curse. It sacrifices suspense and doesn't give room for its characters to breathe, meaning the big character moments don't really land or feel melodramatic. It's fine though, it's a treat to have characters with a handful of dimensions to them in films like these anyway. However, the third act is so hectic that I just ended up switching off. Still, the film is special and sticks out among films today, even as a homage to the classics. The one thing that stops me from being sure where to praise it is that I'm not sure what tone it was going for. Given how funny it can be, it could be tongue-in- cheek, it could be satire or it could be trying to be taken seriously? Either way would be good for it, it's just I don't know where it stands. Solid entertainment either way.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A rare decent modern horror film,"Over the past 10-15 years, cinema-goers have been subjected to an endless parade of bland, watered-down and just in general uninspired horror films, with pathetic remakes of previous classics being a common occurrence. Therefore it's a pleasant surprise when a contemporary horror film pops up that actually provides decent scares, as well as a convincing plot and commendable cast.The Conjuring tells the apparently-true story of the Perron family, who are terrorised by various malevolent spirits after purchasing a new house. Gradually these experiences become more intense, so much so that they employ the services of two paranormal investigators, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, to help diffuse the problem.The film is excellent in terms of pacing, with there being a heavy reliance on the building of suspense, as opposed to resorting to cheap jump-scares every five minutes, a vice that most other modern horrors bear almost like a badge of honor. Small bumps in the middle of the night steadily mold into much more terrifying occurrences. I would liken the experience to the pacing in other evil spirit-related films such as the original Amityville Horror and The Exorcist.The characters themselves are surprisingly more than just sex-crazed, teenage chainsaw-fodder. The various members of the Perron family all have unique personalities and traits, making them believable, and therefore relatively easy to relate to. Likewise, dialogue between the two demonologists, as opposed to just providing plot information, gives the impression of a genuine, loving couple.The cinematography and mise-en-scene is perfectly suited for the film's creepy atmosphere, with dark, misty lakes and uncomfortable wide-angles and close-ups contributing to an overall, over-bearing feeling of dread.The film also successfully uses new techniques in terms of generating this deep sense of fear and unpleasantness, with for instance the game of hide-and-clap providing one or two memorable instances.Ultimately, The Conjuring is by no means on par with classics such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Evil Dead, but nevertheless it is a drastic improvement on the standard toned-down, unimaginative rubbish that is repeatedly churned out today. There is a real sense of nostalgia for horror flicks of the '70's within the film, which were clearly used as inspiration for James Wan when creating this above-average shocker.

The Warrens and the Perrons made sure the director told their story accurately. There is no sex, and I heard Ron Livingston say God damn a couple of times, which to me is NOT what you want to say fighting demons or doing an exorcism.

Eruption,"We have here a film made from the files of the same paranormal investigators behind the Amityville hoax. The film begins with a 16mm film they have shot around a previous haunted case which they are showing to an audience of eager believers, ourselves. We're shown other footage of possession, but nothing so far that couldn't have been doctored.Clever, introducing us to a tentative world of uncertain narration. But a horror film must unfold from a ground of haunted truth so we miss that slippery edge.No this is a pretty ordinary haunted house movie with bouncing balls, noises from the cellar and stopped clocks. These work for me when we have a concentration to the present moment, not for any of the animated gizmos, but for the camera that penetrates a thick palpable space, that tries to part a viscous darkness behind the door in which nothing yet moves but is at the brink of doing so.I'm talking about that specific moment where our vision is ready to erupt, has not yet but we're already embodying it, hoax and truth blending in the tension.There is some of that here but it's too haphazard for my taste. That is because we shift from haunted spatiality itself to exorcism, so we have all sorts of stuff tossed together: poltergeist, visions, demonic spirits, the gnarly exorcism which is always the centerpiece.I think Insidious did a better job in the apparitions, but then it had a much sillier finale as we literally parted space to enter a ghost dimension.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Same old, Same old.","I was actually really looking forward to this film, and that is a rarity when it comes to horror films as i have just became bored of them. But It just seemed to have an edge to it by the look of the trailer. So i sat down hoping to witness a horror movie that stands out more than any other recent nonsense.Almost 2 hours later and i was left with that same feeling i seem to always have at the end of ""horror"" films and that was disappointment. It is a good film; Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are excellent as the Warrens and due to the fact it was based on real people and ""real events"" it has a certain validity to it that others don't. But it is rather boring. It takes an eternity to develop and although it has it's own unique creepiness, it slowly (in ultra slow motion) but surely dwindles into the shadow of any other exorcism movie i have ever witnessed. I can't really knock any of the actors/actresses as they all play their parts well. I am however not fazed by horror films, i am never forced to jump out my seat, or grasp the person beside me, or scream. There where plenty of culprits in the showing i was in; some even burying their heads in their laps through large portions of the film. So that is an indication of it's fear factor.If you are easily scared then this will most likely do it's job and as i said it is a good film and although i was disappointed, i still found it an enjoyable.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not original or deep but highly effective and entertaining as a horror,"Horror movies never make me jump. It's extremely rare. I'm usually not even tense. But The Conjuring kept me pretty tense for most of its duration. I was almost frustrated by how it was scaring me in a subtle, simple way I had no control over. I didn't jump but there were many parts that sent involuntary chills down my spine. Whenever the movie suggests an ominous presence or that something sinister is about to happen, you cannot help but buy into it and start imagining and anticipating things. James Wan is very successful at manipulating his audience with all the horror movie tricks that there are. In this way, The Conjuring works really well. I'm usually very underwhelmed by the directing and acting in horror movies but this is a nice exception.The Conjuring manages to avoid annoying us for the most part. The characters aren't complete idiots. However, they still manage to leave out important details when talking with each-other. And they are conveniently separated or put into vulnerable positions a lot of times. But the aim is to scare and it works. You have to sometimes accept that the lights aren't going to work and that people might be dumb enough to play blindfold games in a haunted house. And of course they can't just move out because, well... because money. Anyway, the plot keeps moving and it's engaging all the way through. Bits of information are revealed in a very effective way that build the suspense and dread. The climax is quite dramatic and satisfying. Fairly intense, but not retarded.There are many similarities to Paranormal Activity. That film possibly had less plot-holes and maintained more mystery. It also didn't claim to be based on a true story. But The Conjuring has much more character- depth and humour. We really care about the family and the investigators. There are probably lots of similarities to The Exorcist as well, but I found that film to be highly over-rated. At least The Conjuring is far less boring. And much scarier. It taps more into universal fears whereas The Exorcist seems to benefit from some religious beliefs which I don't carry.I was a bit annoyed when I looked into the story behind this movie. Why base it so loosely on a true story? There are way too many liberties taken. I invested a certain amount of trust in the story, that most of it actually happened. There appears to be practically no evidence of much of any of it having taken place. Most of the history seems to be completely false. Because so many stupid, inconsistent details were thrown together, they should have made this a pure work of fiction. Then you could laugh afterwards about how creative and scary and ridiculous it was.The Conjuring generally avoids cheap scares and focuses on being creepy and having original moments (in style, not in story). James Wan knows what we're expecting and where we're looking and uses this to his advantage. He makes us stare into a rotating mirror, helplessly searching for the slightest hint of an image so we can empty our bowels the instant we see it. He makes us stare into the darkness, waiting for some malevolent being or force to make itself known. The house and surrounding environment are both shot really well. They look really cool.Anyway, this is a really good horror movie, but it feels a bit dishonest. I mean, they record video in the movie but is there any footage of what they got that the public can see? Are we meant to believe ghosts exist and hauntings actually happen but somehow there's absolutely no solid evidence of them at all? Clearly I don't. But I guess the Warrens were convinced and we should at least respect their sincerity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Loved this movie,This movie was awesome it was very creepy and definitely a horror movie with jump scares and an amazing storyline it definitely is up there in my top horror movies to watch. If you like the nun or Annabelle this one is definitely worth a watch.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You should not miss this movie,"Generally i think horror movies are waste of time, most of them have bad stories and their only aim is to make you terrified, so when my friend recommended this movie for me i wasn't so excited about watching it, however i watched it, and i can say that this movie is actually different from other horror movies. The most important thing that makes this movie incomparable is the fact that it is based on true events, this fact makes the movie very interesting and you won't miss any scene. The acting was very good and i loved Vera Farmiga for her performance in this movie, Patrick Wilson was good although sometimes you may feel that his expressions are little bit mannered. The music and sound is really exciting and the photography was also great. After watching this great movie i can confidently say that this movie is the best horror movie in the last years.. simply a masterpiece! so i strongly recommend it even for those who are unlikely to watch such movies of this genre.. don't miss it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not Too Bad At All,"Roger & Carolyn Perron, along with their 5 children, move to a new countryside home in Rhode Island but it's not long before things start going wrong. It all starts off with the usual doors closing & opening; pictures falling off the walls; creaking floorboards, but it's not long before things start taking a more sinister turn. Roger & Carolyn find help in the form of Lorraine and Ed Warren, two paranormal investigators who have investigated countless instances of paranormal behaviour, and working together they soon start to find out who - or what - is behind the events that is plaguing their home.The Conjuring is a pretty decent horror/suspense movie, but unfortunately it wasn't as good as I was hoping. To be honest, it's a little bit slow paced at times until roughly the last 20 minutes where everything gets pretty relentless and comes to a head. In saying that, though, it's never a boring movie and it has a good few scares with some pretty decent tension that gets built up quite nicely along the way.As mentioned earlier, the last 20 minutes is where the movie is at it's best and definitely makes up a wee bit for the other lacking parts of the film. The movie has two story's that criss-cross with each other. We have the main story of the escalating incidents with Roger & Carolyn and then there's the one that shows glimpses into Ed & Lorraine's lives as investigators. The stories entwine well with each other without getting confusing or muddled.This is definitely not on the same level as films like Insidious or Sinister, but if you enjoy other films like The Amityville Horror and A Haunting In Connecticut then you will probably enjoy The Conjuring.Overall, a pretty good movie to watch and I recommend giving it a go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A look at James Wan and his modern horror masterpiece.,"James Wan is among the most influential horror directors in recent. His smash hit ""Saw"", a film which I am a large fan of, lead to the most successful horror franchise of the 2000's and the increasingly violent and disturbing nature of the films sequels caused the popularisation of the ""Torture porn"" subgenre. Wan has also reaped significant success with his recently popular ""Insidious"" series. So why is Wan successful and why do I like him so much?Wan is a director who understands the secret to suspense, the unknown and the fear it creates. By keeping key details shrouded in shadow, and keeping the audience in the dark as to what's going to happen, Wan is able to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. This is helped also by Wan's talent for creating likable and identifiable characters, this makes the audience care all the more about what is going to happen next. This is used to great effect in ""The Conjuring"". Relatively large cast of characters are all surprisingly realistic and memorable, seeming real enough to warrant the audiences interest and sympathy. The nature of the supernatural elements are also kept largely in shadow for the majority of the film, keeping the audience constantly nervous and more susceptible to the films fantastically chilling atmosphere.Wan also keeps his premises simple, but nuanced and detailed at the same time. ""The Conjuring"", at surface level, is a simple haunted house story. However the smaller details, such as the complex character relationships and strong character development, makes this concept feel fresh.The film looks great too. The cinematography is great and takes full advantage of the tight environment and period setting to get some brilliant angles. The period of the 70's is perfectly brought to life through the soundtrack, costumes and colour palette, which immediately invokes films such as ""Amityville Horror"". Despite the isolated setting, the film dares to make use of other locations at times to add to the scale of the conflict and to keep latter parts of the film visually engaging. In particular the grounds surrounding the house are responsible for some truly memorable images and every moment spent there drips with mood and a chilling atmosphere.The film succeeds in being very scary also, without having to resort to cheap jump scares. The film is brave and effective enough to simply allow the tension, atmosphere and characters to drive the scary moments, there is no artificiality here.In conclusion, aside from ""Saw"" this stands as my favourite Wan film to date and my favourite horror film of the last few years. ""The Conjuring"" manages to feel classic and fully realised, whilst still being fresh and filled with personality. Wan is ahead of the game by a country mile.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Relentlessly Terrifying,"'The Conjuring' is a modern classic, and really lives up to its reputation as a truly scary movie. Beyond the terror, the movie is also pretty solid; it's not just a compilation of ridiculous scares like many of its genre. There is some nice, emotional character work beyond the main demonic storyline. And the scares themselves are very effective. It will keep you constantly on edge with its building, rising tension and suspense. Some scenes drag out for many minutes, just building that tension up and up and up. It is a really stressful watch in many places, and the consequent release of tension is almost always unexpected and will hit your hard. The movie falls into many conventional horror tropes (and its storyline is very overused nowadays), such as the constant jump-scares - but they're very well executed and add to the atmosphere in a meaningful way more so than most horror films. 'The Conjuring' is relentless and doesn't give you a break; once scary things start happening, they won't stop happening until the end credits roll. I would still lean towards calling this reasonably shallow horror; its terrifying in the moment and at a surface level, but in my opinion will fail to stick with you, to disturb or frighten you after the credits have rolled. It doesn't offer anything that gets to you on a deep, disturbing level, but is nonetheless thrilling throughout its entire runtime. It will keep you hooked without fail, and is a great, thrilling watch. If you haven't already, definitely check out this modern classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Well made but ordinary scary house story,"I'm kind of tired of haunted house movies. You know, a family moves in, strange things start to happen, it becomes scary bla bla... For some reason I feel like that concept is seen so many times that it's hard to bring anything new to it to make it scary or interesting anymore.The Conjuring has a good cast and an interesting house, so it feels like there is some quality. It's visually nice to look at and the acting is consistently quite good and characters relatable. I also give some points for not using much jump scares. Instead the tension builds gradually which is always a good thing. Other than that it's still a quite typical horror movie with nothing really special.

Very good,"Very good movie ! Excellent actors and 1,2 jump scares. Most horror films claim to be 'based on real life incidents'. While they rarely live up to the hype around them, The Conjuring is an exception.

Good not great ghost story,"A decent spooker - it doesn't live up to many of the rave reviews it has received, but it's not bad at all. Most horror films these days are so by-the-numbers that the better ones like this often get graded higher on a curve. As with so many ghost stories I found Conjuring's windup better and way more frightening than the eventual climactic events - the atmosphere was so dread-filled that I (a died-in-the-wool horror veteran) was genuinely uneasy for the first half hour or so. As more was revealed it got less frightening - I still find that the less you see, the less you know, the more your imagination has to fill in the blanks - the scarier a movie tends to be. The performances were all top-notch, particularly Vera Farmiga as the medium; special mention should be made of the younger actresses, who were all very believable. Definitely the best horror film of 2013 that I've seen, but again, I'm grading it on a curve.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

10/15/18The movie The Conjuring achieves the desired effect of horror through the director's portrayal of the story. The storyline and theme helped the director's vision for the movie come to be a plaudits film. 
 The Perron family moved into a new, old house that has a dark past. This was the house many murders were committed in. A churlish demon is attached to this house and has been waiting for someone to move in, so it can possess the weakest of the new owners. The writers Chad Hays and Carey W. Hays have a true understanding of the horror genre, they wrote a simple well-known plot and the director James Wan took the storyline to the next level. The storyline is strongly supported by the sequencing of scenes and is believable within the context of the movies premise. The story unfolded through the dialogue and action of the main characters, The Perron on family knew that something was wrong when their daughters started seeing things, they were hearing noises, and there was a nasty smell roaming the house. The family of seven was portrayed as your happy average family in the beginning but when the real monster comes out the family is defeated and looking for any way to get out of that house. The amazing cast in this movie brought it all together from their smiles to their screams the collaboration made the storyline come to life. The theme of this movie is very compelling to the average horror movie lover, a basic theme that evolved into a bone chilling and heart racing movie. The theme is formulaic if you have enjoyed many horror movies before while if you are new to the horror community it is original. Watching many horror movies gives you a sense of what will happen next and it can become boring if the movie is too predictable but The Conjuring hits you with unexpected jump scares and heart pounding suspense that will still surprise you even when you know it is coming. The premise for this movie is realistic because the paranormal activity gives the average ""ghosts aren't real"" believing viewer the feeling of not knowing their own senses and they will be looking over their shoulder that night. 
 At the end of this movie there is one last jump scare that leads to the end credits rolling and doll music playing to leave you with one last tingling sense that the demon is there alongside you. The director and the writers' vision were accomplished just by a storyline, theme, and carefully picked music.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Masterwork Of Contemporary Horror,"Making effective use of its visual & sound design, vintage elements & old-school scares, The Conjuring is one of the best mainstream horror films to come out in recent memory.

A Conjuring Comment for The Conjuring,"First off, I would like to praise the producers for having a great setting for the movie. It really added to the terrifying atmosphere that a horror movie can bring out. The cinematography and special effects were good... indeed, excellent. I love it especially that I'm really a fan of movies with good camera rollings. The screen portrayals were good, but I guess they have to work a little bit on some facial expressions to add more terror on the part of the audience. The stunts were amazing and I guess was very fit for the movie.Nevertheless, I only gave this movie a 6 because I can't find satisfaction with the horror scenes. I haven't even felt my heartbeat go faster than normal. Yes, I consider the fact that they may not want to sugarcoat the scenes because it is based from the true case files of Warren, but I guess, that's what horror films has to be -- over acted. If you don't over act a horror movie, then it'll be plainly a reenactment.Besides, the opening was not that good for me. I believe, for some cinematic effect, they added several non-significant scenes... but come on, the introduction plays a significant role for the entire movie and you have to place something in there that is significant for the plot.Lastly, the musical scoring wasn't that stunning for me. I mean, there could have been more background sounds to frighten the audience since the sound effects weren't that much effective.Not bad at all. Six for this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A return to the classic horror flick...,"Nowadays, reality television seems to thrive with audiences that want a peek into the lives of others. The feature length film, The Conjuring, isn't exactly a reality show, but does claim to be loosely based off the real life experiences of Ed and Lorraine Warren (paranormal investigators) and the Perron family. Like many horror flicks preceding, the implication that the events are somewhat real, does add a level of anxiety to the viewing experience. One of the film's trailers even features a family, in a documentary style interview, who asserts they are the family the film is based upon. It just may be left up to the viewer to decide how real, but the suggestion of true events will lend itself to a bit of buzz over the flick.It's during the 70s that Roger (Ron Livingston, Office Space) and Carolyn Perron (Lily Taylor, The Haunting) moved their five daughters into a tattered New England home, which has a dark history the family is unaware of. The immense dead tree in the yard, the shadowy lake, and large ominous house act as foretellers, but that apparently isn't enough to steer this family away from home ownership. As expected, the mysterious occurrences happen from the beginning, though the pacing of paranormal activity is slow as the momentum of the film builds. April (Kyla Deaver), is the Perron's youngest daughter, and is the first to come in contact with the other side when she finds an antique music box. It's through the music box that she begins to see a young boy close to her own age.After some time and several incidents, Carolyn cannot deny that something powerful and evil is terrorizing her home; she seeks the help of Ed (Patrick Wilson, Watchmen) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga, Higher Ground). The Warren's are known for their expertise and experience with the supernatural. Lorraine, a clairvoyant, immediately senses the forces inside the home during her first visit. They later uncover the history of the property and determine the only possible way the Perron family would ever be completely safe is a sanctioned exotericism of the home performed by the Catholic Church. In the meantime, things escalate and as the evil forces react to the constant and threatening presence of Ed, Lorraine, and their team of investigators. It's soon evident that the Perrons are not the only ones in danger.Director James Wan (Insidious), successfully reinvents the classic horror flick. The film is light on gore, but heavy with suspense and edge of your seat moments. It seems the audience cringes most at what's not there than what is revealed. He masterfully builds tension at just the right moments until the scene erupts with a crescendo. In one scene Christine (Joey King), one of the daughters, is awaken by one of the demonic forces. Her slow search of the dark room turned up nothing visually for the audience, but nonetheless turned out be one of the most terrifying scenes, leaving the audience in a prolonged state of anticipation—all the while waiting for the big scare.An experienced cast further propels The Conjuring. The five young ladies cast as the daughters all perform excellently and plays ""scared to death"" quite convincingly. The four veteran leads: Farmiga, Wilson, Livingston, and Taylor are brilliantly, though Farmiga and Taylor pilot this feature as the tortured female leads. Whether you're a believer or skeptic, the film is worth a viewing.Writerfrancoford@aol.com See more reviews at MediumRareTv.org",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The resemblance to The Amityville Horror book,"A good horror movie to come across in a while. I think the Bible, and all religions in general, are resourceful goldmines for horror movie makers. This movie has a lot of resemblance to The Amityville Horror book (1977) by the late Jay Anson. No wonder, as both Lorraine and Ed Warren had participated in the investigation of that (presumably) haunted house back in 1976.The paranormal events that the authors of the two movies/books claim to be based on true stories could happen. However, to claim that the evil presences respond 'only' to religious rites and symbols (especially of the three monotheists: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) is a bit far- fetched.There are billions of polytheists, pagans and others who have their own ways to deal with such phenomena. For them emphasizing the effectiveness of exorcism rites of the monotheists in books and movies are viewed as cheap propaganda.Non-believers, too, reject the phenomena and the religious rites and consider the whole thing laughable.Still I find this movie scarier and more entertaining than the Amityville movie. And as a horror movie fan I give it 10/10. Don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great Authentic ""Based On True Story"" Movie","I really enjoy watching most movies that state ""Based On a True Story"" and as we all know most are not or are mostly Hollywood and falls off the path of keeping the story realistic. This one was nailed out of the park. James hit this one right on the head, no gore, bloody horror, fake prosthetics or bad makeup, or crappy CGI. Lilly Taylor said in an interview that James didn't use any CGI and I can see why... he didn't need to. I liked the classic/ simple horror touch to it, the more innocent thrillers that keep you more scared because of the suspense. Very well shot, great cinematography, and kept the audience from saying that was fake or corny. As for the over rated or played out ""This movie was so Scary I had nightmares, or peed myself, or cried... well... Not so much. I guess that goes to show don't read to many reviews or take them to seriously before you go and watch it for yourself. It was pretty thrilling and suspenseful, I wasn't bored or was already 3 guesses ahead of what was going to happen because the story line was so great.So all in all, Very Great acting from Patrick, Vera, and Lilly. Good classic scary movie with a solid and suspenseful story line that had you pined in you seat. Worth seeing it in the theater and spending a few bucks.

Horror by the numbers,"Saw The Conjuring last night. It's a movie I've looked forward to for some time. I was somewhat familiar with Ed and Lorraine Warren and the IMDb reviews on the film have been superb. So...does it live up to expectation? Well that depends entirely on what your expectations are...if you are hoping for an Amityville Horror, Haunting in Connecticut, Poltergiest, straight up, bump in the night, haunted house movie...then you wont be disappointed. It certainly deserves it's place on that top ten list. If however, you like horror movies that drag you into the dark rather than using it as a cover for spooks, those psychological gems such as The Exorcist, Silence of the Lambs, The Omen, then The Conjuring will disappoint greatly. If you look back on The Exorcist...it would be hard to imagine anyone replacing Jason Miller as Damian Karras and that's because we understood him so well that Miller WAS Karras. The same could be said for Max Von Sydow as Fr Merrin or Ellen Burstyn as Chris McNeill and even Lee J Cobb as Bill Kinderman. We even got under the surface of Pazuzu, the demon.Demon: What an excellent day for an exorcism. Father Damien Karras: You would like that? Demon: Intensely. Father Damien Karras: But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan? Demon: It would bring us together. Father Damien Karras: You and Regan? Demon: You and us.Demon: Mirabile dictu, don't you agree? Father Damien Karras: You speak Latin? Demon: Ego te absolvo. Father Damien Karras: Quod nomen mihi est? Demon: Bon Jour. Father Damien Karras: Quod nomen mihi est? Demon:La plume de ma tante.The Conjuring also deals with issues of possession and the manipulation of a child, but this spirit isn't Captain Howdie and this movie isn't The Exorcist (1973)...or The Omen (1976) or The Changeling (1980) and therein lies the problem. In the 70s, it wasn't the kiss of death to make a horror movie with an 18 cert and evil could be examined as a study. Now, it's one bloody puke and you're a slave of Satan....one touching memory later and you're free from his shackles. Horror by the numbers. When audiences first sat through The Exorcist, they wanted to run from the cinema and splash their face in holy water...the only time I was on the edge of my seat during The Conjuring was when I contemplated popping out for a coffee.

After I saw the trailer, it looked pretty cool and it looks original to me. Going to this movie I expected an original scary movie and get scare a lot. Overall it was pretty good, but it wasn't really that scary.The plot of this movie is that a family bought a new house and stuff happens in the house. Like banging doors and see apparitions of ghosts, all that stuff. Then, they call these people to search the house for ghosts and trying to make the family be happy again.I admit that there were a few parts in the movie that scared me. And I really like the final climax of this movie I thought it awesome was to watch. But overall, it didn't scare a lot and that was kind of disappointing for me because I went to this movie to get scare a lot. Well, the actors in this movie did a good job though. And, I like the atmosphere. The doll though freaks me out though. Overall, if you really want to see a movie that would scare you a lot and you will have trouble sleeping, watch Sinister.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Believer or skeptic, the film is worth a viewing","Nowadays, reality television seems to thrive with audiences that want a peek into the lives of others. The feature length film, The Conjuring, isn't exactly a reality show, but does claim to be loosely based off the real life experiences of Ed and Lorraine Warren (paranormal investigators) and the Perron family. Like many horror flicks preceding, the implication that the events are somewhat real, does add a level of anxiety to the viewing experience. One of the film's trailers even features a family, in a documentary style interview, who asserts they are the family the film is based upon. It just may be left up to the viewer to decide how real, but the suggestion of true events will lend itself to a bit of buzz over the flick.It's during the 70s that Roger (Ron Livingston, Office Space) and Carolyn Perron (Lily Taylor, The Haunting) moved their five daughters into a tattered New England home, which has a dark history the family is unaware of. The immense dead tree in the yard, the shadowy lake, and large ominous house act as foretellers, but that apparently isn't enough to steer this family away from home ownership. As expected, the mysterious occurrences happen from the beginning, though the pacing of paranormal activity is slow as the momentum of the film builds. April (Kyla Deaver), is the Perron's youngest daughter, and is the first to come in contact with the other side when she finds an antique music box. It's through the music box that she begins to see a young boy close to her own age.After some time and several incidents, Carolyn cannot deny that something powerful and evil is terrorizing her home; she seeks the help of Ed (Patrick Wilson, Watchmen) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga, Higher Ground). The Warren's are known for their expertise and experience with the supernatural. Lorraine, a clairvoyant, immediately senses the forces inside the home during her first visit. They later uncover the history of the property and determine the only possible way the Perron family would ever be completely safe is a sanctioned exorcism of the home performed by the Catholic Church. In the meantime, things escalate and as the evil forces react to the constant and threatening presence of Ed, Lorraine, and their team of investigators. It's soon evident that the Perrons are not the only ones in danger.Director James Wan (Insidious), successfully reinvents the classic horror flick. The film is light on gore, but heavy with suspense and edge of your seat moments. It seems the audience cringes most at what's not there than what is revealed. He masterfully builds tension at just the right moments until the scene erupts with a crescendo. In one scene Christine (Joey King), one of the daughters, is awaken by one of the demonic forces. Her slow search of the dark room turned up nothing visually for the audience, but nonetheless turned out be one of the most terrifying scenes, leaving the audience in a prolonged state of anticipation—all the while waiting for the big scare.An experienced cast further propels The Conjuring. The five young ladies cast as the daughters all perform excellently and plays ""scared to death"" quite convincingly. The four veteran leads: Farmiga, Wilson, Livingston, and Taylor are brilliant, though Farmiga and Taylor pilot this feature as the tortured female leads. Whether you're a believer or skeptic, the film is worth a viewing.follow us @mediumraretv",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror at it's finest,"What happened to the days when horror films scared me? Luckily this film answers that very question. This film is masterly directed by James Wan, the guy that gave us Saw. The Conjuring doesn't have many of the clichés that generic horror films have like jump scares and bad acting, but many moments were I looked at a dark corner and scared myself. This will make your neck hairs stand on end and leave you calling for both mommy and mercy. James Wan proves that you can still make good horror if you do it well. Without a doubt the most talked about horror film for a long time. As far as a sequel, I don't think it's necessary. Any horror film fanatic needs to see this, it will make you want to hug a teddy bear. Hey, wanna play hide and clap? Creepy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good but done to Death,It feels like every possession film has to end with an exorcism which feels way to familiar to be enjoyed. For me there was just not enough scares and the scares that were there just weren't that scarey.The characters and acting are great but I just didn't feel scared throughout the film aside from at the end credit music which isn't a good sign.It also had some unfinished plot lines like with annabelle eg she just throws a chair at someone and then for the rest of the film she is ignored.Overall it was fine and a nice spin on the exorcist made in modern day but just not scary enough and not new enough to be great for me.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This was my first Horror movie in the movie theater,"I have always seen these at home, but the big screen, loud noises and total darkness just makes this so much better :) I haven't seen his earlier work like Insidious (but am going to now for sure), have seen Saw but that is something different in my mind, this was a very classic horror movie, the build up, the suspense, the revealing and the fast end (horror movies tend to have that).The acting, the characters, the music, the scenery it all fits very well together in this one, we get a good introduction to both the Perron and the Warren families and both have their own small pieces of the big picture, but also kind of separate stories within. I didn't sit on the edge of my seat, but I did jump a few times, this was a classic horror story telling with the music that plays a big role in the build up and the sudden reveal of ""something"" that makes you jump.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"It's all very familiar and very obvious, but The Conjuring has good characters and a construction of horror done by a talented director","The script based on the so-called true event focuses on trying to give a theoretical basis to the manifestations through classes, lectures and dialogues between the characters, putting in doubt what is truly real. The writers, Chad Hayes and Carey Hayes, experts in horror films, are in charge of passing on important information so that we understand what is happening and what could happen. It is a narrative arrangement that offers, with didactics, several possibilities for succession, without worrying about fulfilling each one. Research and religious findings emerge with emphasis on the idea that they are demonic possessions, there is even a brief historical portrayal about the action of Catholicism in these cases.The ""documentary"" tone that director James Wan uses at first, as if we're in front of an investigative TV show about the Warrens, with a pedagogical introduction before the credits sheet, helps make Evil Summon not just a face. Facts-based terror, but mostly a climate of disaffection. What is the dark presence responsible for frightening the residents of this house that exists since 1736 and brings back many memories? Through careful investigation, secrets will be revealed and narrative twists will demonstrate that films with exorcisms in their structures still work well, when competently directed and narrated.After several strange happenings, including unexplained bruises, Carolyn believes her new home is haunted by a shadowy presence. So she asks the couple for help so they can live in peace again. The tale of a family who moves to a house far from the city and encounters a supernatural entity is something that is well known to the general public. Fortunately, what Summons of Evil lacks in originality is in quality. In this way, it is particularly impressive how new the feature film looks, even when using familiar concepts.James Wan is a fan of the genre and here his passion is almost palpable. His respect for the classics is reflected in the construction of the characters that inhabit the story. He understands that horror movies only work when they have well-developed and charismatic characters. This is because the spectator will only feel compelled when, effectively, he fears for the people on screen. Otherwise, the (possible) deaths/tragedies will have no impact and the cinematic experience will be irretrievably affected. In that sense, the Warrens function exceptionally. The opening scene is quite competent in introducing them in order to demonstrate to the audience not only their qualities in the field of paranormal investigation but also their solicitous character. Still, it is happy to cement a world that works beyond what is happening on the screen, which would eventually lead to Annabelle's short story, the first spin-off of the saga.Much of Summon of Evil's success is due to its director's talent for generating scares and terrorizing the audience. The script is not so original, at times it resembles many other films but the main highlight is how the director builds the atmosphere of tension, without resorting to fright. This climate is very well worked throughout the film, mainly because of the camera game that James Wan makes, very similar to Insidious. Unlike the other, this one focuses more on suggestion than on fright, and almost the entire film is built in an atmosphere of tension.With the correct duration, Wan is in no hurry to introduce us to the Perron family, he makes us care about each member of that family and we are also suspicious and witnessing a growing scary happening. Everything on time. From the family dog that doesn't want to enter that house for some reason, until we see a foot being pulled by something unknown, we hear strange noises in the house, doors opening apparently without anyone being around, doves with their necks broken by simply passing by. From the house, a powerful meaty smell that may indicate something in the house, etc. Not to mention bruises that appear out of nowhere and increasingly, the behavior of the daughters of the family, the discovery of an attic that apparently someone didn't want to be discovered by anyone else again, among others.As for the characters, names like Farmiga and Wilson bring with them credible personas, for dramas that have already starred in movies or on TV, but it is Lili Taylor who is Wan's trump card. She has the frailty of great horror movie moms like Ellen Burstyn in The Exorcist or Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby - not the frailty of a victim, but one who, despite her best efforts, cannot cope with one. Devil alone. In these movies mentioned, possession serves as a metaphor for the challenges of motherhood, and Invocation of Evil is no different. There are five daughters, after all, of different ages and profiles and moods, as the script by the twins Carey and Chad Hayes makes a point of making a difference in the scenes of change. There are also five times more chances of everything going wrong in a house designed for that. Finally, it is always good to highlight expressive actresses'/child actors, in this case in the figure of actresses Joey King, Mackenzie Foy and Kyla Deaver.It may seem obvious, but to be effective a haunted house horror depends on a well-chosen house and, above all, well filmed. The setting in Harrisville, Rhode Island, looks pretty generic from the outside - trees flanking the property, a murky lake ahead, as usual - but gradually the townhouse, made up of rooms with double doors and lots of openings, shows that it has "" personality"" itself. Precisely because it is an isolated place, the audience knows from the beginning that there will hardly be any outside help, increasing the anxiety that the film conveys. In this sense, the mystery about the entity that haunts the family is well explored, with revelations made at the right time, so that the outcome is cathartic and quite satisfactory.For the construction of the terrifying atmosphere, the team relied on the production design of Julie Berghoff, who was very efficient, in particular, in the composition of the sets by Sophie Neudorfer, spaces carefully erected to make us preserve the feeling of fear and demonic domination. These elements work even better because of John R. Leonetti's centered photography direction, along with Joseph Bishara's musical direction. It's the creaking doors, howling air currents, responsible for giving the room a mysterious atmosphere, rocking chairs that move frantically and alone, and the usual scares caused by what James Wan considers the recipe for a successful horror film: the manipulation of sound, elements that make us ""see"" the ""invisible"".The way in which the producers and direction worked on the materialized formation of the hauntings was a very interesting point that caught the viewers' attention, causing the perfect tension climate to provide several scares. It was simply all part of the house, through an omnipresent shadow or presence, we see the supernatural lost among the furniture, making it not remain in place. All this construction made unnecessary any music or sound effect to create the pre-jump scare suspense atmosphere, showing that even a cut that shows the paralyzing of clocks has a psychologically disturbing power, which achieves total harmony with the camera's floor.What also baffles the viewer is something else: it is being introduced to this house in a hospitable, attentive way, with traveling plans, from room to room (the wide depth of field always leaves the objects in the house in focus), so that later we have this stolen comfort: the film's editing uses the number of doors in each room to bewilder us, and the multiplicity of angles (camera sometimes on the ceiling, sometimes upside down) and perspectives (camera over the shoulder of the mother, the father , of the daughters, it's too many people in a place that doesn't seem big enough anymore) finishes the job. The sheer volume of information in the frame - when everything is in focus, everything can be a source of fright - makes the viewer behave as in 'Paranormal Activity'-style ""surveillance"" terrors, which depend on the viewer's attention to everyone. The details, to work. The difference here is that James Wan avoids the formalism of these terrors of today. Wan uses the well-known jump scare. However, he does so sparingly and always with the aim of increasing (even more) the sense of tension in the story.Considered as one of the best horror productions of the contemporary generation, the universe of Ed, Lorraine, Annabelle and the other members of this battle between the celestial forces, human and demonic, gained derivative productions. It's all very familiar and very obvious, but The Conjuring at least isn't as unnerving as certain current horror movies incapable of even giving a good scare. The jolt comes from time to time, whether it's honestly achieved with the development of the tense climate, or pulled out by forceps with editing techniques. Subverting forms, the film unfolds with surprising clarity, since it doesn't leave much in suspension, resolving itself in its limitations. James Wan is creative, varying scenes of deep tension with others of tender lightness, both photography and art direction fulfilling a bleak universe. Finally, we inevitably compare them to similar works and note how much better The Conjuring is precisely because it is serenely objective and rustic, carefully thought out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Conjuring Universe,"I have just entered this universe with the release of Nun II (I've been busy lol). As so I have decided to review all the films in one place.The series has highs and lows but overall it is a very entertaining place to visit. So here we go...The Conjuring (2013) sets the standard for the franchise with its masterful blend of atmospheric tension and genuine scares. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga shine as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, anchoring a story that grips viewers from start to finish.Annabelle (2014) serves as a chilling spin-off, delving into the origins of the malevolent doll introduced in ""The Conjuring."" While it lacks the depth of its predecessor, it still delivers effective scares and showcases the creepy doll's sinister presence.The Conjuring 2 (2016) continues the Warrens' saga with another spine-tingling case. Director James Wan crafts a haunting atmosphere, bolstered by strong performances and compelling storytelling. The film's focus on the Enfield Poltergeist case adds layers of intrigue to the series.Annabelle: Creation (2017) improves upon its predecessor, offering a more polished and terrifying exploration of the Annabelle mythos. Director David F. Sandberg expertly builds suspense, delivering a rollercoaster ride of frights that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats.The Nun (2018) expands the Conjuring Universe with a sinister tale set in a remote Romanian abbey. While it boasts impressive visuals and an eerie atmosphere, it falls short in terms of narrative coherence and character development, relying heavily on jump scares. It does however enjoy one of the best looking baddies in cinema history in my opinion.The Curse of La Llorona (2019) marks a departure from the main storyline, focusing on a Hispanic folklore legend. While it offers a few chilling moments, it ultimately feels disjointed and formulaic, lacking the depth and originality of other entries in the franchise. Despite some debate its absolutely part of the universe.Annabelle Comes Home (2019) is a solid entry into the Conjuring Universe with inventive scares and a solid cast. Set in the Warrens' home, the film delivers spine-tingling thrills as the possessed doll unleashes chaos. Despite some pacing issues, it's a worthy addition to the series, offering fun and thrilling horror for fans.The Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021) takes a different approach by exploring a real-life murder trial involving demonic possession. While Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga continue to shine as the Warrens, the film struggles to maintain the same level of tension and scares as its predecessors.The Nun II (2023) Loved it! One of the best entries in the universe. Its powerful, interesting and has many great moments. It shows there is plenty of life left in the series.A bit like Star Wars there are discussion on how to watch the movies, release order of chronological order. For me its always release order, otherwise where is the surprise over who is Luke's daddy :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Another unimaginative plot. That aside, the movie was very impressive. 7/10","As with most movies directed by the famous man behind Saw, James Wan, The Conjuring is pretty horrifying. The general mood and lighting of the movie is perfectly thrilling, and the secrecy of what is haunting the house is so brilliantly executed that you will be kept on the edge of your seat during the entire movie.As for the story of the movie, it was unoriginal, and felt like you were watching the tenth remake of some paranormal activity spoof. Especially since it is less than three years ago Insidious was released, which was another movie with a VERY similar plot, also directed by James Wan. I get how this haunted house/family plot really contains room for a terrifying and thrilling story, but it is hard to understand why it has gotten so overused recently as the horror genre is known for being imaginative, unpredictable and innovative.Generally this movie was really impressive. It kept a suspenseful and horrifying theme, and right from the beginning it felt as if the movie would consume you and drag you right into the middle of the action. The acting in this movie is nothing less than great, and the way the characters are portrayed is probably the best in any recent horror film. While you may once or twice think ""Why would you go in there alone?"" as in most scary movies, the characters are actually somewhat intelligent, non-skeptical and generally pretty likable.Jump scares and heavy gore are not really used in this movie, and as the story progresses the suspense of fearing the unknown is more than enough to keep the viewer paralyzed as the events unfold. Keeping the audience this scared in a paranormal activity-like movie without the use of jump scares is quite a feat, unaccomplished in most recent horror movies.Why should you watch this movie? If you are looking to pee your pants you are in the right place. The Conjuring is probably one of the scariest movies that has been released in the last five years. It is also one of the only recent horror movies that actually has likable characters, which is incredibly important if you want to feel as if you are inside of the film, taking part in the horrible events. However, if you have seen all the late supernatural haunted house films, and have gotten bored of the plot long ago, there are quite a few movies out there, which you should rather watch.Helix' Horrible Reviews",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

An instant classic,"This is definitely one of the best horrors I've seen in ages. I loved the fact that it follows the classic horror movie formula, one which directors these days seem to be moving away from with all the 'torture porn' and 'found footage' films that have been so overdone lately, and it's a formula which genuinely works, hence why it's been followed so many times. The film felt like it was paying homage to older classics such as The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist etc. One of the best techniques used in the film has to the be the fact that you don't actually see anything scary for most of the film, it's just the threat of what it could be that scares the viewer – scary noises and doors opening by themselves seem to be enough to invoke absolute terror and suspense. The acting is top quality and captures the feel of the 70s really well. It felt like a really authentic account of events which supposedly took place in this house. The character development between the 2 couples in the film is really powerful and you really feel for all of them. There were some minor cheesy moments, but the rest of the film makes up for it and I didn't even mind them, in fact they added to the charm of the story and I felt like I was a kid again watching a horror movie for the first time.

"Better than AMITYVILLE, not up there with THE EXORCIST","Based, the credits tell us, on a true story, the unhappy house-buying experience of the Perron family in Rhode Island is played as a serious docudrama, not as a piece of hokum, which helps to give the movie some credulity. The two female leads are particularly solid: Lili Taylor as the mother fighting to save her children and Vera Farmiga as the ghost-buster with special ""gifts"". The make-you-jump moments do what they're supposed to and look more like old-fashioned special effects than over-egged CGI.There's nothing like an old-fashioned haunted-house movie. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY has decided to become another cheesy franchise.

Actually a much needed addition to the haunting/possession genre...,"""The Conjuring"" is actually one of the better haunting movies that has been released in the past many years, far surpassing those ""Paranormal Activity"" in every way (especially as this is not a 'found footage' mockumentary).The movie is about the Perron family who move into an old house in a rather idyllic verdant setting. But it doesn't take long before things start to happen; odd sounds and minor things happening around the house. But these quickly escalate into something horrible and the family have to seek out the Warrens to help them investigate into the strange happenings that is taking place in their house.The storyline is nicely composed, quickly establishing solid characters and building up a sense of suspense that quickly turns into dread. The movie does make good use of lighting, environment and shock effects to scare the audience.The poster brandishes ""based upon the true case files of the Warrens"", well, as much as I do believe in the supernatural, these events here were just a bit too out there. But still, it made for some rather good movie entertainment.As for the people hired to play the various roles, then I will say that they all did good jobs with their given characters and roles, and everyone contributed something to their characters and to the movie as a whole.The movie is quick to get into gear and stays in high gear all towards the end. And speaking of the end, I am not particularly fond of those kind of happy Hollywood endings, but hey, it is a crowd pleaser. And the ending is one such that you see coming a mile away - unfortunately.Ultimately, if you like ghost, haunting and possession movies, then ""The Conjuring"" is definitely a movie that you don't want to miss out on, as it is one of the better of this particular genre to have graced the screen in the last couple of years.""The Conjuring"" gets a well-deserved 7 out of 10 rating from me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Lazy scares,"The conjuring came out in 2013. It's not too over the top, perhaps until it's final act, but it does feature many many of the usual standard horror cliches. There's not much original in here but the there is some good craft and acting. You have the dark creepy basement, the cold house, strange smells that come and go, the dog that's smarter than the humans, waking up with bruises, people vanishing from view, lots of exposition, we are quickly introduced to all the key characters. Clocks stop, we get the static TV, Knocks and bangs, quiet, quiet quiet, bang, trace like states, stroppy, screaming girls, dead animals, kids with imaginary friends, the I'll handle it honey dad, use of mirrors, at the end the birds attack. The film at least has the dignity not to the dream sequence.There's lots of handheld camerawork and the usual look horror films have now, a bit low light and lacking bold strong colours. The Piano that plays itself...I'd love it to be a guitar or bongo, that would be hilarious. Light bulbs blow. There's a strong emphasis on the women and girls in danger vibe. Somehow a film about a load of grown men and teenage boys being scared to turn off the lights, wouldn't be scary more comical. The film is fairly restrained early on but loses it at the end, with people flying around the room, witches running around the house. In a weird way the opening scene is probably the best bit of the film, telling the story of how three young people having a terrifying experience finding that while out of their home they return home to find things have been happening in their house while they've been out. This sort of comes back into the story later but in a small way. They play with the idea that perhaps the doll might have escaped, though thankfully this fear proves unfounded, a scene of the doll running out the house and down the road would be pretty silly I'd have thought. Another problem with the film is that the central house the story takes place in seems to have all these extra doors, rooms, basements, secret tunnels, it's ridiculous. How big is this house?The film takes itself so seriously too. I can see why this film did well, appeal to the general horror market, but also religious fundamentalists who really do take all these demon battling stuff literally. Another big problem is that the scenes, while some people may find them scary, they are just short, to build up any real tension or dread. Take a film like Django Unchained, it really knows how to build up an atmosphere of tension and dread at points. There's a long tense sequence maybe 20 minutes, the villain abusing his slaves, while the husband must sit by and watch without losing his cool, unable to reveal his identity, things get even more sinister with the crazed sadist, starting to become suspicious and beginning to threaten them. We just get these very short, 2-3 minute max scenes though.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not the best horror movie in 30 years but it is a push in the right direction,"Every time a new horror movie comes out it is either labelled as a) based on a true story or b) the scariest film in thirty years I am sorry but although this is actually somewhat based on a true story it is not the scariest movie in thirty years, that belongs to a different film entirely but it's all a matter of opinion and we are here to talk about the Conjuring. There is no need to talk about the plot because I am sure you have heard/seen it hundreds of times already (especially within the last five years) What the Conjuring does do effectively is spin a fine tale of horror something that most horror movies these days have forgotten to do. The characters that inhabit this god forsaken house are the pillar to what will make the movie work for anyone going to see it, if they fall flat then you will most likely not care.Most of the scares are things you have seen before but that is to be expected since this movie has been done hundreds of times just under a different coat of paint.The Conjuring is a step in the right direction for the genre for now and is a better piece than Insidious. James Wan can film anything and make it look beautiful and is able to weave a sense of dread from the moment the movie starts.Go see it for yourself instead of watching any trailers (really don't watch them they spoiled the movie) its not that scary but it is some good entertainment for a summer horror flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best horror movies I've seen in a while.,"This film was easily one of the scariest films of the decade,from ""Saw"" to ""Insidious,"" horror filmmaker James Wan's films have always been confrontational in their guileless grand-standing. So it's not surprising that watching ""The Conjuring"" is like getting a tour of a haunted house attraction from someone that pushes, and pulls you through every room.The Conjuring is a 2013 American supernatural horror film,Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators try to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in their farmhouse. Forced to confront a powerful entity later the Warrens find themselves caught in the most terrifying case of their livesI don't have to write a long review on this. I can sum it up in a few words: the most terrifying film I've ever seen since the Exorcist (1973). I love horror movies, been watching them by myself since I was 12years old and I have to say, do not see this alone like I did. The acting is good, the special effects (when necessary) were good, the storyline was fantastic and the movie came together well.I won't deny that the story isn't completely original, but it doesn't stop the film from being great 
The Conjuring was released in the United States and Canada on July 19, 2013, and received positive reviews from critics. It grossed over $319 million worldwide against its $20 million budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror films of all time.

A modern throwback to classic horror.,"It's been a relatively weak year so far for horror films. The Conjuring has been on my radar now though for awhile, and one of my most anticipated movies of the summer. Not to mention all the hype and positive reviews it has been getting. Director James Wan is back behind the directors chair after the successful horror film Insidious. Clearly this man loves horror films and has such a gift for setting up scares and tension. Something this genre really lacks. James Wan in my opinion is one of the best things to happen to modern horror. So does The Conjuring hold up to all the hype? The short answer is yes and no. This film to me seemed to be a mix up of insidious mixed with a dash of dead silence and the exorcist. The Conjuring takes it's time and slowly builds up tension. The scenes are set up great, and a lot of tension is felt. The problem however that while the tension is often high, the scares tend to be predictable mostly, and less effective then in the film Insidious. The two films are comparable in terms of scares however I thought Insidious was more effective on scares. With that being said however, The Conjuring seems to be a lot more focused and consistent throughout the entire film. It is a good film, however there are no new tricks here. We have seen this movie before, however director James Wan has a few tricks up his sleeve, and can create great build up. The Conjuring falters a little bit at the end, and tends to get a little cheesy and perhaps a tad overboard. Where as in Insidious it felt more in place (however some will disagree). Bottom line is this is one of the better horror films to come out in the past little bit. It offers nothing new but is a great throwback to older horror films. It's best too not watch the trailer and go into this film without knowing much. Casual horror fans will love this, but horror veterans may not fully buy into the hype. Not overly scary, but none the less a solid horror flick. Hopefully James Wan can continue his hot streak with Insidious chapter 2 in the fall. Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Glad I watched this!,"This was a treat.A real classic of the haunted house/demonic possession genres. It has been said that it compares to ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Amityville Horror"", which is not far off. For me, ""The Conjuring"" lacked some of the poignancy and depth of ""The Exorcist"", but for all that, it never descended into self-parody.Not excessively gory, your nerves are nonetheless on edge throughout, as early as 15 minutes into the film. Solid performances all round, good pacing, some nice cinematography, and a horribly effective soundtrack all help to deliver the goods. To be watched alone in a dark house!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Commercial overrated crap,"This movie was horrible... I can't understand why people review this as a good horror movie, I just had to laugh with some scenes, it was terrible... I tried to give the movie 5-6 chances while watching it, so I watched it until the end... but left me unsatisfied... clearly Paranormal activity was a lot better than this sh1t. Why couldn't they be subtle with this movie? I had the feeling they tried to take the ""paranormal"" to a really stupid/ridiculous level. But thats just my opinion.But at the end of the day, there's only 1 good horror movie for me, thats 'The ring'",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A favorite, for sure... Watched it many times.","James Wan unknowingly set out to make a movie, based on the terrifying events that surrounded the Perron family. Little did he know, he set the gold standard for what a modern horror movie should be. The Conjuring is perfect. The movie follows the events that took place in the early 1970's in Harrisville, Rhode Island. One of the daughters, Andrea Perron, has confirmed the film's authenticity. But, unless you've lived through it, no movie can do true justice to the horror they lived through.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were perfectly cast as real life demon hunters, Ed and Lorraine Warren. The family members also find a way to really sell the terror. But the real star of this film is James Wan. His clever use of camera work while also building suspense is masterful. This isn't the first time I've seen this movie, yet I still found myself captivated, terrified and impressed. The brilliant use of unnerving, but not corny, music to help drive up the heart rate is genius..... James Wan pulls from our real life fears and utilizes them to maximum effect. He shows that there's no need for a CGI world or over the top special effects. What happened in this movie was loosely based on true events, which makes it absolutely terrifying. All he needed to do was to bring to life the stories this family told. He needed to implement a sense of dread that was relatable to us in the modern day. Who wouldn't panic if they heard something creeping around their house at night while they slept? Moreso, who would keep their cool if someone was yanking you out of bed?The Conjuring is perfect, and has earned a spot amongst the greatest horror films ever made. It delivers on every single level. It doesn't make you wait too long, and it certainly doesn't overstay it's welcome. This movie truly terrified me. If you haven't seen this film, you're in for a treat. If you have seen it, I highly suggest a revisit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Every great horror cliché - but in a good way...,"I have just watched ""The Conjuring"" in a fairly deserted screening, with popcorn in toe I was ready for a good ride and this film did not disappoint. From the chilling first scene and opening credits to the final gut wrenching hurrah ""The Conjuring"" is a thoroughly entertaining trip down well tread horror moments. Although the picture is packed to the brim with clichés and takes a lot of great hints from other classical of the genre, despite this, each cliché is executed well and occasional gets a good scare.Apparently based on a true story ""The Conjuring"" follows the Warrens; Ed and Lorraine, as they embark on the most disturbing case of their ghost hunting carriers. This case was apparently so scary that it is only coming to light now. Ed and Lorraine specialise in driving the daemons that possess your house away. However, a previous case had lead Ed to believe that his wife may not be up to it. The clairvoyant Lorraine see things that others can't be it a nice day at the beach or a horrific hanging. Meanwhile, the Perrons are moving into their new home, quickly however, things start to take a darker turn. The family begin to hear bumps in the night and discordant chimes from the basement. Their only option is to find the Warrens and convince them to rid the house of evil; but can the Warrens rid the house of dread and save the family from their demise?""The Conjuring"" is very enjoyable. Although it may be sporadically scary rather than constantly on the edge of your seat it is still a lot of fun. Also, for me it was refreshing to be scared without any of the modern tropes that seem to follow modern horror around; found footage, gore and stupid teens. This new movie takes its marks from classics. The title card is basically from ""The Exorcist"" however, the blood red is replaced with a sickly yellow. The central characters and narrative centre around children and their connection with the afterlife, although this is not obvious in ""The Shining"" it still plays a large role and ""The Conjuring"" seems to play off this fear of children well. That is not to say that this film is just a rip off, no, there are some genuinely frightening scares and some original moments. There just seemed to be something about the setting and characters that reminded me of a lot of other films; ""The Conjuring"" is set in the mists of the seventies and it shows perfectly in the costumes and sets. A lot of people have already hailed this movie as a future great and although it is great I can't see people watching this in fifty years........For the rest of the review visit kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""The Conjuring"" = ""The Haunting"" + ""The Exorcist"" - 20 IQ Points","""The Conjuring"" did scare me, but twenty minutes after I left the theater, I'd momentarily forgotten that I'd just seen it. While I was watching it I got a little bored and some scenes tempted me to laugh. If you've seen 1963's ""The Haunting,"" 1973's ""The Exorcist"" and 1944's ""The Uninvited"" you've seen three much better films from which ""The Conjuring"" gets its bag of tricks.Probably any clever film student could make something like this movie. We all know the basic ingredients: a large, old house in an isolated setting. The house should be attractive but something about it makes it ugly. It's in New England. It's autumn: cold winds blow skittering dead leaves. An innocent family moves into the house. The family is generic, without too many details; they are All-American and the audience can identify with them. They do normal things like go to the beach and watch ""The Brady Bunch.""Their new home contains many dark and dusty nooks and crannies. There are antique curios that look a bit menacing.Suddenly, during a quiet night, a strange noise is heard. For some reason, no one in this family ever switches on normal lighting. Rather, they use weak flashlights or match flames.An innocent child arises from bed in a long white nightgown. She moves slowly, slowly, slowly, down a dark hall to investigate the noise. The scene is very quiet, very long, and very repetitive. You know that eventually the innocent child is going to come across something unusual: a vision of a hanged person, the reflection of a ghost in a mirror, or something truly terrifying, an IRS man there to conduct an audit.You know that at the same moment that the defenseless family member sees the unusual thing, the previously silent scene will burst with sudden, loud, and oppressive noise. The sudden vision and noise will startle you, and you will be scared. What you paid the ticket price for. Oh, and the family dog dies, birds act weird, and mom is bruising easily.At first, of course, everyone in the house writes off these events as mere chance. Everyone is rational and is not tempted to believe in the supernatural. Eventually someone in the family levitates or clocks stop or people feel cold or something. Just like in ""The Haunting,"" there are loud banging noises. Just as in ""The Uninvited,"" a family member is possessed by the dark energies of the house, and there is the ghost of a bad mother and a not-so-bad mother. Just as in ""The Exorcist,"" there will be an exorcism.So the team of experts is brought in. They speak some ancient language like Latin and possess arcane knowledge. I won't tell you any more because that would reveal the end of the movie to you, but I bet you can guess.I'll just say that at one point, the satanic shenanigans in the house reach fever pitch. Satan is beating the stuffing out of these poor fools. Any sane person would immediately evacuate. At that point a paranormal investigator, Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) says, ""Leaving the house won't help because the dark spirits have attached themselves to you."" OH COME ON. Vera Farmiga may as well have said, ""You can't leave now because there's still forty-five minutes to go in the movie.""Vera Farmiga is a scintillating actress. She electrifies every scene she is in. Patrick Wilson is perfect as her husband; they have great chemistry. The movie wastes them, though. The filmmakers don't seem to realize that Farmiga's human depth and complexity are the best thing the movie has going for it, and utilizing that human power would have made their film a classic, rather than just another ""Boo!"" movie.""The Excorsist,"" ""The Haunting"" and ""The Uninvited"" are all scary but they are also deep. They present big themes. ""The Conjuring"" avoids big themes. One character tries to kill another, and it's the kind of killing that makes your skin crawl. The movie makes no attempt to plumb these murky waters.""The Conjuring"" misrepresents evil and Catholicism. When the Warrens arrive at the haunted house, Lorraine has a rosary strung from her wrist. Ed Warren places little wooden crucifixes around the house. In the exorcism scene, Latin is spoken. This isn't true spirituality; it's fetishism – the belief that objects and rituals possess supernatural power. They do not. Only God has power. I am a Catholic, I pray the rosary, and I believe in Satan. The force that defies Satan is not an object, a rosary, it is rather faith in God.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Old-fashioned spine- chiller,"These days it is harder to find a good horror movie than be a presidential candidate. The amount of sheer dross is staggering. ""The Conjuring"" is really an old-fashioned ghost/possession spine-chiller. There is an innocent family and not so innocent house in, of course, New England (where else?). Peaceful countryside, rickety old house with appropriate noises, and the vengeful former inhabitants. And all of this could have so easily slipped into the bad symphony of clichés, but for a steady hand of a smart movie director named James Wan. With a right amount of old, reliable tricks, but put together with fresh hands, it gives a jolly good scare. The only blemish is ever so sweetened ending in an old moronic Hollywood tradition. God forbid something doesn't get neatly wrapped up. That would be the end of the silly world we know.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Vidiot Reviews,"The ConjuringThe worst part of living with a male ghost is he leaves his ectoplasm all over the toilet seat.Fortunately, a feminine phantom haunts the family in this horror film.Carolyn (Lili Taylor), Roger (Ron Livingston) and their children (Joey King, Shanley Caswell, Mackenzie Foy, Kyla Deaver, Hayley McFarland) move to a new home in Rhode Island.After a number of attacks from unseen attackers, the homeowners invite paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson) to visit and assess.Lorraine instantly gains a psychic impress of the original owner - a supposed witch who tried to sacrifice her child - and recommends an exorcism.With credible portrayals of both the clairvoyant couple that probed the Amityville house and the pair who owned it, The Conjuring keeps its scares simple but highly effective.Incidentally, no matter how much you clean your house beforehand, clairvoyant guests can always see the mess.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"As an avid fan of horror, I found this extremely disappointing.","OK, to begin with, I have been a member of this site for six years, and only come on to review something if I think it's utterly amazing. This movie has such a high rating that I felt like it was time to toss in my two cents, and for the first time because of how BAD a film was, particularly when considered in light of how GOOD it's SUPPOSED to be. And I am not just going to bash on it; I have thought out reasons for why I disliked it.I do in fact think that the lead actress (whom I enjoy in other things as well) did a good job in her role. I find it pertinent to mention that I am, was, and always will be willing to give movies a chance which have been ""done before,"" plot-wise. For instance, I think the plot of random killing of innocent folks as they try to protect themselves from within a house has been done plenty of times, including in The Strangers - but I still thoroughly enjoyed You're Next, which is in a similar vein. I also in no way shape or form demand that a horror movie be extreme in its delivery for it to be genuinely scary or worthwhile. Session 9, for example: fantastic in my opinion, with very little blood. The original Pulse, as well. Although that one's not scary the entire time, there are some scenes that really unnerved me.With these precursors, I'll continue with what I think are some legitimate drawbacks in this new possession blockbuster.First of all, I do not understand the R rating.No one dies. No one gets seriously hurt. Unless I'm mistaken, no one even swears in this movie - which again, does not MAKE a movie for me, I'm not 10 years old - but let's face it, the way that people talked even as far back as the '70s (the time period in which this is supposed to take place), people simply were not that squeaky clean with their rhetoric. Normally I'd be able to look past this because it's neither here nor there as far as the story goes, but it just seems to throw the vibe off a bit for me considering the lack of physical danger that the characters find themselves in. Or don't, I suppose. Which leads me to my biggest problem with this movie.I, for one, did not feel a sense menace when it comes to the evil which plagues the characters. Maybe I'm jaded, maybe I've seen one too many horror movies, but it just wasn't there for me.In the beginning, I gave it a chance as I do everything else.By the time the first 75 minutes ran out, I was beginning to wonder if there would be ANYTHING that would truly make me feel as if these people were in danger. Personally, I found myself feeling disappointed.To be clear, that does not mean that if I were in that situation and saw a girl who was definitely possessed, tweaking, and causing supernatural occurrences that I wouldn't see that as dangerous; particularly if one considers spiritual danger. My point is that I never felt like the characters were in any PHYSICAL danger. If there were more attached to legitimize the spiritual elements of terror maybe I could've gotten into it, but it seemed like the same regurgitated crap that only bible thumpers and closed-minded religionists would find scary. As proof of as unbiased of an opinion as possible, I'll state that I intensely enjoyed and was scared at certain points by both the Exorcism of Emily Rose AND the original Exorcist, despite the fact that I'm not even a Christian.And to elaborate on those statements, I suppose I'd like to add that frankly the evil they face didn't seem all that powerful. Sure, there's some of the typical fare for movies like this (i.e. creepy faces, etc.), but in reiteration, nobody gets hurt really whatsoever. Most of what happens to Lili Taylor's character is a bunch of writhing around and stuff floating as far as that's concerned, nothing more.It's for these reasons that I'm downright astounded that this movie got and has RETAINED a 7 star rating on IMDb, which I generally trust. Hell, it's the reason I went and saw this two hour disappointment. I'm not sure anyone will read this review, but it's definitely geared toward huge fans of horror. Trust me, if you really know what a good horror movie is, you'll think this one sucks. At most, it'll leave a bland taste in your mouth.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A rare horror movie that earns its R-rated stripes on scares alone.,"In a time where horror movies are truly not so good anymore comes THE CONJURING. The first horror film in years that I could call a classic. It's also maybe a rare find, by that I mean it has to be the only R-rated movie that has the lowest body count as well as no sex, no gore and no swearing. It also thankfully doesn't fall into the annoying teen horror category. It features a group of characters you do start to care and feel for.Final Verdict, I have to give credit to James Wan and everyone involved,They've created a movie with a very dark and edgy atmosphere and for a horror film to be able to earn its R-rated stripes on scares alone is certainly a show of great film making talent.

Maybe I've seen a horror movie without any sexual material (no any nude scenes or sex scenes or any such language) for the first time.

Chilling...,"In a heart-wrenching turn of events, Rod and Carolyn were devastated to discover their beloved pet dog lifeless, shrouded in an enigmatic aura. Little did they know that this was just the beginning of a haunting ordeal that would grip their lives.

Desperate for answers and a way out of this terrifying predicament, they reached out to the renowned investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. With their expertise in the paranormal, the Warrens offered a glimmer of hope, a chance to unravel the mysteries and restore peace to their shattered lives.This film draws inspiration from actual supernatural events, taking cues from the infamous 'The Amityville Horror Story' investigated by renowned paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren. The acting is top-notch, with characters showing significant development throughout the storyline. As the plot unfolds, eerie occurrences begin to happen swiftly, creating a sense of unease and fear.

The Conjuring,"James Wan's penultimate film before leaving his horror roots to direct Fast and Furious 7, The Conjuring (notably based from a true story) is a take on a typical ghost story that manages to be both unnervingly familiar and yet surprising and ultimately satisfying.The plot surrounds two 'Ghostbusters' Ed and Lorraine Warren who are requested to investigate the Perron family's new home in which various supernatural activity has been taking place. The film echoes many aspects from similarly themed films; a dog that will not enter the house, noises from under beds, birds that slam into the exterior of the house (something that we saw only months ago in the vastly inferior 'Dark Skies'). This bird-suicide sequence feels oddly out of place, perhaps due to the unconvincing CGI that depletes the sense of genuine fear throughout the characters.However; Wan's influence manages to combine the remaining aspects to keep the film from feeling anything but stale. Played completely straight, the film feels like a classic horror flick, which undoubtedly can be partly down to the excellent performances from the cast, especially from Patrick Wilson as Ed. The production design of the house is as effective as the performances inside of it, contributing to some of the most terrifying and intense moments of the film, including a figure immersed in darkness looming behind a door, and a game of 'hide- clap-and-seek'.John R. Leonetti's cinematography is again excellent, especially within the prologue and climax of the film which enhance the film's beauty while revelling in its ugliness. Had it not been for the sequel to Insidious in the pipeline, James Wan would have left the horror genre with an immensely haunting piece of work.Verdict: 4/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Just great!The Conjuring is just not a typical horror movie, It gives a whole new idea that makes it so theoretical to me and. I am convinced that supernatural creatures do exist.

The satisfactory ending touched me so much, and tears flowed on my face uncontrollably, which is very unusual as I was watching a horror film, and not a touching historical epic! What amazes me is that the film does not rely or even require cheap scares such as loud noises or gory scenes. Instead, ""The Conjuring"" builds scariness by suspense and a very good plot.

It would have been more interesting if they added video footage of the actual event at the end of the movie.,"It can be said that the film, which is claimed to be based on real events, does a relatively good job in its genre.

Other than Ed and Lorraine, the other characters have no depth or development. There are some boring dialogues.

An invisible man sleeping in your bed,"Before I saw The Conjuring I heard a lot negative complaints that it was merely ""cattle prod cinema"" which I inferred meant a lot of awful stingers were the only thing that would make the audience jump. This horrible cliché has been overabundant in many so-called ""horror"" movies for a good while now and I my expectations were low.Thankfully, there are no stingers. Yes, there are scares and jumps, but the score is completely unobtrusive and there are no cats jumping out of closets or phones suddenly ringing. James Wan knows that atmosphere, cinematography, suggestion, and the unknown can build suspense and horror, and the Conjuring has plenty.Apparently based on a true story (which I am extremely doubtful of, but not completely disbelieving) a happy family of mom and dad and five young girls move into a large farmhouse bought at a low price from a bank auction. As soon as they cross the threshold things are not quite right and the property reeks of pure, menacing evil. Eventually they call in the help of a local ghost-hunting couple to document the case and research its history.It was the early 70s, the real Ghostbusters (pun intended) were still in college.About 80% of The Conjuring works. The dread, the suspense, and the inability to comprehend what is really lurking in the darkness of the house makes for great horror. The girls see...something, but we don't. It's a lot like Robert Wise's The Haunting, which is kind of ironic since Lily Taylor, who plays the mother, was in the 1999 remake of that movie, which was full of all the worst horror clichés and set-ups, as well as excessive CGI. It's like Taylor wanted to set the balance straight by doing a movie that took the opposite, and more intelligent, approach.John R. Leonetti's photography is very slick, with lots of slow, creeping shots, but I couldn't help but think that a rawer edge, with exploitation lighting, would have helped it look a bit more authentic. There are a bit too many slamming doors scares too, and towards the end it goes off on a completely pointless tangent with the Annabelle doll and does absolutely nothing with it. For the bulk of the running time The Conjuring seems original and groundbreaking, though in the last act it's a jumble of Blair Witch, The Exorcist, and What Lies Beneath.The positives still far outweigh the negatives, and I still recommend the film to horror fans. If only we had a version of The Amityville Horror that was made this way instead of that horrendous 2005 movie. No doubt there will be numerous sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Lights on or off this will make you jump,It has been quite a few decades in my opinion of true horror genre films that completely exemplify the meaning. Not since Salems Lot has there been a more gripping and terrifying film. The creator and mind behind the Saw franchise has completely turned the horror genre back on in full force. There are some similarities between this film and Amittyville but the structure of this film just grips the audience. The editing and the general ambiance or feel of this film just gives the viewer goosebumps and tingles. I was amazed at the story and how effective the acting was from Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. Lilli Taylor is amazing as the mother and keep your eyes on the kids in this film as they have great chemistry.

Overrated,"I heard nothing but rave reviews about this flick and unfortunately it just didn't deliver for me. There was a lot of build up and suspense in the first two thirds and outside of a few scares in the last third of the film, I found it lacking. For it's nearly 2 hour running time, I kept waiting for it to really thrill me liked it did many others who've seen it, but it just didn't happen.To the film's credit however, it relied less on gore and genre clichés and more on traditional horror elements such as a creaky door here, a dark corner there and a few ""there's something in the mirror!"" moments. So in that sense it was really well made. I also thought the score was *incredibly creepy* (sigh, if only the film had lived up to it). I did enjoy it, but it's no where near a horror classic. If you're into a more traditional, old school horror flick it's worth a watch though.Enjoyed my review?

The Exorcist of modern times,"The Conjuring is indeed a very, very positive surprise. I would honestly say that director James Wan succeeded in what could be called an Exorcist of current times. What makes it so good and original is that it presents a classic horror haunted house style for the first half (in a very well directed fashion, camera is perfect, such as color), then studies and analyses that horror through Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's characters: a couple of expert ""demonologists"". So, James Wan focuses on ambiance, suggestion, and, most importantly, characters (Lili Taylor is very well also), and is able to reenact the mood of the 80's horror is a very effective and entertaining fashion.

One of the Best Exorcism/Possession Films Since the Exorcist and Poltergeist,"First off, I do not believe there is enough scientific evidence to prove the existence of demons and evil spirits capable of infiltrating homes and bodies to induce the blender to spontaneously make milk shakes or stimulate hall clocks to reset themselves to a particular time. So I view The Conjuring as a great story, inspired by and loosely based upon a real case study of a ""haunted house"" which Lorraine and Ed Warren investigated and eventually interpreted as demonic possession. (Their other famous case, the so-called Amityville Horror has been under much dispute and scrutiny since their original investigation, which may have been an elaborate hoax.)Without having done any background research, I hypothesize much of the events as depicted in The Conjuring were exaggerated for dramatic affect. If you can put aside the idea that this is a ""true"" story, there is much to enjoy for supernatural horror film buffs. Carefully timed scenes make you jump from your chair, similar to ""The Shining"", which is something I haven't experienced in a horror film of this sort since ""The Sixth Sense"". Also, the film is not too ""bloody"" but relies more on its scare tactics.The story is loosely based upon the real-life investigation by the Warren's of a house owned by an American family, the Perron's, in the early 1970's. The film begins with one of the Warren's other cases, the so-called Annabelle doll case, before cutting to one of their lectures on paranormal investigations at a university. The main story thread focuses on The Perron's, a married couple and their five daughters, who move into a house in the countryside in New England. Almost from the beginning, they experience some strange occurrences in their house. The first tip-off is an incident with their dog, who doesn't wish to enter the house. Then creaking doors, strange knockings, and glimpses of apparitions terrorize the family at night, which also fosters the somnambulism (i.e. sleepwalking) of one of the daughters.When the house becomes nearly unlivable because of the nightly disruptions, the mother Carolyn Perron (Lilli Taylor in an absolutely convincing performance) tracks down the Warren's. They agree to investigate employing a combination of ESP on the part of Lorraine Warren and technological tools via cameras and tape recorders. As they continue to learn more about not only the recent history of the disturbances, they learn the history of the house which tells many secrets. In particular, two supernatural centers for the unrest are unused basement filled with antique furniture and an old tree near the creek slightly away from the house.While I don't think the Conjuring should be taken seriously as a true-to-life story, it's a horror-fest roller coaster ride. The directing and camera work create the perfect balance of frights, suspense and horror to keep you watching to the next door creaking, relieved when the ""thing"" appears then vanishes. The supernatural malevolence is only gradually revealed, as it should be, until the final denouement. As a horror film, it works well and deserves a place alongside some of the other films of its type, such The Exorcist (still the best film in this genre), and Poltergeist. Simultaneously, is this really how the incidents unfolded in real life? I doubt it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
SUCH A GREATEST HOROR MOVIE EVERR,"This movie is a legit spooky ride. It's got that classic haunted house vibe with some serious jump scares that'll make you jump out of your seat. The story's based on real-life paranormal stuff, which adds a creepy layer of authenticity. The cast, especially the Warrens, really bring the chills with their performances. The film does a great job of building tension and keeping you on edge. If you're into horror flicks that mess with your head and give you the heebie-jeebies, this one's a must-watch. Just make sure you're ready to sleep with the lights on afterward, and this movie is my fav horor movie filmmm!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Really well-done and eerie,"I don't get scared often, or even really jump at most jump moments in most horror films, but The Conjuring delivers on its premise. It's not terribly original, but its scares don't hit you over the head and don't feel dumbed down. They're well-done, and the characters are well-written and so it brings in that extra dynamic to the table. The acting is also pretty great from all involved, Vera Farmiga being the stand out especially and unsurprisingly. Every time I see her I expect greatness and I get it, and I haven't even seen much from her. She's pretty fantastic and she gets some meaty material to work with and delivers the goods.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Delivers The Goods,"Is it THAT scary? Well uh, no.Is it scary? Well actually, yes.The Conjuring is what it claims to be. A fun ghost-ride. It ticks all the haunted-house horror-show stories with a brief nod at exorcism films.Good acting, exceptional horror direction and a real attempt to connect the audience to the characters (good script and decent actors for a change) make this well above the norm for the horror genre.So is it anything groundbreaking? Definitely not. Is it a fun night out that delivers actual scares? Oh my yes. Probably the scariest part is the prologue about Annabel but that's OK. The film still managed to sustain an atmosphere of unease throughout and I was quite happy. Plus, a scary prologue goes a LONG way in a horror movie, as anyone who saw the original ""Halloween"" where the first 5 minutes are by far the scariest can tell you.I think the word I am looking for here is ""competent"" but that's not often a given in the horror world.p.s. As for the ""based on a true story"" stuff. Uh-huh. Sure. Whatever you say.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mostly scary,"As the film progresses it gets a little too manic, and a little immature, which is a bit of a let down because there are parts of it that are really scary. The atmosphere of much of the film is terrific, and the imagery is very disturbing. Hide'n'clap is a brilliant concept, and indeed it's the demon hidden in the shadows that is the scariest thing of all. Rather like with Jaws. And as with many horror films it slightly loses its way as it seeks to ramp up the tension. Unnecessarily in my view. The tension was there all along. The trick is to sustain it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"an excellent horror film, James Wan has outdone himself!!!!!","it's not original, nothing new and you will find 100 films who have a similar plot but what really made this movie a very good horror film is the fact of the extremely well crafting of the movie, the cast, the script and the direction, the best thing that this movie did is taking the standard elements of horror films and transcending them into a very high level, if we think of it the story of the movie has almost everything a supernatural could include (haunting, demonic possession, exorcist, paranormal investigator, witch, scary doll and the most important thing is a creepy atmosphere), James Wan successfully managed to put all those elements in a one very good horror film",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Entertaining, but in reality nothing like that happens","No human soul is a bad soul. They might touch you or move things, but won't physically harm you, especially if it is a soul of family or relatives. Sometimes people get so scared, they actually think souls want to harm them. Entities is not souls and yes, they do cause a lot of mess from time to time. They do not live in houses normally, they only come if the portal get's open. Souls do not possess human bodies, demons could, but these are not human souls either. Religion has nothing to do with possession, it doesn't protect human from that in any way. There are special rituals that are performed during exorcism ritual, but these has nothing to do with Christianity. Places can be haunted, people can be cursed and people can die, but not from the direct hand of the dead ones, like it is shown in this movie. They would die from diseases, insanity, etc. So when you actually know how things work in reality, watching film like that makes you laugh, because of how absurd some scenes are. And it is supposed to be a horror film, not a comedy. I wish for once they could actually show more reality and not just various nonsense purely to entertain viewers. Plus many scenes are just like in other similar movies (flying, vomiting..) so it is very disappointing, that director or writer couldn't come up with something fresh. P.s. Proper mediums would see and be able to communicate with the dead ones and be able to see why strange things happen in house. You don't have to dig archives to find out what is what, if you really have the ability to see more than the rest of the people. In this film Warrens look like an absolute amateurs, hope they weren't in reality. The only film that is decent in terms of esoteric science is The Skeleton Key.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
James Wan Takes Things Old School,"""The Conjuring"" is a film that knows it's scary. Right from the start, the orchestra plays violently in the background while the ominous logos of WB and New Line appear on screen, much like the opening of ""Insidious."" So are the filmmakers cocky or confident? With a film this well made, does it even matter? One thing I know for sure is this: ""The Conjuring"" is one of the most impressive horror films I've seen in awhile.With his directorial debut of ""Saw"" back in 2004, James Wan has since improved as a filmmaker, although faltering from ""Dead Silence"" and ""Death Sentence."" ""Insidious"" was a noticeable improvement, but darn the second half of that film. Now, with ""The Conjuring,"" it seems like Wan has found his sweet spot, even though it does embark on familiar territory with ""Insidious"" and other horror films made in the past like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Amityville Horror."" The similarities the film shares with ""Insidious"" is particularly apparent and slightly disappointing, from certain plot points and even down to some of its characters. However, unlike ""Insidious,"" the film actually does get better in the second half. ""The Conjuring"" is also the most recent horror film in memory that puts a lot of attention to its characters. The film takes much effort to make the characters feel like people, not expendable pieces of meat to higher the body count.For example, there are five daughters in this film, each with their different personalities, and you will be able to tell the difference between every one of them. By doing so, you truly care for the characters when they're in danger. It also helps that you have talented actors to play these roles, especially the female leads, Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor. Farmiga plays a character who is empathetic with an emotionally wounded past, but that plot point is so understated that it brings a sort of dignity to her role. Taylor is equally as impressive, if not more so than Farmiga, as the motherly figure. In one very effective scene, she may bring a tear to your eye.""The Conjuring"" doesn't set out to do anything groundbreaking, but the familiar tricks it does, it does really well. While nothing new, what sets the film apart from most other horror films is the restraint. ""Less is more"" is the motto here, and some of the film's best scares are those where you see nothing. The way the story plays out is also very unexpected, with a structure that probably hasn't been done in other horror films before due to the ensemble cast (there are 11 people in the house at one point). It was a risky move to have such a large cast, but it worked out wonderfully. However, to play ""The Conjuring"" up as the ""scariest movie ever"" is silly and does the film injustice. Is the film scary? What's ""scary"" is subjective. I personally wouldn't get nightmares over it, but there are some great scares in here. Regardless, horror films rarely come as good and beautifully crafted as ""The Conjuring,"" which is why it should be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's Worth A Watch,"Take a haunted house film, add a Satanic witch, splash in a possession and pepper it gently with Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" and you'll get ""The Conjuring"".

Seen it all before.,After the first 20 minutes i realised that i had seen this film before a number of times but under different names. This may have been based on a true story but that story has been done so many times before that it's just tired and predictable. I fell to sleep after about 30 minutes of this movie (a first for me at the cinema) and i think that sums it up. As i have to write a minimum of 10 lines to get this review on IMDb i would like to ask how this film has a 7.9 rating?

"A rare, well made horror movie...","You're reading this because you're a horror movie fan and are dreaming of a good horror movie to come along that will truly give you a scare. I personally didn't believe it was possible anymore with the market saturation of crappy horror films, and every possible twist and scare tactic already used.But with that said, this is one heck of a good movie. There are a few jump scenes, a few hair raising scenes and a few spine tingling scenes, all nicely mixed together with great acting from everyone in the movie. It's so hard to find a horror movie with great acting, and this one truly delivers.Scariest movie ever? No. Every horror movie uses that line in their advertising. But this one is worth the trip for those that love a good horror movie. It holds none of the typical intestinal spilling, gore driven, or machine hacking sick things Hollywood usually dreams up for most of their horror movies. I personally detest those type of movies as they are just disgusting junk for brainless twits with a fourth grade mentality.The Conjuring thrives with solid, great acting, a good haunting/possession storyline, and most definitely some tense, and sometimes scary scenes. I have read the negative reviews of this movie, and I can only say that each one of them sounds like wanna be critics trying to ""act"" as if they know what they are talking about, or people that just love gore and didn't get their addiction fed.Everyone I know personally that has seen this movie has loved it, and I'm glad they recommended it to me.

This one will wear you out.,"It's been a long time since I've had so much fun at a horror film. The emphasis on tension and downplaying of gore pays off in a big way here. From the director of SAW, that may seem a bit surprising, but it really isn't a 'disgusting' film. My friend actually hurt her elbow while watching it -- from flailing around in her seat. I just kept cackling at how well the frights were being set up. And when was the last time real, good actors appeared in a horror film? Vera Farmiga is dynamite. What a delight. Grab some friends (who don't mind being grabbed constantly) and belly up to this flick for a great time at the movies.

Almost Great,"This movie is not your usual throwaway trashy slash flick built strictly to take money from teenagers with nothing better to do. It has all the under pinning to be a horror great. Was it full of cliché? Yeah. Clearly this was part of the design, so it didn't bother me. But despite the fact that they did the detailed work to make it look like 1971, despite the great cast, they tell you it's November in Rhode Island and the leaves are full and green in the trees. That's just one example of the laziness that plagues this almost great horror flick. Just have a clue and call it September! There are so many details that just don't get integrated into a coherent whole. Where the locket come from? Did it come from the high security room full of ""manipulated objects?"" If not where? And what is the point? And who was sitting with the doll in that room? This movie threatens to be very dark in a few spots and, well, . . . it's Hollywood where the East Coast is just a foreign vision where the leaves are green in November. Was there a more interesting original story that got chewed up and digested for the screenplay babyfood? See this movie and enjoy it.

"Thoroughly enjoyable with a sequel on the way, and quite possibly a franchise.","""The Conjuring"" is an enjoyable, spine-chilling paranormal saga directed by James Wan (""Saw"", ""Insidious""), and it has already been given the green light by New Line Cinema for a sequel before the first installment has even hit theaters on July 19. A welcome throwback to classic 1970s chillers, with spectacular production design work, a well-constructed script, impressive atmospheric set pieces, and rounded out with terrific performances from Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. The film primarily utilizes the old bag of tricks for scares very effectively, creating a terrifying atmosphere of bloodless scaremongering.Set in the 1970s, ""The Conjuring"" tells the story of husband-and-wife demonologists Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson), and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), who are best known for their case involving the Amityville Horror, and are now investigating the secluded Harrisville, Rhode Island home of Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston.) The family has recently moved into the house with their five daughters (Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy and Kyla Deaver), and have begun experiencing a series of unexplained occurrences. Lorraine immediately detects that something isn't right in the house, and the pair conclude that the Perron's home is possessed by multiple demons, with their initial investigation revealing that the trouble may have begun as far back as the Salem Witch trials. Meanwhile, the Warren's presence enrages whatever is within the house, and the supernatural activity escalates to terrifying levels.James Wan and his group of frequent collaborators are clearly well in sync for ""The Conjuring."" The film nods its head to everything from ""The Exorcist"" (1973) to ""The Amityville Horror"" (1979), while developing an atmosphere of trepidation, with well- timed scares that will keep viewers on the edge. All the ingredients of a standard paranormal story are present: a haunted and secluded house, a peaceful family being terrorized, strange noises in the night - and its all-familiar territory. However, the film is so finely tuned, it comes across as a respectable homage to the genre. It's reassuring to see a genre film that contains a compelling story and has interesting characters, rather than serving up a number of teenagers ready to be tortured.""The Conjuring"" is primarily intended as a haunted-house attraction, a ride through a hall of nerve-racking horrors. Wan's direction is perfectly paced, pulling off some properly scary set pieces (a game of 'hide and clap'; some business involving a mirror and a music box), and slowly ratcheting up the tension. The frightening escalation of events gives a permanent tension in a feature film that is certainly predictable, but smoothly conducted to satisfaction.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Obviously, it is possible ...","... to make a beautifully photographed (camera work is fantastic and deserves 12) and directed movie (10 until last two minutes, when it drops to 3, with a ""romantic music theme"") around an utter and complete religious BS. The ""truth"" of this story is as real as zombies and vampires. BS comes from the religion (as a phenomenon) and especially Catholicism itself (or any form of Christianity, for that matter), being the largest mass murderer and pedophile organization in human history. Radical Islam tries but there's a lot to do before they get even close. As in - before Latin language and Vatican no evil existed and therefore no exorcism was possible. Christianity is the only ""entity"" eligible to judge right from wrong and good from evil. But, people love to be scared (especially by fruits of a malevolent imagination) and I suppose this movie delivers in that sense using all filming tricks in and out of the book. Acting is also good, considering. And I felt sorry for the dog (Sadie). That' s about it. Good watch (most of it), popcorn may occasionally fly around the room and make a mess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An old school horror that frightens without cheap thrills,"""The Conjuring"" is a 2013 horror movie by James Wan. It features what is claimed to be the true story of a family haunted by a demonic entity in their new house in Rhode Island. Their story merges with that of two famous ghost-hunters who take to heart their situation. Although a ghost story is maybe the most overused narrative trigger for a horror movie, Wan manages to direct a film where the usual thrill providers (doors squeaking, childish voices whispering, hand out of nowhere and everything else) are used in a stylish and well paced way, thus incredibly managing to feel as fresh as the first time you've experienced it. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson do a great job as the explorers of the supernatural, delivering some heartfelt performances. The feel of the movie is very classic: it's clear that the director tried his best to make the audience feel like watching an old-style horror flick, and that mostly works, with explicit references to ""The Exorcist"", haunted house movies in general, and even ""The Birds"" by Hitchcock. I also enjoyed the duality of the story, taking its time introducing a seemingly unrelated side-horror tale about an extremely creepy doll, Annabelle, whom apparently people keep in their houses although it gives chills just by looking at her. Anyway, ""The Conjuring"" is a rare well-crafted horror movie in these years, so it deserves a round of applause for trying to keep the genre from collapsing. I'm still bedazzled by the fact that this movie and the god-awful ""Dead Silence"" share the same director: an example of how important is the screen writing in a movie, especially a mystery one like this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't Turn Out The Lights...Ever,"The house in ""The Conjuring"" has issues. As in, don't-look-under-the- bed-and NEVER-go-down-into-the-basement, issues. Not in a long time has a movie come out that had me cover my eyes and dread the night ( OR daytime, for that matter). I'm a scary movie veteran. At 48-years old, I have seen them all. But, for those of you too young to remember, ""The Exorcist"", and, ""The Shining"", movies that for their time, terrified audiences across the nation, this movie can rightfully take its place right up there along side them. If you're expecting a bloodbath-gore- fest, this movie is not for you. This is the real deal. There are ghosts. There are, ""other things"". There are bumps in the night, ( MANY). And, there is a family that takes us right along with them into long dark days and nights.This is a haunted house.Based on a true story, something a lot of movie studios use as clever marketing ploys to get you into their movies, what sets this apart is that this family really exists and their claims of being brutally terrorized for TEN, yes you read that right, TEN-YEARS,(between you and me, I would have been OUT of there after the first incident) not by Jason or Michael Meyers chasing them with machetes, but doors creaking open by themselves ( who among us hasn't experienced that and just pushed it off as ""the wind""?) and sounds of someone walking upstairs when you know no one is home but you. Believe me, that is TAME compared to what comes after.Carolyn and Roger Perron, and their 5 daughters, move into a remote farmhouse that has a lot of bad mojo surrounding it. Someone claims that houses don't have memories? Right. This one does: quite a few. Within a day, these memories become reality. Unable to cope with the escalating horrors that ensue, they bring in, Lorraine and Ed Warren, real-life paranormal experts that have seen it all, until now. What this family is desperate for is some sense of understanding and just plain help. What happens from then on is all-Hell breaking loose. The reason behind why the doors slam and bad smells wake them up at night, is uncovered almost immediately. Believe me, this doesn't bring anyone, including you, any relief. This house and it's ""inhabitants"" are mad, REALLY MAD. Hang on to your seats people, you're in for a ride.Why would I like a movie that truly frightened me and had me, a mom of 3, sleeping with a night light on and my feet covered up, (you'll never sleep with them any other way after this)? Well for those of us who believe, and a huge population of the world does, it's a fact that in the history of this world, there have been incidents that show us that life doesn't end at the grave and what can come up out of that isn't always warm and fuzzy. This isn't your deceased grandmother leaving you a sign that she loves you and is waiting for you on the other side. Do your homework. If you search right, you can find many credible examples of real-life haunting's from all over the world and the people who survived them, and unfortunately, those who didn't. I won't tell you who in this family survived to tell the tale, lets just say I'm glad I wasn't a part of it.This was the best $11.50 I have spent in years.And when that door creaks open and you blame the wind?

Just didn't like it,I found the movie to be way to religious for my taste and boring to say the least. I'm not saying the movie was horrible as it had decent acting but I felt it could do without the heavy handed religious elements but of course it had The Exorcist feel to it but it fell far too short for my taste to The Exorcist in scope. The religious Christian elements basically was a done deal for me.At one point I also found myself rather bored with the plot and got annoyed how it jumped around so much that it felt disjointed. Maybe if they tried to focus on the plot rather than preaching Christian values and trying to get people to baptize their kids I would have found this movie to be funner to watch.,4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

There is something evil in this house in The Conjuring,"When director James Wan burst onto the scene with SAW he clearly had a unique vision for horror, but who would have thought he would be the one to step out of the torture porn genre to some truly effective haunting films with Insidious. Now he is taking on the subject again with his latest The Conjuring featuring a great cast including Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor, and Ron Livingston, but can he hit the mark again or will it be a haunting in itself?The Conjuring follows paranormal investigators in the 1970s who work to help a family that's terrorized by an evil presence in their home. What starts out as a simple investigation turns into the most terrifying case of their lives. This is not only Wan's best horror film to date, but one of the better of the haunting genre to come along in years. The story is crafted perfectly with a slow build but is well-paced delivering an excellent horror film. The look and vibe screams the 70s and there is something about these stories taking place during this time that just enhances the overall experience. The performances are all great with Lili Taylor stealing the show later in the movie delivering some creepy memorable moments. The directions they take showing the escalation of the haunting are a true pay off as they escalate brilliantly. There are some moments here that have been seen in other films of it's kind, but Wan handles them some perfectly they almost feel like new territory giving this film the perfect classic nostalgic tone while also giving fans something that feels fresh.This is one of those horror films that may not terrify the hardcore horror fan, but is sure to entertain anyone that understands and respects the genre. The average movie goer is sure to leave the theater creeped out at the least and is sure to carry some aspect of this film with them to haunt their dreams. There is already talk of a sequel and these characters are perfect for a franchise as long as they continue to pay close attention to the details and format used here to create a perfect horror film that is sure to become a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"It's Brilliant, One of the Best Horror Films Ever Made","It's facts may not be as direct as they seem, as with the case of many films based on true stories, but The Conjuring exceeds on behalf of films like it by telling it's story not only in an entertaining and incredibly horrifying light, but also by it's pure technical genius at the hands of horror genius James Wan. It's one of my all time favorite horror films, and by far it's the best film Wan has been involved with. In the past he has started many great horror Franchises, including the legendary Saw franchise and the Insidious franchise (of which I'm a bit more fond of personally). The Conjuring is more than able to stand on its own with it's creative screenplay and brilliant display of horror. Wan writes the characters not only as they are, but also with a depth we so often lack within modern and many horror movies in general. The cinematography is excellent and the score is brilliant. The casting is on point, with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga being the obvious standouts, and Ron Livingston, Lili Taylor, and Shannon Kook providing excellent supporting roles as well. In the end, The Conjuring is a masterpiece of horror that only gets better with age, and truly proves to be a modern classic.My Rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is a good horror film but a more interesting film with this material is possible,"Outside of Hide-and-Clap being one of the dumbest things I have ever seen in a film this is a fairly intelligent horror film. The characters basically act like human beings. There's little jumps in logic. The irrational elements are contained to things that would be unexplainable, i.e. The demonic powers that be. The Warren's home life getting a subplot helps round out the characters as well. So the script is pretty good for what its aims are.But I wish it aimed for something higher. The Warrens are frauds and a film that grappled with that would be interesting to see; far more interesting than a better than average haunted house story. Because the production is interested in making a horror film the Warren's ""case"" files are treated earnestly-despite two of their best known cases being definitive hoaxes. Which would be ok if the film didn't lean into the ""true"" story nonsense and including the rote trope of the unbeliever being converted. (The sheriff's deputy in this case). I guess I would like to see a 100% grounded take on the Warrens-not just a horror film using them a veneer of authenticity.With all that said, the film as a horror experience is quite good. Wan understands that less is more in horror (well at least in this movie) and much of the film's joys are the atmospherics. It is very old fashioned in how minimal the effects elements are. The acting-esp. Wilson-is also a lot better than in most horror films.This is fully realized genre filmmaking. I wish it tried just a bit to transcend that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Evil Loves Innocence,"The Conjuring is a 2013 supernatural horror film that's good enough to keep your attention, and entertaining enough to make you want to see how it ends. The plot follows the same formula as any other ghost or possession movie, but brings with it some original concepts as well.The characters are likable and the acting is good, The scares although not entirely creative are very effective, and the movie overall leaves you feeling like you did not waste your time.Is it the best in this specific genre of horror, no.

"Very good, but a tad too long","I did think this movie was very good, but still kind of cheesy. I didn't feel really that it was scary, and it felt kind of underwhelming. I felt the acting was good, but not Oscar worthy. The characters were not anything interesting, but I did find it very entertaining overall! The movie is definitely better than average, but I wouldn't say its better than any bad horror film I've ever seen!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"boring, inconsistent, and funny","This movie is nothing more than a boring, random collection of ""creepy"" scenes. No effort is made to connect these scenes with an actual, coherent story. So in honor of that, my review will be a random collection of my thoughts on the film. No effort will be made to turn it into an actual, coherent review.I get the distinct feeling that the filmmakers made a cynical bet among themselves that they could make the most derivative, stupid, self-contradictory piece of crap, and as long as it looked nice and could make you jump a little, then they would have a hit. Judging from other reviews of this film, they seem to have been correct.The movie is called ""The Conjuring"" even though there is no actual conjuring that happens.The first ten minutes is about a doll. It's too bad the doll has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie because that was the best part.The movie has something to do with a nice family that moves into a nice house in nice 1971 and is terrorized by something supernatural. It might be ghosts of dead children, or ghosts of people that committed suicide, or witches, or demons, or all of them. Since the screenwriters just stole ideas from other movies and threw them into this script, they clearly didn't worry that the movie makes no sense.This movie even copies ""Paranormal Activity"" (which was itself a copy of other movies). Is it a coincidence that the same guy directed both of these movies? Basically, ""The Conjuring"" is really just ""Paranormal Activity 1971"".The movie is partly about Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are real people that used to hunt ghosts and demons. They are most famous for being involved in the Amityville Horror, which was discovered to be a hoax (although this movie doesn't tell you that). There is a melodramatic subplot about how they want to retire, but they love each other too much and are too committed to their mission from God, so they can't quit. And they do get to explain the supernatural events to the family with lines like, ""Sometimes when you get haunted, it's like steppin in gum—you take it with you.""I learned two things from this ""true story"" - First, the women in the Salem Witch trials were actually witches, and they worshiped Satan. Second, the Pope has to approve all exorcisms, and he doesn't like to help possessed people if they aren't Catholic.While watching the movie, I was trying to keep a mental list of stupid things that happened. But there were too many - I literally lost track of them. I even started laughing towards the end, because the characters seemed to have lost any contact with real life and were just running around making the dumbest decisions they possibly could.There are a couple of jump scares that still worked, and the cinematography was nifty. The groovy 1971 fashion is fun. So it doesn't fail 100% of the time. Just 97% of the time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A textbook case of how NOT to direct a film,"Cinema has gotten worst year after year, decades after decades. We now live in a time where all films are pretty much on the same level: terrible and replicas of movies done before.Someone insisted I watch The Conjuring with them, telling me how good it was.The #1 issue is the incompetence of James Wan. Whoever he is, it is obvious he is unable to create a story in visual terms. The camera is CONSISTENTLY in the wrong spot or moving for no valid reason. If a character is looking under a bad or up a flight of stairs, to film this character FROM that place tells us there's nothing to be afraid of there since the camera is standing in that very same place. This ultra basic psychological technique which has been adhered to since Hitchcock is broken pretty much every chance this inept director gets.There is no suspense or genuine scare. You jump from loud noise, cliché moving doll crap and the annoying camera-work keeps getting in the way of the mood they are trying to achieve. Pitiful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Solid, but signals a well-worn genre","James Wan, the creator of 'Saw' and 'Insidious'- and the significantly less successful 'Dead Silence'- brings us 'The Conjuring'. Seeing as these types of horror films have become more prolific it was only a matter of time before they began losing freshness; that is solely what damages 'The Conjuring' for me, regrettably.There are numerous aspects of this film that have been done many times before in other movies, such as 'Sinister', 'Paranormal Activity' 1-4 and Wan's own 'Insidious'. With that being said, they are accomplished remarkably and effectively well here. The problem lies with how there is only so much you can do with one sub-genre, and 'The Conjuring' marks the first time I have noticed these elements beginning to stale no matter how well executed.Was I scared? Absolutely! In that way the movie succeeds 100%, especially in the second half. Never is it unintentionally funny, and the cast is as excellent as their performances- Vera Farmiga particularly. Although also somewhat familiar, the story behind the 'haunting' is pretty well done considering it can be a snagging point in these types of horror films.'The Conjuring' signifies the need for a change in this horror sub-genre, and despite being executed brilliantly and having a perfect cast, too many aspects are overly familiar and worn- out- still, I won't be getting much sleep tonight.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great Timing, Interesting Story, Even Better Acting","The opening interview was pretty cheesy, but the rest of the movie was very entertaining. Patrick Wilson accompanied by Vera Farmiga did stellar work as the Warren family. The pace of film was just right and the ""encounters"" throughout the film were accomplished quite splendidly as well. Don't particularly think this is something I'll watch again unless I forget certain parts and need a refresher, but it is something I'd suggest to anyone looking for a good possession film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Decent period genre piece,"Based on the allegedly true experiences of real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, The Conjuring features converging storylines, which combine the typical tropes and aesthetic of haunting films with documentary style depictions of the Warrens' investigation. From the film and audio technology featured in the investigation sequences to the warm color grading of the movie as a whole, which evokes the color film stock of the early post-Tenchicolor era, the film's artistry evokes its 1970s setting, separating it visually from other, more desaturated horror movies of the 2010s. However, the often overwrought, bassy, atmospheric soundscape of its era does prevail.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
well done old fashion scary movie,It's 1971. Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) with their kids move into a farm house. Strange things start to happen. They call in married paranormal investigators Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson).This is an old fashion haunted house scary story. This is no big twist or slasher porn. This is a rather straight forward ghost story. It hearkens back to films like Amityville or Poltergeist. All the actors are spot on. The tension builds nicely throughout the movie. My only complaint is that the ending is slightly too hectic and runs on a little but that's a very minor point. It's barely worth a mention really. It's great to have an old fashion horror done well.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Genuinely Scary Throwback to Old-School Horror,"It's been quite some time since I've seen a film as seriously creepy and spine-tingling as the paranormal horror film, THE CONJURING (2013), from director James Wan (Saw, Insidious). It's a film that taps into your darkest fears of the supernatural, not with grotesque gore (which I don't mind in certain films), but with a slow build up of spooky, foreboding atmosphere and psychological dread achieved through extended silences, eerily long camera moves and expertly timed reveals. This is not only one of the best supernatural/haunted house films I've ever seen, but one of the best horror films of the last two decades.The film stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Ed and Lorraine Warren, a real-life married couple and paranormal investigation team who were also involved in the case of the haunting of the DeFeo residence in Amityville, NY which became known as The Amityville Horror. The couple has amassed a collection of thousands of case files throughout their years of investigating the supernatural. Lorraine is a clairvoyant who experiences visions of past events and present demons upon entering a haunted residence. She has a gift (though some may call it a curse) that allows her to see things that other people probably wouldn't want to see. Ed Warren does not possess the same clairvoyant gift as his wife, but he is just as knowledgeable about everything paranormal. Ed has the distinction of being the only person not ordained by the Catholic Church who is authorized to perform exorcisms.The time period is the 1970s. After giving a lecture at a local college, Ed and Lorraine are approached by a concerned woman (Lili Taylor) who claims that after moving with her family into a new home, they have begun to experience bizarre and frightening occurrences. The woman, whose name is Carolyn Perron, asks Ed and Lorraine if they will come and have a look inside the house, and needless to say, what they find is not pretty. Ed and Lorraine soon take on the case and attempt to help the Perron family (the mother, the father played by Ron Livingston, and their five daughters) rid their house of the malevolent entities that have inhabited it.The primary highlights here are the stellar direction and expertly crafted scares orchestrated by the talented young filmmaker and horror maestro James Wan. The atmosphere is effectively eerie and foreboding at all times. Wan makes good use of uncomfortably long silences and lingering camera shots, creating suspense through fearful anticipation. On the surface it may seem that the usual haunted house movie tropes are thrown in, but ultimately it's not about what devices are used, but the fresh and innovative ways in which Wan uses them. The slow-burn pace of the first half causes you to become deeply connected with the characters, and by the time you arrive at the intense second half, you are fully invested in every twist and turn.The biggest standout performance in the film comes from Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren, the kind, soft-spoken wife and mother who happens to be frightfully tuned in to the supernatural world. The screenplay and Farmiga's performance do an excellent job of conveying Lorraine's overwhelming desire to help others despite the toll it takes on her both physically and psychologically. As Ed says in the movie, ""Every case takes a little piece of her."" Lorraine is an incredibly brave, strong, and intelligent woman who is also quite compassionate, especially to anyone with problems of the paranormal variety. Patrick Wilson's performance as Ed Warren is also quite good. Ed primarily follows Lorraine's lead when it comes to her visions and the things she picks up from entering a house, but he is very confident and knowledgeable in his own right. Ed is very supportive of Lorraine and looks out for her well-being first and foremost. He obviously wants to continue the work he does with Lorraine but is also concerned about the potentially negative effects it can have on her. They discuss this issue several times throughout the film. The pair makes an excellent team and they balance each other out quite nicely. Lili Taylor does a very good job as the loving and concerned mother of the haunted family, and Ron Livingston is excellent as usual as the laid-back, but also caring and concerned, father. I'm unfamiliar with the five young actresses who play the daughters, but each one of them delivers an extremely genuine and sympathetic performance while managing to bring unique traits to their characters. Through rich, detailed characterizations, we come to care deeply for everyone in the film.The sound design in the film brings the overall feeling of dread up several levels. A creaking door, a whispering voice, an eerie song from a child's toy, a loud CRASH, all expertly crafted to keep you on the edge of your seat, ready to jump a mile at any given moment. Every song on the soundtrack oozes 1970s vibes and manages to capture the mood and feel from that time period flawlessly.THE CONJURING is a rare horror film in this day and age. One with little to no blood or gore, where the main characters aren't teenagers. This film is all about a fear of the dark, a fear of the unknown. It causes you to confront your darkest supernatural nightmares by leaving a certain amount to the imagination, which is almost certainly worse than anything that could ever be shown. This film is a loving homage/throwback to horror films of old, and takes the foundation those films have set and creatively builds upon it. THE CONJURING is one of the best and flat-out most unsettling and frightening horror movies I've ever seen. My recommendation: watch it in the middle of the night in the pitch dark for maximum effect.http://www.themovierealm.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Based on true events back in the 1970,"First thing you notice with this film is that its based on true events, now you think here that OK its just a made up story for entertainment for shock & horror value for a horror film.Well you would be wrong, This is was a investigation that has never been told to media or anyone until now because of the Amityville haunting, this film is truly based on an investigation of a family that was haunted by some evil force when they moved in back in the 70s which also lends to one of the most famous paranormal investigation of the Amityville house haunting & a few other haunting in the area. Vera Farmiga & Patrick Wilson portray two of the worlds famous paranormal investigator's Lorraine Warren & Ed Warren which you can Google them they have done a lot of paranormal investigation through their life some of which were the most frightening to them.This film I kid you not is not for the faith hearted, it is one of the most spin chilling, disturbing horror films your ever see, that really insight your fear of the dark.it refreshing to see a horror film exactly scare the living hell out of you for once.

Only Improved with Ed and Lorraine Warren,"I have to say that James Wan is a massive positive surprise in Hollywood paradigm. He is multi-talented, super creative and have an intelligent way of directing and approaching filming. Bottom line - he's in reference in cinema and a honor and prestigious to Asian American community. With a vast experience in multiple genres, he can dominate them all - even horror - one of the most complex genres to build and make believable in a movie.""The Conjuring"" is, in my view, the icon of the horror movies of the 10's. A plot so successful that originated a sequence of exceptional movies on a billionaire franchise. The music, the sequence of events, the fact that is based on a true story - is all very well managed. But the great difference for good, in comparison with other movies from the same genre, is the presence of the demonologists Ed and Lorrain Warren. In fact, they are the most real-life story that was portrayed in the movie. With no speculation - the couple were well known for their work helping other people, with peculiar spiritual and mental problems and issues. So, more then the Peron's family story, that serves like a base and the ground zero for the script, my focus and what make me consider this film, was, undoubtedly the Ed and Lorrain Warren real lives being projected in a movie incarnated by two charming and amazing actors like Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson.Overall, I gave this work 7 stars out of 10, as a mark for a steppingstone movie in the difficult horror genre, especially this century.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the better horror movies... creepy and tense...,"I saw this movie. I thought at times about turning a light on because it was persistently creepy. The movie seems original and when you predict something will happen, it doesn't. Much of the movie is creepy and tense.There is one scene I do not think I will ever forget... and that is when a closet door opens near a blindfolded woman and then something else happened after that and I will not spoil it. That scene was weird and disturbing.The ghost scenes are genuinely creepy. Few scenes or situations seemed borrowed from other movies. For the most part, this movie seemed original and it's better than most horror movies.I give The Conjuring a honest 8 out of 10. A 8 out of 10 is the majority vote for The Conjuring on IMDb right now too and I agree with it. The Conjuring is not perfect, certain scenes could've been done in a better way certainly or excluded, but its a lot better than most horror movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A good film with very few criticisms,"The Conjuring had a budget of $20 million, this is quite a low budget for such a successful horror film. One reason this film became so popular because it was directed by James Wan, a well-known director of 'Saw' and 'Insidious' also the film was distributed by Warner Bros making it more successful because of its popularity. The Conjuring took 20 years to develop due to it being based on a true story, the element of it being based on a true story made it even more successful because true story films are becoming increasingly popular.My view on the film is mostly positive, I found that the jumpy elements of the film and the music is what made this film a horror. Although there has been a lot of 'paranormal' type films, this one stood out as the story was based on a real family, which are in the featurette 'The Devils Hour'. However, I disliked this film because I found that towards the end it became too alike 'Paranormal Activity' which made it seem almost fake.Overall I think this film did well, it stands out from other horror films and has become a huge success, I think the sequels will do well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A surprisingly decent 70s horror tribute,"A pretty good film, I do appreciate the attempts to emulate 70s horror through the cinematography and intertitles. Another aspect that this movie does pretty well is establishing the relationship between the characters, while the cast is quite large and most don't get a lot of screentime, you still care for them.The horror in of itself is kind of mixed bag, as it uses a lot of tropes you've seen in previous supernatural horror movies, and the rather intrusive score really doesn't help things all that much. That being said it's nowhere near as obnoxious as it could have been, with the exorcism climax at the end being a great source of creepiness, with how the possessed wife moves and all of the crows swarming the house.This is probably as good of time as ever to bring up the oh so iconic Annabelle doll, as it has become relatively synonymous with The Conjuring franchise itself, hell there are just as many Annabelle movies as there are Conjuring movies at this point. I don't find her scary at all, mainly due to her being rather overdesigned and trying way too hard to be scary, seemingly not understanding that the reason why the actual Annabelle doll is so scary to people is that it's a seemingly ordinary Raggedy Ann doll.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Another typical horror movie that shows promise, but fizzles into ridiculousness...","I noticed the surprisingly high IMDb score (which are becoming increasingly useless, but probably another topic for another time) and thought I'd check this flick out, considering it's not often that horror films exceed 7.0 on the IMDb scale. The film starts out promising, with a genuinely creepy vibe and some believable haunting ""events"". For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I won't discuss what happens, but nearly 3/4 through the film, the plot takes a hard left to Crazy Town. Even my wife, a much more forgiving horror fan than I, was asking me out loud if the filmmakers actually expected the audience to believe even a sliver of what was happening on screen. I'm still unsure why horror movies feel the need to go completely over the top in the absence of a decent plot, which this film had initially, but began to quickly unravel during the climax of the story. I still feel Poltergeist is the standard-bearer for ghost/haunting films, and this film doesn't even come close despite some talented actors doing the best they could with the material. This film is simply your typical ghost film, with an inexplicable ending. If you've nothing else to watch, give it a try, but no one should assume this film is any better than dozens of ghost movies released in recent years, and in no way deserves the 7+ IMDb score it currently holds.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Surprisingly good,"I'm not a big fan of horror in general, I can basically take it or leave it. I've seen the majority of the major horror films of the last 30 years and didn't expect this to be anything special. Boy was I wrong, every aspect of this film hits the mark, great use of sound, cinematography, great build up of tension, wonderful acting. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Most of the people giving it a 1 are either hating on it because they expected gore and special effects galore, or, and this one kills me, took offence at the religious nature of possession. I can't even begin to describe the irony and general lack of awareness needed to make that argument, but suffice to say, if you enjoy horror and have half a brain, this will not disappoint.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Entertaining mildly scary,James Wan is a great director and earns all his scares in the movie. And there are so e memorable moments of horror.

A good watch for fans of horror and definitely jumpscares will keep you very entertained. Ending falls short even funny to me. But enjoyable overall overhyped is best words.

The Conjuring is probably one of the most compelling horror stories I've seen in awhile.,"Please check out more of my reviews on www.themovieboy77.comReview: The ConjuringAs I sit in the theatre with my friend waiting for the movie to start, I see a bunch of teenagers walking in. I then reminisce of the times I've went to go see Horror movies, where i have a bunch of teens either laughing or talking throughout the movie. This would occur in The Conjuring, but it wouldn't be long before it would go dead silent and everybody would get lost in the story.The movie begins in the early 70′s with Ed & Lorraine Warren, two paranormal investigators talking to two young ladies and a man about the ""Annabelle Case"", a case in which a doll is possessed by a young girl who was killed in the home the three are living in. I won't give the rest away. The little you know, the better of an experience it will be.Next, we meet the Perron family. A happy family with no history of any demon activity until they move into their new home in Harrisville, Rhode Island. The next half hour will build up to the most terrifying story you will ever hear. Again, I don't want to give too much away.The acting is superb. Lili Collins is great as Carolyn Perron. Her performance reminded me of a young Ellen Burstyn from The Exorcist. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were also great as Ed & Lorraine Warren. They showed a lot of emotion and you couldn't help but be compelled to their characters.In the beginning of the movie, Ed Warren states ""We've been called ghost hunters. Paranormal researchers. Wackos."" in which Lorraine replies, ""But we prefer to be known simply as Ed and Lorraine Warren."" The two characters were more than just paranormal investigators. They were also parents. Their compassion for this family was the reason why you love the characters. Their willingness to help people and delicacy toward the case was just superb and wasn't played out to be some horror movie cliché. You could help but feel for every character involved.The film was unlike any horror movie you'll see. It didn't depend on blood and gore or jump scares to startle you. It was just a compelling and terrifying story with some visuals that may haunt your dreams for awhile. It felt like a 70′s horror movie. One that makes you want to sleep with one eye open.My only issue is the ""based on the true story"" aspect of the movie. There is a scrolling text at the beginning of the movie revealing the story of the Warrens and before the title card, there's text saying it's based on a true story. To tell a story through film, I believe there should be some sort of real life interviews or proof of the facts of the story. It'll make it feel more real and may have pulled me in more, which at the time, I thought wasn't possible but after thinking about it, I would have given this film a perfect rating if I saw some truth behind the story.James Wan, director of The Conjuring, has also directed the first Saw film and Insidious, which are two different types of horror films but are still worth the watch. I recommend The Conjuring to anyone who wants a good story and great acting. It is very scary but there's something about it that just pulls you in. It makes you craving more. One thing is for sure, I will be talking about this one for awhile.Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Clap clap,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Greetings from the dark move goers.Tonight's movie is the supernatural horror The Conjuring (2013) directed by Saw and Insidious alum James Wan. The film is based on the real-life experiences of a paranormal investigator who are Ed and Lorraine Warren and their involvement in the case of the Perron family, who claimed their farmhouse in Rhode Island inhabited inhuman entities. In other words, the place was haunted. The movie is the first instalment in what has become known as ""The Conjuring Universe,"" a film series featuring various supernatural and horror-themed stories.The movie is set in the 1970's and follows the Perron family which consist of five daughters who experience events which cannot be explained and believe there is a supernatural presence within their new home. Though the manifestations are relatively benign at first, events soon escalate in horrifying fashion, especially after the Warrens discover the house's macabre history.Without going into the history of the Warrens, whether it's a hoax or not - the movie is legit scary good. The jump scares from the demonic figure on the wardrobe jumping and attacking one of the daughters, to the clap scenes where the members of the family are playing hide and seek and to the possessed scene was super scary.The flick masterfully balances its jump scares, strategically placing them amidst the building tension throughout the story and uses practical effects along with superb acting to balance out the scary scenes, while it incorporates classic haunted house movie elements like strange smells, creaky doors, and ominous cellars, director James Wan adds his own touch, creating an atmosphere of genuine fear. The film's scares, ranging from mysterious bruises to intense hide-and-seek moments, kept me on the edge of their seats until the heart-pounding finale.What sets ""The Conjuring"" apart is its script, free from cheesy clichés and unnecessary filler along with the musical score which adds to the tension without relying on predictable shrieks, enhancing the overall experience. It also makes you question whether the ghosts are trying to actually help the family from the dark presence. The strong performances by the lead cast, including Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor, and Ron Livingston, elevate the film, making it a standout horror experience.The movie creates genuine dread using suspense and practical effects, rather than relying on excessive violence, I was literally hiding behind my partner during the musical box scene, waiting for something to happen or pop up. This demonstrates the success of the film, not only did it reinvigorate the haunted house subgenre but also provides heaps of scary moments without any blood or gore.Overall a great start to the franchise 7.8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't watch this alone! (seriously! : ),"I've always been a fan of scary movies... from a young age my favorite shows were 'Creature Feature' and 'The Night Gallery'... so I can't say that I scare easily; however, I watched this movie alone one night while my husband was out of town, and I was scared out of my wits!!! (in a good way... I highly recommend this movie). This is the best psychological thriller that has been made in years.This is a great film. It is extremely well made, well written, and well acted. It is based on a true story and, while I know that Hollywood takes great latitude with the 'true story' films in adding drama, I don't feel this one went too far at all. Only enough to skillfully depict what a truly frightening this experience must have been to those families who were involved. Trust me... it will take you there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Craft an old-school spooky tale before descending into CGI nonsense,"I doubt anyone could foresee the success of James Wan's The Conjuring, which, on the surface at least, looks no more remarkable than any of the gore-soaked horror bilge than swills into our cinemas every year. Released in the summer - a season hardly known for horror smash-hits - it proved that audience's desire to be scared lasts the whole year round, raking in the cash on the back of a moderate $20 million budget. It also managed to attract admiration from many critics, who found it both well-made and genuinely scary, harking back to an era when top directors took an interest in the genre and did wonders with it.The film focuses on the Perron family, consisting of loving mother Carolyn (Lili Taylor), hard-working father Roger (Ron Livingston), and their five daughters, who re-locate to a dilapidated rural home in Rhode Island. While they settle quickly, it soon becomes apparent that there are other forces at work, and this supernatural presence isn't at all happy at the Perrons being in its home. Following a series of inexplicable events, Carolyn calls in paranormal investigators Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his clairvoyant wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) for help, who quickly make up their mind that this is the most p****d-off haunting they have ever witnessed.Long before the likes of Most Haunted graced out TV screens, Ed and Lorraine Warren were the real celebrity ghost hunters, investigating almost every famous case of so-called demonic possession you can think of, from Amityville to the Enfield poltergeist. Many of their investigations took place in the 1970's, and Wan gives the film a very 70's aesthetic, complete with a calm, moving camera and slow zooms. 1979's The Amityville Horror is a definite influence, and there are certain moments which will bring the likes of Don't Look Now (1973) and The Omen (1976) to mind also. While The Conjuring doesn't bring anything new to the table for seasoned horror buffs, it's nice to be reminded of a time when frights were delivered by expert hands, and the genre was alive with innovation.Yet while Wan's film certainly does have its moments - a camera swirl from underneath the bed to the dark corner of a bedroom is particularly memorable - it falls victim to many of the tropes that plague modern horror movies. There's the occasional reliance on a jump scare to try and keep the audience engaged, and a climax that quickly descends into CGI nonsense complete with the obligatory exorcism scene. It's rather sad, as there is a good a cast delivering strong performances and a director who certainly knows what he's doing at play here, taking the time to craft an old- fashioned spooky tale without the need for gore or sex before the ending washes away all the good work. Still, it's refreshingly old- school, which is surprising when you think that this is from the guy who kick-started the Saw franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Genericisim, Played-Out Supernatural Stereotypes, And A Waste Of A Film Reel.","Like much and more of modern Horror, The Conjuring first arrived on a wave of flashy advertising, gleaming critic's reviews and a swarm of gore- junkie theater-goers prematurely high off the cheap jump-scares and flash- terror to come. That being said, sitting down for two hours of pastel, thirty-year-old clichés pounding down on the crowd in a relentless tirade was like watching Amityville Horror be dressed up in sunglasses and a t- shirt and animated Weekend-At-Bernie's-style. Perhaps there was a few laughs squeezed out--Officer Brett was a charmer--but other than that, there was just about as much emotions cultivated in the viewers by Conjuring as there would be in a pile of rocks at a Taylor Swift concert. Perhaps even more disconcerting--yes, even more than Conjuring's main spook, who just looked like my Aunt Suzy after a night of drinking--is that this website, amongst others, have given it not one, not two, but eight, nine, even ten star reviews. I wonder if anyone is getting paid to give these ratings, and if so, please contact me with how to get in on it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror revamped,"""The Conjuring"", does everything right the entire film. From classic scares, to impressive acting, there are few flaws throughout. We can agree this movie borrowed some ideas from horror classics like ""The Exorcist"", ""The Amityville Horror"", and others, but the way this new film is executed is what makes this film so frightening. We get a taste of all these films, but in correct portions, meaning nothing is overdone. Giving background on these paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren gives the audience some information on what these guys are all about. Unlike most of these ""Ghost Hunters"" nowadays, the Warrens attempt to find any logical explanation for cases instead of jumping to the conclusion the victims are being terrorized by a paranormal force. The movie is based on the true events of the Perrons in 1970, which makes what was already a creepy movie into a nightmare. Little by little, we uncover the mystery of the Perron house and it's past. The superb acting makes the scares believable and life like, adding another element to the overall scariness of the film. We learn early in the movie the Warrens are experienced investigators, knowing how to handle almost any case and seem to be rattle by nothing. But we see true fear in the eyes of Ed and Lorraine as they uncover a case nothing like they've ever experienced. ""The Conjuring"" is a unique film on its own, making its presence felt in the horror industry.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"I've always wanted to do the ""slow clap""","I love horror movies. I love supernatural movies. Unfortunately most ghost movies are all the same and don't scare me much at all.This one did. 37 minutes into the movie and I'd already screamed out loud 3 times!! This movie had one instance of very mild blood, no cursing , no nudity no slashing.....and yet it wound up being the scariest movie I've seen! Loved it! Great acting, great story, great filming....great everything! This kicked butt over every ghost movie I've ever seen and is now my second favorite scary movie.

Textbook and a welcome arrival,"Real rating: 8/10Disclaimer: If a film's IMDb rating is too low, I will always give it 10/10 and then give my real rating in the review.I think the producers and director got totally sick of all this Paranormal Activity rubbish and said ""You wan't a scary movie? We'll give you a scary movie!!"" Everything happens in the order you think it's going to, and you know when you're going to get scared, and you don't care.It is a pleasurable ghost-train ride and you can see everything coming towards you and you can't stop it and THAT ROCKS. Intstead of tinfoil-hat nutters and cheap cash-ins with unwatchable video footage and fishing-line stunts, we get an in-your-face haunted house story.And it has the 'Based on truth' (ho ho) thing, too, but at least it carries this on it's sleeve instead of just assuming the audience will buy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Another Traditional Haunted-House Story,"From the man who brought you Saw and Insidious, The Conjuring casts you into a familiar setting- one that revolves around a haunted house, a terrified family, and some experienced veterans in this paranormal field. What follows is an incredibly tense and frightening ride through a traditional haunted-house story. The film's major highlight is its effective use of jump-scares and placing you into that seat of hopelessness and the unknown of what's to come next, and I have to say that the cinematography is terrific.Horror movies, in general, really have to rely on cameras to deliver the scariest experience to their audience from focusing on aghast faces to subtle placements of certain items. Anyways, The Conjuring's overall look proves how much more stupendous a film camera is over a digital one, but that's beside the point. This film greatly depends on jump- scares to affright its watchers, and it accomplishes just that as I found countless individuals in the room screaming, gasping, and holding on to their friends in anticipation of what awaits. Admittedly, there were numerous sequences that had me holding onto my chair, shocked at what just transpired and hoping for that particular character to escape unharmed. Rightfully so, the film takes a while to get to the problem of it all as it takes its time building up its characters (there are actually two branching perspectives) and the issue that's arising within the house, and as usual in most horror films, the buildup is much more entertaining and daunting than its climax.On top of the scares, the Conjuring also benefits from its strong acting performances from the likes of Vera Farmiga to Patrick Wilson to even the kids (yes, usually the kids in horror films are horrible actors, but this time, they're extremely believable). The chemistry between Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) is quite evident, and the other family delivers as well. Whenever the kids are endangered, you're dramatically concerned.Then, there's the script, which is satisfying in some parts and underwhelming in others. The greatest element that The Conjuring suffers from is its too-familiar ""everything""- from the setting to the characters to the story and its progression. The film contains almost every single cliché that most haunted-house movies are riddled with. At times, a specific scene feels utterly cheesy and slightly lackluster due to the fact that we've heard these characters saying these exact lines and performing these exact actions in other movies to the point where it feels predictable and unbelievable, ruining the immersion level in the meantime.It's also a little hilarious that after so many haunted stories, yet another family foolishly decides to move into an obviously creepy home that sees its floors constantly creak and its basement scream ""do not come down here!"" The home is old and messy, and there's a freakish tree resting right in the front-yard. How can you not be suspicious right from the get-go?! In fact, during the first half of the film, I wondered why James Wan chose to direct this picture when it's so similar to Insidious. At the moment, haunted-house movies are a fad that should finally be stopped because at this point, no matter how horrifying said movie is, the film will lose points because of its traditional and uninspired route.The music was okay, but at times, it was just more of the same generic horror music that you've heard in almost every single haunted- house movie before it, but then when that bass kicks in, your feet start tapping against the floor and your hands begin shaking. In the end, The Conjuring shocks you and disturbs you while you're in that theater room, but after you leave, you're likely to forget the ending and perhaps confuse the film with another one when it's brought up in a conversation. Simply put, if you're looking for a new horror film with an interesting concept and a memorable, unique experience, The Conjuring is not the place to look, but since there's a shortage of decent horror flicks recently, it'd be nice to actually witness an effectively scary one for a change. In that case, you can't go wrong with The Conjuring. If half of my theater screamed like a group of little girls, chances are you might to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Wow, a brilliant modern day horror for once.","OK so I am disappointed every time I watch a modern day thriller/horror. They are always badly scripted with plenty of unfilled gaps in the story, totally predictable and they recycle material over and over again from the classics such as: Scream, Halloween, Poltergeist and Friday the 13th. A typical detail used in today's horror films is the line 'based on a true story' which you know is totally bo**ocks. However, after doing a bit of research into this film I was soon to discover that the Warrens, the paranormal investigators in the film, were and are actually real people that experienced many well documented paranormal activities such as the Amityville Horror and the haunting in Connecticut (both now made into average films). So for me The Conjuring is a wonderful surprise. The acting is brilliant and well lead by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, the use of make-up and prosthetics over CGI adds extra realism to the scares that the ghosts deliver and actually stay put in your mind. The film grips you with excellent suspense techniques throughout the whole thing and there was many times where I was peering at the screen through my fingers. After being disappointed by James Wan's Insidious and Insidious 2, I was sceptical about giving this film a chance, but I am so glad I did, because what those other two films lacked this one gained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Hype killed it for me,"I must say it took a while for me to finally watch this fright flick and it just didn't do it for me. Now as a film I thought it was alright, as a horror flick there was nothing scary in my opinion. Now the Annabelle doll you see at the beginning has great potential other than that don't expect to be scared at this one. Basically a family of six move into a new home with a demonic presence inside of it (unknowingly of course), and as time progresses things get worse and worse for the family, to the point they bring in ghost hunters for help. This movie is set in the 70s, all sets and acting were great.

Tiw the conjuring,"Today I watched the Conjuring.I've seen this movie twice now and on a second watch I still enjoy it despite its flaws, but it is a little worse than I remember. Initially I had this movie as a low 7 in my mind but Uh yeah it's a little bit less effective now that I'm not like 17I gotta say some of the cinematography in this film is very creative. Honestly feels very interesting and probably my favorite part of the movie. I really appreciate how James wan makes his films feel like his own. There's some flips in one of the shots that I loved, some really cool panning effects. The movie looks pretty great for what it's going for. Maybe some of the lighting seems kinda synthetic, it's still pretty good. I really enjoyed watching the film from a visual standpointSome of the performances are very convincing and it can sell it definitely with the makeup. There were some slip ups in some of the characters performances that were not very convincing. Like when the actress that plays Caroline says ""how did you know"", there were some lines I didn't believe. More commonly in the child characters.The story is very very very cliched and I have seen it many times but that does not mean that this film isn't worth a watch. I don't mind watching something I feel like I've seen before if the presentation is something worth it. There are some intriguing moments in the story that take it slightly away from formula but I swear I've seen this movie format done 45k times. The grudge, exorcist, poltergeist, sinister which came out the shortly before this lol, amityville horror, paranormal activity, the list goes onThe audio peaked once when a character was falling you should have fixed that in editing or done another take. Kinda ridiculous. Some of the child acting is very bad it's kinda funny. There was a bad cgis. Some neat blood gore. Some slight reliance on loud noise jump scares that felt like they were not from the same part of the movie, but I guess this movie gets a pass cuz you can just say spooky ghosts made the noises. It's a bit cheap sometimes.The A plot(family) was much more interesting than the B plot(Annabelle), like seriously that side plot could have been taken out, this movie was kinda long. There are some genuinely scary scenes in the film during the A plot and I did feel legitimate fear for the family especially during the late first and second acts of the film.There is honestly very very very poorly handled unsubtle reincorporation that does not need to even be slightly explained. If you see something in a horror movie and it's heavily talked about for it's own scene you bet it's gonna get reincorporated, this is a general rule to horror movies. I thought there was effective parts of the score, like the climax was pretty spooky music, but some other parts are kinda generic. There is a really cheesy scene near the end of the movie that is so tropey and has incredibly cliche bland music and I thought it was gonna be the end of the film and then it doesn't end there and I'm like ok.Overall, This is a good horror movie with a pretty old school concept slightly overdone concept. There is a lot of personality in the movie however, and I do think there are genuinely spooky parts to the film. It is very visually pleasing movie to watch and it wasn't poorly acted in general. It's worth a watch I'd say, but it is a bit long and I wouldn't be mad if someone didn't like the movie.Remind me to rewatch sinister again, I remember liking that tooMid 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The don't make them like they used to,"I gave it a 6 for the acting; I thought Vera Farmiga and a couple of the kids stirred some emotion.

I find that most of the praise has its merits, The Conjuring is a rock solid film that has scares that would surprise even the most jaded of horror fans.This film is a slow burn in the first act, in my opinion, this movie would've felt better paced closer to 90 minutes as opposed to 120. The characters that were developed in the first act were okay, but generic for the most part in my opinion. I think all in all, the young actors in the film did a great job, it is more difficult than most realize to find decent child actors especially in a story of this nature.The ""ghost hunters"" couple were interesting characters, in particular Lorraine Warren, played by Vera Farmiga. The genesis of her powers could make a decent spin off. Farmiga is the actor who shines in a genre that more times than not puts the art of acting last on the list of priorities.This movie is a lover letter to fans who love demonic/possession types of stories.

James Wan has improved a lot with the master socket , and if with Insidious had done a great job with this film is even better. Shots really well made and disturbing chills , atmosphere typical of the '80s movie realized with skill that can give a sense of oppression , sound effects typical of the old horror that can make you stop the heart and actors who play really well . From the plot , the film seems to be the typical ghost story but it is not. In fact, the film is also the theme of exorcism (it was the time of The Exorcism of Emily Rose, who was not treated so well the genre ) and the family that is not trivialized as happens in other movies.

This is not a classic. But its good.,"Let's face it – Making a horror film in 2013 is not an easy task – Horror fans are not easy to please, thus any new major horror release is condemned to be compared to the classics. Any slasher film that comes out gets compared to 'Halloween' (1974), Any new monster film gets compared to 'Godzilla' (1954), And along with 'The Conjuring', any new paranormal film gets deemed a poor attempt at making a new Exorcist or Shining. Its cruel, but forgivable. The philosophy behind it Is why should we settle for less than we already have. But every so often a film does come along that sets the horror community alight in a good way –Saw did it in 2004, Paranormal Activity did it in 2007, Let the right one in did it in 2008, and now in 2013, James Wan's latest horror outing has done it. When Wan brought out Insidious in 2011, it had to compete against the likes of Source code and Hop, neither one of them being particularity major contenders, and yet it only managed to make a little over $13 000 000 on its April opening weekend, going on to make just a few million shy of the $100 000 000 mark worldwide. The conjuring was originally slated for an early 2013 release, but after an unprecedented, acclaimed reception with test audiences, WB made the bold decision to move the release date back, into Q3,which in recent years has become a hotbed for superhero blockbusters and animated juggernauts; This was among the first horror films to be released in this month since The Omen in 2006. But it paid off, having the biggest opening for an original R-rated horror film ever – An R-rating, not because of profanity of sex, but because the MPAA felt it to be ""too scary"" - Grossing over $41 million over its opening weekend and only dropping 47% over its second weekend, which for a horror film is ridiculously impressive. So what is it about this film that makes it so different to the numerous paranormal activity sequels, last years The possession, Del Toro's MAMA from earlier this year or even Wan's own Insidious? Well, nothing really. After all the hype over this film, I was expecting well-rounded characters, an innovative approach to the ever-increasing banality of the possession formula and a shocking ending – instead I was subjected to one-dimensional cut-outs of actual real life people, and nothing of much shock or surprise. Quite frankly I was disappointed. I only found myself marginally creeped out at two points, both which took place in the basement, and I only found myself jumping once, again, during the basement scene. The acting was brilliant, especially by the young girls, but the dialogue they had to contend with was nothing shy of weak. The music was affective but had nothing much to affect. It was only the camera work of Wan and his collaborative cinematographer John R. Leonetti (Dead Silence, Child's Play 3, Indiseous) which gave the film any stand-alone quality from the sun-genre that it so carefully played into. The consistent fluidity of the camera, mounted on a trolley and/or crane at all times was unsettling and did create heightened intensity, only to be undone by a lack of happenings on the screen. To any one who has seen this and is currently labelling me as unpleasable, i would just like to say that this is the best horror film of the year so far, but its not an instant classic. Ghosts that latch onto the kids, paranormal investigators with a shady and conflicted past, a dog that refuses to go into the house, a member of local law enforcement getting involved, an exorcism that looks only angers the evil spirit, come on! Its been done to death! The only refreshing points of this film was the lack of sex and lack of death, but that and that alone is not enough to make an ""instant classic"" as so many people are calling it. It is still in thousands of cinemas worldwide, has currently grossed over $140 000 000 and has already been commissioned for a sequel. Yawn. I just hope James Wan doesn't direct it. Having been involved with two of the Saw sequels, having just made Indiseous 2, sitting in the directors chair for Fast 7, if he returns for this sequel as well, it could spell the end for a once promising innovative career that never really got going. 6.5/10...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

better and more frightening then the Insidous saga,"James Wan, who had a break through with Saw (2004) was the kind of director I wanted to follow. Have seen Insidious (2010) his effort into the possession genre I had some mixed emotions. I didn't found it scary. The follow-up, Insidious 2 (2013) had the same problems as part 1, it wasn't really scary. But in between those two flick Wan decided to make a real scary possession flick like we used to see in the eighties. And let this be this one here, The Conjuring.Again, it's beautifully filmed and it surely had the feeling like those old school horrors. It takes a while before things go wrong but it just doesn't matter because I was sitting on the edge of my seat to know how this would end.

The Conjuring,"It's an okay film. The build up is kinda slow but it gives time to establish good characters in Ed and Lorraine Warren. The cast for the most part does a good job. 2 of the child actors are decent and the others are garbage. There is only 1 jump scare in the movie that actually got me while I predicted all the other ones.
The movie is also kinda dark lighting wise. I watched this film in a dark room and some of the scenes were just too dark to see anything.
The plot is good. I understood what was going on and what the characters are doing and why. The film flowed nicely from scene to scene. The first 5 minutes are awful though. We basically get 3 introductions to Ed and Lorraine that repeats the same thing. It's only there to establish Annabelle for her spin off movie.
The last 20 minutes are amazing though. The exorcism scene is the best sequence in the film. There's tension, the camera shakes but it works with the scene, the lighting is good, the music is good, and the makeup on the demon is really good, and most importantly, it's CREEPY.

He has left a clear imprint there from the way he conjures up those chilling moments almost with ease and it appears he has quite literally terrified some audiences across the globe. However, for me - it didn't quite live up to its billing.Critics and audience members who had viewed the piece labelled it with all kinds of superlatives. Perhaps it was foolish of me to have read comments beforehand but I was expecting something so incredibly scary it would send a blood curdling shiver down my spine. It certainly didn't do that though if I chose to ignore all those acclaimed reviews it received prior to may viewing, I would tell you it was certainly an exercise in fear. Some sections of 'The Conjuring' were intensely eerie however I wouldn't say it thundered down any barriers.A little unsettling also is the fact that Wan loosely based this piece on a true discovery by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. And on that note it gives me great pleasure to say that actors Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were truly outstanding in their performances as the married couple.Another special mention should be awarded to Lili Taylor who took on the complex role of Carolyn Perron. Truly excellent in the films majority as the concerned mother before superbly adapting to her disturbing performance in the films latter stages.One tip before watching the film would be to know as little as possible about the premise and NOT to watch previews or trailers of it knowingly. One of the best suspense scenes in the films entirety is more or less shown from start to finish in one official trailer.'The Conjuring' is a highly recommended horror. While it doesn't hit the nail on the head with every attempted 'scare' it certainly ranks up their as far as films in the genre are concerned.A tad overrated but still rather chilling and undeniably scary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Flawless movie!!,"I was told by a family member to watch this movie. At first, I was a little hesitant to watch the movie. Reason being, in my opinion, it's repetitive. And in like the past 5 years, they have been coming out with horror movies basically about spirits and demonic possession. But I decided last night to give the movie a chance. And by far, it was the best horror movie from today that I really liked. They say the movie is based on true events. I even did research last night and you can actually see the real people who actually went through those horrifying events. You can even see the Warner's as a real person. Despite the fact, I can even give a link for you to check out. Go to www.historyvshollywood.com to actually look up the true story!! I suggest watching this movie if you are into movies that is based on true events!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Dissapointed.,"I looked forward to this film, as I saw it on the Imdb top 100 bucket list. I did think it was better than the average haunted house horror. Good acting and camera work. But my main dissapointment came from the expectations, seeing that the film was in that list. There was no mention of the Exorcist, which is a vastly superior film despite being over 30 years older. I'm going to rate it 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Christian historical revisionism at it's worst,"Wow... where do you even start? Horrible acting, a claim of historical accuracy, and a blatant undertone of Christian recruitment... and it's just plain offensive if you have even a quarter of a brain in your head. Apparently we've had it wrong all these years, they really were burning witches in Salem. Just a bunch of evil women with their evil lady parts getting guys in trouble.

First Horror Movie To Scare Me In YEARS,"Let me start off by saying that I've seen a big amount of horror films. The last one I remember keeping me up all night was Bride of Chucky when I was 6 years old. After that, horror films just weren't as scary and actually became stupid, silly entertainment. While horror-comedy has become the norm for horror nowadays, it was great to go in with high expectations and from the very creepy first scene into every single scene following, I found myself more and more creeped out and by the climax I was actually scared for the first time in a very long time watching a horror film. James Wan is an excellent director and is able to deliver a fantastic horror film. Does it really deliver anything new to the table of horror, No. Does it feel familiar at certain points to other films, Yes. The movie works because it knows it's supposed to be an old school straight horror film and it comes at you fast and intense and while it has that ""build up"" that we've come to expect from horror movies, the build up is very suspenseful and the movie excellently avoids having cliché and stupid characters. Great acting throughout really helps and while admittedly, being predictable at certain points, it is still very fun and scary. I highly recommend this film to any horror movie fan and can not wait for the next movie James Wan will be releasing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I am pretty sure you've seen this film before,"The fact that the cast and the name are different does not change the situation. You've seen this film before. Whether it was ""The Exorcism of (enter name here)"" or something else in the range of supernatural possession or even alien abductions, the plot is the same: family moves in the middle of nowhere for no good reason, bad things start happening, a team of ""specialists"" come to the rescue and the movie ends with a ""based on a true story"" line.For me The Conjuring was slightly different because the film was recommended to me by a friend who pointed out the subtle camera work and the good old fashioned scares. So that leaves me in a dilemma: do I appreciate the movie as a standalone horror, forcing myself to ignore the entire list of similar movies since the 80s till now, or do I denounce this as a shameless clone of so many films of the genre? One has to wonder: if the viewer sees this type of movie for the first time, is it not a good movie if they enjoy it?But I cannot try to judge all of this based on the pleasures of some hypothetical person. I have to rate it based on what I know, and what I know is that I have seen this film before and cloning it does not one an artist make, but a Xerox at most.Bottom line: every single line, every scene, even the effects and camera work, for all of them I had the strong feeling that I have seen them before. And, alas, they also happened exactly as I had predicted minutes before, down to the makeup and sound effects. I can't really appreciate that. I have seen a lot of crappy movies and some of them copies of other crappy films that I have seen before, but each one brought something slightly new: a monster that was different, a situation, a character type. Just enough to make a small difference. The Conjuring brings nothing new to the table, absolutely nothing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Thrilling; true story . . . must  see!,"This movie sets out to grab the attention of thrill seekers for a good scare. Although, if you're not familiar with the paranormal world, give sincere credit as you watch -- this is not just a scare-tactic production -- this is a real true story.I was anticipating for this one to come out for quite some time. The best thing I like is that the surrounding of the movie has ties with what I've followed from the works of Paranormal State (can be seen on A&E or Bio networks; Ryan Buell, lead investigator). Lorraine Warren has been featured on the show numerous times. She tags along on cases as demonologist & seeks out what forces that may inhabit any property as well as those needing spiritual guidance. Check this series out if you haven't before!I will not go into too much detail of the movie.The actors & actresses do a great job playing out this terrifying & epic story! Also, excellent to see a cameo by Lorraine Warren herself!We will see a brief introduction on where the main plot takes off right as it rolls on. Time era is during the 70's. There is this couple that takes their research & put together lectures that go deep into the supernatural spectrum. They share what they can so the common public can relate on real paranormal occurrences.A family moves into a new home. What awaits them is nothing expected by anyone. Let's just say that their realtor left out a good description of home history. Things of notice are becoming to take a toll within the house, which then has the mother seek out Lorraine & Ed Warren. The couple are used to all kinds of cases that come in many levels in association with being supernatural. This house just happens to host a much bigger problem that they haven't dealt with before.Haunted entities, flashbacks of tragedy & demonic possession are all about to wreck havoc throughout everything & everyone.I highly recommend this movie. Not by any means is the story fiction. Some may need to view this with caution, but I will definitely say that this has its scary moments along as it being a true story & now shared as a movie that is well done.Will probably encounter some hair-raising on your arms, but I am one to find it quite interesting when that happens & thrilling nonetheless, which is exciting when it comes to the paranormal. Hide n' clap? You'll see . . . go on to watch it for yourself!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good!,"This movie is good, if you are a fan of the genre of possession type movies or really scary horror movies about real evil then this is a good movie for you. We saw it in the theatre and it made my girlfriend jump several times in her seat so if that is what you are looking for check it out for sure. I was scared by it in those places too, it is a well done possession horror movie. The story happens in the 1970's this is a good write up of the story from the page: ""Carolyn and Roger Perron move their family into a dilapidated Rhode Island farm house and soon strange things start happening around it with escalating nightmarish terror. In desperation, Carolyn contacts the noted paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren, to examine the house. What the Warrens discover is a whole area steeped in a satanic haunting that is now targeting the Perron family wherever they go. To stop this evil, the Warrens will have to call upon all their skills and spiritual strength to defeat this menace"", it is a good horror film!

"Holy Hot Damn, Go See This Right Now!","This is a rarity of a film. This is a rarity of a horror film. It relies on scaring the audience through shear visceral images and moments, rather than relying on blood, gore, and dropping of the Fawk word to gain the attention of movie-goers. We have been so attached to films like the most recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre film as they are the only horror films we can have as of late, but this film... It combines elements of classic horror and supernatural films like the Exorcist and Poltergeist, and so many others, to not only give the audience genuine, non-cheap scares, but moments that leave you in chills. Sure, this may be speaking from opinion, but it's kind of a rarity to feel this way in a horror film as of recently. Evil Dead, great and fun film, but not once did I feel goosebumps from what I was seeing. True, completely separate entities in the genre, but hopefully you get my point. A horror film is supposed to leave the audience in both a state of not knowing what is going to happen next EVER, and not knowing what to do once you leave the theater. And this film provides. Easily. James Wan is an incredible horror film director, and this is easily his best. It has deeper levels of character development than the common audience member might be used to, it has such a great sense of (Warning: film-major word about to appear) mise-en-scene for when anything at all is happening, especially during chaotic, frightening moments. It also has one of the absolute best casts I've seen in a horror film yet, right down to every. Single. Child actor. Unusual to say, I agree, but without a doubt, stunned by how good they were. No one in the film is up there in stardom, but this film is easily an example of them being showcased very well.And this film has an ""R"" rating, and in my book, it deserves it. Not for blood. Not for language. No sexual anything whatsoever. How is it not ""G""? Well, this film does not let up on the disturbing imagery, and said imagery if far and far away from being subtle. Although, the subtly of some moments does work. Conflicting messages here, I agree, but understand what I am trying to get at: When this film isn't subtle, it works, and it is frightening. When this film IS subtle, it works, and tends to even be more frightening (I'm looking at you, armoire... you bastard...)If you like being scared, or like even good films, please, please, oh Jesus-Tap-Dancing-Christ please, go see this movie. It is so absolutely perfect for a modern day horror film that will no doubt last for a long time to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Torn about this movie,"I think the film is probably about a ""B"" for me. I think some of the scary scenes are effective for sure but there where some things that really bugged me. For example, I know this is based on a 'true story' but I don't really get the purpose of Patrick Wilson's character. He doesn't seem to add much value as a character and every time Patrick Wilson talks, I almost wanted to laugh. It kind of 'subdued' the horror. The same can be said for some of the makeup. For example, the police officer in the scenes at the end looks like a bad ""Will-Farrell-Anchorman Porn Star"" - it was annoying.Vera is pretty good. Ron Livingston is the same in everything he does so I didn't see a lot there. Lili? is pretty good as the possessed mama. All the kids are good....would have liked to have seen more of them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Conjure up some bravery for this scare,"The trailers have ranted about how good and scary this movie is. Of course trailers often lie and overexaggerate on how scary something is. Well that's not the case for this movie, as The Conjuring has all elements that a good horror movie needs. Rather than filling the movie with gore, overacted screaming, and ridiculous killing as is the trend these days, this movie has a story that drives the horror within. Fans will be creeped out by the gradual introduction of the spirit, and further terrified by the subtle things done to the family. Of course creepiness isn't the only scare factor they have, there were plenty of times where the movie made you jump with a sudden noise or character. Those who ar ereligious will get an extra scare factor added to the mix, as the spirituality embedded into this film might get you stirred up at points.All of these factors make the movie feel realistic, which again makes it scary to so many levels. The scariness was built around the story, allowing for the tried and true methods to not be overdone/ overstretched, or sloppily integrated into the movie to get a scare out of the audience. Even the characters were integrated into the story well, and once again the horror was built around them, although not as well with the girls.Overall this movie is one of the better horror movies. Go see it, but don't set your expectations to high to avoid getting disappointed as often happens. Do yourself a favor though, DO NOT bring any kids to the film, or you're asking for trouble.For a more complete review follow the link below: http://robbiesmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2013/07/19/",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Over-hyped, disappointing movie","I was anxiously waiting for The Conjuring to come out. Especially after the trailer was released. And here start the problems with this movie: the trailer is scarier than the actual movie.The trailer involves the actual real family, much adding to the ""based on a true story"" gimmick. The problem with this is that it raises an expectation that we'll actually see real details in the movie. There's plenty of people filming events during the movie, and you're left with a feeling of ""if this was a real paranormal investigation, the only reason for not using real footage is that it's all fake"".The only time the real family comes into the picture is a couple of family photos, on the end credits.As other users have mentioned, the ghost scenes are highly exaggerated, way too violent, again contributing to the overall disappointment of what was supposed to be a ""real"" ghost story.So after you get used to the idea that this is just another lame ghost movie, you're left with half decent performances from Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, and you're left sighing for Insidious.There's basically one scary scene in the movie, the hide-and-seek+clap game. And that's it. What a let down.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Unoriginal but still one of the scariest movies of all time,"TLDR: don't (or do) watch this film at 12:00 am in your basement with all the lights off. That's what I did and it scared the living crap out of me. If you want to watch a creative and original movie tonight, I would skip this one just for tonight. You should watch this when you're in for a scare.Plot: 8/10; Although unoriginal, it clearly has marks for a well thought out plot. This is not an average 21st century slasher or dumb ghost movie. This is a well structured plot.Characters: 7/10; I think this is the problem with most modern horror films. The characters are just not relatable or likeable (so when they get hurt I don't really care for them), but in this movie at least the characters are somewhat likeable.Acting/Casting: 6/10; The acting is not great. The only actors that had a very good performance was Vera Farmiga (Lorraine Warren) and Joey King (Christine, one of the Perron's daughter). I don't think the Perron parents did a horrible job either (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) but they didn't stand out as much as the other two. I think the casting could've been better for the children and Ed.Ending: 7/10; Nothing special but it effectively ends the movie.Cinematography: 9/10; very creativePace: 8/10; Nothing to bad, the ending is a little fastDialogue: 7/10Music: 7/10Originality: 5/10Scare factor: 10/10; Very creative ways to scare you.Prop Design: 10/10; I don't usually include this but the design of the little spinning wheel is very creative.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
THE COUNJURING- True Story comes to the Screen,"Finally a scary film worth watching...oh wait...there hasn't been a scary movie since ""Mama"" this year. I can hear Paula Cole singing ""Where have all the scary movies gone?"" Anyway if you wanna get yourself jumping from your seat, watch the fright-fest ""The Conjuring"".Based on the True Files of Ben and Lorraine Warren who were the first Parapsychologists in the field. The film showcases the horrifying case of the Annabelle Doll incident to the disturbing events at the Perron Family's Farmhouse in Long Island. I did my homework on the history of the Warrens before watching the movie and I have to say that James Wan did a marvelous job capturing the point of view of the Perron Family and what they went through when they moved into their new house and then what Lorraine Warren saw while she and her husband investigated the chilling events.Vera does it again! After playing the cray cray mother of Norman Bates in ""Bates Motel"", Verga Farmiga does a 180 and portrays a loving mother with a determination to help others in their crisis. She gets Lorraine down to the detail after seeing the real Lorraine in interviews. Pretty much anything Patrick Wilson is in is awesome! Lili Taylor and Rob Livingston were believable as the Perrons who portrayed the fear and courage to fight against the negative forces in the house. But the Perron Daughters really delivered the believable scares the girls really went through.There are creepy moments in the movie that will linger in your mind after viewing. You won't see old dolls the same way again. Plus you won't want to go down in the basement by yourself...unless you live in Florida. Worse of all, if a kid hands you a toy box and says that once the music stops playing, you'll see a boy standing behind you, dang it don't even touch the thing!! Oh and don't play hide and seek with a blindfold on in a house you just moved into. Not only can you hurt yourself, but you may be playing with someone extra! Just saying. Like all scary movies, they use every trick in the book to scare you. But the atmosphere is new which makes it great all on it's own. The film brings back memories of the old school horror films of the late 70's. Plus knowing that it was based on a true story doesn't help but creep you out a bit.But what I love about this movie is the power of family and relationships. The Perron family do all in their power to fight against the dark forces to keep their family safe. The Warrens make their efforts to not only save the Perrons from the evil in their home but also protect themselves. The movie could have been a straight 2- dimensional Horror Movie. But what made it more emotional and successful was the theme: the force more powerful than evil is the love of family.Pay attention to the last thing the Warrens say before the credits roll, you'll enjoy learning about that case. I smell a sequel!!!Movie Rating-9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Who Ya Gonna Call!,"This film is recommended.Who doesn't like a good scary ghost story now and then? One that delivers goosebumps or makes us jump with every dreaded bump in the night. The Conjuring miraculously reappears from that old fashion haunted house movie staple of the past before disappearing into the haze of formulaic set-ups updated for today's movie-going audiences. The film toys with our fears of the unknown, wisely keeps the horror hidden for our own imaginations to work overtime, and plays with our own insecurities and foibles.The obvious story may sound all so familiar, but the filmmaking isn't. James Wan skillfully directs this supernatural horror film which (of course) is based on supposedly true events. The film relies heavily on our past experiences as moviegoers as it successfully mixes our cinematic memories of Poltergeist, The Haunting, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, Child's Play and other films of this genre with more recent offerings like The Blair Witch Project, Insidious, and the Paranormal Activity series. (By the way, Wan directed Insidious so he's had some practice with eerie sound effects and quick edits. He also directed Saw but he shrewdly downplays any gore and sex with this outing. It's R-rating is a bit surprising as most of the violence is suggestive and not overt.) Special kudos also go out to Wan's long-time collaborator and cinematographer John R. Leonetti for his atmospheric imagery and powerful use of lighting and shadows.The plot: It's 1971. Carolyn and Roger Perrone (Lilli Palmer and Ron Livingston) are the proud parents of five wonderful daughters and a 17th century farmhouse listed at a ridiculously low price. Needless to say the Perrone clan is one excited and happy family until mysterious goings-on go on. Terrorized by evil forces, The Perrones are unable to leave due to economic hardships (an apt touch with today's housing market woes). Who they gonna call? Help is soon on the way in the form of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson), seekers of the paranormal. These ghost-hunters believe the family's story and will help rid the house of demons and bad spirits.Written by Chad and Carey Hayes, The Conjuring avoids most of the pitfalls of so many previous horror tales. The film tries to remain credible by having its characters make logical choices for the most part and still create some tension and suspense before descending into full supernatural hyperbole. The film also tries to keep a serious tone throughout all the strange occurrences, casting credence wherever it can. The Conjuring purports to be based on actual activities documented in a case study by the real-life Warrens, although the fanciful prologue never quite gels with the rest of the film and the sound effects are all too obvious.However, the strong cast, especially Wilson and Farmiga as the paranormal investigators, help to elevate the familiar story and bring with them an air of believability. The setting, with its 70's pop score and details in its art direction, creates a period flavor that lends an authenticity and legitimizes the reality of the ghostly activity that propagated during that era.The Conjuring is an extremely well-made supernatural ghost story that more than delivers the thrills and chills one expects from this genre. The filmmakers are indeed completely possessed, fortunately, with the right amount of talent and enough style to conjure up a nifty little tale of horror that today's moviegoers can truly enjoy.

James Wan Is a Dark and Twisted Mastermind of Horror,"""The Exorcist"" has held the title of the most commonly voted ""scariest movie of all-time"" by Horror fans for 41 years. I strongly believe that ""The Conjuring"" will soon take its place on the throne.Bold statement...I know...but I will explain why it is true.I went into this movie with high hopes not only because the horror genre has been dormant this summer with the flop of ""The Purge"" but because I read many great reviews from early screenings that got me even more excited than I already was. It did not disappoint. If I was one to have nightmares, I most certainly would not be sleeping tonight. This movie will scare the living crap out of you like you cannot imagine. I normally judge a horror movie on how many times it gives me the chills/goosebumps, as I am not one to normally fall for jump scares. However, not tonight. I kid you not, I jumped countless times and about broke my armrest on my theater chair. The terror is unexplainable and it only builds stronger as the movie goes on.So yea, it's scary so what?.. you might ask..well that is just the beginning. The acting is definitely great for a horror movie and I would call it above average for say, a drama or comedy where it is more strongly criticized. The cinematic effects/camera angles/audio/directing was A++ for me. There were no CGI effects that were noticeable, though I'm sure some had to have been done in certain scenes. The best part was, the plot was actually enjoyable and even if you took away the fact that it was scary as hell, it would still be a watchable movie.I have seen hundreds of horror films and this is hands down the best in my opinion. Some will argue that of course, but in today's online world where so many think they are experts and feel like they mean something when they hate on the entertainment industry, no movie will be liked by everyone. Bottom line, you aren't a horror fan if you don't go see this movie ASAP..In theaters, this weekend. Don't wait. I wouldn't have been upset if it cost me $50 to see this movie.Lastly, I would like to thank James Wan for somehow making a horror movie about possession and doing it so well that I haven't even thought about comparing it to the many others before it. Bravo Sir. We will all be blessed with more of his work than we already have been, in years to come. This is just the start of his prime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Apparently skilfully made, but...","For me as agnostic, weird things result from lack of knowledge and/or twisted mind. Well, there are clairvoyants, but they are persons with sharp senses and enhanced psychology skills. When I am too lazy to ponder, I confine myself to Murphy's laws... Besides, I do not find old house or weather related creaking doors or outside rustles - or similar - supernatural or scary and I do not believe in bad aura.Nevertheless, from time to time, I watch movies dealing with the above topics, particularly if fine directors and actors are involved. In the movie in question, Vera Farmiga was the biggest traction to me: her pleasant physiognomy does not hinder her being versatile... Regretfully, she was the only part I really enjoyed, all other things were okay at best. There were lot of scenes when you expected that something would happen, but either nothing did or the incident was ridiculous, i.e. non-real or deriving from the past. Fuss with finding evidence was not fresh as well, similar depictions have been used in dozens of movies before... Well, I can admit that some twists are thrilling - especially to those having weaker nerves - but all this related exorcism and religious connections provide all this mess odd undertones. I would have preferred a real, personified evil attempting to make his or her misdoings look supernatural or so (i.e., someone trying to chase neighbors away for various reasons, personal revenge, etc.).

Going to try and not give any spoilers and just give a personal account!The first big wave of goosebumps I got was from the opening title sequence. The big retro-looking deep yellow text across the screen, it gave a sense of nostalgia of a classic horror flick. I got this gut feeling like you know whats going to unfold over the next two hours. The movie didn't disappoint, in fact it was the best/scariest/unsettling/etc. horror film I have ever seen.The directing was fantastic in every way, which was not brought down by the amazing actors. Every one of the many characters had a part, which many movies don't ever utilize. The shooting angles had me and the audience moving our bodies and heads from left/right and up/down in anticipation.Really the only downside of watching in theaters is missing some parts when people are screaming their lungs out all around you. But don't let that discourage you...the sound sequences in some of the scenes (actually a lot of them) is critical. The bangs, deep bass, loud cracks, and SCREAMS felt like they were tearing my soul apart.This review is all over the place and so am I over this movie. Highly recommend it except for children...unless you want to punish them for the next few years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A very good surprise,"This is your basic horror movie that relies on the usual tricks of the genre, even some clichés as the one of the match enlightening an entire room. We're therefore far from any kind of originality but The Conjuring is incredibly effective on every level.The content is the most classic possible, where the challenge is met is on the form which is the most important aspect for an horror movie: the mise-en-scène and direction are perfect and produces the jumps synonymous of success.Within the first minutes, you get sucked in by the infernal spiral of this family embodied by a seamless cast, and the sustained rhythm of the narration makes the time fly.Even if it is very conventional, The Conjuring arouses a real pleasure and turns out to be a very good surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Indeed a rare gem in the horror-genre,"Renowned paranormal investigator-couple Ed and Lorraine Warren, just before probing their famous ""Amityville Horror"" case, visit a countryside home, teemed with demonic ferocity, and risk their life to salvage the whole family from evil clutches. Despite the slow-burning beginning, soon the film turns well-paced with its fearsome features. The movie setting perfectly pays panegyric to the 70s' horror movies. Sound effects and cinematography produce spine-chilling impacts. James Wan's direction is so intense and intriguing that it makes me sweat even in AC and causes stomach ache!! Wan vividly establishes him as the pathfinder of modern horrors. He knows meticulously how to frighten viewers with his treatment of satanic approaches and how to play with their fearful instincts. Wan sharply blends the same-old clichés of a haunted house and devilish possession that do not earn disfavor from me. I have to be impressed at how he tracks the paranormal movements and claims the terrifying outputs. Actors make their task well; especially Lili Taylor, Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga capture the major show. The movie brings diabolical fever upon me literally. Indeed a rare gem in the horror-genre and would be treated as an ever-green classic as we reckon ""The Exorcist"" still.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
good horror movie!,"The conjuring is one of my favourite horror movies of all time, this is a horror movie that I can definitely watch over and over again and not get bored of it. I love how the director made it seem so real and it felt like you was actually in the movie. I loved the jump scares in the movie as well. In some horror movies the horror is sometimes too much and too scary but the movie is good and the horror is scary but not that much. I love the actors playing the main characters I think they suit the characters really well and know how to play them and the acting is incredible. I think people who like horror would 100% like watching this movie and the next ones and enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Haunted farm house on the hill - and supposedly true too!,"Why is it that the demonic forces of hell seem only vested in haunting American families in big wooden houses found in the countryside? Does hell only have a one way exit to America? Why is it since the legendary ""ghost-hunters"" or Demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren hung up their possession hunting crowns, opting instead for death and retirement, that all ghosts and demons now appear to have lost the will or ability to stir up echoes. And what was it with the seventies that got all these ghosts and demons into a dizzy whorl that they needed to posses everything from houses to dolls?The Conjuring does very little to answer any of those important questions as we once again enter another house Stateside that has a dark entity attached to it that baying for all of its occupants blood. For a film of such a nature the one thing I can say is that it did manage to conjure up a rather marvelous cast - Vera Farmiga and Lilly Taylor are both excellent in their roles and add a certain amount of gravitas to what is normally a nameless entity.Whilst certainly not believable in the slightest nor scary in the least, if you can suspend your disbelieve for a fraction of a second you may just to believe this whole tale of witchcraft and satanic horror scaring the bejesus out of an everyday 1970's American family to be actually true until real life intrudes as the final credits begin to roll.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Is this a joke??,"I was almost afraid to watch this movie based off of the reviews. Thought I would be scared for days. I read several comments stating that this movie was horrifying and the best scary movie people had seen in years. I kept waiting...and waiting...and waiting for this to get better, or scary even. Nothing. I literally thought to myself that maybe I was watching the wrong version or something and wasn't seeing what everyone else saw. Far fetched I know, but that's how unbelievably disappointing this was. I was not scared at all and I would not typically consider myself someone that is hard to scare. Granted there are a few moments in this movie where you tense up just a bit, thinking something is going to pop out but that's about it!! This simply did not hold my interest. I just don't get it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Believe it,"Okay. I first want to point out that I find it comical how the low scores for this film come from reviewers with poor grammar, lack of punctuation, and general lack of cohesiveness on any arguments. Anyone with any sense can tell that this film is highly disturbing and worth viewing, regardless of any negative comments there may be.The best part about this film is the variety of scare tactics used. It is not a simply jump- scare film, nor does it rely on heavy gore to frighten. This is a well-balanced, well-done collection of scary sequences, each serving to continually build the suspense overall. The scares truly keep on coming as the film progresses, although not too quickly for the viewer to become absorbed in the family's struggle to adjust to a new environment.A few reviews have mentioned ""plot holes"" and/or the ""unrealistic"" nature of this film. However, anyone who does a bit of research will find that the events documented here are all real and did truly occur. Yes, it seems hard to believe, but the fact that this was all based on a true story is not a gimmick. Do some looking and you will find the proof you need. In fact, this movie only shows part of what the family experienced, as parts of the true haunting experience were too disturbing to be added to this film.The acting, by the way, is superb all around, especially with the daughters. I was glad to see Ron Livingstone in a role with some depth, and he stepped up to the occasion with more than enough zeal. Overall, I cannot recommend this movie enough. Instead of a 30- minute build for a quick scare, the scares remain constant and the atmosphere is very moody and unsettled. I was stunned at the amount of terror this semi low-budget work pushes out at a seemingly effortless pace. This is the movie horror fans (myself included) have waited years for. See it.

How authentic to the era that it feels. The costuming, the atmosphere, even the jump scares. I think that it is James Wans best work as a director and everything since has pretty much fell flat.The acting is great, all the girls playing the Perron girls are terrific and special note to Lili Taylor who plays the mum Carolyn Perron.

Well... at least it has a unique time period...,"For months my friends have been telling me that The Conjuring is the modern horror classic. While Insidious was good, this movie was even better. This movie showed how horror movies should be done.Well... Insidious wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing... and... this same goes with this movie.The movie starts off with the Annabelle doll case just for to have a cool trailer. Sadly, the movie has nothing to do with the doll that was so heavily advertised. The doll just plays a part for an intro case that explains an example of a paranormal case, as if setting the stage for the rest of the movie. It is confirming ""The rest of the movie is going to be this good"".Unfortunately, The Conjuring is probably the least scary horror movie I have seen in quite some time. The intro is by far the creepiest aspect of the film, while the rest of the movie doesn't have any scares. I'm not even joking when I say this, there was not a single moment in this movie that actually took its full potential. There were a lot of moments that could've been scary, but simply ended up without a scare. This is a common trend in horror movies now: Build up a scare that will never happen, so as to confuse the audience. However, even that is becoming predictable, because now you can tell if there is going to be a real scare or not.The other thing is that when this movie tries to be scary, it actually fails at it mostly because the camera stays running for half a second too long. In one scene a ghost jumps out at the camera shouting ""SHE MADE ME DO IT"" which could be scary, however the problem is that this happens over the course of a second and a half or so and the girl runs at the camera. This means we get a good look at the ghost moving towards the camera before she becomes threatening. It's the timing that is important in making something scary, and just about every jump scare in this movie is timed incorrectly.This is interesting because the beginning of the movie seemed to understand what was creepy; however, the majority of the movie doesn't. What's even weirder is that the doll comes back for a scene side- story that never has a complete arc. This is weird because it is as if the movie is hinting at ""The doll is the real ultimate evil all along who is behind the scenes and is the ""real"" scare of this movie"" but the doll never has a complete arc. It just exists, sitting in the back of the movie (literally) having its own useless presence.Now the actual character elements of the movie aren't horrible. The characters have fairly good acting and the some of the characters are likable. However, nobody dies, so what is the threat anyways? The worst thing that can happen is someone gets bumped on the head or knocked out.The camera angles aren't horrible in this movie, but some of the are pointlessly complex and thrown in randomly for the sake of directing. Though, there were some nice shots by horror movie standards. So that was nice.All in all The Conjuring isn't a horrible movie, it just isn't a good horror movie. It isn't scary, most of the cast is boring, and nothing in the movie stands out. I feel like I've seen this premise before and I have seen these characters before. The soundtrack isn't bad, but it has improper timing and the same goes with the scares. Timing is key.Watch it if you want to be bored for a good hour and a half or so.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Best Horror Film of The Year So Far,"The Conjuring (2013) is a supernatural horror film based on a true story directed by James Wan. It stars Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor, Vera Farmiga and Ron Livingston.The plot of the film is about a family, the Perrons who move into a new house only to discover it is haunted by a dark presence. They seek help from the Paranormal Investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren who then find themselves investigating the most terrifying case of their lives.Is this film scary? YES! Yes it is, no bones about it. I usually consider myself to be desensitised to horror films due to watching too many of them but whilst watching this it was giving me goose bumps and sending chills down my spine.This may sound like your typical haunted house film that we've seen so many times before with the likes of The Amityville Horror, Poltergeist, The Entity and The Exorcist etc and essentially it is but it throws its own stuff on the table to keep it fresh and original.What makes this film so great and helps it to succeed as a horror is the atmospheric tension combined with the frightening visuals and a few jump scares. Jump scares are often a cheap way to induce a quick scare but The Conjuring uses them effectively. If you take away the jump scares that it has you are still left with one hell of an eerie & creepy atmosphere and a constant fear of dread lurking in every scene. Because this film is set in the 70s it really helps with making it feel like one of those classic haunted house films. It has everything from an old house with a tragic history, a boarded up hidden basement full of dusty old furniture, a creepy puppet, an old mechanical children's toy, a witch, a possession, an exorcism, the list goes on and on. It also plays on childhood fears we've all had when we were younger such as monsters being under the bed, in the closet, things that go bump in the night. When you're watching this you know you're watching a horror film, there's no mistaking it for anything else.The acting in the film is good, all the actors and actresses play their parts well so you believe they are the characters they're playing. You experience their emotions with them even though those emotions mostly consist of being scared shitless, you do feel the sigh of relief when their ordeal is over and done with.The musical score is excellent and well composed which is another contributing factor to the all round creepiness of the film. It also has a few catchy songs from the late 50s/60s thrown in.The Conjuring isn't just a great horror film it's actually a great film all round. This is a true classic in the making and one of the stand out horror films of this era. Already it can be compared to the likes of The Exorcist & The Amityville Horror and hold its own against them. James Wan really pulled out the stops and this film along with his previous ones have undoubtedly made him this generation's equivalent of the likes of Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper & William Friedkin, and a true master of horror.

Teen / kid friendly scare-fest,"These movies are perfect to put on for families with kids / teens that like horror and jump scares. There are no dodgy scenes, the language is clean and the horror is violent and over the top, striking a good balance between not holding back to cater for younger audiences and also not making it too disturbing to watch.The story / pretext is very simple and Scooby Do-esque, it's quite amusing throughout the entire series how seriously the ghost hunting skills are taken and how quickly the victims willingly put themselves in situations they know a murderous demon will start banging the door or pop out of a cupboard.It's hard to criticise this well-crafted rollercoaster of horror scenes.

Even if you are not a believer in the paranormal, this trivial belief should not deter you from enjoying and experiencing the terror.Everyone here is perfectly cast. I loved the family, the girls, The Warrens and the parents. They all seemed so perfectly suited for their roles. I even appreciated Wan's usage of 1960's and 70's lingo like ""far out"" and ""groovy"". Although it wasn't germane to the story, he does it just to amuse us. What warms my heart is to see people in movies being genuine and earnest with each other. In an age where we see duplicity, backbiting, and rudeness as the norm, The Conjuring uses their characters with sincerity. Perhaps this is indicative of the period. This is a beautiful film to watch using stunning settings with very chronologically accurate designs and set pieces. The fashion in clothing and choice of automobiles are spot on accurate as well. It's nice to see a director taking care of a movie he cares so much about that we is devoted to expressing accuracy and truth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fun Quasi-Exorcist Update,"Directed by Horror Genre leader, James Wan, ""The Conjuring"" is one of his best efforts. Although not as original as Insidious I enjoyed this horror almost as much. It has more disturbing imagery than his earlier hit, and a more traditional story. Indeed the latter parts of this movie are akin to the decades old ""Exorcist"" but somewhat less religious overall. While the Exorcist involved priests heavily, ""The Conjuring"" stresses the ghost-hunters are less religious. There are a lot of good performances and creeping going on. The back story is convincing and eerie enough. There is less gore and more emphasis on creeps. The core cast do very well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

So yes I recommend seeing this movie! It was worth every penny I spent, which nowadays was a whole darn lot! $50 bucks for me and my sis to see this! Ridiculous' one shared drink shared nachos and two tickets and still ended up Being $50bucks!

"A severely over-rated disappointment,","James Wan once again returns to his Horror roots directing back to back horror movies with The Conjuring closely followed by Insidious Chapter 2. 2011′s Insidious was undeniably one of the biggest horror movies of the year and I absolutely enjoyed it . Even to the point that I started recommending it to people. Insidious had atmospheric horror, and it had almost everything going for it, everything except a lackluster ending which it had to include for an obvious sequel. Nonetheless James Wan knows his movies; be it Saw, Dead Silence or Death Sentence, entertainment is guaranteed. His latest offering The Conjuring is nothing but a haunted house movie albeit following the 'old wine new bottle' routine. If you are horror movie fan you'll instantly feel in familiar territory here. We've had more than a handful of them, the best being The Amityville Horror, The Haunting, The Shining, Poltergeist, the list goes on. So what's new here? Actually nothing, as soon as the middle-class family moves into their new house, you know things are gonna get awry. It starts off with a very slow first act and they dump all the noisy, in-your-face stuff towards the finale as the demons and violent spirits takes a toll. I'd been hearing a lot of positive reviews about this one, some even quoting that its one of the scariest movies ever to hit the screen or even that the visuals will be stuck in your head making you paranoid with every creak you hear in your house post-watching this. I can't say the same though, yes it did give me jolts and ample amounts of anxiety but the visuals just didn't have any effect on me. I forgot about it as soon as I came outta the theater. There are a lot of memorable scenes though made possible with some fantastic camera work. I suppose I had my expectations way too high reading those rave reviews which made my experience so .so yeah even this one could be hampering your experience should you choose to watch the movie. The plot-direction is one among the high points here, balancing the events from both families, The Perrons who are the victims of the haunting and The Warrens who are the ghost hunters. Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston as the Perrons did convincing acting. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Lorraine and Ed Warren delivered splendid performances. Vera, being my favorite from The Orphan and loads of other movies, was no less impressive here. The kids were another addition to the brilliant casting, there were five of them and it seemed too much of a crowd initially but the ones who were terrified victims and dragged to the end did an astounding job, among them Joey King who played a younger version of Talia in The Dark Knight Rises gave a noteworthy performance here as Christine. Ah well now the about the unholy beings, they were terrifying indeed, thanks to good makeup and less-screen time. James Wan did go for the right amount of 'the less you see the more you'll be scared' formula and it did do wonders. There was this particularly awesome scene which involves one perched atop a cupboard. Clearly haunted house horror genre aren't my cup of tea unless its another Cabin in The Woods which had tons of novelty (yet again I wouldn't call it scary). I was more scared of twitchy otherworldly beings like Mama, Samara from The Ring or the ones from The Grudge but for others though, The Conjuring might just satiate their terrifying needs as evident from the pretty lady behind me who kept gasping more than needed. The Conjuring is a well directed, brilliantly acted horror movie with mild scares that could be enjoyed the same at home with a good pair of headphones. As for me I'm gonna wait for Insidious Chapter 2 and see if its got some real scares.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Sinister + Paranormal = The Conjuring,"First the good. The movie is scary. There is little in the way of psychological thrills and chills (which is my favorite, think ""Evil Things"" for a fantastic example) but lots of shocks, jumps and BOO! moments that give you that jolt of adrenaline fear we scary movie lovers desire. Visuals are pretty darn disturbing, WELL DONE, and scary, too.The not so good. The reason this only gets a 7 is it's a formula. Its Sinister + Paranormal with some parts taken directly from each film. Its a lot of haunted house clichés right back to Amityville Horror. It has a slight hole in the plot (the experts arrive to inform the terrorized family the spooky entity is attached to them, not the property - even though their research indicates the spook is strictly concerned with the property) Of course the terrorized family WON'T leave the house...etc.If this had been an original story with more and well established psychological thrills, minus every haunted house cliché, this film would be an easy 8 or 9 and possibly a 10. The cinematography was brilliant, the acting was adequate, the spooks were spooky, just needed less formula and more originality.I'm glad I went to see this in the theater. I'm also glad I saw 30 Days of Night in the theater. (to give you a reference of my taste) Even though its a 7, its easily the best movie I've seen all year, and likely will hold on to that spot if Insidious 2 doesn't knock it from top spot.

Pass the Popcorn review,"James Wan is probably the most famous young horror director. He was involved in the Saw saga, directing two and producing all of the movies. He's also famous for including a specific trademark in all of his horror movies – that trademark being creepy evil dolls. But The Conjuring is supposed to differ from his previous works, since it's based on the true story of the Perron family and Ed and Lorraine Warren, the latter being famous paranormal investigators who worked on the Amytiville Horror case, among many others. The Conjuring was extremely well received, which is kind of a surprise, as new horror movies are not generally known for being good.In 1971, the Perron family – Roger, Carolyn and their five daughters – moves into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island. On their first night there, they discover a secret cellar, and while sleeping, an invisible force pulls one of the daughters' leg. In the morning, they find their dog – who didn't want to enter the house – dead. The next days, more strange things happen: doors open on their own, clapping can be heard when there's nobody there etc. Frightened, Carolyn (Lily Taylor) convinces Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) to come and inspect the house. The couple discovers a malevolent spirit attached to the Perron family and decide to look for evidence in order to request an exorcism from the Church.The Conjuring isn't entirely faithful to the true story – for example, the Perrons lived in the haunted house 10 years, while the movie makes it look like just a couple of weeks, and they have reported the presence of good spirits, too. But that's not really relevant, especially because most people will find it much more interesting to speculate whether the spirits/demons are real at all (it happens with every movie of this kind). And also because The Conjuring is a great movie. It's not a typical jump scare plus murderous demon kind of horror, which is excellent because it really works hard to scare you, mainly by creating atmosphere (unlike the jump scares that just abuse human instincts). In the end, you find you were mostly afraid of nothing, because you expected something to appear but it never did. This is the movie's best feature, since all the other scares, featuring visible spirits, aren't quite as scary. I also appreciated the fact that the movie's following two timelines – the Warrens' and the Perrons'. The Warrens' especially adds a lot of drama to the movie, which makes it very relaxing from time to time, but also lets you connect with the characters a lot. Too many times do we see a horror movie in which people die before we've even learned their names.The acting is very good, too, especially the children's – who all look genuinely afraid when they have to – and even though there are no famous actors in the movie. Finally, the use of soundtrack was amazing, as a dramatically loud sound was rarely heard when something scary occurred: again, the makers of the movie didn't focus on humans' natural, instinctive responses in order to create fear. Now, about the things I didn't quite like. The movie starts out with the Annabelle doll story: a doll inhabited by a demon was taken by the Warrens to their home after they had performed an exorcism on it. There is absolutely no reason to start the movie off with that story, since it isn't linked in any way to the Perron family, either in the movie or in real life. Still, this start is interesting and creepy, and I admit it seems reasonable to use that story to explain what the Warrens do for a living. Moreover, the beginning is not as bad as the ending of the movie. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that all the build-up during the movie doesn't quite pay off and everything is kind of underwhelming. Nevertheless, The Conjuring is a very good horror movie that will intrigue and scare – and maybe even make you keep the lights on at night.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good for people with insomnia,"Made me sleep quite deeply. You know... It's the type of movie that builds up forever and disappoints.

Is it any good?,"I live in RI, and I make deliveries for a living so I'm at the house at least once a week. Is this movie any good? I've never seen it but, think I should because the visitors there allways say ""Isn't this awesome? This is the Conjuring House."" I remember when it came out it was in the news about people trespassing on the property. The new owners have done a bunch of work and the place looks great I must say. Only thing I've ever experienced there, was someone must of had one of those static machines from the ghost shows because when I pulled in, my phone that I use for a radio started making that noise. So someone please let me know if this movie is worth renting? Thanks!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the most scary films I've seen,"I'm not a fan of horror films but I had to watch it when I read it was based on a true story. To what extent the truth was told?

Striking original movie of the Conjuring universe,"This is a beautiful example of the renaissance of horror in the new millennium. Claimed to be a true story of a 1970 case of the married paranormal investigators and demonologists Lorraine and Ed Warren, a family moves into a ramshackle home out in the country. They have sunk everything into the home and cannot move when it becomes apparent that the place is hopping with ghosts. The acting is great, especially the always exquisite Lili Taylor. She becomes possessed and has to pull out all the stops, which she does with aplomb.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Instant Classic,"The Conjuring is one of the top horror movies of all time. It was literally an instant classic when it was released in 2013. It's the best haunted house/devil possession film since The Exorcist. Good performances from the entire cast including the children actors who knocked it put of the park. The score and use of sound really gets the hair on your neck to stand up especially on first viewing. It's the best shot haunted house film ever, great angles and more use of practical effects (well modern practical effects) that make it feel more real. The facts that it's based on actual events and the Warrens in general make it creepier and more enjoyable because again it adds to the realism and brings you into the story more.It's has great jump scares but also doesn't completely depend on them to make you uneasy and scared. The story is great and hooks you plus the introduction of the Warrens which expands the universe that they eventually built. After you have seen it a few times you appreciate it even more because of how well done it is. It's such a good film that it deserves more than just the usuals Halloween time play through. It's a great summer film as well for kids at sleepovers or just relaxing Friday night at home after work. After you watch the first I highly recommend the sequel because it too is a fantastic horror/haunted house film. Not as good as the first but arguably the best sequel to a horror film ever. If Conjuring 1 is an A+ masterpiece of haunted house films then the second is easily an A- and valued addition to the genre. The third film is a solid entry as well, a noticeable step down but still a solid B.Do yourself a favor and watch these films but when you watch this one appreciate the greatness of it. It's not just a horror masterpiece it's a great film altogether.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
After seeing so many 10 star and 1 star reviews... I give 6 stars.,"After reading the reviews I am quite surprised how people watched this movie. I think expectations are maybe too high if you only read 10 star reviews. However, this movie is not THAT bad to give it 1 star either.'It is nothing new, we have seen this all before'. Clearly this is another haunted house movie, we know this genre by now but the movie never really claims to be anything more than that. If you are tired of classic horror stories, than don't watch it.Is it the most scary movie I have ever seen? No, but it kept me on the edge of my chair and there were for sure successful jump scares and unnerving moments.
I was entertained for most of the movies duration and I think that is what a horror movie like this is meant for and why it actually is better than a lot of other movies in this genre. No, there is no original creative story to it, yes at moments it is cliche (it is set in the 70's, In a haunted house, clearly the directors watched a horror movie before and they clearly do not try to avoid cliche's, it is basically the whole charm of the movie). The characters are not that complex, the story is not deep, the acting is a bit unrealistic at times, and the ghosts look like we have seen them before but as a whole I think this movie works and delivers just what a movie like this should be delivering.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
CONJURING REVIEW,"First of all, this movie is amazing. James Wan did a perfect job, as well as two lead actors, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga.Conjuring has something that many modern horror movies lack - character depth. In this movie, you really do care for characters. All actors did a perfect job, especially Patrick and Vera and I think that they are irreplaceable as Ed and Lorraine.Now about the scarriness. This movie is truly scary. James Wan is one of the few people who can make jumpscares actually scary and good. Clap scene and Wardrobe scene have one of the best jumpscares of the modern horror. This movie has an R-rating, although it's not that gory or violent and has no sex or nudity scenes. This movie got an R-rating just because how scary it is.This movie also started one of the most exciting things in the world of horror, The Conjuring Universe. At the time I'm writing this, there are 7 movies in Conjuring Universe and I'm really looking forward to everything that they will make in the future.Review by SeljoberXXL",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good but filmmaker did not know how to end it...,"This movie is a mix between Amityville and The Exorcist. First it's about the house, then it's about and evil entity and it ends with possession.I really liked this movie, it was interesting, it was stressful (not in any horrific way), the plot seem to be good, until the end... The ending was like a slap in my face, downright too easy.Maybe it took them too long to get to the end and they had to rush it because of time limits, I don't know but the possession part ends all to quick and they live happily ever after...And what's the link between the doll and what's happening with the Perron family?And with everything happening in the movie, I don't see Lorraine suffering much from anything...",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"BORING for first hour, EXCELLENT for the last 45 minutes","I have absolutely no idea why this film has the rating it has. The first hour is SLOW, BORING and completely PLAYED OUT. No need to give anything away. Just rest assured that you will yawn for the first hour waiting for the film to actually take off. Nothing original at all and way too slow.Then the film takes off, and when it does you will be happy you gave it a chance to develop. The last 45-50 minutes make the entire film worth watching. It is like an old-school horror movie that sucks you in and delivers genuinely scary moments. Excellently done last half of the film.When taken in total, this film is only a 6 because of the way it starts. Had they done something even remotely interesting or unique with the first half then perhaps it would have been better. Unfortunately, the film is 20-25 minutes too long with totally boring content that reduces this films to a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Terrific a ghost Movie that delivers,"The Conjuring tells the tale Of 1970, paranormal investigators and demonologists Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed (Patrick Wilson) the duo investigate the home of Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston) Perron.

Be prepared for your popcorn to drop,"""The Conjuring"" is horror well made that earns it's R-rating solely based on terror without any sex, gore or cuss words. It's a welcome change from the overused and hence clichéd ""found footage"" genre. Set in 1971, paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren are approached by a mother whose family is being tormented by a demonic presence in their new home. It doesn't take long for the Warren's to get sucked right in the sinister situation. Unlike most horror flicks these days where the evil spirit crawls across the walls and ceiling wearing white, ""The Conjuring"" does not show much and builds on the greatest fear on mankind - fear of what they can't see. The acting, screenplay, sound and set design is very fitting too. My advice? Be prepared for your popcorn to drop if you go in with one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Surprisingly Well,"I would had never gone to see this movie if it weren't for the fact of looking up its score on IMDb here. I was shocked that a horror movie got such a decently high rating. So, that's what compelled me to go see it with my girlfriend.From the well placed scare parts to the well paced plot, I never felt bored or tired. The acting was great and the story solid. It was perhaps a bit too polished for my tastes in regards to the theme of the movie.I loved the musical score, the lighting and also the sound effects.I implore anyone looking for a good scare, with friends, to see this movie, with the lights off. There are also a lot of ""wt*"" moments that are scary and funny.Thank you for reading my review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Give it a shot,"I finally got to watch this movie and I wasn't disappointed. You may think that it's just like all the other possession movies with the haunted house and the dad not believing anything etc. But this movie is different. They seek out the help and find the Warrens.There is also a little back story to them as well which I found very interesting. Most times, the ""psychics"" are just that, no back story, and are solely there for the purpose of trying to get rid of the demons.It's rated ""R"" but their isn't any blood or guts or much swearing for that matter. It's given that rating because of how tense it gets. Their are typical jumps and scares and most of the time you see it coming but there are a couple that got me.If you're looking for a movie to scare you, this is a one that I would definitely recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Decent,"This film is pretty decent and did make me jump a good few times, the casting is solid and the cinematography pretty alright as well, the thing that kind of pulled me out of this movie however was the make-up.The start of the movie was pretty great, I was creeped out and all the scares were working but around halfway through I was left somewhat unimpressed by some of the make-up on the dead characters, the costumes were good and I found them scary from a distance or when I couldn't see their faces but once we started getting up close and personal with the ghosts you could really tell they were fake, this was a shame because after this point the scares started becoming quicker and more which you could tell was supposed to leave you on the edge of your seat but again didn't work for me. I think the film really works best when it's going slowly and the ghosts are left up to your imagination but when it all starts ramping up towards the end it stops being scary. Decent enough horror film though, would recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Good, but didn't do much for me","On the plus side, it had Lili Taylor in it, and except for the ear scene it had no gory scenes. Except for the climax, I found it rather flat. To me it was more of a thriller, than a horror movie. I found the direction rather uninspired. But I'm not a big fan of The Exorcist either, so that might say something. I never experienced a sense of dread. Okay, I'll qualify that, I did wonder what was going to appear from behind the sheet. So i am thankful, there were no scenes with maggots coming out of mouths ☺ Perhaps the director played it too low key. It got a little more intense in the climax. But for me. It was too little too late.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
James Wan makes a great movie out of a terribly generic script,"Even though the exorcism genre is extremely overplayed, The Conjuring stands tall among this overcrowded genre. While it doesn't add anything new to the group, it does a great job building suspense and offers a few genuine scares. The storyline is as bland as they come, a family terrorized by ghosts/demons turns to someone with psychic abilities to fight the demons and ends up needing to perform an exorcism. We've seen this time and time again, but this time James Wan adds some solid nostalgia/style and what I think stood out the most, terrifying sound effects to make the movie something special.I've said it before and I'll say it again, The Conjuring is the most polished, clichéd, horror movie ever made. It features hardly any original ideas, but it takes a generic storyline and somehow makes it shine, it's crazy to see how effective a movie can be in the hands of a good director. A certain crowd-pleaser, this will probably be the general public's favorite horror movie of recent memory, but certainly not mine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nothing New,I would give this film a 6/10 and tbh that's me being generous. The first hour moves at a snails pace but once the warrens take the case and the film moves into its final act it does start to pick up however by this point I had lost most of my interest in the film. Whilst I'm happy the people giving this 10/10 enjoyed the film I really don't understand what they think is so good about it. It's a nice try at creating something unique within the possession sub genre of horror but for me it really fell flat and is not something that I will be likely to ever go back to again.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great Family Movie, it ended a little too early.","Not bad, If I could I would rate this movie 6.75, I don't think this film is too scary, a tough 10yr old girl could handle this film just fine.The characters in it were decent and the actors were good enough me to believe that no other actor could fit the roles they played any better.I think the movie was about 30min too short from being a 9 or 10. The director had great ideas and he should have stretched out a few of the scenes a bit longer, because some of them happened too fast. If the scenes were longer I don't think it would make the movie boring. I just felt that some of the horror and gore was done in a hurry and there could have been more time dedicated to more of the characters in the movie.I am happy to see that someone finally made an R rated horror movie that didn't have to get there by using nudity & sex. Don't get me wrong, I love me some naked girls in movies but a truly scary movie has it's work cut out for it to become an R rated movie.Some of the horror scenes in the movie were funny to me. The exorcism went by too quick, it definitely could have been a few minutes longer to make me feel a little uncomfortable about it, I love the messed up feeling I get after watching a warped movie.The marketing done for this movie was too strong and lead me to expect more than what was in the actual commercials, they could have held back and still sold it just fine. I don't think I got ripped off by going to see it in the theatre but I would have been happy to watch this film on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Future Classic Horror Film. Exceptional Cast In The Horror Genre.,"This is a great film and has inspired four sequels in six years.

Good Movie But....,"When I first heard The Conjuring announced, I wasn't that excited. The plot wasn't something new, and I just was not that excited. James Wan, a good director with movies like ""Saw"" and ""Insidious"", kind of brought my attention to this movie. However, when ""The Conjuring"" came out, it got very good reviews with critics and even better ones from fans. I then got exceptionally more excited for the movie and planned to see it in theaters. I came in waiting for a movie to scare me out of my seats but what disappointed me the most was....the scares themselves. I had watched a couple of trailers for the movie before going to the theaters and the trailers revealed more than half of the scares! It got so bad that I was even calling out the scares before they even came out. It really ruined the movie for me but I didn't let that influence my review. ""The Conjuring"" is a good horror movie don't get me wrong, but its not anything new. Sure it's better than most horror movies coming out now, but it is not as terrifying as most people say it is. My recommendation, watch it, but DO NOT watch any trailers for it. If you did, you're going to be a little disappointed with how much the trailers show.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Finally a good thriller...,"After many medium thriller movies comes ""The Conjuring"" to overturn all of these.

Decent Horror Film,"The Conjuring certainly isn't a groundbreaking horror film that does for its time what The Exorcist did back in the day, that's for sure. However, the film knows exactly what market it's trying to appeal to and work with, and it does it extremely well. It's suspenseful when it needs to be, it does a good job of inviting the audience to gain an emotional investment in the characters, the jumpscares (coming from a viewer who detests the concept of using such a cheap way to gain a scare out of the audience) are well executed, it's well written, directed, and performed.
Ed and Lorraine Warren are real-life paranormal investigators who have dealt with a number of cases. This film, supposedly, is one that they hadn't spoken about prior to the film, and it documents the ""true story"" of what they dealt with. Prior to her passing, Lorraine has been seen giving interviews in conjunction with this franchise, which appears as an endorsement in the project. With one of the individuals the film is based on approving, it adds an extra layer of intensity -- and respect -- to the project.
Overall. while far from perfect, The Conjuring does a fantastic job of pulling off exactly what it was trying to do. Whether or not it's actually based on a true story is debatable, but it's easily one of the better horror films of the last 10 years (hard to believe it's been out for 8 now) and it was profitable enough to spawn an entire universe of films.
Personally I've only seen a few of them and I have some catching up to do, but I'm excited to dive into this franchise to see where they take it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Little Overproduced,"The Conjuring is at its best during its more classical haunted house moments where characters walk around in dark places with candles or flashlights as the sound designers take over and let your imagination run wild.

spooky stuff,"Despite hating the title, and thinking it all looked like the usual ""little girl ghost"" kind of stuff, I went to see ""The Conjuring"" fairly recently, and was pleasantly surprised.Maybe I shouldn't of been. Its from the same people that brought us ""Sinister"" and ""Paranormal activity."" Horror movies that prey on psychologically freaked out viewers such as myself.It all sounds vaguely familiar though. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play paranormal investigators who are called to the aid of a genuinely terrified family, as they start experiencing strange and spooky stuff going on in their new home. Which of course they can't leave because they've just spent a fortune moving there.What could have been a pretty standard haunted house movie though is given a boost by being a sometimes genuinely scary haunted house movie. After we get all of the usual doors slamming and stuff floating around rubbish out of the way, this one shows signs of some promise. Plus I had a good time at the cinema with this one. Everyone there seemed to enjoy it, and there haven't been that many times at the cinema where everyone was really getting freaked out by the same movie.

What's with the hype?,"Horror is one of my favorite genres in film, I think it says a lot about our nature and it takes a lot of skill to create a truly frightening experience for moviegoers. I stayed away from The Conjuring series because I felt it had everything that's boring and predictable about modern American horror just by reading the accolades it got. I wasn't interested in Annabelle or The Nun or any other James Wan related flick for that matter -though the first Saw is really ok just for the ending. I have a lot of friends and follow a lot of critics whose opinions I respect a lot and they all praise this film so much that I though ""Well, there MUST be something really cool about it. I might be missing something good"". And I rented it and watched it at 1 AM with all the lights turned off and... You know, all the ritual for horror fans. I wasn't disappointed, it was what I expected: a well directed, well acted (Farmiga and Wilson are amazing actors) mediocre jump-scare fest. It is by no means a bad film, but i isn't worth of it's hype and in no way deserves to have so many sequels and spin-offs. If this is the best of the series, how bland and generic could the rest be? I'm really surprised to see how many people connect with this when it delivers a poor atmosphere, the scares are really dull and uninspiring, the supernatural makeup is terrible. The best scene for me was the hair-pulling possession, that was really nice, but other than that I felt it never delivered anything new to the genre or even something remotely frightening. It was just ok, and it saddens me to think this type of film (along with Insidious and Sinister, which I haven't seen either and after this experience I'm not planning on never seeing them at all) is what American horror is now about. How dull! I love The VVitch for it's tense atmosphere and for being such a beautiful portray of witch-era tales, and Hereditary is an amazing horror-drama with a subpar plot twist that left me feeling cheated, but still I felt like watching something fresh and chilling. It wasn't the case with The Conjuring and I just can't see what everyone sees in it. I was right about it all along.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
James Wan goes one step further and gives a spooky thriller,"The best part of watching horror films is the chill that will run down your spine , the curiosity to watch what-happens next , the excitement it builds pumping up your blood level. The Conjuring gives an adrenaline rush to your body with few scary scenes and spooky moments. Only I wish , it could have been more.Mysterious things begins to fall on The Perron family once they move into the house by lake. Sooner they seek help from the famous Paranormalist The Warrens to help them resolve the happenings and ward off the evil that is scaring their daughters to death.From the director of SAW and The Insidious , James Wan goes on step ahead and explores a complete new dimension with this taut horror . The story is based on true incidents and is powerful along with fantastic screenplay. I felt that there were some chilling moments in the film but not enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Couple of scenes will give you a jilt - The scenes where evil starts unraveling on the family , the moment Warrens enters the house and realizes the evil spirit latching on the family and finally the last exorcism scene has been filmed brilliantly. Cinematoography is good. Art direction is enduring. Editing is tight. It is Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are the soul of the film especially Farmiga.

Conjured 1,"Thought I'd go back and check out the Conjuring series. You know, as much as I hate some of the spin-offs that this has given birth to, I really appreciate this first film. I can't say that I enjoy it all that much, but I can see what it's doing, the path and method of horror that it is employing. It really is going about things in a different way, trying to build tension rather than just splash blood about the screen. Our actors are all delivering solid performances, its well shot and well done overall. That said, I think its in that expanded Conjur-verse that we run into the biggest issue. The story feels... Diluted and spread out. From the beginning, there is so much focus on Annabelle that you can just tell it was always meant to be its own series, the various items in their storeroom intended to give birth to a wide range of various horror tropes. The demonic doll, the unholy nun, etc. If just this first Conjuring could have been its own movie, I think I would put it in that list of great modern horrors but I just can't quite bring myself to do that when I see what its legacy has become and how obviously that was the plan from the beginning.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
