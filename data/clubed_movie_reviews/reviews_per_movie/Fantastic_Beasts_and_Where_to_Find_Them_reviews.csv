I liked it,"I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world.For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure.The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch.However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest.Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn't flawless by any means it's certainly entertaining!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"SFX pretty good, characters & pacing lacking.","It's OK, I suppose.Good parts: Period costumes & sets were beautiful. Special effects were (mostly) very good, and the Fantastic Beasts were individually great fun.So-so parts: The acting was only OK. Newt (Eddie Redmayne) in particular left me dissatisfied. Yes he's playing an introverted character, but I saw no reason for the bond he seemed to build with Tina. The MACUSA wizards & witches were extremely underdeveloped, including the President. Their hot-and-cold treatment of Tina for her interruptions made no sense to me either.Poor: The editing seemed off to me, in a way I haven't noticed since The Chamber of Secrets. --- awkward pauses littered the film, robbing it of its momentum. Newt's interaction with some of the larger beasts didn't look realistic (e.g. his stroking the Thunderbird's neck). And I personally dislike FX-heavy movies where the Big Bad is some amorphous cloud (not as bad as Green Lantern, but pretty bad).Final thought: why do so many large beasts have bird's heads? This seems to be a thing with Rowling ...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Charming and endearing!,"I admit walking into the theater, I was very excited but also a little apprehensive. I should not have worried at all though, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was incredibly enjoyable! Rowling's magical world is as alluring and fun as ever! For me, the best thing about this movie is exactly that. Exploring this world.In the Harry Potter saga, with the exception of Deathly Hallows, most of the action was confined in Hogwarts. When we were taken out of the school, the main characters, being underage, were not allowed to do magic. The novelty in this movie is that we get to follow a fully fledged adult wizard in an entirely new environment and observe the dynamics and workings of the magical society.Said wizard is Newt Scamander, a magical zoologist that traveled the world in order to find and document rare creatures, which he carries in his magical suitcase. When this suitcase gets mixed up with one that belongs to muggle Jacob, some of Newt's creatures escape and cause problems in New York.Eddie Redmayne shines in this movie. He plays a very clearly British, endearing and slightly awkward Newt, but the character's kindness is obvious by the loving and friendly way that he treats his magical creatures. Dan Fogler does a great job as Jacob Kowalski, the muggle who is suddenly thrown into a world of wonder that existed beside him all along. He is the one the audience can best relate to, since he mirrors our sense of marvel. Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sudol also do a good job as the two vastly different magical sisters, who aid Newt in his adventure. If I had a small gripe, it would be that the excellent Colin Farell was in my opinion under used.All in all, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a solid and visually stunning movie that manages to achieve three things.First, although it takes place in the Harry Potter universe, it stands apart and has its very own story, which can be enjoyed separately from that of the famous young wizard. Second, it drops quite a few hints and names, which not only tie in nicely with the stories that we know, but also serve to set up the next installments, which are rumored to document Dumbledore's past and connection with Grindelwald. Finally, the movie features a bustling 1926 New York, which coupled with the intriguing character dynamics, offers a brand new insight into Rowling magical world and leaves us poor muggles asking for more.After following Harry's adventures, many of us were left wanting to see much more of the story and luckily for us, it seems Rowling has that much more to offer. Personally, I can't wait for the next movie, great job!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's watchable, I was a little disappointed.","I watched this for the second time, having been a little disappointed first time around, and perhaps didn't have the best of days. My opinion, second time round, hasn't changed a great deal, the visuals and special effects are terrific, I just found the plot and storyline a little thin.I would say it helps if you're a huge fan of Harry Potter and JK Rowling's works, you may be a bit more forgiving, I found it a little bit frustrating. Definitely some good elements, but I'm not sure the elaborate visuals were enough to keep attention alone. It was a little dull in parts.I must pay huge credit to Eddie Redmayne, I thought he was great as the lead character, I'm so used to seeing him in serious dramas, it was nice to see him doing something different, he was great.They certainly put together an awesome cast for this one, Gemma Chan, Colin Farrell, John Voight, and of course the excellent Samantha Morton.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Harry Potter based film without Harry Potter? No problem.,"Originality is nearly non-existent in the movie industry now a days since sequels, spin-offs, prequels, and Remakes dominate. But I do usually see them because the originals are good. Checking this out in theaters for me didn't require any trailers, because its based on the Harry Potter universe. What's not to like about that?This film is set in the same universe as Harry Potter, except in 1926, in New York. It is centered on the wizard Newt Scamander, who brings magical a suitcase containing Magical Creatures to New York, but when the creatures come loose, its up to him and his friends to get them back to avoid getting exposed to non magical people. The movie mostly has a good pace, and is fun. It also introduces interesting ideas to the universe, which really got me intrigued. However, it can be confusing, and hard to get into at first. When I watched it, it took me 10-15 minutes to understand it. But those little nitpicks don't take away the good writing this film has.For the characters of this film, they are a pretty enjoyable cast. The main character Newt (I'm just going to be honest) is a moron. Seriously why would anyone think that bringing a suitcase of magical creatures that isn't 100% secure to a city of non magical people is a wonderful idea? However, he is a fun character with a goofy personality and if great to follow. Also joining the adventure, is the auror Tina and her sister Queenie, who are likable and contribute to the adventure. But my favorite character is Jacob, who is a no-maj(non magical person) who gets involved in the adventure and helps Newt. I liked how he has a goofy personality and is very funny. The fantastic beasts in the movie are also really funny, and cute as well. I only mentioned those because the rest of the cast involves spoilers, but the characters are overall pleasant additions to the Harry Potter universe.The visual effects in this movie are better than shown in the other 8 Harry Potter movies. The budget is 180 million and it shows. The design of the animals are brilliant, (just to avoid the ""fantastic"" pun)with unique abilities, and they all stand out rather than simply having dragons. Other magic in the film is unique (like the suitcase). I like how this film used many more of these ideas to bring to life and doesn't make it stand out as much in the action scenes or use gimmicks (unlike the other Harry Potter films). So overall, brilliant visual effects to add to this film.After the Harry Potter films, I didn't expect this spin-off to be this good, but I was wrong. The movie is overall a holiday treat with a Fun story and characters, interesting ideas, and awesome effects. It is a recommendation from me indeed, and after this, we'll see if the next spin-off coming to theaters near us, Rouge One: A Star Wars Story, can top this.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was better the second time around...,"I watched the movie back in 2016, when it was just released, and believe you me I wasn't impressed. But then again, I never were heavily into the ""Harry Potter"" universe that Rowling has created.But I sat down in 2022 to watch ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" again, deciding to start over and actually catch up on the two sequel movies that I hadn't seen either. So of course I started from the beginning to get up to speed.Now, I didn't particularly enjoy the 2016 movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" from writer J. K. Rowling and director David Yates. But I guess 6 years softened me up a bit, as I found a bit more enjoyment in the movie the second time around. Hold your horses, because I am not won-over, nor would I consider myself a fan.The storyline in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is adequate. I mean, it is not a movie that requires the audience to invest their heart and soul, so you can essentially just lean back and munch on your snacks while you watch the movie. I found the storyline to be boring the first time around, and now in 2022 I found it a bit more interesting. It still wasn't a riveting storyline that had me on the edge of my seat though.Visually then ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is great. It was so back in 2016, and it is still in 2022. So if for nothing else, then you certainly are in for quite a visual CGI treat if you sit down to watch ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"".Something that is impressive in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", is the cast list. They certainly had managed to put together rather extensive cast ensemble with lots of talented actors and actresses. While I didn't really care much for the character Newt, then actor Eddie Redmayne actually put on a convincing and good performance as Newt. The movie also have the likes of Dan Fogler, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight, Gemma Chan, Ron Perlman, and Johnny Depp on the cast list.""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" certainly is a movie that would have an appeal to the fans of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, of that I am quite certain.My rating of ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find a Compelling Plot?,"A charitable rating because I like the beasts very much (albeit it'd be nice if this was the era of Jim Henson's Creature Shop instead of ALL CGI), and I even didn't actively dislike Eddie Redmayne here like in his performances last year (though he still has certain little tics and a wide-eyed profile that's not enormously likable). Basically anything to do with Newt Scamander's adventures along with Jacob the would-be baker (a funny if one and a half note Dan Fogler) and Kathleen Waterson is a fun time, and there's an element of Doctor Who I appreciated as far as a character going off into some new place with his police box (err, suitcase here), facing off with some gnarly creatures, and humans who are a variety of helpful and disastrous.But when it gets into the actual *plot* it becomes trickier to handle for Rowling as a (first-time?) screenwriter: there's darkness here that sometimes, not all the time, gets to be too dark, at least for what is being set up as a ""franchise"" or whatever. In the Potter films there was a more gradual build up to darker themes and tones and scenes and kills. Here, it's just there, and despite finding Samantha Morton to be terrifying in a convincing way as the head of an anti-witch cult, and despite finding Colin Farrel to be sturdy as a villain, I didn't much care for the conflicts around the uh, Obscurus-what-have-you (sorry if I'm not good with names, it's a late-night review), and ultimately it's a lack of heart that makes me not care as much. To put it into perspective, I found more to engage in emotionally with Fogler than Redmayne, by a mile, and only hints (but not enough) with Waterson's backstory.What makes me want to give it an even lower rating is that the final act turns into what so many Hollywood movies from these studios out to be Legacyquel-McFranchise-villes is that it has to be some massive threat tearing ass through the city and the (super)heroes have to face off to stop it. There's actually one interesting facet to this that kinda-sorta is happening, where it's compassion or even something close to empathy, that Newt uses against the villainous force, however this gets put on the wayside for more action and special effects that are surface-cool but deep down empty and it all leads up to a reveal for an actor to come that made me throw out my hands like ""WHY!?!"" There's derivative things to this movie that Rowling may have made intentional or not; aside from Doctor Who, I also thought of Men in Black with it featuring a Magic-Police-Special-Agency force, and X-Men in large part with Farrel's character (tell me you don't see Magneto there, especially near the end).I found a lot of creativity and some clever things to this - hell, a platypus obsessed with thievery is a highlight of any movie this *year* let alone this one - and just the idea that this is a hero not unlike a, uh, Charles Darwin but with magic. I went in with a lot of goodwill towards this, but didn't leave as satisfied as I had hoped given this writer and the world to work in. It's the sort of blockbuster that would have me, then lose me, have me then lose me, and so on (i.e. on one hand Ron Perlman cameo, and you'll know it when you see it; on the other hand... Ezra Miller).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Magical, but very different, successor to the Harry Potter sphere","I wasn't sure what to expect from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. It smelt curiously of ""cash grab"" since the Harry Potter films managed to conclude themselves quite perfectly, all the more so considering Warner Brothers preemptively announced four sequels before this film had reached theatres. The best compliment I can give it is that it proved me wrong- Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them never feels lazy, or cheap - it's a worthy adventure that will have all but the most cynical revelling in the wonder of the Wizarding World.The film is fast paced and constantly dishing out new surprises, in the form of beautifully rendered, inventive CGI ""beasts,"" and a number of hilarious, imaginative features of this magical world of New York that successfully create the illusion of being in a different world. There are tons of minute little details that delight in the purest sense. The set of new faces are mostly agreeable, the most likable being Dan Fogler, whose bumbling ""non - magi"" is a welcome addition. He elevates sometimes silly jokes with expert comedic timing and facial expressions. Katherine Waterston is fine enough, as is her flirtatious sister. And what of star Eddie Redmayne? He is alternately charming and annoying. The character of Newt Scamander is one fully realised by Rowling's script, yet Redmayne's Hugh Grant- esque, crouched delivery is at times grating. Nonetheless he wins you over in the end. I won't say who the villains are, because that plays into the intrigue of the plot, but suffice to say villainous characters were decidedly underused for my taste, and could've used far more development than the already packed script granted them.In all, this film never quite touches the awe and great characters imbued within each Harry Potter film and book, but it offers many delights nonetheless, and is definitely worth seeing, especially on a big screen, where it looks positively beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Marvelous Cash Cows and How to Milk Them,"As just about everyone in the whole muggle world (or nomaj world if you're reading this in the States) knows, FBaWtFT is the first of a five film spin-off series from the Potter franchise, still under the careful stewardship of David Yates. (And if the other films in the series were 'amber-lit' rather than 'green-lit', their production now seems assured after the US opening weekend alone has brought in nearly half its $180 million budget).Set in New York in the mid-1920's Eddie Redmayne (""The Danish Girl""; ""The Theory of Everything"") plays Newt Scamander, a Brit newly arrived with a case full of trouble. Newt is a bit like an amiable and ditsy David Attenborough, with a strong desire to protect and establish breeding colonies for endangered species. It's fair to say though that these are creatures that even Sir David hasn't yet filmed.Within the battered old case (a forerunner of Hermione Grainger's bag, which was probably borrowed from Mary Poppins), Newt stores a menagerie of strange and wonderful creatures which – after a bump and a mishap – get released by wannabe baker and muggle Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler, ""Fanboys""). Newt has the job of rounding up the strays with the help of Tina (Katherine Waterston, ""Steve Jobs""), an out of favour member of the Magical Congress of the USA (MACUSA). Unfortunately this couldn't be happening at a worse time: something else – nothing to do with Newt – is wreaking havoc across New York and MACUSA is on red alert suspecting the involvement of a dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, following attacks in Europe. And keeping the secrets of wizardry from the NoMaj population is getting increasingly difficult, especially with the efforts of the ""Second Salemers"" movement run by Mary Lou (Samantha Morton, ""Minority Report"") and her strange adopted family.This film will obviously be an enormous success given the love of all things Potter, but is it any good? Well, its different for sure, being set many years before Potter and only having glancing references to Hogwarts and related matters. And that gives the opportunity to start afresh with new characters and new relationships which is refreshing. It's all perfectly amiable, with Redmayne's slightly embarrassed lack of eye-contact* in delivering his lines being charming. [* Is this perhaps the second leading character in a month that is high on the autistic spectrum?] . Redmayne does have a tendency to mutter though and (particularly with the sound system for the cinema I saw this in) this made a lot of his dialogue inaudible. Waterston makes for a charming if somewhat insipid heroine, not being given an awful lot to do in the action sequences.Kowalski adds a humorous balance to the mixture, but the star comic turns are some of the creatures, especially the Niffler a light fingered magpie-like creature with a voluminous pouch and expensive tastes!In the 'I-almost-know-who-that-is-behind-the-make-up-but-can't-quite- place-him' role is Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman as the untrustworthy gangster Gnarlack. And in another cameo – and probably paid an enormous fee for his 30 seconds of screen time – is Johnny Depp, which was money well- wasted since, like most of his roles, he was completely unrecognisable (I only knew it was him from checking IMDb afterwards).At the pen is J.K.Rowling herself, and there are a few corking lines in the script. However, in common with many of her novels, there is also a tendency for extrapolation and padding. Some judicial editing could have knocked at least twenty minutes off its child-unfriendly 133 minute running time and made a better film. Undoubtedly the first half of the film is better than the second, with the finale slouching into – as my other half put it – ""superhero"" territory with much CGI destruction and smashing of glass. What is perhaps most surprising about the story is that there are few obvious set-ups for the next film.Quirky and original, its a film that will no-doubt please Potter fans and it stands as a decent fantasy film in its own right. It's difficult though to get the smell of big business and exploitation out of your nostrils: no doubt stockings throughout the world will be full of plush toy nifflers this Christmas.(For the graphical version of this review and to comment please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com.

A classic in its own right,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them... It's not Harry Potter, however it is a classic in its own right. I loved the creature creations for this movie including of course those greedy goblins which I was so very happy to see in this film as well. Eddie Redmayne did such a wonderful job as Newt Scamander and his cast of creatures was breathtaking. They were all created differently and beautifully in their own right. His deep connection and understanding of the creatures was so well done by Redmayne who seemed to be a little Autistic with his lack of eye contact most of the time while talking, which if it was done on purpose, I love it. It gives the character even more depth and beauty. The other wizards were amazing, I think my favorite was Queenie Goldstein she was so endearing and such a wonderfully played character. She had a lot of heart and that endeared her to the audience even more. It was cool to see the differences between the American and British Ministries of Magic and the difference in terminologies between the two countries. All in all this movie gets 5 enthusiastic stars from me. The continuity was incredible and I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic but with deductions.,"Today I left the cinema with mixed feelings. When I saw the first trailer of this movie I was excited, because I like the urban fantasy setting of the Harry Potter universe. Unfortunately Fantastic Beasts couldn't convince me completely. One big positive factor of the movie is the cast. Eddie Redmayne acts great and incarnate perfectly Newt as a sympathetic protagonist. Also the rest of the cast is suitable and sympathetic. I want to emphasize Dan Fogler who plays his role glorious. The charm of the magic was again very well captured. The self-stirring spoon in the cocoa and the many other small details are very coherent and convey this typical Harry Potter Flair. Also very good is the sound (no I don't mean the music) of this movie. I think this is a big reason to watch this movie in theaters, because the sound mixing is great for the big screen (more for the big Hi Fi equipment). So watch this movie in theaters if you have the possibility, because technically it is solid. Some of the audience I watch with didn't like the CGI effects, but in my opinion it was good. Not great, just good and fitting. The narration in the whole movie was the big con for me. The movie has this inconsequent narration. The main problem is that the film tells the two action strings too parallel, so they won 't fix well. Through this, the film becomes too predictable and loses some of its strength. The beginning scene was misleadingly and out of the context, for people who won't read the book. Here, too much was done according to the typical Hollywood formula. The story is pushed too strongly in one direction and the narrative speed is a bit too leisurely for my taste. The whole film would have done 15 to 20 minutes less well. So I promised myself more and I missed something that makes this movie special. With this strong template in the back and the big cast I would have just expected a more rounded movie which sticks out of the mass. I give Fantastic Beasts 7/10, because it is an entertaining movie, with a strong cast, but the narration issues made it a typical Hollywood movie. Not great, not bad, just good. Watch it but don't expect something mind blowing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Charming and entertaining,"JK Rowling will forever be known as one of the most genius humans to ever live. The fact that she can pen such a detailed and perfect magical world without Harry Potter and the beloved characters we have grown to love, it makes you feel like this world is actually real! This movie is very entertaining and and heartwarming. It's no longer a dark saga of an evil dark wizard trying to kill a young boy, it is an insight into a magical world that is so grand and amazing!Despite taking place way before our known HP time, there are enough quick and witty references to our known HP world throughout the movie to make Potterheads smile. I went in with less than no expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. And LOVED IT. And the best part of it all- I've always somewhat disliked the HP movies, because I'm a die-hard fan of the books. The movies never lived up to the books. For Fantastic Beasts, there are no books to compare it to, so there's no room to dislike! Can't wait for the next movies!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Five-Word Review: Delightful, Perfect Series Starter; Disjointed","'Fantastic Beasts' kicks off an all-new franchise in JK Rowling's Wizarding World, set in 1920s New York. Gellert Grindelwald has alienated old friend Albus Dumbledore with his extremist, revolutionary ideas and begun terrorising Europe. Dumbledore, meanwhile, becomes a professor at Hogwarts where his students include Newt Scamander, who is more comfortable around magical animals like Bowtruckles and Nifflers than people. Upon travelling to New York City, however, things do not go to plan.Right out of the gate, this is a wildly entertaining and simply delightful film. Within the first minute the world and setting are perfectly established, and the Roaring Twenties NYC is gorgeously realised, with a very 20s feeling about the film. The best magic from the Harry Potter films is retained and expanded upon - one of the best things is seeing the wider use of magic outside of an education environment, and a particular highlight is a scene where a strudel is exquisitely assembled and cooked using magic, all seemingly in one shot.And speaking of the visual effects, they are fabulous. Gone are the shonky creatures like Fluffy and the Cave Troll from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone back in 2001. The breathtaking visual flair is evident, from the intricate plumage of the Occamy to the Demiguise's silky coat (which is used to make Invisibility Cloaks). The standout, however, is the Niffler. A dragon-like obsession with treasure makes for some hilarious slapstick comedy where the adorable little creature, like a mix between a dog and a mole, rampages through a bank and collects a veritable trove of trinkets.The plot, an original creation from Rowling, is surprisingly good, with some dynamic turns (though this occasionally gives way to poor pacing) and solid twists. The wider magical world is something I've been wanting to see since my first experience with HP, and Fantastic Beasts sets up this world wonderfully, with lots of space for future expansion. One thing this film does really well is kicking off a new franchise - there's a clear feeling that there will be lots of material for future sequels, and just enough teasing of some elements to be intriguing.There are lots of nice touches in the film which really make it more watchable, from Newt's remarks about the Eastern Front of World War One (dragons), to the NYC-cranky-cab-driver voices of the house elves. Ron Perlman unexpectedly shows up and steals his scene with a delightful caricature of a speakeasy owner that is fabulously over-the-top, and overall the film feels separate enough from HP to work on its own but also connected enough to be accessible to fans.The standout character is, somewhat surprisingly, Dan Fogler's Kowalski, a Muggle (No-Maj) who is equal parts comic relief and relatable schmuck. The rest of the acting is sometimes a little off, though Ezra Miller is fantastic and Eddie Redmayne seems a good choice for the role of Scamander. At first I thought his acting was sub- par, but I think the fault lies with the writers - whether deliberately or not, he is not characterised very much, though this is probably to leave room for expansion in the sequels.In fact few of the characters have much development due to the often rushed nature of the film and its abundance of different elements, resulting in a film which is often disjointed and messy. It's also a little too tonally uneven, with some moments just being a bit too broad to hit home and clashing with its darker moments. It's at its best during its lighter moments, not taking itself seriously and having a good time.All in all this is a must-watch for any HP fan, and should be a delightful watch for any viewer. Despite its flaws, it's a very solid start to a franchise which I hope will be just as good as its predecessor. 79/100.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Charming Expansion of Harry Potter Universe,"This is my first review on IMDb. I felt compelled to do so after reading Empire's underwhelming 3 Star review (does their opinion count for anything any more?), then going on to watch the movie myself last night.It was excellent. Heart-warming and charming with extremely likable lead characters. The story wasn't too heavy - enough to keep things ticking along - though there were plenty of ""Easter Eggs"" and satisfying references to other known HP people & places (Grindelwald, Le Strange, Hogwarts, Dumbledore etc)The Special FX were pretty amazing - most of the Magical Creatures were well realized and convincing. There was plenty of humour throughout, while the music....I am not sure if other have mentioned it....but the movie's soundtrack is just as fantastic as those wonderful beasts!Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining Adventure,"In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the magician Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) comes to New York City. While listening to the speech of the non-maj Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton) telling that witches and wizards are dangerous, he lets a Niffler escape from his magical suitcase. Newt tries to capture the creature in a bank, but he stumbles upon the non-maj Jacob Kowalski (Dan Folger), who is a cannery worker unsuccessfully trying to raise a loan to buy a bakery. Newt captures the Niffler but he accidentally swaps his suitcase with Jacob. The former Auror Tina Golstein (Katherine Waterson) arrests Newt since he has not registered as a wizard in New York and brings him to the MACUSA. However, when she opens his suitcase, she finds only donuts and baked goods. Newt is released but his creatures flee from his suitcase at Jacob's apartment. When Newt and Tina find Jacob, Newt wants to obliviate his memory but Tina decides to bring him to her apartment since he is wounded and confused. She introduces her sister Queenie (Alison Sudof) to Newt and Jacob, and Queenie and Jacob feel immediately attracted by each other. During the night, Newt brings Jacob with him through the magical suitcase to help him to search for the creatures that are missing. However Tina takes the suitcase to the MACUSA and they are arrested since she believes one of Newt's creature is the responsible for killing a senator. However the wizard Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) accuses Newt of conspiracy with the notorious wizard Gellert Grindelwald and Newt and Tina are sentenced to death. What will happen to them?""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is an entertaining adventure with a flawed story. For example, why Newt needs to travel by ship if he may move using his magic? The cast is excellent, highlighting the cameo of Johnny Depp. The CGI is top-notch and despite the running time, the viewer does not feel bored.

"Just Fantastic, so magical, so much fun, so much heart!","Just absolutely brilliant!! This new story first of all is funny. There is so much humour in this movie, a thing the potter movies always failed to have, despite the books have lot of it. So in Fantastic Beasts you can really feel J.K.Rowlings style. And despite it being a prequel, it is incredibly creative, with so much imagination and good ideas. The characters are just so funny and well thought through.It is in many ways a return to old times. To cast a spell you have to say it again and the music is just a wonderful fantasy-soundtrack. Still in the end you can feel the darkness to come... All in all just perfect for anyone who likes fantasy and Harry Potter. And also just greatly done in all technical ways.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic CGI and where to find it...,"OK, let me try to sum this up.First of all I'd like to point out that this is not necessarily a bad movie, it will keep you entertained. You got a decent plot (yet fairly predictive), you got humor, and you got somewhat interesting characters.HOWEVER, what you got most of is CGI, CGI and... CGI. I grew up with the Harry Potter movies and every time a new one came out I was always excited to see what new cool stuff they might of added with the latest technology.These days you can animate almost anything and therefor some of that magic (no pun intended) you had before is now lost. I simply do not get impressed by the ""fanastic beasts"", I only see a blob of CGI that I can't relate to, they do not feel like a part of the real world, and there is just so many of them that after a while they end up giving me a headache.During one part of the movie I ended up wondering if I'm not in fact watching The Avengers or X-Men. There's also one scene that reminded me very much of a particular scene from Star Wars, (You'll get it).Do I recommend this movie? Well if you don't mind the things I just mentioned, you might like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I hate Harry Potter!,"Honest, unbiased review by a Harry Potter hater!I'll keep this short. No one needs a massive essay to read.I begrudgingly went to watch this movie at the behest of my other half as she's a massive fan of all things Harry Potter. Where as I can't stand any of it.Well, how I was surprised!Fantastic Beasts and where to find them is by far the best movies I've seen this year. In fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen!It's one of those movies that has something for everybody. Captivating story line, excellent castings with exceptional performances. I could go on forever... Go and watch it right now! Now, dammit!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

No story & too much CGI,"I have to say that I am really disappointed of the movie as a whole. The Harry Potter movies are easily one of the best and most rewatchable movie franchises so far. And this movie is sadly nothing like the original HP movies. The only thing that is has in common are the special effects (for the apparitions). There was no real dialogue between the characters. Just silly one-liners and the occasional humorous remark. I am also very angered by the fact that they just introduced a new concept (obscurials) to the HP franchise that would literally change everything (if obscurials exist why hasn't Harry Potter become one? After all he fits the criteria).There was also way too much CGI in the movie. It became a real nuisance after a while. Especially because it wasn't even ""up to today's standards"".My final critique concerns the overall flair of the movie. It just didn't feel like it belongs to the magnum opus that is the HP movie franchise. And righteously so; why did they film it in NYC? The HP franchise is the most British thing since James Bond and Doctor Who. I never really realized it before but now that I watched this movie it became very clear to me. You can't just change the location like this and expect the audience to embrace it. Sorry. What's next? Fantastic Beasts in Japan? No thanks. We already have that, it's called Kaiju.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A non-wizarding fan goes out on a limb...what cr*p!,"OK, so I can bit a grump where fantasy films are concerned.Not that I don't like them, I do. My ideal kind of cinema is one that lifts me up out of my cinema seat in the dull plane of existence I inhabit and, for 90-120 minutes, transports me to another time, place or world.But does it have to lob layer upon layer of encyclopaedic background cr*p at me? Am I supposed to do something with it? Why isn't this experience fun for me?I admit I'm in the minority, but I find these fantasy universe films tiring. 'Fantastic Beasts...' is exceptionally well made, the production design is astonishing and is very well acted by a game cast (Ezra Miller, take a bow), but make it easy for an old man!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a newt wizarding world,"JK Rowling gets sole writing credit for adapting her own story but I reckon she was helped out a lot by Steve Kloves who gets the producer credit here but wrote most of the other Harry Potter films.Newt Scamander is the author of a classic textbook at Hogwarts when Harry Potter started his first year at school. Here we see Newt (Eddie Redmayne) as a young man as he researches Fantastic beasts and has come to America to release a Thunderbird into the wild.It is 1926 New York where things have become chaotic in the wizarding world with a criminal on the loose, the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) fears that their world might be discovered by humans especially as some magical entity is causing destruction in the city just as Newt and his suitcase containing the menagerie of fantastic beasts have landed.Also there is an anti-magic street preacher, Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton) is trying to unveil wizards and witches to a disbelieving audience including sceptical newspaper publisher Henry Shaw (Jon Voight.)The MACUSA have sent security enforcer Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) a mysterious and powerful wizard himself to find out what is causing the chaos in New York and he pressures Mary Lou's adopted son Credence (Ezra Miller) to help him. Newt on the other hand is also being pursued by a security official Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) who wants to get into MACUSA's good books.In this prequel world of Harry Potter we see the fault lines being drawn that would ripple through to Harry Potter's time. This first film expands the wizarding world to America who seem to be more stricter, no contact with muggles here. The story though owes a bit to the Philosopher's Stone especially when it comes to unveiling the real villain.There are several mentions of Hogwarts cruelly called Hogwash in one instance, Dumbledore is also mentioned but it is a film in its own right, there are also some fantastic beasts but I did not think this is a film that will enchant a generation of kids like the Harry Potter books and films. The reason, it is not focused on the children characters and we do not see the world from their eyes but Scamander who tries to be childlike.Redmayne's Scamander was a little too downbeat and bumbling for my liking. Porpentina was just irritating although her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) brought the right level of sexiness and charm and her relationship with Jacob was very believable and tender.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical introduction to the new era wizarding world,"Having grown up with the Harry Potter books, and as someone who found a lot to like with all the films (though admittedly some were better than others), expectations were high for 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. Especially also with such good word of mouth.Those high expectations were met, and more. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' serves as an introduction to the new era of the wizarding world, and not succeeds brilliantly doing that but also works as a magical slice of entertainment in its own. A long film it is, but a vast majority of the time it doesn't feel like it, so engrossing is the world that the film creates.Not all's perfect. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' takes a bit of time to get going, with a slow and overlong introduction that tended to also be confusingly written. Jon Voight is wasted as a character with not much personality or development and with a subplot that practically is forgotten about, both by the viewer and by the film. It is too early to tell how well Grindelwald will fare as a villain, but first impressions weren't that promising with Johnny Depp's performance not really igniting my fire, for somebody who specialises in oddball roles he just seemed too lightweight for such an evil character. This said, the future films I'm sure will turn this around if they keep going forward rather than backward.'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' lives up to its name visually. The look of the film is spellbinding, from the wonderful use of colour, with perfectly contrasting shades of light and dark, to cinematography that is never garish and too simple or murky and convoluted, a standout of the latter being that long shot of Credence and Graves in the alley. The standout is easily for the interiors of the suitcase, our looks of awe matching the characters'. Even better are the special effects for the creatures, all of which are technical marvels. This said they are more than that, they are also creatures with their own distinct identity and purpose, as great as Demiguise, Occamy and Thunderbird the standout is the adorable Niffler who also provides some of the biggest and best laughs.James Newton Howard's music score has the right amount of the haunting, the whimsical, the ethereal and the rousing, always dynamic with the action and what's going on in the film. The script has some grim social-commentary and suspense, which gives the film its darkness, while also bringing some perfectly pitched humour (mostly from Jacob and the Niffler), poignant emotion and sense of wonder, while balancing these different tones in a way that never makes one think ""it's trying to be too many things"" or ""it doesn't know what it wants to be"". The references to details from Harry Potter will make die-hard fans squeal with delight, they certainly gave me a sense of nostalgia. There is a lot going on in the story, but all in a way that is told with charm, exuberant and offbeat wit, enchanting imagination and nail-biting suspense. Loved the little details as well, such as the wand-shining house elfs, the bake-offs, the office-cleaning and the magically translucent umbrellas.David Yates was more than ideal as director, having the firm ground from having directed the last four Harry Potter films. There are no complaints to be had visually and technically, and, other than the slow start, could find little to fault with the way the story was told. The characters are well drawn and their personalities well established, with the only real glaring exception being with Voight's character. Found myself really caring for the heroes and the creatures, and got a real sense of threat from the villains (excepting Grindelwald).Acting was top notch, apart from Depp (and Voight doesn't really have much to work with to make any distinction), with Eddie Redmayne on superbly eccentric and endearingly quirky form. He is ideally matched by an affecting Alison Sudol, a charming Katherine Waterson and a highly amusing and amiable Dan Folger. On villain duty is Colin Farrell playing his dastardly role with smarmy relish and a chilling and heart-breakingly repressed Ezra Miller, though the latter is more ambiguous as a character whereas the former is full-on villainous. Samantha Morton also impresses.On the whole, a magical introduction to the new era wizarding world, and mostly it is fantastic. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Look Kids, Magic is Back!","I have loved and lived Harry Potter for over half my life. I've stood in line for books and attended midnight screenings of many of the movies. As much as I'd like to talk about the books, I will restrain myself and focus only on the movies for now. I vividly remember the day I bought tickets for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in 2001; that was my introduction into the world of purchasing advance tickets, standing in line for hours before a movie, and dressing up as characters, it was a whole new world and I was loving it. I can recall the first time I saw each of the eight movies over the next decade. I was practically giddy before each film and sitting in the theatre watching the Warner Bros logo fade in the sky evoked a sense of excitement that only a fan could understand. So when the incomparable J.K. Rowling announced that a feature film was being made on Newt Scamander, a character you only know about from references made in the Harry Potter series, and she was penning the screenplay herself you can imagine how excited the fans became. Is using the Harry Potter name a ploy to create a new franchise and make billions of dollars? Probably. But do we care? Not really. Give the woman a pen and paper and we'll read her grocery list.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is the name of a textbook written by Newt Scamander that Harry Potter and company read at Hogwarts. A guide on said beasts was also released a few years ago for us nonmagical folk. As such this movie (and whatever is to follow) is a spin off of the Harry Potter series existing in the same universe but taking place many years before we meet young Mr. Potter. J.K. Rowling has written a new story that she plans to expand in the next four movies or so we're told. The movie begins with Newt arriving in New York City with his many fantastic beasts and is on the hunt for a few which have gone missing. Along the way he meets sisters Tina and Queenie, two witches who are well immersed in the New York magic scene and Jacob, a friendly no-mag (the American muggle lol, right?) baker, who unwillingly become a part of his journey. The unlikely team must save the city from loose beasts, angst ridden children, and a dubious ministry worker whose intentions aren't made clear until the final reels. The first half of the movie focuses solely on the beasts. And while I respect a movie living up to its title we could've used some focus on the humans as well. An actual plot is practically nonexistent as we see Newt tame the many beasts. That is not to say that you're bored. The exceptional graphics, unusual creatures, and quirky characters keep you entertained even while you're waiting for something to happen. The second half takes off well with the story moving forward and ends on a literal bang as we're carefully shown the potential this series has. Famous and very popular characters from the Harry Potter series are given a quick mention in passing evoking chuckles from fans but alas, we'll have to wait longer to see them again. You've tested our patience, Ms. Rowling. Kindly deliver what we've been promised. That's a humble request from a fan.The characters and the actors who portray them are extremely effective and endearing. From Eddie Redmayne's Newt Scamander, Katherine Waterson's Tina to the utterly charming Alison Sudol as Queenie and the lovable Jacob, played by Dan Fogler, everyone's at the top of their game. Colin Farrell and Ezra Miller who play Graves and Credence respectively deserve a special mention too. It's refreshing to see a blockbuster that delivers such fine acting along with all the glitter and gloss. The director, David Yates, is a Harry Potter alum having directed the final four films in that series. He's clearly comfortable in this zone and has a genuine fondness for J.K. Rowling's ideas. It seems the writer and director have found a formula that works wonders. I only hope they don't become complacent.This is the first movie in the Harry Potter world that doesn't have a book (not counting the beasts' guide or printed screenplay) to accompany it which causes an interesting dilemma for us fans because for once we don't know what to expect from future installments. And while I thoroughly enjoyed this film I saw the small cracks even through my fan glasses. Nostalgia and a deep desire to return to this magical work shielded me from most of them but I wanted more- I wanted more human interaction, I wanted to know the characters' backgrounds, and I wanted the story to outweigh the shine. There is no shortage of ideas here and I'm excited to see where the team take it. We know the universe but not this particular world. It's a welcome journey, one I'd like to take again. And at this point we've taken the bait. Please don't lead us astray, Ms. Rowlingbecause we'll follow you almost anywhere.https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Drab & Charmless with a Mumbling Protagonist & Lifeless Production,"Borderline Charmless with a Lead Character (Eddie Redmayne) that Mumbles, Withdraws, and is Virtually Lifeless. The Female Lead (Katherine Waterston) is a Good Pairing because Her Character is Lifeless too.Then there's Jon Voight, who is Absent Anything to do with a Sub-Plot that goes Nowhere. Colin Farrell (as a main antagonist) seems Depressed to be there.It doesn't Bode Well when the most Engaging Characters are Secondary, Dan Fogler and Samantha Morton and Their Flirtatious Frolicking Occasionally Lifts the Movie from its Doldrums, as do a few of the Titular Beasts.But the Look of the Movie is Drab Brown and the Film is Drab in other ways. There is Very Little Energy when a Beast isn't On Screen and the Production seems Static and Stiff.The CGI is Generic and the ""X-Men Mutant vs Human"" Story is a Lazy Recycling. In the End the Main Antagonist is a Reveal that is Not-Surprising and is Rendered as a Whirling Spiral of a Dark Liquid Mist (talk about a let-down).It's an OK Time-Waster but Overall it's such a Waste of Budget, Writing Talent, and when Imagination is Lacking in a Film that IS Imagination, it becomes a Missed Opportunity at Best and at Worst, a Disappointing Development in a Franchise that Deserves Better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Be ready to take a ride to another Roller-coaster into the Magical world,"All of those who have grown up watching Harry Potter and thinking this might not be up to their expectations, my advice to them is, give it a chance and you're never gonna regret it. If Queen Jo can create a truly magnificent magical world before, why are you putting her abilities to enhance the magic beyond limits to doubt??? This is her first, as a screenwriter and it is splendid and she has bound her audience in the magical world, they had already quit trying to escape. Eddie as an actor has proved AGAIN that he has got what it takes to bring the character to LIFE. Newt IS Eddie. It's refreshing to see new faces in the same scenario that we grew up with. Of course, you'd miss Harry Potter, but this is something worth watching. And even I am a Potterhead, I am happy that they are thinking of making four more. Enjoy... :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Tips and thoughts about this movie.,"Tips1: It is not a harry potter movie. Yes it takes place in the same universe but both the characters, the tone, the magic and the structure is completely different. So don't think that you gonna see a Harry Potter movie if so you gonna be disappointed.2: don't expect a strong story with a clear goal. This movie is more like. One thing happened their and one thing happened then. The only plot this movie have is what you already have read.3: This movie have some slow parts. But i can sure you you can always expecting you that things will happened again.ThoughtsI think it was a movie a bit better than i thought(though I did'nt have high expectation about it). It has great characters and a CGI that is mostly good. Mos of the time it feels like magic that happens and not CGI and the beasts felt real. It had some really clever references to the Harry Potter universe and no one of them makes the original story less good. It had great characters and a very original screenplay. But the screenplay is also what i dislike most in the movie. I like to see movie as one combined story that all makes sense together which is something this movie does'nt have. It also have some really stupid parts like some of the jokes.Overall I would say this movie is as good as the other Harry Potter movies. Some I like better some I like less. The 8 i give this movie is a really weak 8.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fantastic, lives up to its name!","This is another movie I've been champing at the bit to see and have high expectations. So, let's just get something out of the way from the get. Although, this is another J.K. Rowling creation directed by David Yates, Beasts is NOT Harry Potter. It's the wizarding world created by Rowling, but events take place in 1926 America. New country, new characters, new stories. That being saidFor me, the movie started a little slow, only because I've been all over Pottermore devouring all the new info/material Rowling has released (while avoiding the actual book) with the run up to the film. As such, I was just impatient to get to the meat of the story without preamble. Not that the preamble itself is nicely done and quite enjoyable as far as origin stories go. Being a period piece, the creators have gone all out with ornate set design, costuming, and props all which suck you into the story that unfolds and adds to the magic and wonder.The cinematography, lighting, editing, musical score, and visual effects are first rate and serve to create a world that feels real enough to actually step into. No small feat given the use of CGI in today's film. In particular the world where Newt's fantastical beasts resides is absolutely stunning and deserving of its own movie. I could easily get loss in exploring every nook and cranny.Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander is a joy to watch. No surprise given his recent turns in movies from Les Miserables to The Danish Girl. Quite the chameleon actor. Redmayne uses everything at his disposal: body language, awkwardness, and mannerism to create a charming, interesting, and endearing three dimensional character. I can't wait to learn more about/see him in future franchise films.Dan Fogler is pure gold as Jacob Kowalski. A ""no-maj"" in the wrong place at the wrong (or is it right time?) that finds magic is real and is taken for the ride of his life far beyond anything he can conjure in his imagination. Fogler is perfectly cast. Extremely likable, funny, open, and amazed at the magical world unfolding around him, makes for the ideal surrogate for the audience.The story itself is deceptively straight forward on the surface (magical creatures get lose in New York and need to be captured before the non-wizarding world discovers magic is real), but like other/best epic films such as Harry Potter or Star Was is merely the seed for a more encompassing, far reaching, adult tale that will fire the imagination and entertain for years to come.Wands at the ready and head to the theater. This one is a solid 9 and needs to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One hundred and eighty thousand dollar vanity project,"The J.K. Rowling backlash starts right here, but it should have started a long time ago. J.K. Rowling is a wonderful story teller, absolutely. . But... How do you measure excellence in the arts? Well, there's the rub, because there is no quantitative measure, it's all generally subjective, so basically within science 2+2 make 4, and Mt Everest is just over 8,000 metres high, but really the only number we can put on a Jackson Pollack painting is how much somebody will pay for it, the only number we can put on a film is how many people go to see it. Without doubt zeitgeist, the emotions of one's contemporaries effects perceptions - why the hell do you think they put laugh tracks on TV programs?, what is advertising? What I am saying is we all 'go with the flow' Some perhaps more than others, but generally we just can't help smiling back if someone smiles at us. To capture the public's imagination I would suggest that, in general, it really helps if an artist has some talent to start with. There are many artists with some, if not immense talent. For recognition beyond one's own village however, the most important ingredient (with exceptions) is luck. Luck may manifest itself in many ways, but often it might be being in the right place at the right time. Elvis Presley was good, but really, if it hadn't been him it would have been some other young white kid with a twinkle in his eye who could sing black. It certainly wouldn't have been a black kid. Elvis presented a persona who was not at all dangerous yet people could pretend he was. Far from threatening white America he stole swathes of alt culture and assimilated it for the benefit of the ruling group. But I'd bet my bottom dollar he wasn't even the best singer in Tupelo. So back to J.K. Rowling. Quarter of a century ago she wrote The Philosopher's Stone. It was a great read. It was funny, imaginative, eminently 'readable', sufficiently complex to delight without being to obtuse to alienate, It had a character for everybody, It could be picked up and put down easily, would fit in a reasonable pocket, the goodies and baddies had recognisable demarcation, yet leaving just enough ambiguity in some, and it to the standard tried and tested trope of David and Goliath and ran with it quite exquisitely. Over her first three books Harry Potter became a global phenomenon, Elvis had competition, Rowling, was the kids, if not total literature market, and you know what? Good for her, 'cos those three books kept up the pace. The Prisoner of Azkaban nailed it. Now I delve into hypothesis. By the time of her fourth book Rowling was the absolute golden egg. She could do what she wanted. And I suggest what she wanted was greater editorial control, i.e. more of her writing left in, and, whereas the first three books would have had considerable editorial input, from professionals with vast experience in pruning work to present a more marketable product, by the time we get to Goblet of Fire, J.K Rowling, in addition to her undoubted talent had two more things going for her, the absolute undivided devotion of millions of fans (sources of revenue) and the consequent level of control over her work. And like any artist she was unlikely to think that her work could be improved by a mere muggle. Consequently the subsequent books became much larger, and, at least for me, a little unwieldy, because hell, she could do what she wanted. I'm not saying they were bad books, I'm saying that there will have been people at Bloomsbury secretly wishing, but NEVER admitting that they could perhaps just miss out a little bit here or fix a bit of continuity there. And then the film series.. And now Fantastic Beasts... It is one of the most expensive 60 films ever made, and it is, in effect a $180,000 dollar vanity project. Oh hell, I know there is a demand for it, and I'm not saying this is Ghostbusters 2016 or anything like that, I quite enjoyed it, but it is merely a moderate story populated by a cast that as individuals are sometimes interesting but more often padding for those that are. Newt Scamander is frankly boring, and the whole lingo/naming thing just seems a little trite. Granted the special effects are truly special, but give me Colin Farrell sitting on a Belgian bench with Brendan Gleeson any day over him watching some ball of smoke trashing entire avenues of New York. Fundamentally, in Harry Potter, we had personalities driving the stories. In this it is .. magic! That is not meant to be a compliment, it is a moan that the whole shebang seems like """"I know, let's put something here that is .. magic!, just wave a wand and .. say """"smoothinox fluffy flora"""" .. and pow .. oh golly .. wide eyed wonderment .. cute critter ... yawn."" Guess you've got to go and watch it, but if you know J.K. Rowling stop sucking up to her so much. She's great, but so are lots of people around her.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brilliant return to the world of wizardry,"Fantastic beasts and where to find them was great, it brings audiences back to the wizarding world of Harry Potter. We are introduced to this band of 'misfits' who end up having great synergy, this film has all of our favourite elements of Harry Potter without being the exact same thing. From the underdog/outsider characters that we all gravitate to, to the wonders of magic most notably presented through the character of Kowalski.Yes, Dan Fogler's Kowalski was surprisingly very good, not only was he the film's comedic relief and the sort of device used to explain magic to the audiences he was also great in the more serious and emotional roles. To the extent that towards the end of the film I really did feel for him and has grown very attached to the character, something that I have not expected when first introduced to him. Eddie Redmayne's performance was not groundbreaking here but he does a good job playing the 'outsider' role in the movie, the guy who no one seems to understand or cares to listen to which makes his friendship with Jacob Kowalski all the more precious.Another great delivery was from Colin Farrell as Graves, he isn't in this film much but whenever he is in a scene he definitely steals the spotlight, funnily enough a lot of times from the American minister of magic, Seraphina Picquery played by Carmen Ejogo. Quite a shame though because I did want to see this character shine and be of impact, but I guess as always the minister characters always seems useless in the world of wizardry.This film is written by JK Rowling herself which from my understanding is quite impressive as writing in different forms of media is not usually a successful transition. The writing in this film was really good, so kudos to Rowling for making a successful transition.Finally onto the beasts, I have heard criticisms on how the fantastic beasts seemed to be sidelined by the main story about the threat of the American wizarding world being revealed. However I would really disagree with that, I very much felt that the beasts and Newt Scamander was the main focus of the story while there was the underlying second arc on the revealings of the wizarding community and Geret Grindelwald. Now, I understand that Grindelwald would potentially be a large part of the upcoming films but in the case of this film that arc is definitely not the main arc but was instead introduced. The beasts definitely stole the show on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
After all this time?,"I have been counting days for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them since the moment it was announced. I was so anxious when the plot they revealed was just about Newt losing his creatures and capturing them again, as it sounded too shallow. After the first few trailers, we saw that there was a bigger picture and I began getting high hopes.I cannot say I was disappointed. After the film, I sat and stared at the wall for hours, not saying anything but just thinking about the film. The major new element that J.K. has added to her world had hit me so hard, yet after thinking about the film as a whole, and how shocking the revelations such as ""Horcruxes"" and ""wand owner issues"" were at the beginning and how they turned out to be, I started becoming satisfied. It was breathtaking and connecting the phenomenon with an important character we already know and will take place in the pentalogy *no spoilers* enlightened me.Apart from the greater plot, the beasts were FANTASTIC. I could not believe how every single one of them made me want one of them, as some were not even supposed to be cute but were. I was so satisfied with how much they added to the descriptions in the book, in terms of both looks and attributes.I disagree with everyone who thought the characters were paper-thin. They made me associate with them (e.g., Newt's introvert personality, Tina's struggles, Jacob's dreams) and I liked all more than I thought I would.The CGI was quite nice, except for Frank the Thunderbird and Gnarlak the Goblin, as I saw it in IMAX 3D. Because it was already revealed, I feel free to say that Johnny Depp was actually worse than I expected, as it looked like Grindelwald was Johnny Depp and unfortunately not the other way round.Being a Potterhead as far as it goes, I terribly enjoyed the film without watching it as a hardcore fan but as a critic. Don't hesitate to make inappropriate sounds in the middle of the theatre when the Warner Bros. logo appears (not me or anything, just what a friend of mine did...), for THE MAGIC CLEARLY NEVER ENDS.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Without question, of course Warner Bros. were eventually going to want to adapt that story for the big screen. Redmayne's lovely performance sets up the emotional core of the franchise.

The best movie of the Harry Potter world.,"In a very good way, this movie reminded me of a long episode of Dr. Who. Much better than I expected. And Eddie Redmayne would make a great Doctor, by the way. This movie had a lot of heart, both in the story of the budding friendship between Newt and Jacob, and in Jacob's story with his love interest. The resolutions of both of these stories strike all the right chords. And all the rest is indeed plenty magical and fun, with magical creatures and plenty of action. I came into the movie prepared to suffer though it, as my kid wanted to watch it. I was quite pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twizard Rating: 93,"A lot has changed since the first Harry Potter film was released in 2001. Heck, a lot has changed since the LAST Harry Potter film was released in 2011. The franchise helped change our modern interpretation of what a film series can be. And this prequel spin-off is proof of that. While this isn't a Harry Potter movie, it's part of the same world.In the 15 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, blockbuster films have become consistently good. Critically acclaimed. It's not just popcorn entertainment anymore--we have higher expectations. And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.The Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does not. It's much slower like the later films in the previous series. Yet, the difference is, this is the setup to the next four films. By the time we got to the last few Harry Potter movies, we weren't exactly looking for a brisk narrative. And I was hoping for this in Fantastic Beasts--albeit, probably unrealistically.Set in 1926, an English wizard, Newt (Eddie Redmayne), comes to America for McGuffin-like reasons (and unclear, at that). He gets into some trouble as some of the fantastic beasts escape from the suitcase where he's keeping them. As this is happening, he gets mixed in with a normal non-magical human, Jacob (Dan Fogler).Other assorted things happen that are appealing to the audience. We get to go inside this magical suitcase and see dozens of unique creatures in this new expanded universe. It's really cool and aesthetically pleasing.The movie is long and not enough happens to truly justify it. Instead of using the time to thoroughly explain some of the overarching story lines, the filmmakers spend it drawing things out. Perhaps because they feel like they have to.Don't get me wrong, the film is great. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It does most of the things a good film should do. While the storytelling isn't quick, it's still very even.This is what director David Yates is good at, as evident in the last four Harry Potter films he directed. Though Fantastic Beasts is missing the magical world that is Hogwarts, Yates knows how to bring alive New York City in the '20s and make it feel magical.You will most likely enjoy Fantastic Beasts. If for no other reason than the fact that it's the ingress back into the beloved world of Harry Potter.And Easter eggs are scattered all around. Just don't go into it with the same expectations as its predecessors.Twizard Rating: 93",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"More of the Same, but Different.","It has been five years since the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows part 2 and if I am being honest I did not really like the last 3-4 Harry Potter movies, despite being a huge fan of the books and earlier movies. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is the first spin off movie in the Harry Potter universe and with that comes some pretty big expectations. The fan base is anxiously awaiting more stories from the magical mind of J.K. Rowling and with her taking sole writing credit on this movie, we really get a good look at what this world will look like in future movies.Lets start with the plot. Any true Potter fan knows that in the original series ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is what the students at Hogwarts use to study magical creatures. With this in mind I expected to learn about the writing of the book and traveling across the globe finding...well fantastic beasts. The movie takes another direction and chronicles Newt Scamander's trip to New York and while there he gets wrapped up in a sort of magical mystery he must help solve. While not what I expected I am not necessarily disappointed with the plot, but in a movie titled ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" I expected a bit more about the creatures that we eventually got.The cast of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is deep and extremely solid. Led by Eddie Redmayne, who seems to be playing a character with very much the same demeanor as his own really plays the star well and provides a great hero. Katherine Waterston takes what I believe is her first big step into the public eye. She is great here and I think is poised for big things. Colin Farrel is serviceable in his mysterious role, but I wish he could have used his real accent. Rounded out by Dan Fogler, Samantha Morton and John Voight the world gets filled out with some strong characters from both the magical world and the real world.One of my biggest concerns coming into this movie was the tone and the relationship to the series that came before it. It is a hard line to play, you don't want this movie to be too much like its predecessor, but you still want people to feel that they exist in the same world. Fantastic Beasts gives you a little bit of both of these options. It is certainly its own movie, and other than maybe having a better understanding of the world and getting a few extra Easter eggs, does not require viewing the previous series. That being said I wish there were a few more hints to flesh out the world. It would not make sense to mention Harry or really almost anyone involved in his story because Fantastic Beasts takes place 70 years prior to those events but I felt it would have been nice to see a few more friendly sights.Fantastic Beasts had to be more of the same, but different. As I have said before this is a difficult task, but I believe this movie has for the most part succeeded. Much like last years Star Wars The Force Awakens, I was not really blown away by the variety of new creatures. They were there and I will give credit to both movies for tacking such a difficult task but both failed to create the same wonder as their predecessors. That does not mean that these were not good movies. Both I think are solid continuations of beloved franchises and both give me a good feeling about the future to come. I would say most Potter fans will enjoy this movie, and it brings enough new things to the table to keep the series from feeling stale. I am excited to see where this magical series takes us next.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth Seeing if you're a Potter fan,"The story was good, but hard to follow at times. The effects were decent, other than the CGI goblins, house elves, etc. They just looked out of place. The main issue I have with the movie is the acting. There was a lot of awkward staring, and the interactions between characters were extremely cringy. Eddie Redmayne was great, but the ex-auror girl, her sister, and the muggle were painful to watch. You would think that with a franchise this popular, they would at least try to get better actors for the main and supporting roles.Other than that, I enjoyed the film. There were plenty of references that Potter fans will pick up on, and it does a pretty good job of setting up for the next four movies in the series. Definitely can't wait to see the next one.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A visually stunning and magical movie...just Fantastic!,"This movie is absolutely beautiful from start to finish. If you can see it in 3D I highly recommend you do. It enhanced the already beautiful and magical quality of the movie. The story was interesting and had both light and dark elements to it which made for a highly engaging and emotional movie experience. Eddie Redmayne as Newt was entertaining, intriguing, and mysterious and quite honestly just perfect for this role. All supporting cast members I felt were wonderful in their roles as well and the chemistry between them was great. The ""beasts"" were all beautifully done and magical to watch. I will definitely be going to see this again!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really Forgettable,"It wasnt what I hoped, it does feel that it occurs on the Wizarding world of HP but the story kinda doesnt leed to anything, there is only a climax in the movie because of coincidences. And the main plot with the main character has nothing to do with anything, he is just doing his stuff while everyone else is kinda helping him but also worried about their own problems. It was a little entertaining, but after you finish watching it you will probably forget everything about the movie in a week.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Excellent,"Just got home from seeing ""Magical Beasts and where to find them"". After a rough start ( the projector windows platform crashed and they Restarted from beginning).

I will definitely buy this one when it comes out on DVDS or Blu ray. Thumbs up for a unique view on American views of magic. I would like to see more of this type of entertainment.

Truly Magical,"I am so pleased the world of J.K Rowling has come back to are screens. I can't fault this movie. The visual effects was extraordinary. the story line and the music behind the film was fantastic, just like the title. It feels like coming home watching this movie. I seen it in the IMAX 3D. it was truly wonderful and warming. though its not harry potter and its starting all over again getting to know these new characters, it's been great. we will always have a piece in are heart for harry potter that we can enjoy watching over and over again. but i am sure this won't be a one off movie. they surly will make more of fantastic beasts. i am looking forward to see whats going to happen next. go watch this movie if your a harry potter fan you are going to love it",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Remarkably lacklustre,"Remarkably lacklustre for a film involving magical creatures.'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' underwhelmed me, in short. At no moment across the 130 or so minute run time was I ever invested or drawn into the story or the characters. I didn't feel any good performances from the cast either. Dan Fogler sticks out in my memory most, though the rest are forgettable.The special effects are also not to the level I was expecting; that's not to say that they are bad and I'm not certain what I was indeed anticipating from them, but I just found 'em to be meh - nothing blew me away. Which is a vibe that I got from the whole film unfortunately.Hopefully 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' does more for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Rowling masterpiece,"Fantastic beasts and where to find them is a true Rowling story. It reminds you of the first two Harry Potter films ie it gives priority to the story. For example, simple things like the wands in this movie made me beam with joy because they looked exactly as they were supposed to - a normal piece of wood that holds immense power.From the beginning of the film (when the newspaper montage is shown) one can see Rowling's flair and style of writing. The film is a mixture of dark scenes and vibrant bright scenes which (like her books) has the effect of the ever lasting battle between good and evil.The story covers it all - romance, mystery, plot twists and turns and a brilliant climax. As always, JKR uses her eye for detail and leaves nothing to imagination. As the story begins, the audience starts having questions and as the story progresses, all those questions are indeed answered.The only negative here perhaps is that if you haven't read the books (and especially if this is your first Harry Potter experience), you probably won't appreciate it as much as a seasoned Potterhead would as there are a lot of references (that arnt explained in detail - they don't have to be if you have read the books) from the Harry Potter series. For a seasoned Potterhead however, these references, some subtle - like the Hallows' necklace; some not - like Leta Lestrange; make the movie all the more enjoyable.Finally, Jonny Depp is Gilderwald to the T. The few minutes he is on screen makes your skin crawl in a magnificent way as you want to face him but somehow do not.Bottom line - I loved it. Can't wait for the next part. Cannot believe it isn't a book. And simply cannot stop obsessing.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It just drags on and on,I enjoyed this film tho my Main concerns are 1. It's pointless there's no need for this film it's just a cash cow of the Harry Potter franchise and 2 it's so long they could of cut 30 min of the film. Saying all that the film is still good it's not great or amazing but it's enjoyable enough for Harry Potter fans.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Do you like going to the zoo? That is the question ...,"Although I was a fan of the Harry Potter series, I had no preconceived notions or requirements for this stand-alone movie, other than an expectation that J.K. Rowling would not disappoint.Nonetheless, I was disappointed. The first half of the movie is basically an overlong visit to a CGI-created zoo. We watch as the protagonist hunts down a half dozen or so ""fantastic beasts"", mostly one at a time and in extended chase sequences. If you do not enjoy visiting zoos or watching car chases (which have the same dynamic as animal chases, no matter how exotic the species), you may be bored. I certainly was.The second half of the movie is more engaging, as loose strands from the first are finally woven into a conventional good vs. evil morality play. But even here, virtually every turn in the plot is easily predictable, as Rowling uses the same pro- Muggle/anti-Muggle dynamic employed in the Potter series to define her characters, plus an ironically preachy lesson in the harmful nature of organised religion. Fortunately, the actors, particularly the good guys and gals, are able to overcome the limitations of the script so that I couldn't help but like them and cheer them on. The cinematic recreation of early 20th century New York is also well done.However, on the whole, I think Rowling is capable of better work than this. For movie-goers content to be dazzled by special effects, this film may do the trick. For those who want more than a formulaic ""Hagrid saves the world"" knock-off, the film will probably seem much longer than its two hour running time.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's charming and fantastic but no Potter.,"""You're an interesting man, Mr. Scamander. Just like your suitcase, I think there's more to you than meets the eye. Kicked out of Hogwarts for endangering human life with a beast, yet one of your teachers argued strongly against your expulsion. I wonder... what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you, Mr. Scamander?"" Percival Graves (Colin Farrell)Graves' (The chief of security for the wizard world) comment in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them suggests the homoerotic subtext of Harry Potter and sums up the fantastic elements of this Harry Potter prequel (70 years): Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), magizoologist and shy scientist, carries a suitcase of strange animals that also serves as a portal escape hatch.His job is to protect these little ones as he says from ""the most vicious creatures on the planet, humans."" In 1926 prohibition NYC, he searches for lost beasties and new species and encounters the covert magician population and various human beasts as well. His brown luggage bag is filled with these little creatures, including an adorable green twig, Bowtruckle. Yet, the most lovable, Niffler (a mole with a duck's bill), has escaped on search for shiny objects to fill his kangaroo-like pouch.Let's settle this for me right now: veteran Potter director David Yates' Fantastic Beasts is no Harry Potter—it lacks the depth of characterization and the intricacy of the Hogwarts world. It still, however, has the zany fun with exotic wizards and varied No-Majs (American Muggles) like the sweet, bungling baker, Jacob (Dan Fogler), who bring us back to J.K. Rowling's Potter-like world.Actually, I find eccentric and crazy characters boring after a while; I nodded off a slight bit, especially when Eddie Redmayne's British accent is garbled or when just too many lightning wands, explosions, and strange animals overpower the narrative. Redmayne's Newt is also too cute with his patented bashfulness, stammer, head held down, and hardly talking.I am not sure young kids will be able to keep up with the plot, so have them read the titular text book beforehand so they don't fall asleep. ""I don't think I'm dreaming and I ain't got the brains to make this up,"" says Jacob. Keep your brains awake for this twisty, Potter prequel and you will be rewarded with beaucoup beasts and a few of the human kind.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Good and The Ugly,"Okay... Why lie? I absolutely loved it! But what I loved above everything else was Credence and his story. Dear God, did I love the roll he played. Not to mention Ezra Miller's acting (Sweet baby Jesus he took my breath away!) I loved what J.K. Rowling so boldly offered for us to witness and especially how the story of Credence played out. It was in now way cliché and honestly had you holding your breath and always second guessing yourself. I can't praise that part of the movie enough. Or the animation! Jesus, the animation was breath taking!But there was only one thing that put a sour taste in my mouth... And that was definitely the development of romantic relationships. I mean I like romance just as much as the next girl, but I didn't think it fit the heavy atmosphere of the movie. I thought it was totally unnecessary. I didn't like it and I thought it made the plot of the movie deteriorate from its original magnificence. There was too much new information to take on, too much plot to catch up to, and too little character development for me to really appreciate it. Ultimately, I felt that by also including a romantic relationship or the implication of one the director was trying to push too much into a two hour and twelve minute long movie.If that part of the movie, and only that could be extracted, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them would have been the movie to end all fantasy movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The interpretation of Eddie Redmayne who played as Newt Scamander was very good and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Dan Fogler's who played as Jacob Kowalski and Katherine Waterston's who played as Tina.

Refreshingly Entertaining with Outstanding Effects!,"Although I don't like David Yates' directing, I think he did his best with this movie. The cinematography isn't perfect, but the colour contrasts are really beautiful to watch. The movie is highly entertaining and I recommend it to everyone (especially to families/adolescents).PROS: -Eddie Redmayne's acting! He is a real cutie in this film. His interaction with his ""fantastic beasts"" are adorable! -Eddie's chemistry with Dan Fogler and Fogler's believable chemistry with Alison Sudol. -Alison Sudol is gorgeous, sweet and pulls off her role without a doubt. -Colin Farrell's scenes. He has the most interesting ones. -The Beasts in general. All scenes, especially the ending are beautifully scripted and filmed. -The score is beautiful and fitting. Pacing and editing are fine. (why did Warner Bros and David Yates screw it in The Legend of Tarzan then???) -Great CGI. Worth to watch in IMAX3D.CONS: -Katherine Waterston's acting... she gives a very disappointing performance in this movie. I know her previous work and her acting isn't that dull actually. Apart from that, she looks extremely plain and black hair makes her look hideous. -Unfortunately less Colin Farrell. - Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. Seriously? How bad was that?! -Very few magic spells are recited. That was very disappointing, as we're watching the world of the wizards, aren't we? -There are many movies which take place in the US, therefore, I think the Harry Potter universe should have stayed in England. I hope the sequels will be filmed in Hogwarts and we will get to see more wizards, teachers and so.Overall the movie is really refreshing, as it has an original screenplay that isn't based on a novel, comic book, etc. The movie also gives a profound message about the desire to be accepted into society, especially when one is different than the majority.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Fine.,"I decided to revisit this film after a couple years. Let me say that the first time I watched it, I didn't like it. Upon the rewatch, I appreciate it more but still wouldn't consider it incredible.The Good:-Jacob Kowalski, Tina, and Percival Graves are standout characters that are compelling and enjoyable.-The ""beasts"" are amazingly creative and imaginative in the best way.-Set and costume design are really good. It was refreshing to see wizarding world characters in a different time period.The Okay:-The CGI is fine but with a franchise like this it could have been utilized better; a few times it feels overused...something that I can't say I ever felt while watching Harry Potter.-The plot is pretty straight forward, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but none of the desired twists land the way I think J.K. Rowling would have hoped considering she produces some really flooring plot twist moments in the original series.-The musical score is fine but not memorable.The Bad:-The pacing is rough in the film. There are some truly great moments but none of them seem to follow one another in succession. The first half of the film feels draggy.-It takes awhile to warm up to Newt as a character which isn't fantastic given that he is the lead. I understand he is supposed to be socially awkward but for the first two thirds of the film he mostly feels bland and you don't really care about him all that much.I think a key question when judging prequels is, although the story is linked to a successful property does it do enough to merit its own existence; can it stand on its own two feet without pandering or fan service moments. I believe Fantastic Beasts is able to be its own thing without elbowing the audience in the ribs about how it is connected to Harry Potter. If this were the very first wizarding world film ever it wouldn't be a knock out of the park but it would be enough to spark questions and spawn a sequel, which I guess means it does its job as an intro film well, albeit imperfectly.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"Hats have to come off here to Eddie Redmayne. I reckon he must have spent virtually all of the filming days staring at a green screen reacting to CGI. That's my problem with this. Though set in a fantasy world, there's nothing remotely authentic about it. Not his ""Newt Scamander"" character, nor the constantly changing scenarios that are busily trying to engage our eyes without bothering with our brains. ""Newt"" arrives from Britain into the USA with a magical suitcase full of creatures that is the target of the dastardly ""Grindelwald"" (a few fleeting appearances from Johnny Depp). When it is stolen and some of the beasties escape, it looks like a bad time to be insuring the properties of New York's Fifth Avenue and with all hell breaking loose, ""Newt"" and his new muggle friend ""Jacob"" (Dan Fogler) to round them all up and thwart a plan that will bring the wizarding world to the brink chaos. There's no denying that the film looks great, with astonishing attention to detail and an impressive imagination behind the design of mystical creatures and their animated visual effects. The thing has no soul, though. Unlike with her earlier ""Potter"" characters, JK Rowling hasn't really created anyone here about whom I really cared. There are some fun critters - the curious platypus and their own mini version of ""Groot"", but Redmayne just seems to be rushing around reacting all the time, without us really getting to know him or much about his mission. Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller and Depp suffer likewise, with little effort put into imbuing them with much persona. Even the magic itself seems sterile and derivative. It's not terrible, it's more a sort of ""so what"" that you just know will spawn loads of predicable sequels and ""Newt"" and ""Grindelwald"" square up for a battle royal.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Fun Film, but only if you're familiar with the Wizarding World","I really did enjoy most of this movie. I loved the four main characters, Newt, Tina, Jakob, and Queenie, and thought the movie probably could've been made around the four of them, but there were two side plots that felt completely out of place. They start the film with newspaper clippings on the disappearance of Gellert Grindelwald as well as stories on the New Salemers. None of this matters to Newt, who only wants to find Fantastic Beasts, as well as deliver one of them to Arizona. That's all well and good, but he gets entangled with the New Salemers, and later the MACUSA, the American Ministry of Magic. If you're unfamiliar with the Wizarding World, then a lot of this, especially the story of Grindelwald, might be confusing. I watched it with my father, who'd never seen the HP series (except the first movie, when it first came out), and he found it to be confusing. I found myself explaining the different spells and words to him, as well as explaining who Grindelwald was because they just never explained it very well. The same goes with the New Salemers. All we know about them is that they're super religious and anti-witch/wizard. The New Salemers felt like a cliché and were just put in for Tina's demotion from Auror to make sense. There was a lot of this that I did like. I really wish they'd spent more time on the actual Fantastic Beasts. The 1920's time period was absolutely delightful, especially with Muggle/No-Mag Jakob experiencing everything for the first time. I don't think the story was completely thought out, and it could've been a lot better. But, still fun for fans of Harry Potter. I really hope they clear up all of the questions in the second film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Absolute Rubbish, no story, no characters, just special effects","It is unbelievable that JK Rowling's name is even attached to this film.The discipline and thought that went into the Harry Potter characters and story certainly wasn't applied to this catastrophe, which, like the Hobbit and so many other Hollywood regurgitation(s), merely seeks massive profits by piggybacking on a successful franchise while being utterly devoid of substance.It isn't even worth going into detail. There is only one truly likable character, though you can't relate to ANY character as we know absolutely nothing about them, nor do they have any developed relationships with each other.The entire script is built around the magical creatures doing damage to NYC, again, a ridiculous premise, as the damage is massive and there is no backlash. The complicated boundaries between the magical and non-magical worlds and people, so well laid out in HP, are completely absent. The most ridiculous example of idiotic, careless detail is that for most of the scenes on the streets of NYC, it is practically a ghost town, whereas in reality, NYC in the 1920s was nearly as densely populated as it is now. Perhaps more so, not worth it to fact check this.And Eddie Redmayne as the lead was totally inaccessible, not engaging and half of his speech literally unintelligible. Fully one third into the movie it is finally established that he, the lead character, is closer to magical creatures than humans, but by then, not only do we not care about him or like him, but really the script gives him not ONE real relationship wherein to show forth his character. Who is he? Where does he come from? We don't know. Anyway, a horrible choice for a lead character, someone who has no emotional connection to any characters. Even his relations to the animals is explored surface level, there is no one relationship with anyone or anything that develops throughout the story and makes the audience care about the character. Only superficial plot-related details are given and there is no emotional or human life at all.This is the same way all the characters, every single one, is treated. They are merely 2 dimensional props, there to perpetuate a plot that is mostly centered around special effects and hubris action, magical creatures rampaging here and there, and, as I said, unrealistically, going on undetected.Literally, not one shining point to this film. Another disgrace to storytelling, devoid of all substance and creativity, pumped out of the Warner Bros fecal-making factory. Utterly disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Went above and beyond even my (high) expectations,"As a die-hard fan of Harry Potter, I can't tell you how exited I was for this movie to come out. For over a year I had a countdown app to keep of how many days were left until the 18th. But, after having read cursed child and being disappointed with how she continued the series, I was cautious about how she would illustrate the past. But Fantastic Beasts did the very opposite of disappoint. It was better than I could have ever dreamed and it's a shame that we now have to wait two years for the next one. Even if I wasn't a fan of Harry Potter I would still love it (though a lot of it would go over my head) Every fan NEEDS to see this movie asap.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun ride, but with some miscalculations.","The movie is very good if you disect it into the scenes themselves, but as a whole the puzzle doesn't offer a very engaging picture. Meaning, effects, dialogue, acting, etc. was absolutely fine, as you expect from a production on this level. And while the plot wasn't a mess, or terrible, or incoherent, it seamed unsure of what it wants to do. A huge chunk of the movie is our protagonist searching for beasts, but there is nothing interesting about it. We as viewers just stumble upon them again and again, everyone knows whats going to happen, but we have to wait a few minutes before the cycle repeats. At the end of the first half it causes the movie to drag, you're unsure what the story is going to be about, since youre 45-60mins in and there seems to be no significant plot. Later the story unravels and I thought to myself ""oh, good. They DO know what their plot is."" But once again we get interrupted by creature hunting and it completely wrecks the tension that JUST started building. I do like the creatures and understand why they wanted to sprinkle them inbetween, so that you don't just get people running around and talking. But the creature part shouldve been cut back, especially because the movie spans 130mins anyways. Little moments of creatures would have been enough, have them there as helping hands or weave them into the plot (as they sometimes did).
If they really wanted to show some longer scenes with creatures, a mini-series would've been a nice vehicel for that and I'm sure the HP-Fans would eat it up happily.
The movie still has enough going for it to be a quite enjoyable movie that the whole family can watch, especially some cute moments, just sad how a little tighter editing could have made it much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yayor J K Rowling,"21 November 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. For those of you who are missing the adventures of Harry Potter and his wizarding world, Fantastic Beasts plugs that gap with alacrity. With a cast headed by the supremely talented Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander, this film immerses us once more into a place where the world of wizard and No-Maj (American for Muggle) collide. We are again treated to an insight of the machinations of J K Rowling's brain, and I for one am always happy that she shares it with our world. You absolutely do not have to watch any of the Harry Potter films to understand any of the references to Muggles, Hogwarts and the like, this film is story on its own and we are introduced to a whole new collection of characters.......and magical beasts, some of which are cute and some downright weird. Excellent visual effects, and a screenplay which includes more than a few lighthearted moments. Another smash from the wizarding world and I eagerly await the next instalment.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It ultimately tries too hard at being another Harry Potter,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) - (M)
Tony Saad - Saturday, 19 January, 2019(STAR), (STAR), (1/2 STAR)Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them aimed to capitalise on the enduring popularity of the Harry Potter series, being the first feature spin-off film of the famous stories. Directed by David Yates, who directed the last four Harry Potter feature films, collaborated with J.K. Rowling -the author of the books, in her screenwriting debut- to create a product stuffed with clever CGI tricks and lots of allusions to the original series. While it does try to live up to its original series, it still leaves quite a lot to be desired. Still, it is not a terrible movie, in fact; I enjoyed it very much, but it sadly does not introduce anything new or memorable to the franchise, and is littered with all sorts of plot-holes.The film is set in 1926, some 60 years before Harry Potter rose. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), is a British wizard, who arrives in New York with his magical suitcase filled with... well, Fantastic Beasts! However, he bumps into Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) a no-maj (or muggle in the states), who mixes up his suitcase for Newt's, and some of the beasts escape. They both end up in the company of Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), a former Auror and grounded witch for the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), and her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol, in her feature film debut). The race is on to find the beasts before they cause any trouble, while keeping the wizarding world away from the prying eyes of our world in the 20s. Yes, in 1920s New York, wizards and witches were persecuted by no-majs and lived in hiding from them.Now, this should make for a thrilling epic magical adventure, but when the whole story revolves around some beasts escaping from a suitcase, you know you're off to a weak start. To up the ante and increase the already low stakes, Rowling and Yates also included a subplot; a destructive phenomenon known as a Obscurus is on the loose, and Grindlewald (Johnny Depp), a notorious criminal, is a suspect.Personally, I do not see how this 'subplot' in anyway relates to finding Newt's beasts, as it never disturbs the flow of the main plot. What was Grindlewald's relationship with the Obscurus? What exactly was he trying to achieve? Was there something I must've overlooked -if there was, then I should know-? Or did Grindlewald like causing trouble for a hobby? He absolutely plays no real role in undermining Newt and his companions on their search for the beasts. And even then, why would Grindlewald even infiltrate MACUSA? Nobody knows. I don't know. J.K. Rowling doesn't know. Hey! Not even the man himself knows. It really was just a waste of Depp's unique talents.And that's why I liked lord Voldemort more than Grindlewald. His intentions are clear, and he plays a direct role in Harry's adventures, yet remaining in the shadows in the first half of the series, only slowly revealing himself in the fourth instalment.The award for the least necessary character in the film goes to (Drumroll please) ... Credence (Ezra Miller)! Yes. Credence is this abused and over-emotional kid who (Spoiler alert) ends up being the Obscurial that was terrorising New York. By the way, I do not mean harm to the actor; he did try hard. Still, like Grindlewald, Credence plays almost no role in Newt's search for his beasts, and somehow has got this strange link to the main antagonist that is too ambiguous for me to understand.But the characters in Fantastic Beasts are not all terrible, and some are even enjoyable. Dan Fogler's role as Jabob Kowalski was a good comic relief in the film. That said, I think if Kowalski did not bump into Newt, then he would've been of no use. But what Kowalski lacks in purpose, he makes up with his warm and entertaining personality and ability to engage with the audience even in tough situations.No film made in the last 20 years would be complete without some sort of romance. Enter Queenie, Tina's big-hearted legilimens sister who becomes attracted to Kowalski. Alison Sudol is a charming actress, and took off to a very good start in the feature film industry. Unfortunately, Queenie is just there for show, and that's a great shame. She had a lot of potential that could've been fulfilled in the film, but it never ends up being that way. When she senses that Tina and Newt are in mortal danger, she and Kowalski go searching for them. Except, Newt had a 'Pickett', a sort of mythical cricket that came out of the wizard's pockets to pick his cuffs and allow him to save Tina and himself, making Queenie and Kowalski panic for nothing.Speaking of Newt and Tina, they are both very compelling characters, but I found Tina to be a little bit dry early on the film. This is the first time I see Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterston respectively on screen, and they have both impressed me. They may not be as memorable as Harry, Ron and Hermione, but their collected and complex personalities make them more exciting than most of the other characters.The point was; there were too many characters and plot-holes for Fantastic Beasts to make sense. It is trying to be the new Harry Potter, going as far as to include the famous character's jingle at the very start. But what this film lacks in stakes, it makes up in sheer dazzling magic.Fantastic Beasts is a visually satisfying film which manages to closely emulate the magic duels of the original Harry Potter series. Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (Sherlock Holmes, 2009) presented the most tense and action-packed moments beautifully, almost reminding me of some scenes from Sherlock Holmes, which he filmed. His techniques are backed up through use of CGI that's so effective I was -I must admit- fooled into believing the beasts were actually real. Even then, projection alone does not make a film. If the story department had worked more closely with Rousselot, it would've been possible that the projection would be even more impressive.The highlight of the entire feature is the brilliant costuming. Really, I was mesmerised by Newt's suit, as it helped reiterate the character's veteran personality searching for, and rescuing beasts around the world. I must admit that New York, along with every other location including Newt's amazing suitcase, look so real to me. Seriously, everything was well built and placed, and looked as though we were really living in 1926. The Model Ts, the small shops, the metro in New York etc. all appear like they're taken from their original locations and used on set. I can say that Fantastic Beasts looks and feels so much more aesthetically pleasing than the original Harry Potter series.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them tries to imitate its original, by adding fantastic wizard fights and focussing on the aesthetics. But it ultimately tries too hard at being another Harry Potter. The characters lack the complexity of their original counterparts. I think Rowling and Yates were focusing more on making sure here were hidden information for the next few instalments than actually making a product that clearly had something to say. But the film does excel in showcasing the artistic creativities of the decoration and costumes department, and has made the original Harry Potter series a bit of justice to be fair.© Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Film Review, 2019.

This Film is Magic,"Spellbinding, enticing, in a word: Fantastic. Everyone remembers the first time they read/ saw Harry Potter. The first time you went to Hogwarts and were completely transported into an amazing new world. We all wish we could enter the world for the first time again, and with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, JK Rowling has given us what we wanted. An entry into a completely unexplored era of magic with all of it's twists and turns and beauty and disaster. I must commend JK Rowling on her screen writing debut. Falls nothing short of what you would expect from a Potter book. An intricately woven plot with many interesting characters all fighting their own battles, all while introducing us to a whole new world. First, let me praise the brilliant Eddie Redmayne. His character, Newt Scamander, is an outsider. He never felt quite at home with people, but when we see him with his beasts, that's what passion is. We as an audience can see and feel for his intimate relationship, fascination, and respect for these creatures. One subtle thing Eddie did was when talking to people, especially in serious scenes, he didn't make a lot of eye contact. He would look up for a second, then look back down to their shoulder. A perfect and realistic quirk that many people can relate to. The rest of the quartet are also magnificent in portraying their characters. All the technical teams that worked on this deserve a huge round of applause. Costumes from the 1920s that are intriguing and somehow magical, sets that immerse us in a different time, the props department, with their determination to perfect every detail certainly paid off, the animation, making book covers and newspapers come to life even when they are not the main focus, reminding us we are in a new world: one where magic is the norm. And, of course, the beasts. They are what make this film truly magical. They are unlike anything we've seen before and bring our childhood imaginations to life. I could go on for eternity about all the wonderful things about this movie and why any Potter fan, or anyone, should go see it, but I believe I've made my stance quite clear: This film is magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the end,"From the magic and sorcery demonstrated in the film, the eyes are rounded. Now I know how Hogwarts was restored - just like that apartment. Advanced Americans from the 20s bake delicious strudels in five seconds, and Mrs. Weasley peels potatoes for half an hour. (But the British are progressively tolerant in their love of Muggles.) How is any conflict in the magical world possible with such skills? At the same time, basic spells (like ""accio"") are absent in the cinema as a class. Why wasn't the counterfeit hero wrapped up at the customs, and the British one at that? Yes, he should have been herded as unreliable in England itself. ""They're not dangerous!!"" Newt shouts in the middle of the movie. Actually, they are deadly. Or are they dangerous enough to be expelled from school, but not enough to travel around the world with this zoo?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
better than it looks in trailers,"(no spoilers). the movie is actually very well done. I was a bit worried when I saw trailers, but the movie definitely exceeds expectations.Now, the good stuff: *the movie has the same feeling as harry potter saga, it has the same charm and so on. I guess it's the biggest plus for me, to see and feel the HP world again. *actors do a good job. Acting is good, strong. The main character is likable too. *it's a lighthearted movie with humor, but at the same time it also has seriousness. So it's quite a balanced movie. *really good CGI in 3D. Definitely go to 3D, it really makes a very big difference.Now, the reasons why I deducted one star are: *some scenes were a bit slow and too long. But nothing major. *some humor in one or two scenes didn't feel too natural. But overall the humor is good, so no worries about it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Nice, but not what I expected","When I heard the notice f a new film of the Harry Potter universe I was very exited, my expectations were very high. I was kind of disappointed when I saw the film but it wasn't bad at all.The character is nice and singular, all characters are likable. I waited more action in the film, anyway, i'm gonna see the next one if there is.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The fantastic world from JK Rowling.,"The movie takes place in the Harry Potter world. You can recognize words, ideas and places from the same universe, although the story feels fresh with original fantastic beasts. This movie is targeted at a more mature audience. The story is very creative, with excellent actors. The main actor, Eddie Redmayne, did an amazing job and created a peculiar character, better than our imagination could contrive. The movie has dark scenes but in our mind, only the sweet and pleasant ones remain by the time we leave the movie theater. JK Rowling mixed the real world with the magical world and in this way was able to create funny moments.The movie is very good and you can enjoy it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent but darker and less beast hunting than expected,"I thought this film would basically be a homage to the book and Newt would go on a hunt around New York for all his magical creatures and it would be wholesome light fun...that is not what happened.The film is DARK and I sincerly hope nobody brought their children to the cinema to see this. At time I thought I was watching Tim Burton instead of Harry Potter and was on par with the scariest parts of the HP franchise is not scarier.Redmaybe was okay byt Katherine Waterston was far better and stole every scene she was in. Dan Fogler also played the cluess muggle (we're not going with no mag) very well too.There seemed liek several big names in this film who were in it for 5 seconds (Zoe Kravitz, Depp etc) who just didn't need to be. Rather than hiring big ""A-listers"" I think the cast should've relatively understated and the actors should've been allowed to make the role their own without being instantly recognisable.I probably won't be watching the sequels because, as I mentioned, this film had a darker underlying storyline which I didn't really care about. In my opinion this should've been a movie seperate from the originals with only a few hints and easter eggs in there for die hard fans. I don't see the point in bringing backstories for characters who should either get their own movies or be left alone. So this movie could've been infintely better if it was more focused on the creatures and less on Grindelwald and the creepy cult people...but still a decent and captivating film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Coming home in the most brilliant way,"When I was rating this movie I wondered if it wouldn't be too easy to give it 10 stars. Giving it lesser stars would be a downright lie, so I gave it a go.When I watched the trailers for this movie I was hyped and my expectations were very high, I'm a real Potterfan FYI.So when I went to see this movie during a pre-screening I had butterflies in my stomach and I was nervous as hell. My best friend, who went with me, had the same feeling. The moment the WB logo came on, the audience erupted in cheers and applause. A marvellous feeling came over me.Without going into details, I thought the movie has a very good plot, with a big twist... the actors were also very very good, I enjoyed Newt and Queenie the most, stellar performances, especially Eddie Redmane. The music that supports this movie is moving and it supports the 'coming home' feeling. There is definitely magic in this movie and not just because of the CGI, which makes everything look very good, but also because of all the reasons I spoke of woven into one big, new, fantastic (see what I did there) world.I can't wait to see the other parts.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a magical background setting adventure story For kids,"6/105/10 to the costume setting and the fantastic beasts,1/10 to the animal lover behavior but not the actor.I am sorry, but I have to admit I have no chemistry with any characters from this movie.I never read the book, therefore, I can't judge the original story. But all I watched this movie, the story is boring and plain. I will leave the movie in 20 minutes if there are no CGI processed. It is a movie built on CGI, the story itself is sadly empty.During this movie, there is only a few magic is needed, more like a magical background setting adventure story for kids. It made me miss Harry Potter, its plots are packed and trilling.Not so many things to talk about this movie, just some random thoughts below:First, the bad guys clubs, that supposed to be a very major person from the books according to other reviews I read online; however what I able to recalled from the movie about him are only the beginning newspapers warrant for arrest and the ending's exposure, and there is nothing else about this bad guy's bad history.Second, illogical love between the pretty younger sister and the no-maj.Third, Tina, the character just too pale and overacting, when I say pale I am not meaning to her skin, it is about her characteristic less role, simple head less thought and impulsively.Fourth, trust me the chubby no-man has better acting skills among all. And the main character, mr.nert? I knew he is a good actor, but I just can't find a favor from this character.Peace out.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Scamander's Lumos Maxima Is Sufficient For Another J.K. Rowling's Heptalogy,"It was predicted by the selfsame Rowling: ""If I have a sufficiently powerful idea, I will come back"", it is. The return to the wizarding universe most acclaimed of all time was as logical and pressing as the return to Katniss Everdeen's Panem or a galaxy far, far away in ""Star Wars"". ""Fantastic Beasts"" fulfills all its aims with faultless expertise: conceiving the spin off wished by all fanatics drawing on Harry Potter's rich mythology to forged a style of its own which stands out with power of franchise, introducing to the most apathetic or uninterested people of Rowling's writings and laying a consistent foundations for extensive franchise which has in front of its wand.Seductive prequel begins in in the midst of the 1920s, in New York precisely, a period of economic prosperity. Magizoologist Newton ""Newt"" Artemis Fido Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) born in 1897, who was expelled from Hogwarts due to an incident with one of his beloved offsprings, does expeditions across five continents to register, protect—from the most dangerous specimens in the planet, ""humans—"" and categorize magical creatures in order to write a meticulous textbook of preservation about them, entitled ""Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them"" (with a foreword written by Albus Dumbledore: ""Never tickle a sleeping dragon""). These trips take him to 'The Big Apple', where meets the baker Jacob Kowalski (Dan Floger), who accidentally takes Scamander's fabulous carrying case. That mistake ends with the catastrophic opening of the suitcase, which four celestial animals escape (""Night at the Museum"" style). While Kowalski, Scamander, Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) — a police belonging to the 'MACUSA' — and her charismatic sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) are in the exhaustive animal search and capture, in Europe, malicious and powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) causes great vicissitudes, which will be connected ominously with animal chase in North America.The charm, excitement and fantasy projected before us were theoretically 'as if by magic', nonetheless, such magic is performed by explicit magicians. The first of them is who has been behind the art of wizards all this time, J. K. Rowling, who now holds the start of this new story with her own hands, since in addition to assembling almost naturally the new piece within Harry Potter's vast universe, wrote the screenplay of all the characters involved. British (screen)writer makes a well-built beginning as such; it's for that reason that first installment is crammed with information, narrative threads as: The Magical Congress of the United States of America (which is strictly dissimilar to the British), varied range of suggestive characters, meaningful range of facts, ambitious catalog of creatures and the presentation of who perhaps will be the king-villain of the saga (akin to 'Thanos' in ""MCU"").Second miracle worker is director-producer David Yates, who was in the middle of Gabonese jungle with ""The Legend of Tarzan"" in July and concluded masterfully the story of Harry, Ron and Hermione with ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 & Part 2"" in 2010 and 2011 respectively; he enigmatically returns to inaugurate a new and long chapter, which probably also will direct. His tremendous experience is imposed on the fluidity of the story, the refreshing and vital blocking and assiduous harmony of every complex aspect on the screen. It is open to view that Yates and Rowling are understood well and for the sake of their all 'muggles', that honest connection must endure.Our third magicians are the art, production and boundless special effects team, they demonstrated some of their aces under the sleeve, the others are kept for future films. Simply by the imaginative, surprising and sophisticated recreation of the 1920s, radiant —and sometimes terrifying— creatures, thundering lightning flashes of wands, flying food and objects in the movie, parallel worlds of the suitcase of Newt and more are a compelling Academy Awards nomination. Maybe there is a little excessive use of CGI, but if the current blockbusters abusing technology for purposes like these, they have the clear path.Lastly, but no less important, the true wizards of the story. Oscar- winning Eddie Redmayne wears the coat that made Radcliffe shine in his time. The new hero for a new era of magic has an inherent connection with his stooped over way of walking, his shy personality and bangs manage to create an overwhelming and interesting atmosphere. His team is equally effective, however, Dan Floger (""No- maj"") is who amuses us and provides part of the comicality in the film, and in addition, gives us glimpses of silent film. On the dark side of witchcraft and wizardry, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller and the short cameo by Johnny Depp become the subplot into something scary, creepy and not too suitable for kids— substantially, pointing out in the excellent performances and background music by James Newton Howard.""Fantastic Beasts"" fortuitously becomes us absent-minded of the original series, with a spin-off packed with magic, joy, new opportunities and surprises to come. The faithful muggles—or No-maj— of Rowling have a lot to be happy with the return to the essence of Harry Potter with a golden and striking wrapping which promises fabulous visuals, stories, and possibilities. Open that suitcase, we are on the right way.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not a great film, but it has some good aspects","I didn't like the movie, I am not a fan of wizards or Rowling's work, but I decided to watch it to see Rowling's work as a screenwriter, which I found not good.
Though there are some details in the film which I found good; like production, how they make everything fit the historical context which the story is based on, for example the briefcase (being the resource of Newt's magical products, being relevant to the story of the motion picture), also the production design, costume design, I like how the played with the colors, and used some specific ones to create a good photography.
One of the reasons why I don't like a lot Sci-Fi or Fantasy movies is because of the use of many special effects, but I was quite pleased with those shown in the movie.
I do think the acting, direction and screenplay are poor, could be better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I enjoyed this film more than I expected,"I haven't been a fan of the actor that played Newt, but I really liked him in this. Well written. The acting quite good. Characters and their development very well done. An immersive experience. Good special effects, and imaginative creatures. My favorite character has to be Queeny. I just fell in love with this vivacious and fun part of the film. Some interactions between Newt and his creatures were a little over the top. Sometimes less is more. I really like how the personalities of the creatures come through. The darker aspects of the film are actually very well done, and are historically accurate for the United States at the time this story is presented. Much of the dark wilsonian progressive aspects of the inter war years leading to the second world war was well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
2 hours of waiting for something to happen,"I admit, I am not one of those folks who call themselves Harry Potter Fans. However thought I would give this one a try. thought it would be a perfect way for me and my family to spend a cold afternoon...I felt this was was 2 hours of waiting for something to happen. I get there are usually slow starts with most trilogies as the characters and story line are provided to the audience. However for me felt the movie was extremely slow and sorry, seeing new magical beasts is not very exciting. They did that with avatar a decade ago. My boys ages 8 and 10 had trouble as well engaging in the movie. Both gave it a thumbs down when we were leaving.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disclaimer: I Didn't Read The Book,"I had watched this movie last night with my family and really loved it. The plot is about creatures running rampant in New York city and the main characters need to return them to a magical suitcase before non-magic folks discover anything about the wizarding world.Even though it was about magic, I still found myself getting lost in the well executed plot. It was set in the olden days and never once broke that setting.The screenplay of this movie was decent. There were times I had trouble understanding what somebody said and had to listen closely. Although that happened, I was glad the actors stuck close to their characters.Which brings me to the next point, the acting was really good and never broken. At first, all of the characters had different motives which made it exciting when they decided to work together to get the creatures back in Newt's suitcase.The special effects for this story were quite interesting and well done. It was fun seeing a whole new world full of magical creatures in the suitcase.There was never a time where I thought anything looked kind of fake, it all seemed quite real. The music in the movie was quite subtle. I had watched it last night and even now I barely remember any of it. In my opinion, that's good because it matched the scenes and didn't mess anything up.The editing was pretty nice as well. I'm sure somebody who read the book would be unhappy with me right now because of how I'm being so optimistic about the movie. I'm being honest, the plot progressed well. The only issue I had were some of the cut scenes to the orphanage, they were sometimes unnecessary or too quick. Overall, this was a good movie that I would definitely watch again sometime in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Superbly Marvelous!!!,"Do you remember the look of harry walking down 'Diagon Alley' for the very first time as he discovered who he was and the world to which he belonged?!?!? Well that was what I experienced when I saw the opening scene of ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" I cannot put into words just how very emotional it was for me, partly because it has been so long, almost too long since 'Harry Potter'and partly because this time around Rowling is treating us and giving us the opportunity to truly see the Wizarding world Not just Hogwarts and Quidditch and all that but the Real Diverse world of Magic that spans the entire world and co-exists alongside us 'No- Maj' – American term for 'Muggles' i.e. Non Magical folks. This is truly a Motion Picture, because from the first scene you literally hit the ground running. This is a Dark World – make no mistakes. And definitely not a child's world at that!!! There are beasts, and forces at play that bewilders even the Wizarding community. For me this movie didn't disappoint perhaps that is because I didn't go into this movie expecting Harry Potter. Newt Scammander is the Focus just for this movie so do not go expecting him to span the other movies. This is all about the epic Showdown between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, the end of the Global Wizarding War and this movie sets the stage for that perfectly. We are instantly made aware of the conflict between No-Maj and the Wizards, and the imminent threat overshadowing the both the worlds, with the MACUSA (American Counterpart of MoM)desperately floundering to contain the situation. The special effects are superbly executed. The casting is flawless, because can you really expect otherwise when you have the likes of Colin Farrell, Eddie Redmayne, Dan Fogler, Ezra Miller. (drumroll forJOHNNY DEPP!!! – He got 2 lines and 4 frames and nailed them!!!) Each character is crafted very practically  no overacting in sight. The chemistry between Newt and Jacob Kowalski is what makes it all the more interesting. Partly because Kowalski is all or any of us in the event that we do get to meet the likes of Prof. Newt. There is ample Comic relief with a biting and poking incidents getting out of hand and budding romance between two very improbable but wholly cute people. Also we get a to know Prof. Scammander's wife!!! The creatures are TRULY FANTASTIC. I absolutely loved the little gold digging Niffler. The antics of the Beasts are well articulated and just enough to keep you satisfied yet keep you hooked on for more. The movie is action packed and had enough mystery to keep the thrill seekers in us entertained what with the introduction of a new Dark Force that will blow the smithereens of the world, both No-Maj and Wizarding. I have a lot to hope from this franchise. And I am elated that Rowling has realized that 'Harry Potter' is all that's good with the world but we finally also need something that feed the imagination of ours as an adult. Because like it or not we can't help being curious as to what really happened before Harry, before James & Lily and Voldemort. We can't help but wondering where it all began and if this is where it all began then I can't wait for more!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More or less,"An interesting film, to keep the harry potter's magical world on but it lacks a story and there's no magic. After seeing it, I felt dissapointed, I was expecting a story that makes sense and the real problem in that franchise is, if you haven't seen any harry potter films, you're doomed... It's a shame even though some scenes were pleasant to see.I expect more for the 2nd.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"J.K. Rowling is a fantastic story teller, and this movie proves it.","I am a big harry potter fan and I have read all the books at least three times. I went to this movie with high hopes seeing all the positive reviews and was not disappointed. I really loved Dan Fogler acting, such a talented guy. He can make you laugh just by his facial expressions. Acting was brilliant, very natural. I hope he and Eddie Redmayne will play a part in future movies. I watched this movie in IMAX 3D and I would recommend everyone to watch it in this version, you will not be let down. Brilliant cinematography, really feels like 1920's New York City, and the musical score fits perfectly with it. J.K Rowling has proved once again that she has a gift of telling stories in such a way that you are hooked from the beginning. After watching boring movies in summer, for example Star trek (very predictable), this movie, Doctor Strange and Arrival according to me are the best movies of the year. November has been truly a blessing. I don't want to give too much away plot wise, but I am imploring you to watch this, if you can, with your friends and family, you will leave as a happy man/woman. Of course it is not perfect but which movie is? I am a philosophical kind of person, so I could see lot of moral/ethical lessons, especially from Newt, that I can apply in my life too.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unmemorable  by itself but adds to universe,"The movie expands the Harry Potter universe in the movie scene. Even though it may be an amazing thing for the fans it may not be that interesting for people who do not have any attachments to the series. The movie itself is very basic which falls short of making the viewers feel excited. Also, even though the ""beasts"" adds a nice lore, there is nothing more than them. Even there is other contents regarding lore they are not covered and it feels lacking. It may be done on purpose the create hype for future movies, however, I believe that it could have been more than that. All these together leaves us with a rather unmemorable movie especially for people who are not big fans of the Harry Potter universe.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sometimes a Bit Hard to Know The Foundation of Good and Evil,"I really enjoyed watching this film. It is visually astounding with some amazing creatures which inhabit a world that is familiar to us, New York of the 1920's. Eddie Redmain comes to the big city from London to find a weird creature. It is quite destructive and his task is difficult because laws have been passed against magic. There are several factions in the city, the strength of whom is difficult to pinpoint. We have no trouble realizing who the heroes are, but the infighting within the administration is not totally clear (although I'm probably too inept to get it the first time). There is a delicate balance between the edgy, dire blackness of Harry Potter and its humor. Some of the creatures are hilarious, but when push comes to shove, there is nothing funny about what is happening. Lives are being lost and religious fanatics are seizing power. Life in the city is crippled by poverty and despair. I understand there are several films yet to be made that bank on the unanswered questions in this one. I am hoping to watch this again to get more of an understanding of it. Oh! The special effects are beyond belief.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good movie, but far from a masterpiece","It was a CGI-fest with a lot of buildings breaking and cool looking beasts. The story wasn't very deep or meaningful, but it had some interesting characters. I liked most scenes with Kowalski, the comedy relief and support character, it felt like he fit very well in the movie. The main character, Mr. Scamander, was very weird most of the time.

Nothing Like Harry Potter - Just the Same Universe,"J. K. Rowling's universe is quite magically fun but this movie is just okay - not great, not horrible - mediocre. If was young again I'm sure I'd like the movie a bit better than I do as an adult. I do recommend this one for the younger film audiences - lots to offer them. As an adult, the story is rather bland and a bit too simple. There is way too much abuse and misuse of CGI that also keeps this from being a film favorite for me.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"J.K. Rowling works her magic again with these ""Fantastic Beasts""","For the past 15 years, I've always been a devoted follower of J.K. Rowling's phenomenal Harry Potter series. The 7 books and the eight movies based on them have worked its magic on me all the way through. Now, in light of the worst election most of us have experienced, who knew that Rowling had the magic touch to bring me back to the Wizarding World that I knew and remembered. But it wasn't any book, it was a tiny textbook that made the largest leap to the big screen. In ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", the Wizarding World was more colorful and alive as ever. It even helped too, since this is Rowling's first ever screenplay, she knew this world better than anyone ever could. Set in 1926, the movie follows British ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander (the amazing Eddie Redmayne, Oscar-Winner for ""The Theory of Everything"") as he travels to New York. Once he arrives, things get a bit hairy, thanks to a classic switch of suitcases with former war veteran Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler in a sensational performance). When Jacob accidentally opens Newt's suitcase filled with these fantastic beasts, Newt, along with the help of ex-auror of the MACUSA Headquarters (America's version of Ministry of Magic), Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston, a spellbinder) and her spicy sister, Queenie (a fetching film debut by Alison Sudol from the band ""A Fine Frenzy""), searches for his precious beasts all around New York. But there is terror reigning supreme, as a dark force will cause the war between the Wizarding World and the No-Maj (American term for ""Muggle"", non-magic folk) world. Not even the leader Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo) and the auror Percival Graves (Colin Farrell, very menacing) of MACUSA or the Barebones, a Second Salemers group led by adoptive mother/conspiracy theorist Mary Lou (Samantha Morton) or her abused son Credence (Ezra Miller in a chilling standout performance) could do anything to contain it. This magical first chapter of a soon-to-be 5-part film series brings back director David Yates (who has directed the last four Harry films) and producer David Heyman (who produced all the films) and production designer Stuart Craig. And yet, like Newt's magical case, the world is more expanded in ways we couldn't even imagine thanks to those three. What's also interesting about this movie is that it is more adult than the previous films. The social and sometimes political themes of fear, isolation, loneliness, abuse and love are presented in a more mature way. While it's playful and enchanting at times, it's also not afraid of showing us the dark side of the Wizarding World. Rowling has delivered a phenomenal first screenplay and her trust in director Yates was a very natural choice. The characters were original, well-developed and perfectly cast, the magical creatures including a thieving Niffler, a vicious Swooping Evil, a striking Thunderbird and a charming Bowtruckle are indeed fantastic, the look of the film is marvelous and the music by James Newton Howard is pitch-perfect. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing this movie again, so as a fan, I can look back at some of the details that will lead to the amount of extraordinary events in the Harry Potter books that most people will miss out on. It's a first-class stunner in many ways, a pure-blooded fantasy that dazzles with wonder and charm. So far, the magic is back and it definitely needed me to believe again. This is the beginning of a whole new world that I can't wait to see once more.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts,"In the 1920s, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is a wizard who arrives in New York City from Great Britain with the intention of travelling further to Arizona. He ends up getting mixed up with a would-be baker (Dan Folger), another wizard (Katherine Waterston), and strange events from somewhere in the magical community causing havoc on the city.As this film was written by J.K. Rowling and directed by Peter Yates, much of the jollity of the Harry Potter series is repeated here. The visual effects are magnificent as is the set design and all else that help recreate another time and place long gone by mixed with the supernatural.Occasionally, the story seemed incoherent and difficult to follow though it seemed easier to understand near its conclusion. Luckily, its light-heartedness, fine acting and able directing saved the film from falling to a mediocre level.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Time to start memorizing spells again!,"I practically grew up reading the novels and I distinctly remember how my friends and I would have 'duels' after class. Then came the movies, which more or less brought the magic to the big screen (apart from the Goblet of Fire, which I thought deviated too much on trivial stuff).After the 8th movie had come and gone, we were all a bit disheartened, and would anxiously wait for Pottermore for our entertainment. Then J.K. Rowling (takes a bow!) launched the spin-off books and things started looking up again.To be honest, I've been having a rough week, and movies are the only things that are keeping me sane right now. Marvel is always a bright spot, with its recent success with Doctor Strange. However, I had no idea how this movie would turn out to be when I went for it, knowing very well that all characters are new, and knowing very little about the Fantastic Beasts in the first place.I don't think I moved even an inch during the entire 2 hours and 13 minutes. J.K. Rowling has come up with a highly imaginative narration, this time based in the US instead of the UK, and every character, scene and set has been brought alive marvelously by director David Yates. The movie has everything - comedy, suspense, plot twists, scare moments and of course, brilliant visuals.I'll be waiting for the next 4 sequels with the exact same anxiousness as I did with the original series. Thank you J.K. Rowling!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Love the magic, but the story was scattered","Love the magic, love the creatures, love the chance to revisit this world with some fun protagonists. But the story was scattered, partly because origin movies have to introduce SO much. (Simply keeping track of the creatures would have taken a detailed spreadsheet.) And I wish the bad guys were as developed as the good guys. Still, fun holiday movies are not a bad thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Movie,"I've never read any of the books (Potter or this one), so I go into all of these movies completely blind. This was done very well. Families, singles, adults, and kids... all will be highly entertained. This is different than the Potter movies because these aren't folks who are trying to learn their craft, they know it so they aren't limited using their magic and the things that they don't know. One of the best performances, if not the best one is that of the lone muggle. We seem to get to experience everything through his eyes (to a certain extent). His wonderment is our wonderment. And I really enjoy the actor Eddie Redmayne, for the life of me, I can't remember his character name, but there were opportunities for him to be over the top and he never was. I sat next to someone in her 20s (I am in my 50s) and she was just over-the-moon watching the movie. I enjoyed it immensely as well. Just fantastic special effects, great storyline.. and all actors perform splendidly. This is a multiple view movie that your kids will never get tired of. It is a nice little addition to the Potter franchise. (The story takes place before Potter). I say this is a must see on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Watch it only for the fantastic Beasts !!!,"A Spin off from the Harry potter franchise, you wonder how they can make a movie out of a textbook.The plot line is pretty standard with love, betrayal and climax. A huge focus on the protagonist leads to underdevelopment of the main villain. The movie ends in a whimper when compared to the initial build up.You won't even feel frightened from the main villain who goes off as quickly as he comes.On the positive side, a huge production budget lends to gorgeous animations. You are able to see many of Rowling's creations come to life. Its a fun to watch how they are unique in their own respect with magic complimenting their personalities.Watch the movie just for these Fantastic Beasts and hope that the sequels are able to do justice to the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Where and how I found Fantastic Beasts,"I must admit at the very beginning, I'm one of those adults who bought the small booklet, and even enjoyed it. I always appreciate when an author creates an entire world in which his/her story takes place, very few compare with the totality of the world created by JK Rowling. So no wonder that the full story of Newt Scamander has already existed in her mind, when she wrote his textbook for the Hogwarts' students and all the rest of us. But this was written from the very start as a movie, and in my mind is the fruit of the creative partnership she had formed with David Yates, who directed the final three installments (4 actually) of the Harry Potter saga.The result is both a visual marvel, a heartwarming story, and a tale of fantasy, action and suspense. Another part of Rowling's magic is the amazing characters she creates. She created here four wonderful leads, that gave room to some wonderful acting performances: Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, and the most surprising of all Dan Fogler, with whom I was already familiar as a voice actor (Mars Needs Moms) and he proves, that a good voice actor, is a good actor. One more special mention must go for Ezra Miller, who's so superb as Credence, that he almost spoils the surprise at the end of the film.Bottom line, not really a prequel, but a wonderful independent story that happens to fit into the same universe where Harry Potter exists. Don't worry, there's room there for much more.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"As a huge fan of the original films and books, I wanted this movie to be brilliant and reminiscent of Hogwarts. Unfortunately, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is just vanilla. With a shallow plot and uninteresting characters, I left the film wanting to go back and watch Prisoner of Azkaban and Deathly Hallows pt. 2.The CGI was weak (shades of the Phantom Menace), the wizarding terminology (No-Maj, MACUSA, etc.) was forced and the acting wasn't anything special. While I still hope for sequels, this film shows that the magic of the Wizarding World is not in the wands or the spells, but in Hogwarts.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I Loved It,"I really liked the movie. I thought the actors were great. The story that took place before Harry Potter was very well done. The special effects were excellent. I thought David Yates, the director of the movie, did a fantastic job on his 5th Potter movie. The musical score was really thrilling. The monsters, especially the little guanine pig who kept stealing money, was really cool and funny. Furthermore, the bad guy played by Collin Ferrell, was scary and he had a unique black wand. Overall, the actors and actresses performed their parts really well. I have do not have anything bad to say about the movie and that I thought it had a sad, but happy ending. I can't wait for the next movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really Enjoyable,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them.There is no need for this movie. That's true of most sequels/prequels. This movie was made for one reason. The Harry Potter movies made money. A lot of money!! And Warner Bros were not ready to give up on the goose that laid the golden egg just yet. So they set about trying to kick start a new franchise.These movies should not appeal to me, but I do enjoy watching them!! Maybe it's because of the fun my kids had watching them, and I got caught up in their excitement. I dunno. But I find it entertaining anyway.I have a real soft spot for Eddie Redmayne, and I enjoyed his performance as Newt. In fact all of the leads are engaging. As for the movie sufficiently detached from the Potter books/movies so that a viewer doesn't need familiarity with the latter to enjoy the former. But there are enough call-backs for fans to know that we're still in the same universe. Depp filmed a secret cameo (which amazingly in this day and age, was kept a secret)Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them grossed $234 million at the domestic box office to end the year to 12th highest grossing movie of 2016. So it was the lowest grossing and worst performing movie from that universe, but considering it was a prequel, that features none of the original cast I think it did quite respectably. Enough to warrant a second movie to be released this year anyways.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A majestic treat, good step in the right misdirection.","So five years on since Harry Potter left the big screen, director of the last four films David Yates returns to visualise another J.K. Rowling story that isn't strictly a prequel but set well within the Potterverse. This story actually being a book written for charity back in 2001 with a large majority of profits going to Comic Relief, is also Rowling's screen writing debut.Predating Potter, we go back to 1926 where a young, slightly bashful and awkward wizard, Newt Scamander sails to New York for what appears to be more than just one reason, harbouring quite a number of exotic creatures in that surprisingly humongous suitcase of his.But, as one can expect, there's something already loose in the New York which is threatening to expose the wizardry community and in true American stereotype, set off an unwanted war between Nomags (American name for Muggles) and the Wizards.Eddie Redmayne is nothing short of brilliant, emanating a cunning understanding and love for the creatures he tends for. Like a soft Sir David Attenborough but with the mannerisms of a clumsy Lee Evans. Being a lover of animals and furry companions myself, I could related with Scamander who thinks a little more outside the jurisdiction and the box, or should I say suitcase.The supporting cast is strong, with a decent Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight and even some amazing hidden gems but it's Katherine Waterson as the American magical investigator, Tina and quite possibly my favourite muggle of all, Dan Fogler's aspiring baker-extraordinaire wannabe, Jacob Kowalski that makes the story work so well. Other mentions have to go to Ezra Miller, who does quite a performance and the alluring Alison Sudol.This seems to delve deeper than most of the Potter films I remember, especially with the relationship with muggles, having quite an emotional impact setting aside differences, it reminded me a little of the Hobbit, out of his depth but an unique and lovable friendship is born. Jacob Kowalski is truly magical, providing a lot of the best comedy seen in Potter films. I want some of that Gigglewater!The beasts themselves are, incredible but quite CGI rich which does ruin it slightly for me, however it's expected and younger audiences and fans won't even think about it as a lot of them are comical and cute if not majestic. Yates does a fine job keeping the darker side just lingering until the epic reveal which is some of the best CGI and destruction I've seen; and like with his previous Potter films, dares to go quite sinister and ferocious with it.James Newton Howard has a go with the score, and composes something quite magical, reminiscent of Danny Elfman's work of a Tim Burton movie. It's a great score but didn't quite smash it, lacking any recognisable theme. The trailer music had more of an impact.Is it a Potter film? People are going about saying ""going to see the new Potter film"" and the answer is yes, all the same elements are there and there's enough connections and mentions to tease Potter fans' interest especially when certain names are dropped.It's not secret this is the first of many, a multi-picture deal with the next four already in production. Yes, four more to come. It's a good step in the right misdirection, and with Yates at the helm for all of them, if like this, we should hopefully be in for a treat.Running Time: 10 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 6 for muggle Jacob and Gigglewater. Would I buy the Bluray?: Yes!85% 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Relatively decent Harry Potter flick,"The first Fantastic beasts film is ok, nearing good status. It's an entertaining and well acted film with nice effects and movie sets but it's not very memorable and the plot is a touch of a letdown.Eddie Redmayne does a good job of playing Newt and his accompanying actors Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler all do well and have fairly interesting characters as well. Unfortunately I found quite a few of the side characters disappointing and the main villain played by Colin Farrell whilst well acted wasn't intimidating or threatening, more like a businessman.The plot's alright but nothing special, although it was fun to see all the magical animals and I did like the setting of some scenes, obviously a lot of effort went into making them. An annoying lack of action too.6/10: Good",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Magical Bit of Entertainment That is Well Worth the Watching!,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find ThemThis was a most excellent film! The production values were top notch. The acting was on point. The casting was superb. The script was tight. The action flowed quite well. The two and a quarter hour run time passed in a flash. The dialog was fully appropriate and well done. On all points, this film delivered and was well worth watching.For fans of Harry Potter this film fits wonderfully into that existing realm - but stands nicely apart from it. Some, just enough, actually, of the familiar landmarks and touchstones are there - Hogwarts, Dumbledore, muggles, etc. - but only as frame setting reference points.The story is otherwise apart from the world that Rowling showed with Harry Potter and we're well rewarded by journeying to it. Thus, you don't have to be a Potter fan or have read any of the books or seen any of the previous films as this tale well enough stands on its own.The characters were well rendered and nicely believable. Their motivations were realistic and made sense within the confines of the tale. Aside from Farrell and Voight, the rest of the cast were essentially unknowns. That's a grave risk for any film with such high expectations riding on it. Yet, that cast was exceptionally well cast and delivered handsomely in their performances.The sense of wonder and awe and beauty of magical possibilities was well handled and quite different from what we'd seen previously in the Potter films. A different tale, this, and thus a different flavor.With this release and its well deserved coming success, there's sure to be more Rowling tales set in America and thus will have an entirely new and different audience than what the Potter-verse has already created.I recommend this film highly. It's a great and enjoyable bit of magical entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magic in a Different Way!,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is the prequel franchise to Harry Potter, with a different plot, characters and intentions. The first instalment takes place in New York (So we are going a long way from United Kingdom) and our main hero, Newt Scamander, a zoologist that specialises in Fantastic Beasts, has came to the big city to fix some things. He has a suitcase full of animals, and when things go wrong, Newt and his new friends have to go get all of the magical animals back to the place. On the way are hidden secrets revealed, secrets that later reconnects and gives us a brighter understanding for what happened before the new magical era. Dumbledore is mentioned a few times, but he never appeared. The Potters are of course not mentioned here, since this was happening a few decades before, and the parents weren't even born yet. Even if this film is way different then the classic and original Harry Potter movies, I'm still pretty impressed by this one. Great action that holds, good development of story, and creative ideas and visuals. One of my favourite things about this film was Newt's suitcase that is a normal size, but is capable to be bigger inside and have an area on an average forest size. The suitcase was the animals home, and they showed greatly their connection to it. Many new creatures were introduced in here that was never introduced before in the Wizarding World, for example The Niffler, a black, gold-hungry, black looking-like Echinada, that carried a lot of the film, with the great innocent look of it and the ironic humor it gave. The rest of the animals were great, but they were more like side characters, because in the end, the main problem is much bigger. Our great and powerful Grindelwald, manipulated an innocent boy with great, hidden powers to become even bigger and use his power for his needs. They showed that greatly, as well as showing how the innocent boy, Credence, was treated from the beginning of his life. His flashbacks and dark thoughts gave the character more depth and an interesting addition that spiced up a big part of the film. The technicals are also something too talk about. Great music, the theme did fit perfectly, and the script and dialogues had sense and nothing felt wasted or unnecessary. The acting was nice, quite decent, I would say acceptable for the film. Johnny Depp came here in and out, and his role was good, too. His performances are good most of the time. In the end, Fantastic Beasts was great, a fun prequel to Harry Potter, and something worth watching!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Epic spin-off and easily understandable,"If you have been, and still are, a super nerdy Harry Potter fanatic like me, you will have a blast watching reference after reference to the now already older HP-movies, and it will be easy to follow the story line because of that. Don't even get me started on an amazing reveal towards the end. You will feel a chill running through your body.The story is well written, as usual, by her excellency J.K. Rowling, leaving almost nothing unclear or confusing by the time the credits roll. In my opinion though, a few things still need clarification, but that's absolutely the whole charm of it, because it makes the desire for the next four all the bigger.Last but not least, hats of to Eddie Redmayne for a fantastic portrayal of Newt Scamander, which was just outright stunning. Furthermore, there is one more supporting actor who deserves great credit for a very emotional, humoristic and overall grand portrayal of a quite significant role, but I won't tell you who, because you need to go watch the movie now...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Although some (like myself) were hoping we would come out feeling like we just saw another Harry Potter film, this is a completely different movie.

Fantastic Yawns and Where to Find Them,"Spoiler FreeJ.K. Rowling should stick to writing novels. This whole affair is nothing but a huge money grab. This latest entry is a hollow shell devoid of any spirit and magic of the Potter world. In short, one fantastic yawn fest.WB and co., you must be laughing all the way to the bank. This film is just one long 2 hour trailer. Personally, I found watching the trailer more interesting and best of all, it was free .What made the Potter films endearing was the character development with the magic and CG as the supporting cast. You cared about the characters and were eager yet anxious about their journey in a magical world. It's the other way around in Beasts. After the first half, I couldn't wait to get away. I just hate it when I feel there was no sincere effort put forth. Yes, the wrapping looked nice but when I opened the box, I felt duped. As if on some amusement ride, the whole film was on rails and along the way, there would be occasional things that would pop up.Don't be fooled by the current IMDb rating and glowing reviews both which are no doubt artificially inflated by the legions of Potter fans around the world. If you are a true fan then you should demand more than an illusion of what could have been. What a complete waste of the excellent cast who you could tell were just going through the motions but I blame it on the poor writing. Rowling must have written the whole thing during her 15 minute coffee break.You know there's something amiss when some of the minor characters steal most of the spotlight or garner the most laughs- think Ice Age and that squirrel or Despicable Me and those minions. I wonder how this series can possibly be extended to 5 parts. The main problem is the film is now stuck with an unlikable cast moving forward.WB and Rowling must take the fans to be fools or worse, they cast some dark magic that blinds them to donate money to this sorry excuse for a film. If you notice all the reviews on here, you can tell the film is quite polarizing. Most are either 10's or 1's. The fans vs everyone else not possessed by magic.Resist the dark magic. Times are tough and your hard earned cash better spent elsewhere that is more deserving. Take it from me, a duped Star Wars fan- all the red flags are there. This film, this road. I know where it leads. And it's not to the promised land. If fantastic beasts is what you seek then this film is not where to find them.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beautiful stand-alone film; great character depth in Newt,"Without any spoilers, this review will be shorter than I would like, for a film so delightful in its entirety. However, no spoilers here, since I would never risk ruining the discovery for a new viewer, or cheating anyone out of the development of Newt's character, richly portrayed by Eddie Redmayne.First off, the visuals in the movie are positively spectacular! Today I enjoyed some of the most realistic effects I have ever witnessed in a film, and the acting reflected this as well. The spells, the creatures, and the action are all delicious, and utterly believable on screen.Even better than the visuals was the main character, Newt Scamander; he and the other leads complemented each other masterfully. Newt begins as an odd person, slightly out of place, and always watchful, as one might expect any new wizard might appear, arriving in the USA from the UK in 1926. Newt's concern for the creatures he studies is revealed in smaller stages early on, but midway through the film we see his powerful understanding as he explains his chosen purpose in more detail. I was moved and, again, delighted by the way he follows this, and Eddie Redmayne embodies this character with flair throughout the story's evolution.The other central characters were well revealed, though not all as deeply as Newt's, but again, these are people for whom you will come to care deeply by the end of this installment. I have heard that there are others to follow this story, and yet it stands alone, beautifully told and well-contained without any background in the (later-set) Harry Potter universe.

Ok,"It's ok, but give me any HP film over this any time. This uses the magic much more frequently, but the real magic of the HP world is not here anymore, everything seems a bit fake, trying too much.I guess this can work better who never heard about Hoghwarts before. There are some crime elements and some prejudices and parallelisms with racial elements - curiously in a cast not diverse at all - that can make this an interesting journey. The actors try a lot and most people the visuals are pretty god, I just felt the scrip was messy, with no idea about where it would land.

"Great, a fun trip back to wizarding world.","All I can say is that this movie is a great opening to the future stories. The whole cinema was immersed with the movie, I can tell. We all missed the wizarding world. I swear to god the entire cinema made an ""aah.."" sound when the hedwig's theme was played at the start of the movie. The jokes were funny, we laughed, and we also were carried away by the thrilling adventure. Although I felt that there were some parts that were a bit too stretched out (cannot complain though as i enjoyed every minute in the wizarding world). Newt Scamander was acted splendidly by Eddie Redmayne. The gentle, animal lover/geek with awkward personality towards human was really shown. Some might say that the CGI was a little bit too much, but how else can you include dozen of mythical creatures in a movie? The only downside I saw was that the American wizarding school, Ilvermony, didn't get as much part as I thought it would get. After the ilvermony sorting feature and the ilvermony's backstory on pottermore, I thought this movie was going to include some parts about the school, but apparently it wasn't. It is indeed not a mind blowing movie, but it gave such nice aftertaste. It is the kind of movie that makes you smile while and after watching it. Oh the nostalgic feeling you will get after seeing the wizarding world again!All in all, a new wizarding story awaits! Now I clearly see why J.K Rowling decided to make 5 movies instead of 3.

It seems like it will tie in nicely and go into detail about the first Wizard War or such. So the upcoming parts I can't wait to see. For fans who haven't been into Harry Potter but may want to see this, it is still a wonderful ride. I love fantasy creatures and beasts. And this shows off some impressive ones. I give it a 9/10 for the beauty and adventure. But it felt like it had a few slow parts that either should have sped up or wasn't necessary, I'll go more into detail about that further down.The GOOD! The movie in the end was very FANTASTIC! Loved even the fact it sets around the time 1926 in New York. And Eddie Redmayne did a very talented job at playing the role of Newt Scamander. Most of the other actors were new faces to me. But they themselves did a wonderful job/part of the Wizarding World. The other two actors I did know were Colin Farrell and Dan Fogler. I very much enjoy Farrell and was excited to know he was in the movie as well. And Fogler, was happy to make me laugh once again. Since the last movie I saw him in was Balls of Fury(2007) so it has been awhile. Then comes the fantastic beasts! I was very happy to see that they did show many different creatures and not just a couple. Since the movie was in a way to show beasts it would have been a big downer to not see much variety of them. But you get it, and that was a big plus in my book. Sort of wish I had a few myself, and if you saw the movie you may know what beast you really want.To continue with the good of the movie. It had me laughing and Dan Fogler's character should make you laugh. One thing I did enjoy it gave us spells again. It didn't just stopped at the beasts but enhanced or reminded us the many different spells they use. The CGI at times was, to me, looked fake. Yes, CGI is fake but it should match in at least. My eyes at times were able to tell something wasn't right, you saw Newt standing next to a computerized beast when they were trying to make it look real as possible. But going over those parts, the CGI that was good, was amazing! The effects turned out cool. I get nit picking with CGI movies but this played it off nicely. I miss old animatronic animals or creatures. But in the end the effects came down to surprise me for the movie.Now with the bad. I believe it was two parts of the movie, maybe three, that were really slow and lot of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad just that it wasn't necessary. In a way it ended up being more cheesy than what they were after. There was also another part of the movie which involved a creature. One of the comical scenes to make people laugh. But I felt so awkward and weird watching it, that I didn't laugh during this scene and was again waiting for the scene to end. The scene did make audience members laugh, I just wasn't feeling it. A five part movie, which ain't bad at all, but you tend to get the scenes that can go on a bit to do movie fillers. Make the movie longer, if played out right it goes unnoticed because you are wanting more. But besides those couple of scenes I can't find much else, of course some of the acting was cheesy. And the extras(people standing around in the back) did feel oddly placed. Didn't need. The CGI did seem off to me, or at least the creatures and human interactions. At times it was like watching a real animal. Then other times you could tell it was computerized and didn't match well or look odd/out of place. But it wasn't all the time.J.K. Rowling I think did a supreme job writing the Harry Potter books. The way she manage to write a story, characters, twists, and other things. What always made me happy was you, yes YOU, could go on, add stories, fan theories, and depth that could have meaning to her story. Sort of like Star Wars. There is so much to still learn from her story. That is what I find thrilling. So with this story we get to learn much more. And hopefully with J.K. writing it, we get much more suspense and twists and excitement. Even more characters that is to come! So with David Yates directing and Rowling writing, I think we will have a wonderful four more movies to come.Kids who grew up waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out, along with the movies. We are grown up now, possibly having a family, friends who enjoyed it alongside with us. The new generation will be watching it with us. And I say that right there is probably the best part about this series. We get to cherish the memories again with people who take this movie to heart. So I say this movie is a must see. Kids will love it, younglings may get spook from the fights or creatures but I highly doubt it. And teens to adults will love another adventure through the Wizarding World.I do have to mention one more thing. I am unsure about other viewers, but when I saw this movie, it felt like it related to Star Wars. Which had me laugh to think that. I won't say why I thought so. But there were many times I had scenes pop into my head of a Star Wars movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A disgusting cash grab and nothing more.,"As a fanatic Harry Potter fan, books and movies, I was as excited as anyone about this. Now that I've seen it, I've got a bad taste in my mouth.The first clue is the big stars attached - they are nothing more than lures to draw in moviegoers, because the movie itself is so weak, it can't do it by itself. If you're five years old, maybe the magic and animals might distract you.Boring, non-existent story, lame one-dimensional characters, amateur actors. It is built out of string, all show and no substance at all. Don't get me started on the awful characters - Newt in particular stands out, it might just be terrible casting but he is painful to watch.Maybe the next one will actually bother to have a storyline, this one certainly didn't. The 'rise of Grindlewald' is ridiculous and literally comes out of thin air. They didn't even try to create a shred of a backstory for him. Why did Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp attach themselves to this? Colin Farrell is so shamefully wasted here that I'm baffled why he agreed to this.The only explanation, again, is money.JK Rowling actually gave this mediocre production her stamp of approval? She should be ashamed - the money clearly has gone to her head.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's fun!,"Well, we've got a new Harry Potter movie. (Or should we rather call it ""Harry Potter universe"" movie or something like that?) Anyway, this movie is quite different from the previous HP stories and it's a welcome breath of fresh air. We're going from the pompous and dark atmosphere of Britain and Hogwarts to the bustling and grimy 1920's New York. No more teenage angst and ancient prophecies, just some quirky wizard on the hunt for strange creatures...well, for the most part. I don't wanna say too much about the plot, but it does make for a really fun and creative movie. I think that some aspects should've been developed more, but at least that'll leave something for the die-hard fans to discuss about. Anyway, I'm off now to read my old copy of ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"".",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pretty good Harry Potter spin-off movie,"I was lucky enough to attend an advanced screening and I must say I have enjoyed this one :)J.K. Rowling is doing a good job as a screen writer and the return to the Harry Potter universe left us with a good taste. The finale was a bit long, but surely not boring. Dan Fogler is a good comedian and Alison Sudol got our attention.

Mind blowing experience,"One of the best movies I've seen this year.Don't understand some of the poor reviews.This films based on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, one of the companion books to J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Simply incredible. Watch this movie and unleash your imagination. I saw most of the Harry Potter movies.However, this one has a very similar theme, however way more engaging.The movie is set in New York in 1926, seventy years before the Harry Potter series, and features Newton Scamander as a main character.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Negative reviews are misleading. A separate series with entirely its own host of merits.,"It is really quite absurd to me seeing even one negative review left for this wonderful movie, let alone the generous handful there are. To be led by them is to be misinformed. I can't help but get the impression that the individuals disappointed by this movie are individuals who came to it expecting a continuation of the Harry Potter series - and that, it never promised to be. This film features a new, exciting range of faces which, in itself, is refreshing, tipping just the right amount of the cap to the Harry Potter franchise.What Fantastic Beasts does is continue that wonderful style of story telling. Every bit of the thoroughly entertaining whimsicality remains and if anything, I'd consider this to be a slightly more uplifting and child-friendly contribution to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.From the outset you are convincingly thrown into the hustle and bustle of 1920's New York and within that setting there is such creative exploration of 'fantastic beasts' throughout the film. It feels truly educational in it's style yet suffers not one moment of slowing in its pace or extravagance. As an adult I thoroughly enjoyed this film but I feel for children it must achieve the delighted heights of the early Harry Potter films plus some. J. K. Rowling's mind is the one of the most creative of any author, and now, screenwriter too.The criticisms of the CGI are surprising to me, as are criticisms of the acting - I think we all know by now that the performances of Eddie Redmayne and Colin Farrell are no less than stellar on every occasion. Alongside this I was pleasantly surprised by one perfectly apt addition to the voice cast in Ron Perlman.All fits incredibly snug within this movie and it is rated so highly by me because although the most pernickety among us will find one or two of the minutest details to fault, any film put before me is judged by the feel of its whole. Here I came away with every bit of satisfaction and enjoyment that I ever envisioned I could.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
6 points to hufflepuff,"This review of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is spoiler free*** (3/5)NOT LONG AFTER director James Mangold announced that his new film Logan won't be much of a CGI f**kathon and will have a lot of action to dominate the story, author and first time screenwriter J.K. Rowling announced that Fantastic Beasts will be a series of five just to try and match the previous of her adaptations; though you have to credit her for the extraordinary skill of adapting a big screen spin off/prequel/extended universe, not too long after the previous big screen adaptation from her novels lasting a total of eight films. This story originally published in 2001 by Rowling and has the names and habitats of around 85 different magical beasts, it focuses on former Hogwarts student turned scatterbrained friendly magizoologist Newt Scamander and his adventures and misadventures of finding and catching these critters around the 1920s.Fantastic Beasts' story opens promisingly with our hero Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) stepping off the ship in Gatsby-era New York in 1926, while he is there he meets with no-maj short for no-magic Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) who conveniently has the same briefcase as Newt except Newt's is filled with the many habitats of his magical beasts, and Jacob's is not then they are met by Tina short for Porpetina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) one of the members of the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America) and it is her job to investigate any unregistered wizard who comes through the city. Until a few beasts set themselves free from Newt's briefcase and a whole plethora of dark forces try to take it off him. But what could be wrong with this? Unfortunately like the first Harry Potter it has a few things wrong with it. Firstly the screenplay by first time screenwriter J.K. Rowling is a little muddled and spends too much time with trying to put on some funnier dialogue for the different characters. Secondly, the film spends too much of its time constantly building the wizarding world and the muggle world surrounding it, be that as it may it's beautiful and done well but it's not necessary.There are couple of new villains introduced one being the shrewd Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) one of the more senior members of the MACUSA who doesn't really take no for an answer as he is trying to catch Newt as he thinks he is a bad influence to the magic world. The second being Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) who could essentially be seen as the new Lord Voldemort he is an adopted child of the wizard loathing Mary Lou (Samantha Morton), who constantly makes his life miserable as she tries to take over him. Credence is a rather person who has a very strong power overtaking and it is Newt Scamander's job to find that power and put it back where it belongs, unfortunately while he tries he goes through some mass difficulty as not only is there a horrendous dark force trying to take over the world but he also has to outrun Percival Graves who doesn't much like Newt as soon as he meets him.Later, when Newt is trying to catch the beasts that have come loose each scene is dedicated to catching them but while it's done well and beautifully created by the FX team and it's nice to see this included, they tend to drag and take a while to warm up to each of them and take a while settle in trying to figure out where it is going. There are a couple of fun moments for example the no-maj Jacob being introduced to the magical habitats of his beasts, and also Newt performing a mating dance to one of the more larger beasts which isn't commonly something you would see from an Oscar winner but it is fun to see, but unfortunately other than that there isn't much going for Fantastic Beasts also there is the Thunderbird named Frank which makes a convenient pet but also manages to reduce everything that Newt has done wrong.Despite some of the scenes being dragged, the constant world building and the muddled screenplay this makes for a decent adaptation of yet another Rowling novel featuring some rather fantastical beasts ranging from very tiny to extremely large, that has some fun throughout some good CGI beasts created them with the image of the FX team it still has some magic at its heart.VERDICT: While constantly concentrating too much on the beautiful world building, this makes for a decent adaptation with some rather fantastical beasts, decent performances that still has some magic left at its heart.6/10 6 points to hufflepuff",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a wonderful trip,I don't get to go out and see the movies when they come out because of a panic disorder I have and it would just make it unwatchable but when I can get my hands on a GREAT movie like this Im rejoiced. At first I seen harry potter and doing no looking into the movie I ordered it. And man it was great the plot is vastly different then the kids harry potter and it feels more adult for us kids who grew up with watching the movies and now are adults. The acting was great tho I did kinda dislike the 1920 NYC accent. But other then that I cant complain it was a wonderful movie and one I will share with my kids some day.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Alright but not Fantastic,"I'm gonna say I've never been a fan of Harry Potter, now don't get me wrong, I've watch the films and found them entertaining. I don't hate it, but don't love either. Now I was into this after seeing the trailer.Magic scenes are effective, reminds us why we loved Harry Potter, even though this is a prequel. Eddie Redmayne does have quite a boyish charm has the wizard Newt. Dan Fogler brings some memorable moments here, has a human who gets pulled in the magic world. He and Redmayne have such a Butch and Sundance like chemistry. Alison Sudol is also quite the scene stealer, has a happy go lucky wizard. Colin Farrell really gives his all here, I really don't want to spoil anything about his character. But everybody else seems so lifeless in there roles, Katherine Waterson always looks like she's gonna cry in every scene.At least in the Harry Potter movies I've seen, all the characters had some degree of life in there performances. I think I would have liked it more if the movie was more focused on Newt and the Beasts. The Beasts in this film where more watchable also, even though they where CGI. All in all not terrible, but not Fantastic. Hard core Harry Potter fans will probably wanna see this. But I could sit through Doctor Strange a million times more then Fantastic Beasts. Does not make me eager for the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Despite what people say its actually pretty good,I was skeptical about watching it because of the reviews but if you are okay with a goofy guy as the lead and can understand why hes like that then you will love this film. The plot was a bit scattered to me the first time i watched it but then again its setting up more movies so it has to cover a lot. Despite what people said after watching it twice i completely understood what happened and can have a good idea whats coming next. Newt is by far my favorite characters in the HP universe now and idc what pottermore fanboys have to say about it. kawalski or however you spell it is an extremely funny character getting exposed to the wizard world and acted like many of us would and he portrayed the character very well. So stoked for the next installment too bad its in 2018,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
waste of time and space ... why they even made this crap ... is a ? to me,"The story is very weak, the film seems like it was thrown together overnight. The plot was very weak, though there are some elements of good comedy. This film just seems like a cash cow to piggy back off Harry potter. All of the HP films were better than this. Think people voting this film way too high. The film is basically a wizard trying to find his pets whilst a terrorist wizard looks for some lame CGI obscurus. It doesn't even explain why hes looking for it. Yeah that's the whole film. Next to no story, just throws CGI creatures at us.I would have liked to see more of a magical world and a stronger story. The main villain only had a few minutes of air time at the very start and at the end. (Probably due to the amount he charges) But I guess this was aimed at a very young audience who love CGI creatures that they've never seen in the HP universe. Like the dragon thing that increases or decreases in size to fit the space. But in the suitcase they stay very small not fitting the available space. I feel they could have made this film a lot better if they focused more on the story line. Also the teleporting gimmick is way too strong. No wizard could do this in previous Harry potter films which are much further in time in the HP universe. So wizard's got much weaker than those of 1920/30's?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What I saw left me underwhelmed,"This is basically a placeholder review, which is why I'm not rating it. I saw it on a plane and missed maybe the first half hour, so I should see that before I come to any final conclusions.The creatures are imaginative and probably look pretty cool on the big screen, and the acting is pretty good, but there doesn't seem to be much story. The movie - and this may in part be simply because of where I started watching it - seemed more an excuse to show off a bunch of crazy creatures than anything else.I'm surprised that something written by JK Rowling is so simply plotted; perhaps she needs the space of a novel to create her magic.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just Couldn't Rate Any Higher,"Every viewer has their own views of certain movies and as much as I like Sci-Fi genre, I just couldn't bring my score higher than a 6 on this movie.Was it the plot that cramped me or more so that the movie was a bit long for the actions to offset the balance? Either way, maybe it's just not my style of sci-fi movie with this type of magic or witch craft.. Some boring moments and magic for my taste.Strangely, I enjoy much of the Harry Potter stuff that hits the screens so i would say there is something quite lacking about this movie.Anyhow, view at your own curiosity. But a 6 is what I am graciously giving this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic Screenplays and How to Write Them.,"When the film opened with the WB logo along with the Harry Potter theme, I couldn't help but cross my legs in excitement. At that moment I knew I had to let go of my potter fandom in order to see where this stands as a film. And not beam whenever I hear the name Dumbledore or see a Portego Maxima being cast. And I'm glad I did because this is without a doubt, a pretty good film.JK Rowling's first screenplay exceeded my expectations. It had everything a screenplay of this kind should have. A well rounded plot, a conflict, rich characters , smart and witty dialogue. And most importantly in this case, establish and introduce a franchise. Which It did.We follow the likable protagonist Newt Scamander (A British writer and wizard) around New York, with his side-kicks Tina (An investigator for the Magical Congress) and Jacob ( A hilarious muggle), as they try and re- capture the magical creatures that have escaped Newt's briefcase and caused all sorts of trouble around the city. While Percival Graves (an Auror) Investigates an orphanage in order to solve the case of a mysterious creature targeting certain individuals in the city.The film carried the burden of having to introduce dozens of new characters, creatures and elements that are essential to the franchise. And it carried it all well thanks to the the humorous character Jacob Kowalski who gave the film a light-hearted feeling that made everything else easy to digest.The entirety of this A-list cast were superb. You kind of expect that. Redmayne's portrayal of Newt was smooth. Dan Fogler who played Jacob the muggle has definitely stood out, some might say ""stole the show"".David Yates directs this film effortlessly. There couldn't be a better choice for the wizarding world since his style works best with it. The film felt focused overall on what it wanted to deliver. There weren't many scenes or sequences that felt entirely unique though. And If there were, they were overshadowed by the overuse of CGI, which is always a necessity for films of this type.Overall this film is a unique experience that is as thrilling, suspenseful, fun and fantastic as any HP film. And it has the potential to stand out as it's own franchise that's as good, if not better.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful but cliched,"I have just finished watching the movie on Prime Video and everything is absolutely fresh in my mind right now. I had no idea what I was going in for. I didn't read the original book or watch any trailer before seeing this movie. All I had heard was that this takes place in the same universe as Harry Potter, which is why I watched it. And honestly speaking, this movie is nothing different from what I expected it would be.The problem with this movie is that it's very, very cliched. It uses those exact plot points that make an annoying movie, well, annoying. That's literally how this movie begins: Making an annoying creature do things for which the protagonist gets in trouble. This is just like how Dobby was in The Chamber of Secrets, except over there he was doing it because he had been asked to do so. The marsupial mole over here wasn't doing it for any particular reason at all, except for being cringy. If I were Newt I'd have just let him get caught and die.And then of course, Newt is unregistered. The way the movie began made it seem like Newt was a complete idiot, except that the whole point behind his character is that he's smart. He's the only one person who cares about the beasts of the magical world unlike the zoophobic wizards. Every species in this whole movie - muggles, wizards, magical creatures - everyone was unlikeable. They all did things which made me want them to get their comeuppance.The only thing that saved this movie for me was the world building. I have heard that the book is actually a guidebook for all the creatures living in their universe. So this, being an adaptation, was the only good part in the entire movie. And it was so beautiful that I enjoyed this otherwise irritating movie. I really wish that was the main focus of the movie instead of them being about fugitives running from the law and something something Ezra Miller.Another thing I really liked about this movie is the depiction of the 1920's America. All the characters looked like they belonged in that age. The ignorant, hateful behaviour of the people from that time was very well depicted, if that was intentional. The acting was great. People reacted just like how they would if the CGI was present before them in real life.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a movie that seems to be more oriented for a young audience, since they are the ones who will find it more appealing. It has cool and cute animals, funny scenes, childish storyline and overall the 90's and early 00's vibe to it. It's a one time watch for the adults, since the only good thing to offer for a mature audience is the phenomenal CGI. It won't remain as interesting if watched for a second time, which is why I'd recommend you to not ruin the experience by watching it for the second time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's fantastic in plenty of scenes, but Fantastic Beasts and where to Find Them needed more magic in it's atmosphere","""Where's my letter for Hogwarts!"" I kept thinking to myself as I sat in my seventh grade science class as I wished more interesting things were being taught. Like most twenty-somethings growing up in the early twenty-first century, I became a part of the Harry Potter phenomenon having read the books, bought a bunch of merchandise, and of course, saw the movies. Harry Potter has the distension of where I consider all the movies good. With the exception of maybe Star Wars (if you don't count the prequels) or Lord of the Rings (if you don't count the prequels), have you heard of another franchise where the entire series has been consistently good?When I left the theater after watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 2, I thought we were done with that whole world of wizards and witches. But in that short time, the Hollywood industry has made a big change where franchises can build on it's universe with new characters and different environments. If Disney can do so with their Marvel and new lineup of Star Wars movies, then Harry Potter can do the same thing. Let's see if Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them can continue to bring magic to the wizarding world.In 1926, wizard zoologist Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) has arrived in New York to study the animals in America. While walking through the streets, a money-stealing creature escapes his suitcase with Newt trying to catch him. He eventually does, but accidentally doing in front of a muggle (or no-maj as their called in the States. The muggle who escapes before his memory can be erased is Jacob Kowalski (played by Dan Folger), a WWI vet who is trying to open a bakery. Newt is captured by Tina Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterston) who reveals herself as an auror who works for the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA).He taken to MACUSA's offices where fellow auror Percival Graves (played by Colin Farrell) examines Newt's suitcase only to discover donuts; Newt had accidentally switched bags with Jacob. Newt and Tina leave to retrieve the proper suitcase only to arrive at Jacobs place too late. With several magical creatures running around New York City, Newt takes Jacob, Tina, and her sister mind reader Queenie (played by Alison Sudol) to retrieve them.I don't want to give away all the details of this highly anticipated movie, so I'll stop there. With a script by author J.K. Rowling, you'd expect Fantastic Beasts to be as strong as the previous Harry Potter movies, right? It does has great moments, but it's being juggled around in a script that's having a hard time introducing these new characters. I think part of the problem is that we don't get enough time before the action takes off to really know Newt Scamander. Eddie Redmayne is perfectly fitting for this eccentric character, though I wish he didn't mumble half of his lines. Otherwise, I thought that everyone worked great.The story of capturing the rest of these creatures while balancing along with American prejudice seems fine enough, so what's wrong? Id say that even though we do get a good look at how American wizards work in this universe, I would have liked to seen more of it. What the Harry Potter movies did was that the muggle world was only featured when it had no choice. Here, were spending it mostly in 1920's New York (which is designed really well!) which is interesting, but fans really want to see more of the wizards. I'll also say that the action seems to be bigger then before, which is also fine as this is supposed to be a more adult story.I'll give this six nifflers out of ten. It's an good but not great start in a new series. Let's hope that J.K. Rowling can show off more of how the American wizarding world works in a sequel. Fans of the book will probably be satisfied. Those that weren't fans of Harry Potter are not going to be swayed with this one. I think Newt Scamander needs to continue searching for more interesting elements in his story, even though he does has some good things to show here.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical Menagerie: The Wonders and Woes of 'Fantastic Beasts,"In the enchanting realm of cinema, where the alchemy of storytelling and visual spectacle often conjures up worlds of wonder, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" emerges as a curious creature. It is a film that, much like the magical menagerie it showcases, is both delightful and perplexing, evoking a sense of awe while leaving us yearning for the cohesive charm of its predecessors.The film, set in the bustling cityscape of 1926 New York, introduces us to Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a magizoologist with a suitcase teeming with more wonders than Pandora's box. Redmayne, with his quintessential British awkwardness, brings a certain earnestness to Newt, a character whose love for the creatures he protects is as palpable as the beasts are fantastical. His performance is the cornerstone of the film, grounding the more whimsical elements in a reality that is as tangible as it is magical.Director David Yates, a veteran of the wizarding world, weaves a tapestry rich with the lore that fans have come to adore. The film is a visual feast, with creatures that dazzle and settings that transport us straight into the heart of this expanded universe. From the ethereal beauty of the Thunderbird to the mischievous antics of the Niffler, the film's CGI inhabitants are rendered with such care that they breathe life into the silver screen.Yet, for all its visual splendor, ""Fantastic Beasts"" finds itself grappling with a narrative that, at times, feels as unwieldy as a rogue Erumpent. The plot, ambitious as it may be, juggles multiple storylines that vie for our attention, and in doing so, dilutes the potency of each. The film's pacing stumbles, caught between the urgency of dark, unfolding mysteries and the more lighthearted escapades of Newt's creatures.The supporting cast, while talented, is given a script that doesn't always play to their strengths. Katherine Waterston's Tina is a character with potential that never fully blooms on screen, and Dan Fogler's Jacob, the No-Maj caught in the whirlwind of magic, provides a touch of humor but also serves as a reminder of the narrative's disjointed feel.""Fantastic Beasts"" is at its most enchanting when it revels in the innocence of discovery, the sheer joy of exploring a new facet of a world we thought we knew. It is less successful when it attempts to shoulder the darker themes that loom over its horizon, themes that feel shoehorned into a story that wishes to remain in the light.""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a film that captures the imagination but struggles to hold it captive. It is a mosaic of wonder and confusion, a journey that is as frustrating as it is fascinating. It stands as a testament to the power of the Potterverse, yet also as a reminder that even the most magical of worlds cannot escape the pitfalls of an overambitious plot. As we close the suitcase on this chapter, we are left with the hope that future installments will find the balance that this film searches for, somewhere between the fantastic and the flawed.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Honest Review,"It's not bad, it lacks the childlike wonder that came with the Harry Potter novels and movies, but it was still a ride back into that world and one that we've all been itching for and for a fairly long time.You get a beautiful Art Deco New York between the wars and Colin Farrell fittingly doing his best Melvin Purvis impersonation, at least what would be his best if the Irish didn't keep slipping through.Eddie Redmayne was fantastic, even if he did, from time to time,look a little too much like Roger Daltrey for his own good.And then the rest of the cast, you see A-list celebrities popping up in the smallest of roles, as if the script hit Hollywood and every closeted Rowling fan dove for a little slice of the script. In a way it helps the movie, and in a way it's distracting to have Ron Perlman and Jon Voight jump up in minor roles.What is it with Perlman and heavily prosthetic roles?

Expecto Samethingicus,"I saw this movie a few nights ago and i found it enjoyable up to a certain degree. I like certain parts about it, and disliked other parts. As is tradition: Good sides first, bad sides later.Good sides:A fun new story: The story on itself was enjoyable enough. Newt Scamander arrives in New York with a briefcase full of the most outrageous and fantastic beasts known and unknown to man. But then... a few escape and he finds himself to be arrested for doing it on purpose. Dunn.. Dunn. DUUUNNNNRowling's Imagination: we are once again astounded by the fantasy that J.K. Rowling has to offer to us. The animals are as crazy and as adorable and as awesome and as cute as you can think of... and possibly even more so. It is truly fun and mind-blowing to see that she has made this world come alive and i agree with one of the muggles: ""I know i'm dreaming, because i don't have the brain to make this up.""New lands to explore: We get to see a new side to the Wizarding World that JK has created, besides just seeing Hogwarts in England. This time it is New York and how the magic society works there.Effects: The special effects and the animals that are there in the movie look truly amazing. The special Effects department did an amazing job to make everything look real.Now for the bad parts, because it does have those too.Same Things happen: I must say that despite the fun story, it was predictable. Main guy gets in trouble, the Ministry goes after him and only makes things worse. They react as you would expect. They don't trust the main character and say he is out of line when suggesting something even a little bit crazy... You live in a magic world! Nothing should be too crazy for you! We are also again confronted with problems that should not be there in the Magic World. You have an entire world in your suitcase? Why do you need a place to stay?Same humor: I'm not sure if this is to blame on JK, or on the director David Yates, but we have the exact same feeling and scenes as the last 4 Harry Potter movies. The same type of acting, the same type of emotions (or lack thereof), the same type of awkward moments. It is the same thing again. There is little new in that regard. You watch the same movie, just a different setting and story.Special Effects: It is also listed as a good thing, yet i'd also like to point out that the movie heavily relies on that. In the first few Harry Potter movies the special effects were only a part of it, not the backbone of the movie. That has changed now. The real 'magic feeling' is gone, so now the directors and producers need to make it look good for it to stay interesting.All in all i liked the first time watching, but i must say that it will take a while before i will see it again. The awkward acting and the same type of pacing is difficult to enjoy after 30 minutes of the same.There is no natural feeling to the movie. I felt like i was watching a scene-book. You don't watch an entire movie that is put together perfectly so that one scene flows over into the other. You're watching scene 1. Scene 2. Scene 3 and so on and so on.6 i can give it. a 7 is a bit too much.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the expanding world of Harry Potter,"J. K. Rowling added a new dimension to the Harry Potter universe with a story about the author of one of Harry's textbooks. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" depicts eccentric wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) in New York City in 1926. A mishap gives Newt a few unplanned adventures amid the supernatural occurrences plaguing the city. And there are a few references that should catch people's attention. Overall, from what I could tell, the movie makes a point about discrimination and witch-hunting (and the laws against wizards marrying non-wizards is probably an allusion to the infamous anti-miscegenation laws).But most importantly, it's a fun movie. As in the original series, each of the characters has something to contribute. David Yates, who directed a couple of the Harry Potter movies, does a good job here.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Standing on the shoulders of Harry Potter,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am personally a huge fan of Harry Potter, having grown up with the books and movies my whole life. I personally just think that as her first outing into screen writing, Rowling should perhaps have joined with a co-writer to smooth out some very obvious flaws that prevent this movie from being all it could have been.The first and probably most important flaw with the film is simply the story structure. As I mentioned, the screenplay would have benefited greatly from a co-writer that could have helped prevent the vast myriad of stories opened up from stepping on one anothers toes and clouding our view of the main story. The auxiliary stories that Rowling weaves into this overarching narrative of a new dark wizard (Grindelwald) simply don't work out that well. The sheer number of them (the details of which I won't spoil here, you'll have to watch for yourself) simply draws out and complicates what is essentially a plot to obtain a dangerous power and deploy it as a weapon. The main focus of the trailers and build up, the monsters and Newts' quest to recapture them, provides some fun and relief from the admittedly darker tones of the main plot. This is all that can be said about Newts escaped monsters as, although entertaining, they provide no insight into the main narrative whatsoever.A second, but still rather problematic, issue is the characters themselves and the way they are portrayed. Redmaynes' Newt Scamander can be fun at times, but equally as frustrating at others with a fairly weak performance and a tendency to mumble lines at some points. That being said he does bring a certain likability to his character which I'm sure can be exploited in further adventures. The supporting cast are generally quite forgettable with the standout performer being Dan Foglers' portrayal of Kowalski, Newts' no-maj sidekick. The romance that develops between Kowalski and Queenie is a perfect example of the stories that don't quite work out and therefore shouldn't really be in there at all.The ending as a whole left myself and many around me wanting, as I'm sure many of you will realize if and when you see it for yourself, employing a classic ""and it was all a dream"" type scenario to escape any repercussions from the dramatic final(ish) sequence. The reason I say finalish is that because of the number of stories opened up throughout the movie there is a sizable chunk of tying up loose ends to be done. During these revisiting scenes I found myself expecting the movie to end at least three times before it actually did, a further example of Rowlings' lack of experience as a screenwriter.Overall I'd say there is definitely something to work on in the future and although there are elements of inexperience in the story, it was certainly a fun experience to return to the wizarding world if only for a while. I must say that I appreciate Rowlings' attempts to reflect reality in this story with themes of animal conservation, segregation and abuse as they convey good messages of preservation of nature and unity of different people to a wide audience but that unfortunately cannot make up for what was, to me, a disappointing continuation of the mythos.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"If this is to be five films, they simply have to improve on this effort","It's been five years since we said goodbye to Harry Potter and the wizarding world in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. With the way Hollywood is now, I'm surprised it's taken Warner Bros. five years to return to one of their most lucrative properties to see if they can bleed it dry.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a film based on a textbook written by J. K. Rowling within the Harry Potter universe. The textbook is one written by Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and is pretty much an encyclopaedia of creatures that he's documented on his travels throughout the wizarding world.When Newt arrives in 1926 New York, he does so carrying a suitcase full of magical creatures. After a mix up with Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), Newt loses the case and as a result, a number of the creatures escape and run amok in New York. While trying to track down the escaped creatures, Newt must evade the clutches of Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), an Auror working for MACUSA (The Magical Congress of the United States of America), trying to protect the wizarding world from human discovery.It's definitely fun returning to the wizarding world and Rowling has written an entertaining enough story however, my problems with Fantastic Beasts lie with the fact that there is barely any introduction given to this time and setting in the wizarding world. It was something that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone did so well, laying the foundations for the rest of the series however, that was the world of Hogwarts and this an entirely new setting.We're just thrown into this story with Newt tracking down the creatures and nothing else that happens around this main story is explained very well at all. It's certainly an adventure that is fun to watch but I felt the setting needed a bit more depth, considering this is going to be a series of five films. Don't even get me started on the finale of this film, which becomes a ball of confusion thanks to an unexplained revelation and an incoherent set-piece involving a rampant black cloud (known as an Obscurus).Which leads me to the special effects on show in this film, which for the most part are very good. The majority of the creatures are well designed and brought to life through wonderful effects, even if they aren't all that fantastic. In places though the CGI looked a tad messy, particularly in the finale I've mentioned previously.Unlike the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts doesn't have the likable characters to lead the film. The performances are good enough but the characters were a little lacklustre. Newt Scamander is a pretty weak lead character for a start and Eddie Redmayne doesn't really do enough to make you like him, leaving this as a Redmayne performance somewhere between the heights of The Theory of Everything and the very low depths of Jupiter Ascending. Dan Fogler's effort as the comic relief of the film is admirable but he doesn't do much else other than make weird faces and noises.Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol play a pair of sisters who Newt meets during his time in New York but I can't help but feel Waterston is massively wasted in a very limited role, as is Colin Farrell as the mysterious Graves. Much has been made of Johnny Depp's casting announcement in this series and his appearance here leaves me fearing the worst for the rest of these films.Warner Bros. initially announced Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as the start of a new trilogy, which more recently became a pentalogy. While there is certainly enough fun to be had with this film, the films simply have to get better if they are to standalone from the Harry Potter films.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A different, original addition to the HP universe","One of the most outstanding elements of ""Fantastic Beasts"" is its originality and difference from the other HP movies, breathing fresh air into the Harry Potter movies.

A fantastic return to the Wizarding World,"This film is the perfect expansion of the Harry Potter universe. Thanks to J.K. Rowling as the screenwriter and producer, and David Yates as the director, we can enjoy a very dark, mature and humorous film. Eddie Redmayne appears to be a flawless actor that can play any role. The soundtrack is very emotional and nostalgic: in fact we can notice an inspiration from the famous Hedwig's Theme from Harry Potter. Moreover, the cinematography is fantastic and very detailed. The visual effects are stunning and perfect as well. There are a lot of connections between this film and the other films of Harry Potter, but you can enjoy the film even though you don't know Harry Potter (of course, if you are a fan of it, you'll enjoy this spin-off/prequel much more than other people).",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful re-introduction to J.K. Rowling's world of witches & wizards.,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is set seventy years before Harry Potter begins his adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Magizoologist Newt Scamander(Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York City, in the year 1926. Newt is carrying a briefcase filled with a variety of magical creatures. An unfortunate mishap causes the briefcase to open. Due to this, some of these wondrous creatures escape & are on the loose in New York City. Now, it is up to Newt to find the creatures, protect them & put them back in the briefcase, before they are harmed or cause widespread panic in the city.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a brilliant film. J.K. Rowling has written a fantastic script. What is even more amazing is that, this movie is Rowling's script writing debut. The visual effects are enchanting. The 3D is eye-popping & works in almost every scene of the movie. All the beasts in the film look incredible & match the descriptions that are given in the source material. Though I like all the Harry Potter movies better, this film holds its own & is a worthy addition to the Harry Potter franchise. I love the fact, that we find out about the American wizarding community. One minor flaw in the movie is that, the climactic set piece could have been a few minutes shorter. The highlights of the film are the titular beasts, the humor & the performances. Eddie Redmayne is spectacular as Newt. Redmayne continues to show us his versatility as an actor. Katherine Waterston is great as Tina. Dan Fogler is outstanding as Kowalski. Alison Sudol is awesome as Queenie. Redmayne, Waterston, Fogler & Sudol share this natural camaraderie, that makes it an absolute delight to watch all their scenes together. Ezra Miller is superb as Credence Barebone. Samantha Morton is good as Mary Lou. Colin Farrell is excellent as Graves. Carmen Ejogo is impressive as Seraphina Picquery. The supporting cast is effective. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a must watch for all Potterheads. I can't wait for the sequel!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well worth the admission fee! And the 8.5 IMDb rating.,Not a big Potter fan and have not bothered with the last four HP movies but this is different. A lot different.

I am sure you could find something to moan about if you were to sit around and picked holes in it but if you want to be entertained GO SEE THIS MOVIE!

"An engaging beginning, but a bit unfocused on story and characters to deserve a higher rating","Time for the awaited prequel to the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The film is set in the 20's, long before Harry Potter's time. It's about the young Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne, who arrives in New York with a suitcase full of magical creatures. Unfortunately some of them escapes and he is force to go and look for them together with the muggle (non-magic people) Jacob Kowalski and the witch, Porpentina Goldstein, before they wreak havoc all over the city. The film is the first in the Harry Potter universe that isn't based on a book but an encyclopedia of magical creatures. J.K Rowling has written the script and also decided to keep the long and complicated title, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Seriously, couldn't they have thought of something better?At first we are greeted with a lot of news articles before ending up with Newt Scamander as he passes through the gates to New York. Honestly, the film has a slow beginning. A lot of the Harry Potter films begin quite dramatically with an evil dementor, a difficult house elf or a quidditch tournament. Here it takes a while before I'm starting to feel that the film really takes a hold of me. It also makes me wonder what's it really about? Newt is chasing his animals with the company of a muggle and a witch but at the same time we also find out that the American wizard world is quite different from the English one. Apparently there is some sort of interesting cultural conflict that we never really get the answer to. Pity!After a few fat jokes, a strange mating dance and a long almost completely animated scene in a suitcase, it actually starts to happen something. The evil in the film appears more and you start to understand the conflict. Unfortunately I don't feel that this evilness or the conflict is motivated or developed enough. It lacks a clear vision and a path already from the beginning. What does Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them really want to say? Whose story is it? Newt Scamander's, the muggle who wants to bake, the USA vs England conflict or the American ministry's fear of being exposed and start a war? Also in all this, add John Voight as a political leader with a son who likes to bully boys. Very strange.Behind all these questions and strange things, there are actually a lot of things to enjoy. The director David Yates continues in the same style as before, however with much more animation. It is charming to see the American wizard society and the 20's New York look good. Also the acting raises the film with Ezra Miller as a strange boy and Colin Farrell as an evil ministry man. All in all, an okay beginning of a new series, but what the next films will be about and what characters will fit in, especially considering that it is said to be set in Europe and eventually include Dumbledore, I really can't say. As I said, an okay beginning but it could definitely have been better.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Loved it. But......,"I love Harry Potter. I've read all the books, seen all the movies, been to Alnwick but yet to visit a theme park. It seemed to me that JKR began to write by the yard with the books, and in due course the movies, becoming flabby, overblown, overlong and lacking direction. But don't get me wrong - I'm still a fan. With the advent of Fantastic Beasts came the opportunity to right a few wrongs and start afresh but no, the same problems persist, along with a few new ones. The plot of Fantastic Beasts is obscure and often difficult to fathom and retain. If the Director lacks direction, then pity the poor audience. Having read the HP books prior to seeing the movies I had some idea of what was supposed to be going on, but not in this case. JKR is rightly an icon but that's not to say that everything she does is great. And this is not great. Most of the innumerable characters add nothing but confusion to the picture and it speaks volumes that the most endearing character is a mute CGI mole-like creature. There'll probably be a spin-off. The movie is saved through it's 3D and CGI. It is fabulous. Breathtaking. Dare I say it before someone else does? -spellbinding. The best ever. But shouldn't it be more than this? I was lucky enough to have seen this in Imax 3D and thoroughly enjoyed the experience but I very much doubt that watching in a lesser format would be half as impressive. So - what's the bottom line? Is it worth seeing? The answer is a definite Yes, though not in 2D. And JKR? Still love you but please listen to your critics and do better. Please.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More of the same,"If you liked, let's say the last three Harry Potter films, you're going to enjoy this film just fine. It's cut very much from the same cloth, with excellent special effects, wizarding world oddities, unsuspecting muggles, wand-waving, all that jazz.Unfortunately it also shares a lot of flaws with those three movies. The colour palette is still pretty grim and dark, as is the general mood of the world. The characters are quirky and likable, but also rather one-dimensional or at least they don't grow a lot during the movies. The dialogue goes up and down in quality, though can be quite excellent in certain moments. And yes, dear J. K. Rowling, we get it. Bureaucracy is the root and symptom of all evil. All. Evil. Can we please move on to other subject matters because this is getting tedious.On the other hand the film does improve upon certain things. It's nice to see the American wizarding society, though as stated, it shares certain annoying similarities with the British one. All the eponymous fantastic beasts are simply fascinating and the movie broadens Rowling's world excellently. I also like that the main character Newt uses these critters in combat as well, because for some reason the makers of these films seem to think that magical combat has to consist of fast-flying coloured blobs of light. And nothing else!All this criticism aside, I cannot help but admit that I like the movie. I love the Harry Potter universe and I will see these movies however many they end up making. But that doesn't mean that I cannot point out the flaws. I love it that much.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The world of wizards is back full of new thrills and adventure,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (I will call it FBWFT from now on, because SEVEN-WORDS TITLE!), directed by David Yates and written by J.K. Rowling is the 9th film of the Harry Potter universe and the first film of the new franchise. The story takes place in New York 70 years before Harry receives his Hogwarts letter and our protagonist is Newt Scamander. He has a suitcase where he carries a lot of fantastic beasts, which will accidentally escape causing many problems in New York and set in danger the secrecy of the magic world. I don't know about the 3D experience, but what I know is that the 2D is definitely lots of fun and everyone (even people unfamiliar with the 8 Harry Potter movies) will enjoy.Rowling proves for one more time that her imagination is limitless and Yates proves that he knows well how to make it shine. Some people are concerned this is an attempt of her to make another billion. My answer to those comments is that I don't really think so, but I wouldn't care anyway! Let me explain by reviewing the movie. FBWFT does what no prequel/sequel/remake, which wants too much to succeed, ever did: It is a totally new story with no plot similarities to be found with the original movie ( the Harry Potter franchise in this case ). In contrast with the first H.P. movie, this one is more thrilling, because it dedicates less time to set up the world of the new franchise and more time to the actual story this movie wants to tell. Of course, there are some exposition-heavy scenes, but Rowling's world is just too beautiful to consider it a serious weakness. As I see, not everyone agrees on that, but I feel I nearly know anything about the American school of Magic or how American wizard community works but only a few things. What I feel I watched is Newt, Kowalski and Tina trying to protect New York from all those magic creatures wrecking havoc. That's why I don't think it's a money-grab attempt, because it doesn't feel like that. And why I wouldn't care? Because it's great, anyway! Every character is well-developed and likable for his/her own characteristics. Even Kowalski who, as a regular human, asks all those things we, the audience, need to know(exposition lever) still manages to remain likable thanks to the comic relief he offers and his not being useless as one would expect. Performances are convincing and generally great as expected from such a charismatic cast. Moving on the technical details, CGI is almost flawless and every creature is really beautiful. Same goes for cinematography and editing, which is masterfully used to create a sense of awe when needed, make the pace faster when things get dangerous or just let us enjoy wonderful images. Music score by James Newton Howard is superb and blends perfectly with every scene. (Still, no one is like John Williams, but you already knew that).Any complaints? I was a little let down, because I expected to learn more things about the American school of magic, but this doesn't really qualify as a weakness, because this was just not the story J.K. Rowling wanted to tell and the movie's marketing never implied something like that. All in all, FBWFT is a prequel, which respects its audience by paying homage at some points to the H.P. movies, but without relying on your H.P. knowledge to be enjoyable(everyone can enjoy it), with great performances, great visual effects and a great story. If you are a fantasy-fan, DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE! I still reserve the 10-stars rating for a movie that will far exceed my expectations and blow my mind, but still, no real complaints about Fantastic Beasts. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Counterargument,"This review is a shout out to all the people who complained about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (FBAWTFT).Okay people, listen up! I'm going to respond to complaints with counterarguments.A big complaint is that Eddie Redmayne (Newt Scamander) mumbles most of his lines and doesn't make eye contact enough with the other actors. I've got an answer to that: Newt Scamander is meant to be a shy, socially awkward guy. When you think about it, it makes a lot of sense that he mumbles. You've met people that mumble. And the eye contact problem? His character is supposed to be a guy who connects more with animals than with any other person. He's not exactly used to talking to people.The next complaint is that the CGI is not perfect. Does it matter? Nope. Does it still support the story? Yes. Moving on.The last complaint is that there is no plot. There's a plot. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to summarize it.

Mediocre Beasts and Where To Find Them,"It's been nearly half a decade since Pottheads got their last fix from the silver screen and for many a JK-Junkie out there, Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them was the most eagerly anticipated film of 2016. Fantastic Beasts offers an interesting mix of familiarity and new beginnings as the Potterverse welcomes back David Yeats, director of the previous 4 Harry Potter installments, and sees J.K Rowling's maiden voyage as a screenwriter. I've always been a fan of the Potter films, save for my hatred of Deathly Hallows:Part 1, and I was certainly looking forward to seeing what else Rowling had to offer but this films serves as more of an appetiser rather than a main course. Full of great effects and solid performances from Redmayne and Fogler, the film offers very little in terms of story, which, when considering this was penned by one of the most successful authors of all time, is largely disappointing. Set in a beautifully designed 1920's New York, clearly no expense was spared for the effects budget as Fantastic Beasts does exactly what it says on the tin by offering the audience a sample of some beautifully imaginative creatures. Unfortunately this is a case of style over substance as by the end of the film the beasts are playing second fiddle to a dim-witted auror (Katherine Waterston)and the American Ministry of Magic subplot. An interesting point to note is some of the darker tones that Rowling is attempting to examine this time round. Child abuse, albeit a theme in previous Potter films, and capital punishment spring to mind but there is certain, uncomfortable and perhaps perverted atmosphere between Graves (Farrell) and Credence Barebone (Miller) that I found odd. This darker tone, not too dissimilar from the later Potter films, was an intriguing element in the film and I'm interested in whether or not these will be explored in the fore-coming sequels. On a broader scale, Fantastic Beasts is similar to Warcraft(2016), by way of an underwhelming film that will no doubt produce several offspring. The film markets itself on the idea of a new story set in a familiar universe but, under it's thin layer of narrative, lies the all too familiar shell of a money-hungry franchise... But hey! that's Hollywood folks, so buy your overpriced popcorn, sit back, relax and let this wave of mediocrity wash over you",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Fun Watch!,"I procrastinated on this movie for quite a while, not knowing what to expect. I was scared that it might not be as good as the Harry Potter franchise. I'm so glad a friend asked me to watch this because this movie, although not as dark as the Harry Potter movies, was as enjoyable. The movie was an adventure. The special effects were amazing and I loved the Fantastic Beasts used in the film. The Niffler, the Demiguise, and the Bowtruckle were all adorable and so endearing! Eddie Redmayne was amazing as Newt Scamander and it felt like he was meant to play that role. Newt Scamander is an unconventional film hero. He's not big and muscled like the Marvel superheroes, nor is he an agile, street-smart hero. Instead, he is the sensitive and sweet type of person who your heart just goes out to. His bond with his animals, and also with his new friend Jacob was heart-warming. I loved how believable Redmayne was while playing the character. The supporting cast was great too and Dan Fogler was great as Jacob Kowalski, the clueless No-Maj who is forced into an epic adventure. The entire cast of characters brought something to the table and made the movie what it was: An absolute delight to watch!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Better than Potter?,"Whisper it quietly, but I might just have enjoyed this more than any of the Harry Potter series. Not that any of them were bad. The first 2 were a bit ropy but still set out the world beautifully, our first view of Diagon Alley was a wonder to behold, and they generally improved each after the other, though 3 may still be the best. But maybe the fact that this could just be a movie without beholding to the books, which the original series had to, gave this much more freedom. It was always impossible to completely be faithful to the complexity of the books story lines in the time restraints of a films runtime. Plus not knowing how it was going to turn out before even entering the cinema was a bonus. I also appreciated the fact that the wizarding world could be expanded beyond Hogwarts and its grounds, and the New York of 1920's was beautifully realised and the ways in which the magical world of America differed from that we had previously seen was cleverly done. The film is also improved by the fact that from the start it has better acting talent in the main leads as with the best will in the world the original child cast, with exception of Emma Watson and Tom Felton, were lacking a touch, though they improved a bit as time went on. This does suffer from the problems of the first couple of Potters in that it has to set up the world, and maybe tries to squeeze a bit too much in to pave the way for the sequels, and also Newts story and the forewarning of Grindelwald seem a bit squashed unnaturally together. But despite a few faults I really enjoyed this and am looking forward with impatience for the rest of the story.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Decent,"I went with somewhat lowered expectations due to some very negative reviews. However, the movie was solidly entertaining. A few reviewers said the film did not live up to its name but I found it sufficiently beastly for me. There were some comments about it leaning heavily on the Potter franchise which don't appear to be true. It does follow the HP universe with an American twist. I particularly liked the actor who played the lead, Newt Salamander. He reminded me of Matt Smith who I've been missing ever since he left Doctor Who (Capaldi just doesn't cut it, sorry). I also found the subplot with the baker/cannery worker charming. It was just what the movie needed - a bit of muggle :^). In general the actors did a very good job. Many may claim the CGI was overdone but I found the film well-paced and enjoyable. It totters a bit before it finds its feet but comes together for a satisfying finish. Production values are excellent (to my eye) and the direction is good along with the script. I suspect there will be a ready audience for a sequel if they make one.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worrying Means You Suffer Twice...,"Like most I am a big fan of the Wizarding World that J. K. Rowling created, and I love that they continue to try and make movies that expand on it. Fantastic Beasts comes with a different tone than we are accustomed to from these movies, but that makes it refreshing. It forges its own path with an entirely new cast of characters. They throw in enough familiar names to keep us engaged in what is to come in the future, but they put all of their effort into developing the new characters they want us to get to know. David Yates seems solely placed in the industry to make these movies, so he was a wise choice to take us in this new direction. I was disappointed that Steve Kloves didn't write the screenplay as in my opinion; he was the real hero behind (almost) all of the Harry Potter films. It is understandable in this instance considering Rowling decided to tackle the script herself. Eddie Redmayne was an excellent choice to portray our new hero and they surrounded him with a good supporting cast, including Dan Fogler who I always enjoy. If I had any complaint it's that the film does tend to drag and has several dead spots that made my attention wander. Not surprising when you consider they couldn't make the entire film about the Magical creatures without boring the audience. That made it important to find a great conflict so that the movie would be more successful. The sequels are much more fraught with problems and I didn't find them either as interesting as the original. That shouldn't suggest that I don't want them to keep trying to bring the Wizarding of World on to the screen as much as possible. As long as they do I will continue throwing my money at them.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
rubbish,"one of the worst movies I have seen - wasn't really a fan of the potter series but at least I could sit through them - this movie had me contemplating walking out but because I was with others I suffered through - not really any cogent story line, wooden performances, nil character development and some hooky cooky scenes that can be seen in any old casper cartoon - absolute waste of time and another movie that is just big on tricks but short on story and completely unmemorable - I feel ashamed I went to see this movie because I am now part of the problem - if we keep going to the cinemas to see rubbish like this they will keep making it - don't be weak like me - just don't go to see this crap",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pointless, Superfluous & Unwarranted, Fantastic Beasts Is Anything But Fantastic","The breathtaking mythology of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world was brought to silver screen through the collective wizardry of an epic ensemble that dazzled the hearts & minds of muggles around the world and it still remains one of the most beloved film franchises of all time. But we are living in an age where no series is ever allowed to rest in peace, and so this magical world is back again, with a spin-off that doesn't have an ounce of the original's magic.An absolutely pointless, superfluous & unwarranted return to the wizarding world, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a dull, needless & wholly redundant spin-off that nobody ever asked for and is even worse than the weakest Harry Potter film. Lacking an interesting set of characters, far too preoccupied with its beasts, and devoid of everything that made its predecessor so delightfully captivating, this subsidiary of a much superior franchise isn't worth a dime.A spin-off of the Harry Potter film series, the story of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them follows the adventures of Newt Scamander, an eccentric & introverted wizard who arrives in New York with a suitcase full of diverse, magical creatures but finds himself being chased by American wizarding authorities after his suitcase mix-up with a muggle results in several creatures escaping out in the city, thus threatening the exposure of the magical world.Directed by David Yates, there is an attempt to create its organic world from scratch but it indulges in so many trivial moments and moves at such tiresome pace that the interest fizzles out real soon. Yates' direction is substandard but the fault mainly lies with the script. Written by J.K. Rowling, the film brings its magical creatures to life in fine detail but the human characters lack sturdy arcs and have nothing to make the audience invest in their journey.Production design team does well to recreate the 1920s New York setting, and its set pieces are sumptuously decorated. Cinematography employs colour tones that impart a slightly vintage vibe to its images. The use of CGI is excessive yet the very segments they are applied to remain hollow from within. Editing is poorly carried out, for its 133 minutes runtime is severely felt plus it fails to keep the interest alive. And lastly, James Newton Howard's score is only mildly effective.The film packs a capable cast in Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller & others yet nobody leaves a lasting impression. Redmayne comes off as too eccentric in the role of Newt Scamander, Fogler plays an oafish muggle, Waterston's character isn't remotely interesting, Sudol is an overdose of sugarcoated mediocrity, Farrell at least tries to make his character stand out, while Miller contributes well with what he's given.On an overall scale, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is arguably the worst thing to come out of J.K. Rowling's imagination and is as lifeless in storytelling as it is bland in characterisation. Failing to bring anything new to the table, it is a tediously crafted, awfully written & shoddily narrated fantasy that's overlong, uninspiring & frustrating, and is lacking in originality & creativity. In short, the new era of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world is off to a highly disappointing & instantly forgettable start, and is anything but fantastic.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Derp And Where To Find Derp,"I tried to enjoy it, but I didn't find much to enjoy myself. The character who gets accidentally embroiled in the situation is the most interesting thing in this movie. I'd rather follow him than the mumbling lead.The other characters are barely memorable, plot is incredibly so-so. An extra star awarded for Johnny Depp being in something that isn't made by Tim Burton, even if his screen time in this instalment was barely a minute long.Check it out, a lot of people like it, maybe I wasn't really ready for it or had Harry Potter on my mind but for me it was simply ""meh"". Not overtly bad but not overtly good either.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Potter Film without Harry,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is essentially a Harry Potter movie without Potter. It is set in J K Rowling's ""wizarding world"", but in the New York of the 1920s, not in contemporary Britain. Despite the American setting, the main character Newt Scamander is British. He is referred to briefly in some of the Potter novels, but never actually appears in them. (Some of the Potter characters, such as Albus Dumbledore, are referred to, but do not actually appear, in this film).The late zoologist Gerald Durrell once wrote a book entitled ""A Zoo in My Luggage"". As far as I am aware Durrell did not possess any magical abilities, and his title was not to be taken absolutely literally, but Newt Scamander is a man who quite literally does have a zoo in his luggage. When you're a wizard- to be exact, a magizoologist- fitting an entire menagerie of fabulous beasts into a suitcase is easier than it sounds. The difficulty is persuading them to stay there.In 1926, Scamander arrives in New York en route to Arizona. He only intends to stay in the city for a short time, but things go awry when he loses his suitcase and several of his beasts manage to escape from it. The film then follows his adventures as he tries to recapture them with the aid of local witch Tina Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski, a ""No-Maj"" factory worker with ambitions to set up in business as a baker. (""No-Maj"", short for ""no magic"", is the American term for a person without magical abilities, what in Britain would be called a ""muggle"". The maxim that America and Britain are two nations divided by a common language holds good even in the wizarding world).As in the Potter films, the prevalent theme is that of good versus evil magic. Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne as a shy, diffident young man, bats for the good side. Voldemort does not make an appearance, but we have another malevolent wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, to bat for Team Evil. Moreover, Scamander also has to face a problem which (apart from his unpleasant aunt and uncle) never bothered Harry Potter too much, namely malevolent muggles. Despite the existence of an International Statute of Secrecy, which forbids wizards from revealing their powers to the outside world, a militant group of American No-Majs known as the ""second Salemers"" have become aware of the presence of witches and wizards in their midst and are demanding the re-enactment of the anti-witchcraft laws and of the death penalty for witches. As a result the American magical community has become increasingly paranoid about secrecy, and breaches of security are punishable by death.The film contains a certain amount of political satire at the expense of America, with parallels drawn between the wizarding world and real-life American politics. Both the ""Second Salemers"" and the more extreme factions inside MACUSA (the Magical Congress of the United States of America) seem deliberately designed to recall McCarthyism. The ban on American wizards marrying No-Majs, or even befriending or interacting socially with them, recalls the officially-sanctioned racial segregation of the ""Jim Crow"" era. A ban on magic wands is the equivalent of the Prohibition laws.Satire is never going to be cutting-edge humour when it is directed at the politics, customs and institutions of several decades ago, but the film's main appeal does not lie in its satirical barbs, or even in its plot. What makes it something out of the ordinary are J. K. Rowling's remarkable imagination, and the visual imagination displayed by the film-makers in transferring her vision to the screen. The New York we see in this film is on the one hand recognisably the New York of the 1920s which we all recognise from dozens of gangster movies and on the other hand a strange, alien steampunk fantasy world, where strange, alien things can and do happen. Scamander's beasts are a weird and wonderful set of creatures which owe more to Rowling's imagination than they do to the traditional fabulous beasts (unicorns, dragons, etc.) of legends and fairy-tales. The film was directed by David Yates, who also made several of the Potter films, and who clearly has a visual imagination to compare with a Tim Burton or a Peter Jackson. There is a lot to enjoy here for any Potter-addict deprived of their regular fixes since the main franchise came to an end with ""Deathly Hallows Part II"" in 2011.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic!!,"Yesterday I went to the local cinema to watch Fantastic Beasts with huge expectations and pure excitement and anticipation. I left the cinema with a huge smile on my face. I loved it. Of course it doesn't totally give you that amazing feeling of being sucked into the magical world of Harry Potter that the HP books(and at some extent the HP movies) give you, but then again, nothing ever will. The HP series are irreplaceable. Still you discover so much about the Wizarding World, and you really feel you are inside that magical Universe. The casting and acting was beyond perfection. I loved Newt's character and the way Eddie portrayed him. I laughed, I felt like crying, I felt suspense, I gaped at the numerous plot twists. It had everything a good movie needs to have. The effects were superb. The writing was as amazing as J.K. Rowling is. Now I know that as a die-hard Potterhead I could be a little biased but that also set my expectations really high. Fantastic Beasts totally lived up to them. This movie lays the groundwork for the whole series and it is certainly going to be an epic journey. If you still haven't watched it, to ""Muggles(No-Majs)"" I say: it is a movie worth watching. To Potterheads I say: What the hell are you still doing here? Grab your wands and enter the Wizarding World once more!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the more decent spin-offs,"This review does not contain spoilers. The character of Newt Scamander is one that which casts a humongous shadow on our beloved Potter-verse. His book was first mentioned in the first Harry Potter book and his character has developed over time through fan-fiction that has both been discarded and approved by Jo.The casting of Eddie Redmayne was one of the most apt castings by this team yet as he brings a certain British flair of clumsiness that is somewhat contrasting to the gray and monotonous NYC setting. But the biggest flaw is that in the setting of the MACUSA in NYC is somewhat inferior to the British Ministry of Magic. The real surprise performance of the movie is that of Ezra Miller, a self declared Potterhead, who dives into the character and emerges victorious.The comic elements to the story lighten up this universe and give a touch of real human emotions to a WB movie. The comedy, however, is not over bearing as the characters are well aware of the imminent dangers that lie ahead. The characterization of Newt, gives us an understanding of what our very own Hagrid would have been if he was of complete human descent. The visual effects are beautiful, and the emotions are well played by both, the plot-line and the actors.All-in-all, its a must watch, and serves as a reminder to those that said that the potter-verse depended on characters like Dumbledore, Harry, Malfoy, Ron, Hermione or Snape.Jo has captured our attention yet again with a simple swish and a flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" can be enjoyed by wizards and muggles alike.","Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person in the English-speaking world (or beyond) who has never read a Harry Potter book or seen a Harry Potter movie. I have nothing personal against the little wizard. It's just that his story never interested me until now. I'm not much of a reader (considering movies to be a more efficient use of the time that I have available for entertainment) and the film franchise ended before I started regularly writing movie reviews. But, in 2016, as a published reviewer, I felt that it was my responsibility to see ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" (PG-13, 2:13) – and to do so with an open mind, as I try to do with all the movies that I see and review. On all counts, I'm glad I did my duty.What does this movie have to do with Harry Potter's story, you ask. Well, I'm just an ordinary muggle, but I have done my research, so please allow me to take a crack at answering your question: ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is one of the titles on the mandatory reading list for first year students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when 11-year-old Harry Potter first began attending. The then classic textbook was ostensibly written by someone named Newt Scamander. In our non-magical world, such a tome appeared on book shelves in 2001. The book announced the same Newt Scamander as its author, but was, of course, written by Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling (with the profits going to the charity Comic Relief). In 2013, Rowling struck a deal to adapt her book into a screenplay (her first foray into screen writing) and co-produce this, the first film in a planned 5-part series. And here we are.In 1926 (which Harry Potter fans may know, is the year before the aforementioned textbook was published), Newt Scamander (Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne) is finishing his globe-trotting research for what will become his Hogwarts-approved text. Before he heads home to the British Isles, however, he stops in New York on his way to Arizona, where he plans to release a Thunderbird named Frank in his natural habitat. Newt is carrying a suitcase which would probably qualify as a modern-day carry-on, but through magical means, contains a number of strange creatures – in a whole fantastical magical world. Unfortunately (for Newt, that is, but fortunate for us Movie Fans), Newt's stopover in New York quickly turns chaotic. He is being spied on by Porpentina ""Tina"" Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), a former Auror (security official) who is working for (but fallen somewhat out of favor with) the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA). Newt is being confronted by an anti-magic street preacher named Mary Lou Barebone (Oscar nominee Samantha Morton) when one of Newt's creatures (a cute platypus-looking, coin and jewelry-loving ""niffler"") escapes from Newt's case and runs into a bank.As he uses his wizardry to retrieve his niffler, Newt becomes entangled with a hapless wannabe baker named Jacob Kowalski (comedian and voice actor Dan Fogler). Before Newt can obliviate Jacob (erase from his memory the magic he has witnessed), Jacob runs off after accidentally switching his case of pastries with Newt's case, with its plethora of magical creatures. (Can I get an ""uh-oh""!) Tina tries to use the situation to get back into the good graces of MACUSA and its no-nonsense President Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo), but they both are quickly distracted by the magical havoc being wreaked in New York City. Naturally, when Jacob opens ""his"" case, Newt's creatures escape, which forces Newt both to save and partner with Jacob and also soon involving Tina and her younger sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol), who can read minds and who becomes quite smitten with Jacob. Meanwhile, Henry Shaw (Oscar winner Jon Voight), the father of an ambitious young U.S. Senator, and the mysterious and morally questionable Mary Lou and her troubled adopted son, Credence (Ezra Miller) get caught up in this whole mess in some very dramatic ways, as does MACUSA Auror Percival Graves (Oscar nominee Colin Farrell), who was already investigating a destructive magical entity in NYC and has questionable motives himself.""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a delightful and creative journey into a world which a boy wizard and a muggle (or a ""no-maj"", which is the American equivalent) would likely find equally fascinating. The story may be tough to follow for those who are new to the Harry Potter universe, but reading non-spoiler summaries like the one above should help. Either way, it's a lot of fun to take it all in and learn as you go. The story has a lot going on, but Rowling and director David Yates (he of the last four Harry Potter films) weave the various plot threads together wonderfully and include some nice ""Easter Eggs"" for the many Harry Potter fans who will be watching. The casting is excellent (and in one late reveal, thrillingly startling), but Redmayne's portrayal of Newt as a bumbler is a bit distracting and Waterson's Tina is a little inconsistent. The visual effects are very good (and worth seeing in 3D), but feel somewhat overused. All in all, however, this movie is an entertaining excursion and a great introduction to those of us who were heretofore unfamiliar with the imaginative worlds created by J.K. Rowling.

"Newt Scamander deserved a book, before the movie","I should start by saying that this was probably one of the most awaited movies of the year for me. So pardon me if i had set too high an expectation. What awaited me was an entertainer with quite a few amazing moments, plugged into a magical journey.Five Reasons to watch :A glimpse into the Magical World of Harry Potter. The fans love this world unconditionally and those who aren't fans are ever so curious about whats around the corner. This movie has subtle hints to Harry Potter if you are looking for it – an occasional mention of Hogwarts and Dumbledore, a Gryffindor scarf etc bring the familiar world back to us.This movie is guaranteed to bring a smile on your face. The animation and the colors makes the movie surreal. The vibrant blues and golds bring the imaginary creatures to life and there are moments one wishes they were real.The graphics around the Obscurus was unnerving and was Scary without being gross, I would say they nailed a difficult scene perfectly. I can list the creatures and their beauty all day and I am sure they are going to live in my mind for a long time to comeMr.Farrell's acting has me convinced that he is a wizard. Such is the flair with which he has performed this role. Miller on the other hand had a difficult role to play and has done justice to the short role. Dan Fogler brings a breathe of fresh air into an otherwise grim movie. Eddie Redmayne had a hesitant\curious\shy character and I am not entirely sure why. Much as I loved seeing him, his character could have had better dimension.A glimpse of New York from the past.This has been done in multiple movies before but not with the imagination of JK Rowling. The life of NoMajs(Muggles) has an old world charm and appeal. The bakery scene almost made me want to jump out of the seat and get into the screen just to smell the freshness of a newly baked bread that they were picturing.Meet the Pre-Voldemort Baddie. Fables come to life as we have a glimpse of a not-so- mad and ever-so-sensible Grindlewald. Where it could have scored better:Newt Scamander deserves a book, before the movie. JK Rowling should have explained to us why he is the way he is. I have often been at a loss of words on why people think that every single thing needs to be 'Americanized'. The heavy British accent that shouted out 'Hogwarts!!' was missing from the word go as FB (Fantastic Beasts) is based out of New York. Unlike their present day counterparts, New York City is painted out to be a dull, boring, slightly OCD'd world from both the No-Maj (Yeah, Americans like to rename everything, even if we Muggles do not mind being called muggles) and wizarding world point of view. There were so many situations that warranted a better explanation, unless you are absolutely thorough on your knowledge of the Harry Potter World. 'The Flash', was a pretty odd choice for an odd character.A movie that could have been a lot better had there been a proper JK Rowling book that preceded it and yet, something the HP fan in me would never have missed for anything !!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The answer is: in the suitcase.,"The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.Maintaining David Yates as director lends a consistency to the project, and yet, it could have been refreshing to get a completely new take on J.K. Rowling's world with this series. In this new instalment, Jacob is clearly meant as our way into this magical new world. Dan Fogler as Kowalski, this normal no-maj' or muggle who gets caught up in all this, is the audience character and comic relief of the movie.He is all of us, he is the guy who is constantly like ""Hey what's going on?!"" and they explain things to him but they are actually explaining them to us. Dan Fogler is so good, he never gets annoying and he never feels like a side-kick either, for that I was very happy he was in this film. Moreover, by the end of the movie, he also becomes one of the most important emotional core of the movie as his romantic relationship subplot with Queenie is by far the film's most charming detail.Unsurprisingly, Fantastic Beasts amplify both the strength and weaknesses of Rowling's storytelling approach - a cliffhanger-oriented tactic that works well in novels but feels less elegant on screen. Nonetheless, David Yates is a director that understands this world. He is building great set action sequences as well as several slower paced scenes and are not overly relying on our knowledge or love of the Harry Potter universe. The major problem with this movie is that the visual panache comes with a whole lot of plots. In fact, the film has some structural problems and really feels like two movies. On the one hand, you have the beasts plot and on the other hand, the chasing going on with the Obscuro and Grindelwald plot. Finally, this film has Harry Potter-esque magic but the world itself is the muggle world. I'm addressing this point because I believe that the magic in this film is the most awe-inspiring where it shouldn't have been the most magical. Magic is in the details.Overall, I did enjoy this film but it feels too much like a setup movie for future instalments of the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Slightly disappointed, but still an okay prequel.","I felt like the movie started slow and to be honest I missed a proper introduction to the character, something that was done right in the first Harry Potter-film, despite that there was certainly the feeling of the 'Harry Potter'-universe. I did hope for the return of some old characters, mainly Albus Dumbledore (which would be played by a younger actor, and Michael could play as his father) and key locations like Hogwarts. Perhaps I'm still stuck with too much hope for another Harry Potter movie, but they were things I had hoped for.To be really honest, I felt slightly disappointed even though the movie certainly brought back the feeling of the 'Harry Potter' universe.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Solid but still doesn't match potential,"""Fantastic beasts and where to find them"" was, for the most part, a fantastic experience indeed. Bright, colorful, with the magical world probably more fleshed out than in any previous Harry Potter movies. Probably the best film about HP universe since ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". They really had to deviate from boring Harry (sorry Daniel) and his repetitive confrontations with Voldemort to make the story shine again. Instead of Voldemort we have Grindelwald now. Luckily Johnny Depp didn't lose any charms since his Mad Hatter and Jack Sparrow roles. He is a persuasive antagonist and I am very excited to see him more in future movies. But J.K. Rowling proved us on numerous times (with the first 3 books) that she doesn't need any concrete villain to make the story worth to be told. With Grindelwald having only a cameo appearance, there is still barely a scene in the movie which will make you stay bored. The last battle is spectacular – luckily much better than average Harry Potter and Voldermort fight scenes in the eights movie. Plot holes are present but forgivable.My only concern is as always: yes, David Yates is still directing the movies. I don't know why producers keep calling him but he certainly does NOT know how to make a good fantasy movie. He neither feels ""Harry Potter"" nor can add life to the story and make it special. He is not a bad movie director but not a particular talented one as well. Fantasy is just not his genre and his limited directory skills prevented this movie (and all 4 previous ones he directed) from becoming something truly special. We have a talented story told by not quite talented storyteller. But the truth is – spectacular world created by J.K. Rowling deserves so much more. Given that, we stay with enjoyable but unfortunately easily forgettable picture. We have all technical elements (graphics, special effects, plot, acting) on a superb level. But bad directing prevents it all from tying together into something which could ultimately become a new benchmark for any new upcoming movie in fantasy genre.I cannot help but to remember recent ""Miss Peregrine's peculiar children"" by Tim Burton. Without any explosions and significant special effects, Tim Burton once again made me believe that magic is real over and over again with every single scene. Not sure what cocktail we would have with mixing Tim Burton (who can also make disappointing movies sometimes - Alice in Wonderland, Mars attacks) and Harry Potter universe, but I do think that director of ""Miss Peregrine"", ""Big Fish"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" could add charm, magic and heart to ""Fantastic Beast"" movies – something that this movie lacks.Despite of another fail from David Yates, pretty much the whole team making this movie did a great job. Special thanks to J.K. Rowling for a wonderful script.Solid 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Two Stories that Barely Connect,"When news of a new franchise set in the Harry Potter universe surfaced, I have to admit I was underwhelmed. Like anyone else, I craved more Harry Potter movies (or at least movies set in that universe). I felt that there was still so much to explore in J.K. Rowling's world. That said, one of my least favourite actors in an Americanised wizarding world chasing down creatures accidentally set free was not my idea of something that needed to be explored. I wouldn't say I had zero interest, but I certainly wasn't hyped for it. But as the release date started to near, new details started to appear. The one that intrigued me most was the presence of Gellert Grindelwald, who was undoubtedly one of the most short-changed characters in the last couple of Harry Potter movies. Now this was some history that I could get behind. This is more like what I wanted for a Harry Potter spin-off franchise.This is, unfortunately, where my biggest problem with Fantastic Beasts lies. How do you connect the story of Newt Scamander finishing up his famous textbook on magical beasts with the reign of Voldemort's predecessor? The answer is you don't. Fantastic Beasts felt like a movie with two unconnected narratives that are strenuously linked by coincidence and right-place-right-time. I went in apprehensive of how important the Grindelwald plot line would actually be, but the opening scene gave me a glimmer of hope that he would be instrumental. By the time the credits rolled, it was apparent that he's included for little more than reference and franchise building in future sequels. In truth, that's all Fantastic Beasts really is, at least narratively. It's an introduction to a larger tapestry. It gets us accustomed to all the major players, embroils them in a scatty, underdeveloped story, and then pretty much says '...until next time'.But what about the world building? I'll admit that with the initial announcement, the only thing that particularly intrigued me was the exploration of the American wizarding world; seeing how this hidden society acted and behaved across the pond, nearly a century ago. In this respect I felt a little disappointed as we don't really get a whole lot in this department. It's a two hour movie that has to squeeze in introductions, Scamander's escaped beasts, Grindelwald references, and a plot about a suppressed young wizard, leaving little room for any kind of look into this new world. We see the MACUSA headquarters, and a shady little club run by a goblin gangster, and we get some exposition about the relationship between witches and wizards, and nomaj's (American muggles), but we get little more than a brief mention of Ilvermorny, the American school of wizarding, and the supposed references to Native American culture were so small and insignificant that I must've completely missed them.What we do get though is an intimate look at some fantastic beasts. This is the film's biggest strength, and probably rightly so considering it's title. While only a handful actually escape, and each are rounded up surprisingly easily and quickly, we do get a look inside Scamander's briefcase (which is basically a wildlife preserve version of the TARDIS) and all of the other creatures he keeps in there. The sheer amount of creativity and imagination put into the creation of these creatures is nothing short of staggering. As Kowalski remarks ""I can't be dreaming. There's no way I'm smart enough to imagine all of this."" There's an invisible primate that can see potential immediate futures, bird-snakes that grow and shrink to fill their surroundings, a rhinoceros-type creature that injects magma from it's horn, and the star of the show is a little marsupial whose pouch can house an infinite amount of shiny things.Finally the acting and character work. Eddie Redmayne, as much as I dislike him, was at least tolerable doing his best Eleventh Doctor impression. He was clumsy and a bit haphazard, but remarkably likable, and certainly knew what he was talking about. Dan Fogler was pretty great with his wide-eyed expressions at almost everything, and hogged the movie's most emotional moments. He's undoubtedly the stand-in character for the audience to latch onto as we're introduced to new beasts and thrust through this world that we're not readily equipped for. Alison Sudol is quite entertaining as the mind-reading, flirtatious Queenie, but her sister, played by Katherine Waterston, I just found annoying. Tina is meant to be an ex-auror, but I did not, at any point, believe she could hold any kind of authority or power over anyone, let alone magical criminals.For Fantastic Beasts itself, it's splintered, unconnected narratives will surely get tied together a little more in later instalments, but for now it just felt a bit like throwing things at the wall and seeing what stuck. While the menagerie of beasts befitting of their title was certainly entertaining, and I'd love to see more of them, I felt Fantastic Beasts just lacked a little bit of the magic that made the Potter franchise so solid. We'll see where the franchise takes us, because I feel it's a little hard to judge one fifth of the sprawling narrative we're yet to see. I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and enjoyable 7/10.http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic World-Building and How To Let It Down,"There's some really good world-building in this film. America in the 1920's? Absolutely brilliant what is done with it. It feels like a very organic extension of the Harry Potter universe; like it has always been this way and we are peeking back in time in a fictional universe (and not like a different universe altogether, or just shameless fandom branding).However the plot leaves a lot to be desired. The ""Fantastic Beasts"" wrapper doesn't wind up nearly as exciting as the world around it. It's a very basic fetch quest type story that merely serves to introduce new characters and places and things; it also serves to dumb-down and grind the interesting stuff to a halt. The action scenes aren't great -- choppy, bad CGI, mindlessness (though not the mating dance which was a real delight) -- they go on a tad too long and don't add much overall.Rowling clearly knows what she's doing, yet for some reason resorted to a paint-by-numbers plot to get her points across. Maybe it was studio interference (albeit only for the first film, to re-introduce things in a simple way) or maybe all the good stuff is being saved for later (ugh, world-building).Sorcerer's Stone used a fairly simple plot to build a world, yet it felt like an organic extension of what we were seeing and how it was being shaped and presented to us. Here it feels cheap, unfinished and of two disparate ideas.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deeply disappointing.,"It is difficult to include spoilers, which presume a plot. There is no proper plot, just a series of loosely connected episodes. There are far too many noisy special effects at contrast with the quiet subtlety of such items in Potter as 'Fluffy' or Quiddiitch. What was even worse was the acting. There wasn't any except for Johnny Depp''s small moment at the end and Eddie Redmayne's ever pleasant charm. But it is Eddie who is charming us, not some unconvincing character called Newt Scamander. If there is to be a series of Newt Scamander films, PLEASE spend the money on the cast and not the effects and PLEASE return to the humanity which were hallmark of the Harry Potter books and also a fundamental reason for their greatly deserved success.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magic Dr Who vs Arcane MiB,"Written by Mrs Rowling, an author as successful as she is unimaginative, i.e., tremendously, this film happens in a city where wizards form a society of bureaucrats and Gestapo agents. Despite truly immense powers, they fear the non-magical, inferior race and hide from you mere humans, instead of teaching you and making babies with you. Anyway, I'm not sure how this works but I digress: the point is, the movie is full of Men in Black chasing illegal aliens throughout New York and lackadaisically wiping people's memories.Here lands an odd but friendly British wizard with awkward manners and a luggage much bigger on the inside. He soon finds a companion and on they go travel-ling through time... no, I'm kidding... through New York, chasing harmless but troublesome creatures. Still, the protagonist is so reminiscent of the Doctor that it could explain why I rather enjoyed most of the film.I really enjoyed the 4 main characters actually, the good guys; it's all fluff, well played and entertaining running and flirting. For the rest, well, it's not as if the writer plagiarised well known series so as to save her energy for other aspects of her craft: events more predictable than they come, dull villains, loose ends, amateur climax, endless epilogues... At the 2/3rd mark, the Beasts start to outstay their welcome.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Potter will Never End,"The Harry Potter-based films are going to become a group of movies very similar to what Star Wars has become: movies based and written for the world that was created by genius writers. Fantastic Beasts is the first of many to come, no doubt, where movie after movie will be created with some sort of link to a part of the bigger picture. Rowling has hit the jackpot, no doubt, and she's not done yet.This film is brilliantly directed, pulling on every emotion of the viewer (love, humor, evil, you name it), and keeps the film in a more dark and somber feel rather, similar to the final Harry Potter film, which I believe any Potter fan really appreciates. The films are not meant to be lighthearted, but meant to show true distinction between good and evil. It adds the perfect amount of comedic relief as well, which Potter movies are going to be so good at in the future, based on how well they were able to do so in this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as immersive as the Harry Potter films,"The beasts truly are fantastic in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Did J.K. Rowling outdo herself as the writer? Yes and no. She does introduce several new exciting elements of the famed wizarding world, and yet the plot in this particular film is quite disappointing. The trailer and the very title of the film are misleading - but, if one goes with an open mind and does not expect beasts let loose all over, beasts found and beasts to the rescue, one may rather enjoy the film. Of course there's ""some"" beasts let loose, beasts found and beasts to the rescue in the film, however, the larger part of the film entails something more ominous. Moreover, this film has merely set the scene for what seem to be more interesting sequels.Plot - 6/10Ever since David Yates took over the Harry Potter series, it has become darker in comparison to Chris Columbus' first two parts. Well, in his defence, the kids grew up to face more dangerous enemies, setting a dark tone for the story itself. Anywho... In Fantastic Beasts (and...), the events happen too fast as everybody is trying to save New York city, and hence does not make an immersive experience unlike the other Harry Potter films. In fact, this one is better than none of the Harry Potter films. Yet, Yates has done a fantastic job in directing this film and I look forward to watching the next four parts(!) in the series.Direction - 8/10Eddie Redmayne is brilliant as Newt Scamander, and you can't help but fall in love with Newt - he's eccentric in an adorable way. The rest of the cast are great too, and the cameo appearance of one ""big star"" makes for a really good scene.Cast - 9/10 Acting - 8/10 Cinematography - 10/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful, Magic and well acting!","Yesterday I've seen "" Fantastic Beasts and where to find them "" at the cinema. I loved it! Of course before the movie started I thought that It could have been a real disaster, but at the half of the movie I changed my mind. The movie is well directed, visual effects were wonderful, and the fantastic beasts are very cute and well realized. J.k. Rowling wrote a good screenplay even if it was the first time. Eddie Redmayne portrayed Newt Scamander in a wonderful way,but was Waterston's performance which captures the attention! It was stunning, Waterston showed her character's desire of justice and her fragility wonderfully, Ezra Miller and Colin Farrell also gave a fantastic performances. At the end I can say that "" Fantastic Beasts and where to find them "" is a very good movie and I know that the following movies will be more beautiful than the first.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
From Jk Rowling's wizarding world,"Back in 2011 when the epic Harry Potter saga ended I was simultaneously sad and happy; sad because my favorite franchise had ended and happy because it ended in such a beautiful way that tears came down. So you can believe my excitement for this was through the roof, and while I enjoyed Fantastic Beasts I found it to be somewhat overhyped. By no means is the film bad per sa, but the film lacks the magic that the original Harry Potter films had.First off, the acting here is spectacular. It's easily the best part of the film as were introduced into one of the finest creations of J.K. Rowling's mind, Newt Scamander. Eddie Redmayne is excellent and charismatic as the titular character is awesome to watch and he truly gives off this weird and somewhat socially awkward fella who needs his creatures. Katherine Waterston is very groovy (see what I did there) and plays along side Redmayne very well. The characters of Queenie and Kowalski are both good comedic reliefs and have great chemistry, not only with each other, but the entire cast.Directed by David Yates, he once again finds himself in the ""Wizarding World"" and while he does a fine job I would've liked to see someone new take their hand in this franchise. I do have to say that the score in the film brings me back to the early Potter films so bravo to the team for that. While the film itself looks good and has some great effects it suffered from an overwhelming and abundance of CGI. I was really really hoping it wouldn't be, but the sad truth is the CGI takes away from the beauty of some scenes and takes you out of the film as a whole completely.My real complaints of the film come from its villains. Colin Farrell is severely underused which is a shame as he is so good in the film andAlso Ezra Miller's performance is pretty bad. I get what they were going for but in the end it didn't work at all. The film may have its ups and downs, but overall Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a wonderful expansion of J.K. Rowling's ""Wizarding World"" that strives off its fun and light-heartedness and it's great performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them,"Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them is a prequel of the Harry Potter films. Both written by J.K. Rowling, this movie is the first screen play she has written. The story takes place in New York 1926. A wizard named Newt,has traveled the world acquiring various magical creatures (fantastic beasts). Unfortunately upon his arrival, there is a mysterious creature causing havoc among the nonmaj(moguls, non-magical people), so they blame it on him since he is an unknown, mysterious wizard to them. In addition he misplaces his magical case and his creatures escape. He then has to retrieve them , and clear his own name.This movie was great. The graphics were amazing really accommodated to the Harry Potter franchise. It also expands on the wizarding world in general. I can see this having many sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A solid entrance back to the Wizarding World, that packs it's share of action, but has a slower plot than it;s predecessors","'Fantastic Beasts and where to Find Them', gives viewers the opportunity to enter back into the wizrading world, that captured viewers hearts through the 'Harry Potter' series. In this movie, JK Rowling(author of the Harry Potter series) adds a more personalized touch to the movie, as she herself was the writer for the movie. Alongside that, David Yates took up the directing spot for the movie. Harry potter fans will know him, as Yates directed the last 4 Harry Potter films. Choosing Yates as director was quite interesting, in the sense that the Harry Potter films he directed had a more darker tone to them, and in this film, Yates kept up the same fashion. The film follows the story of Newt Scamander, a British wizard, who comes to New York, USA, for personal business. The story takes place 70 years before Harry Potter was born, so the fashion and vocabulary used by the characters is based off that time period quite well.Acting wise, Eddie Redmayne(The Theory of Everything) played the role of Newt Scamander quite well, as he provides a good share of innocence and charm to the character. The supporting acting in the movie was quite well done, as Dan Folger, Katherine Waterston, and Samantha Morton all provided entertaining acting performances. 2 of the more interesting castings, were Collin Ferrel, and Ezra Miller. Ferrel provided a solid veteran touch, and added a good deal of seriousness into the movie. Ezra Miller, who viewers may recall from the upcoming 'Flash' Movie, showed how well he could play an emotional character, but did not get enough screen time that the he deserved, as his character was not well developed. In conclusion, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them opens up the gates to the Wizarding world, and does not fail to show viewers just how interesting the magical world is. The plot does move rather slowly, and some elements are not developed clearly, but the acting and charm the movie provides somewhat covers up for that. JK Rowling herself, stated that this film was the first in what will be a 5 part movie series, and the film served as solid introduction to another series into the Wzarding world.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
boring and creepy,"I had high hopes for this movie. I was excited to go! However, the plot was painfully boring. The CGI looked incredibly fake. And the whole subplot was just plain creepy. I was so disappointed. It was immediately obvious who was the bad guy and there were definitely some bizarre interactions between characters. Honestly, you don't really love or hate any character in the movie, even though, from the first minute, you really, REALLY want to like one of them. There was nothing that felt really magical about this. It was just bland and boring. If you are seeking another magical movie from the Harry Potter franchise, this is not that. You might love it, but if you are truly honest with yourself, I'd doubt it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A cozy new story in a slightly olden period of the wizarding world.,"I was in such a trepidation about what this is about that I actually read the book by the same name first! Newt Scamander didn't come across to me as the daredevil he was cast as in the movie in that book but it is a compelling tale nevertheless. There are the same old themes of racism and the 'greater good'. You hear something about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and your hopes rise. I would say this film doesn't disappoint. Newt's character is cast spot on, and the other cast members gel well too. The special effects are amazing, and the magical creatures are breathtaking.Overall, a cozy story in a slightly olden period of the wizarding world.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fanciful Magic and Can We Find It?,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them started as a charming if verbose act of whimsy on the part of ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling. The fictitious textbook was first featured in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" before years of grassroots Harry Potter fervor made the wordy title optimal merchandising fodder. Now the title has morphed into a narrative film about the wizard who wrote the book. A film whose title should have been ""Fanciful Magic and Can We Find It?""We first meet our author Newt Scamander (Redmayne) on a ship, sailing into New York harbor. He carries with him at all times, a brown briefcase that hides an entire zoo of magical creatures, one of which he plans to release in the great frontier of Arizona. Before he can even leave New York City however, Newt's creatures are inadvertently let loose upon the muggle community of America and the wizarding world struggling to keep themselves secret. It is then up to Newt and his new American friends, magic bureaucracy functionary Tina (Waterston) and bumbling No-Maj (non-wizard) Jacob Kowalski (Fogler) to find them before they're used as scapegoats for something far more sinister.Taken from a chockablock collection of 85 creatures, J.K. Rowling (who wrote the screenplay) turns in an extended universe that is just as thick a muggle textbook. Within a half-hour, the audience is inundated with intricate plot mechanics that clunk and veer wildly from one whimsical set piece to another; flying by the seat of our pants until we're finally given time to breathe. We're then treated to a thicket of intrigue largely plotted with due seriousness by No- Maj zealots Mary Lou Barebone (Morton), her brood of adopted children, and their tenuous connection to Magical Congress brass Auror Graves (Farrell).Newt's zany exploits fit these staid, sullen moments about as comfortably as a Hogwarts freshman at a Game of Thrones (2011- Present) season finale. You're never quite sure where the film wants to go, and it seems to take an arrogant delight in setting up plot point after meticulous plot point. But could we please settle on a mood or stakes that don't change with the weather?With a reported 5 more films to follow, Eddie Redmayne's Newt are some pretty scrawny shoulders to cloak a franchise on. In any other movie, Redmayne's uncanny ability to develop pigeon-toed introverts into characters we aspire to be would have been greatly appreciated. Unfortunately Fantastic Beasts crams the Magizoologist into an overloaded story that can't decide if it loves itself more for being unnecessarily convoluted or weaving in trough-loads of fan service. What is clear is character is largely secondary; a message made painfully clear when we finally learn why everyone in the American magic community seems to be upset with Tina for some reason.If any non-beast character leaves this movie with their head held high it's Dan Fogler's Jacob. He's pretty much around to take all the magic in and be told things everyone but he and the audience should already know. Yet when the movie abandons this ploy for a late, second-act romance between him and Tina's bewitching sister Queenie (Sudol), he rightfully takes his place as the Ron Weasley of this re-purposed franchise.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them may just be the first movie ever based on a charity campaign. 80% of the cover price of the original book went to poor children the world over through Comic Relief. Yet despite good intentions, Fantastic Beasts the movie winds up feeling more like a charity case. Who knows perhaps the companion book ""Quidditch Through the Ages"" will bring the magic back on the big screen. For now we'll just have to settle for this swaggering and splashy fiasco.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but not great","We travel once again into the magical world of Harry Potter, several decades before the rise of You-Know-Who and the birth of The Boy Who Lived, by following the misadventures of Newt Scamander in America and discovering his Fantastic Beasts. In this misadventure we get a treat of a film that is a decent follow up to the masterpiece of its predecessor but stumbles a little on the execution.The biggest fault of the film is the story, or at least specific parts of it. The film is a little too obvious with its foreshadowing and setup, which distracts from the rest of the film. The entire subplot with the ""exposure of the magical world"" and the involvement of the ""Magical Congress of the United States of America"" (or ""MACUSA"") is interesting, but ultimately unnecessary for the movie until the sequels come out. When the film focuses on the Fantastic Beasts and Newt Scamander themselves, it shines, only to be rusted by the political overtones and the unneeded dark magic involved.The characters are all fun and very distinct. They all have very unique looks and actions to them that makes them memorable and likable. The distinctions come to a disadvantage, however. The roles of each character is so obviously cliché that, if it weren't for the decent acting chops of all involved and the additional character tidbits added in, it would be rather painful. Newt is obviously the hero, Kowalski is obviously the comic relief, Tina is obviously the heroic girl and so on.The effects are a little questionable. It's easy to make out a lot of the CGI, and the filmmakers would have done well to use more practical effects. Especially for creatures that were on screen for a long time. For a movie that's based around them, that's a pretty big flaw.The movie is good, but it could have been much better. If they cut out the subplots and add in more practical effects, we could have had the Magical World equivalent of Jurassic Park. Instead we get an enjoyable movie that is bogged down by stories that are obviously meant to set up future sequels.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For Potter & Rowling Fans,"Confession. I'm not a fan of Harry Potter nor J K Rowling works. Except for Prisoner of Azkaban, I didn't enjoy any Harry Potter film. And, I felt the Deathly Hallow films were outright boring.So I went to watch Fantastic Beast with low expectations. And at the end, I was very happy and pleased with what I saw in those 2 hours.Fantastic Beasts can be seen either as a fantasy film or as a mystery of incidents happening in New York leading to murders and destruction. And in all of this, we have a mysterious young man entering New York with one suitcase of secrets who becomes an unlikely hero.Newt, a Hogwarts Alumni and known to Dumbledore is beautifully played by Redmayne. He is shy, soft spoken and always in some sort of trouble. Yet his confidence and love for his animals saves him somehow. His is the most well written bit in the movie.He shares some nice chemistry with his other male lead i.e. Kowalski played by Dan Foger. Foger also does a lovely job of a No Mag aka Muggle who is hesitant to be with Newt but then becomes his partner and also falls in love with Newt's animals and with another magician.The women played by Waterson and Mary Lou do commendable jobs. While Colin Farrell and Ezra Miller spice up this film with strong performance.However, the movie belongs to the fantastic beasts. Hats off to Rowling's writing and Yates vision as a director, these beautiful creatures are unbelievable. They're lovely and in 3D you really feel like loving and touching each one of them. If you have kids, they will love these creatures. And will stay with you for a long time.And also there is a small cameo by Johnny Depp and I'm not saying any more.Overall, a very satisfying experience and I'm waiting for the sequel and you will also figure out why I'm waiting for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great family adventure,"A great family adventure film with lots of spectacle, humour, excitement and even a bit of romance.From the hugely imaginative mind of Jo Rowling comes a new franchise set in 1920s New York. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,' is easily her best story since, 'Goblet of Fire,' - Harry Potter book four. I do wonder how good the Potter books five to seven could have been if she'd had more time. Not having publishers and producers constantly nagging at her about deadlines has set the author's mind free. This movie is fantastic.For those who know nothing about the ""Potter"" universe it is a world in which people who can perform magic exist in parallel with those who cannot. The magically gifted community cast spells with wands and brew potions in cauldrons but otherwise go through life as most normal people do. They go to school, get jobs, have families, retire and die. They keep themselves secret from the normal world though governments have departments and agencies that use them. And, for the purposes of this film especially; magical creatures like dragons and griffins are real. Critically you don't need to know anything about the Potter story to enjoy the movie.There were two things I don't like about this movie and neither spoiled it. The first is the intro. Multiple newspaper articles drifting and revolving across the screen for a few seconds each is far too busy. If the audience is expected to pick out any details from the writings then the highlights needed to be narrated. But after that it's all good.The movie rolls onto the screen like an eager peacock. The plot gambles along well enough with interesting characters, some fun and thrills. Then, just when it's got you enthralled it opens its tail feathers to the real spectacle. Great.The other thing I didn't like was near the end of the movie when a protagonist is revealed and most especially: who the actor is that will play him. I sighed; slightly bored to see that face again and thought to myself, 'Nah, can't see it,' but we'll give him a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
J. K. Rowling's magic realm reopens with this first installment of a 5-picture deal,"J. K. Rowling's magic realm reopens with this first installment of a 5-picture deal, directed by wizardry old-hand David Yates, adjusts the time back to 1926, New York City and introduces us a new protagonist, the 29-year-old Newt Scamander (Redmayne), a self-consciously introvert wizard, carries a suitcase which contains all the heterogeneous beasts he has captured all around the world, although, some naughty ones constantly sneak out into the world of No-Maj (a precursor term of Muggle), and unleash some considerable commotions, notably the cutesy Niffler, a relentless, reckless and ravenous treasure-hunter.Newt's pursing action in a bank catches the attention of Tina, a delegated former Auror employed by the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), also causes his suitcase unintentionally swapped with the one belongs to Jacob Kowalski (Fogler), a portly No-Maj who fails to get a loan to open his pastry shop. The triad soon will be joined by Tina's mind-reading sister Queenie (Sudol, aka. the musician A Fine Frenzy), woozily inveigles herself into a tabooed romance with a No-Maj, but, it is the Jacob-Newt pair gets the full treatment of a constellations of awesome beast-hunting exploits.Meanwhile, a mysteriously destructive dark force, later identified as Obscurus, wreaks havoc in the city, killed a bigot Senator, Percival Graves (Farrell), the head of Magical Security of MACUSA, yokes the advent of Obscurus to Newt's arrival (indeed there is a dormant Obscurus captured by Newt inside his suitcase), but on the sly, Graves also coerces a young Credence Barebone (Miller) to locate the human host of the amorphous Obscurus with his own ulterior motive, on the grounds of a quid pro quo to extricate Credence from his abusive stepmother Mary Lou (Morton), a No-Maj extremist against witchcraft. In the process, Newt and his friends must save themselves from the persecution from MACUSA and during the climax, when a rampant Obscurus threats to expose the witchery universe to the whole world, it falls on Newt and his fantastic animals' shoulders to do the reparation job, a finale sounds like boilerplate on paper, but in fact, emanates a feeling of cleansing solace owing to its visual and aural grandeur.First time takes on the sole credit for the script, Rowling timely orchestrates a storyline simmering with a cauldron of repressed torment from an anomaly, whilst adheres to the family-friendly, mass- appealing tenet, punctuated with a kaleidoscope of SFX creatures to lure any goggle-eyed audience. Among the core triad, Redmayne walks us through the journey with his unaffected self- effacement, Waterston engages us with a competently innocuous impression in the traditional heroine mode and Fogler makes for a sufficient comic foil tailing around as a proxy of us Muggle onlookers. A key revelation may suggest Farrel's future involvement with the franchise would be blunted, after being supplanted by an even more named star, however for my money, Miller upstages others to demonstrate his versatility, he can go very dark if necessary, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN-style.By and large, the film sets a solid first step to usher the large demography of Harry Potter fans to a similar milieu after a 15-year stretch (bar those have become too skeptical to take the story seriously) and establishes Newt in a grown-up Harry image as our sympathetic guide, hopefully, peddles new audience at the same time even if the whole enterprise feels like being constructed by rote and commonality, that is what masscult for, isn't it?p.s.: The 3D format I watched is rather murky and blurry, which as usual, is poles apart from its pristinely clear quality from its trailer, always a disheartening factor to put potential viewers off from cinema-going, since Blu-Ray DVDs are only several months away, 3D, once an eye-catching pull, now has legitimately become a thorn in our flesh in its stalled technological progress.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Non-Fan Perspective: Enjoyable, Fun, Family Romp","As a non-Harry Potter fan (Have not read the books, and have only seen a couple of the movies), I had no expectations for this film. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was quite good. If you haven't seen it, think of it like ""Doctor Who"" with wizards (Complete with a wizard Tardis). It reminds me of some of the better episodes featuring the 11th Doctor. That is not a criticism, by the way, I genuinely enjoyed the film, and I am not saying it is a rip off of ""Doctor Who,"" I am simply saying that it is most similar to some of the adventures of the 11th Doctor, with magic instead of time traveling space stuff.Here were some of the highlights for me...ACCESSIBILITY - I like that I didn't have to know a ton about the Harry Potter universe to understand what was going on. It doesn't exactly hand hold you, which is good, but you can at least follow the story and enjoy it without being super familiar with the universe. (There are a couple things that seem like plot holes unless you know the universe already, but they're not severe, and if you go with someone who knows the universe, they can explain them to you. Like... why, for example the wizards don't just murder all the humans and be done with them. In the lore of Harry Potter, it is apparently established that it screws up your soul and messes with you magically when you commit murder. Not explained in movie, so I figured I'd mention it here.)CHARACTERS - All of the characters who are supposed to be likable are likable. The actors do a good job with the roles. It's always pleasant when you don't hate the protagonists and it's always pleasant when the characters develop and have arcs that follow logical emotional and motivational progression.STORY - I like that this film has well-paced story progression with climaxes and slower character building scenes that effectively create the universe. I also like that the action set pieces/special effects serve the story rather than existing simply for their own sake. There are a few silly moments that challenge suspension of disbelief (the big ol' reset button at the end), but overall, it remains consistent with its own internal logic and, most importantly, it tells a story with a minimum of plot holes (once again, so long as you suspend your disbelief).EFFECTS - They're good enough to tell the story.CREATURES AND FANTASY WORLD - I genuinely liked all the creatures, and I was genuinely interested in the dynamics of the fantasy world they created. The 20's era wizard society and their interactions with the ""real"" world were interesting to see and engaging.PROBLEMS - None that I care to nitpick on first viewing. The positives far outweigh the elements I thought were overly silly.OVERALL - 9/10 - I highly recommend this film to general audiences. The logical story progression, the well-paced plot, the dynamics of the fantasy world, and the likable characters, coupled with the fact that you don't have to completely understand the Harry Potter universe to enjoy it, make for an effective and fun family adventure. It's not flawless, but it's still quite good.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The guy with the case full of monsters,"I'm not particularly a Harry Potter fan, but I've seen the Harry Potter films and generally have some familiarity with J.K. Rowling's magic world. This movie is set in the same universe as the Potter movies (albeit a different time and place), so movie goers will be familiar with many of its attributes.This time the story revolves around a curious young British immigrant Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), who is in 1920s NYC with a bag of fantastic creatures. The story involves a temperance-style anti-witch group, a dark wizard, a no-maj sidekick, two young ladies, and more.Although the visuals were very impressive, and it was all very well done, this busy movie didn't impress me that much. The writing, the plot...not sure what it was. I think perhaps I'm in the wrong demographic to really feel the magic.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Huge, pathetic waste of time (I even fell asleep from time to time)","When they have nothing to say and no message to deliver, but they still want to make a movie, they are resorting to special effects.

Poor Jon Voight, what a huge distance from ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Coming Home"", and ""Runaway Train"" (all three absolute masterpieces), and his next films (culminating with this s..t). Poor Colin Farrell, also a very good actor himself (but not here, here everything is bad). Poor cinematographer Philippe Rousselot, what he came to do... (he's the one who signed in the past the cinematography to masterpieces like ""Diva"", ""The Moon in the Gutter"", ""The Emerald Forest"", ""The Bear"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"", ""Henry & June""). Mr. Director David Yates is an expert in stupidity, he's making only poop-movies. Only one thing I liked in this huge mess: the pastries in the shape of fantastic beasts offered by Kowalski (Dan Fogler) in his shop at the end of the film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A vehicle to introduce an American version of Hogwarts and Harry Potter,"This film tells the story of an English wizard who travels to New York with a suitcase full of magical creatures. The creatures get loose, and he has to capture all of them back before they create citywide panic and destruction.I was looking forward to ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" a lot. After watching it, I have to say I am mildly disappointed. Though the visuals are great, the story is rather weak. The beasts are not portrayed to be fantastic at all. They merely look scary, fly around and be aggressive. I am not sure how they are fantastic, if anything they are scary especially to young children.The film is not about where to find the beasts either. It is about capturing them, instead of finding them in the wild. The action is sparse and muted, and there is little adventure in the story. It does not grip me or captivate me. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal to me is the most disappointing, because he is made to look like a - ahem - innocent and mischievous character, when he could look fierce and powerful. His lack of eye contact, and a lack of confidence in general makes me difficult to associate him as the protagonist.To be honest, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is merely a vehicle to reconstruct the hugely successful ""Harry Potter"" series, set in the USA with an alternate universe of wizards. It feels more like a cash cow, milking off the success of the much better ""Harry Potter"" series.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
British style of movie composed with dark imaginative direction from Yates make Fantastic Beast have his own unique screenplay,"First off all, i will say what are the three things that make Fantastic beast good to me. One, the twist concept. Two, Farrell's performance (Greaves). Three, Fogler's performance (Jacob). Oh and yeah of course, the Jacob farewell scene.The twist concept using British typical, giving so many option to reveal who the real enemy is. Thanks to Hitchcook who made this potent formula. With so many option about who the real enemy is, the movie tells audience to keep thinking until it's reveal. This will keeps audience enthusiasm to the story. This formula also often used by Christopher Nolan whose also British director.I must confess Farrell performance is incredible, even surpass the lead, Eddie Redmayne, psychology-problem actor specialize. Farrell was electrifying and charismatic. Honestly, I am a little bit sad he just play role as disguise to grindelwald, whose true identity played by Johnny Depp. Well, i degrade my trust a little bit to Depp. No promising performance from his some latest movies.And the last is Fogler's performance. What the director intention is, to grow likable feeling to Jacob as the duration goes on. I also like this formula, this formula seems very heartbreaking in the end, because step by step director develop Jacob's character, from his problems, his comedy, and in the end reveal his true loving and caring trait, but then should let all those things gone suddenly. I like that rain obliviate idea, it was deep and original. Jacob's character was played really great by Fogler. He just like a completing piece to the cast, i will never imagine how this movie could be without him, it should be a little bit empty and shallow.The conclusion is, this movie is good and matched with it's metascore (66).

Not-So Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find a Good Plot.,"The return of JK Rowling's magical world of wizardry, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is about a Magizoologist named Newt Scamander arriving in New York where he finds himself mixing briefcases with someone who then unleashes the magical creatures within...and so he runs around the city trying to retrieve them all again. Does that sound like a plot to you? I mean really? Because believe me when I say this, the film bordered on boring. But of course with a budget this massive, the production, acting and visuals are all going to be splendid. Eddie Redmayne plays the lead character and whilst I did find his acting incredibly annoying for the first five minutes, I slowly adjusted to it and found that his character was rather endearing. He did a good job. Dan Fogler plays the 'No-Maj' (that's a Muggle for us British people) and adds a much needed comic relief to the film. Everyone else in the film was fine, nothing memorable. Actually, Ezra Miller was decent as a young troubled teenager who succumbs to abuse. This brings me nicely to the story. Oh dear. This film had none for the duration of its long run time. Three quarters of the film involves Scamander trying to retrieve his lost creatures, this is where it gives the film a chance to show off its production and visuals which it does so brilliantly. The last quarter suddenly turns into this dark, abusive storyline where there is death...and that is where the film picks up and actually attempts to establish a story. But the two do not match and it's like watching two separate films. Considering this is aimed towards families (including young children), I don't think they would happily watch the last quarter...it's just too dark compared to the whimsicalness of the majority of the film. JK Rowling herself wrote the script and was essentially trying to bring nostalgia to the generation that grew up with Harry Potter, this is not particularly well suited to the newer generation. Moments of forced character development, scenes of pointless romance and a ridiculous amount of plot conveniences...it was just lazy writing with no natural transitions. I have to give major props to the creature designs as many of them looked gorgeous, particularly the Thunderbird and the mischievous Niffler. The production was also great, the setting of New York 1926 was perfect and felt fresh for the franchise. It might sound like I'm hating on this, but apart from the story and script the film was pretty decent...I just wanted it to be so much more. Overall, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was a welcome return to the imaginative world of magic with great visuals, production and acting but with a tedious script and lack of plot it did border on boring.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great return to magic, but not without it's problems","Newt and co. inhabit a 1920s era New York, trying to capture all the creatures that have escaped from his suitcase. In the meantime though, something far more dangerous brews in the city. One of the first things you'll notice when watching the film is how beautiful it looks. Stuart Craig has (as usual) done an incredible job with the set design, bringing to life a very convincing environment for the story to take place. I am no historian, but the atmosphere created by the buildings, the props, decorations and the environment in general all work together in creating a setting that not just looks like New York a century ago, but feels like it as well. Obviously New York isn't the only place the people go, and all the other places in the film are just as excellently made. This was all brilliantly captured by cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot, whose use of anamorphic lenses and some great lighting and grading meant that not only did everything look good, but it also didn't feel too clean, something which helps sell the 1920s look of the film.The acting of the main four was also quite good. Not award-winning for certain, but definitely good enough that it doesn't detract from the film in any major way, and the consistency between the main actors means that no-one in particular really outshines their co-stars. It also helps that all of Rowling's characters are well defined, unique and excellently created. Every one feels like a real person that may have actually lived at some point in time, each with their own story, and all of them very enjoyable to watch. The character of Jacob Kowalski is especially useful in adding some much needed humour to what would otherwise be quite a dark and serious film.Adding to the magical atmosphere of the film was the excellent music. James Newton Howard, who has worked on films such as The Dark Knight and The Hunger Games, has created a beautiful score that really adds a layer of 'magic' to the film (similar to what John Williams did with the first three Harry Potter films). It, along with the brilliant VFX, really sells the idea that we are taking a look inside the wizarding world. There is one scene in particular when Newt first enters MACUSA that is especially breathtaking. Speaking of VFX, it really is quite wonderful. Except for one scene, the CGI never calls attention to itself, and blends in seamlessly with the real elements in the frame. The one scene where it does call attention to itself is when it shows some humanoid creatures. The skin and animations aren't exactly believable, and it really detracts from what was a fairly important scene (for comparison, Kreacher in Deathly Hallows looked real, while the humanoids in Fantastic Beasts look more like Grawp from Order of the Phoenix).While Fantastic Beasts gets a lot of things right, it's not without its share of faults either. One of the biggest problems with the film is its introductory sequence. It does a great job at bringing the audience into the wizarding community in America, but unless you already have a basic understanding of the wizarding world before watching the film, you may find that it is a little confusing at first. The film simply assumes that you know how magic in the Potter universe works and doesn't really attempt to explain much of it properly to newcomers. Another thing that also isn't explained very clearly is the Obscurial (don't worry, not a spoiler), and it reduces how enjoyable the film is because instead of being able to follow the progression of the story you may be left trying to fill in the blanks.While the editing was decent as a whole, the movie would likely have benefited from a faster pace and also if it didn't adopt a completely chronological order of events. Even though the climax and the build-up to it was pretty good, showing some scenes later than they did would have made the end even better. The linear edit also means that when a certain 'big surprise' occurs, fans of the Potterverse might be able to predict it, which really takes away from what would have otherwise been the strongest part of the film.Another failing is the ending. After the climax, the film runs for over 15 minutes longer, and during that time not much of importance happens, and that extra time would have been better used introducing newcomers to the wizarding world. Fantastic Beasts also fails to properly set up future films in the series – it ends as though it's a standalone film which really kills a lot of excitement for future instalments of Scamander's story.With all that said, most of the problems in the film are actually smaller than I have made them seem, and some are simply a matter of opinion. And when a film is as great as this one is, nit-pick is all you can do to find faults. With enough humour to lift up what would otherwise be quite a dark film, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a wonderful return to Rowling's magical world, and whether you are a big fan of Harry Potter or don't know anything about his story, you are sure to enjoy watching this film (though if you are a newcomer I suggest you take friend to help explain some things).8.2/10 – Definitely go watch it, one of the better films of 2016NOTE: About halfway through the movie does get fairly dark, so be careful when taking children under the age of 12 (depending on their level of maturity).",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lots of fun but disappointing Lead,"Just as the Harry Potter books gave much more info and supplied more detail than can be crammed into a movie, I feel this story needed a book to help flesh out some of its characters and inventions. For example some of the most memorable acting from Samantha Morton and Ezra Miller portrayed characters I'd liked to have known more about and the evil force/creature was as difficult to comprehend as a 'horcrust' Eddie Redmayne is usually believable but in this you could see his acting. The choreography of his mating dance with the large rhino-creature was a comedic misfire and just looked goofy. As for his farewell scene, he's conveyed contrived awkwardness. But I really liked this film. it was very entertaining, funny and moving, with beautiful CGI beasts. Alison Sudol and Dan Fogel showed hearts and souls of the most delightful people in this tale.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is overall a whimsical and often magical starter to a series that stands on its own without even trying to better its predecessor.,"Fifteen years after the release of the Philosopher's Stone and five years after Deathly Hallows: Part 2, the prequel/spin off cycle of beloved franchises has continued with the Harry Potter franchise, and its finally one done right. Since the news of J.K. Rowling developing a spin off in 2013, I've had huge speculation on what it would be. Three years later, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is upon us and it's safe to say that the magic is back and it's untouched.The risk about a spin-off is whether it is rich like the products that spawned them, but there is no sign of that here because this is written by Rowling herself. As the creator of this universe, she writes with passion and almost perfect understanding of what fans want. You can tell through every line of dialogue, set piece and character that she has her fingerprints trademarked all over them. Instead of setting another story in Hogwarts, she makes the fresh decision to set it in 1920s New York.Here we meet Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) whose visiting the city with a suitcase full of magical creatures. The community has strict guidelines and does not allow creatures in it. His problem starts when his creatures suddenly start to escape and cause havoc across the city. He has to make the challenge of trying to find them.Redmayne shines as Newt, having the quirkiness and maddening cheerfulness of Matt Smith's Doctor Who. He's often funny and charismatic, a different hero from Daniel Radcliffe's dive at the main man of the story. Him and Rowling have done a nice job at crafting a perfect protagonist for the next big fantasy series.Colin Farrell plays Graves whose in charge of the Magical Security in the city. He's fairly good, relying on lead villain territory heavily and never collapsing into cliché as much. Dan Folger plays Newt's sidekick Jacob Kowalski whose a surprisingly likable supporting character. He's charming and full of interest like his leader. Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol are spellbinding too as sisters Tina and Queenie who help Newt on his quest.David Yates does just about a good job at directing this as he did with the last four Potter films, but due to the alterations of the universe, it feels seamless. This is because he's kept to his rules of bringing this world to life with real sets and impressive CGI. His directness has a Tim Burton-like feel that really makes the film extraordinary but different. The action scenes under his wing are impressive but not necessarily more effective than anything we've seen before. He'll be directing the next four films in this series so there's a guarantee that he will do justice again.""Fantastic Beasts"" isn't quite as fantastic as it thinks it is. While the plot is surprisingly original, it feels occasionally thin when it comes down to Newt and Kowalski trying to capture the creatures over the city. It sometimes feels like video game montage than your average fantasy quest. Also as this is the first part of the series, there's a lot of heavy world-building exposition to be done, which sometimes overlaps and wobbles the pace a little bit.Now that the setup has surfaced, Rowling and Yates can now do more of whatever they want next time round. While it isn't as intelligent as the best Potter films, it kindly resolves the problems of the more average entries of the series. It's one of the biggest pleasures of the year, like what Star Wars: The Force Awakens was in 2015. This could be the benchmark for all spin-offs to come: fresh and pretty much its own thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mediocre,"I was not disappointed, yet not pleased. As a die-hard Potterhead, It's a ""just okay"" from me. As a non-fan, who hasn't watched any Harry Potter movie, It's not really a good one. I sobbed at the few first seconds into the movie even before the protagonist appeared because, you know, it's been such a long time and I mean, just listen to THAT music! It's just so awesome to be involved in the magic world again. I screamed eternally when a familiar spell was cast, or when the Hufflepuff scalf was shown in pride. However, to be honest, I think the script was not really well-written as I found a handful of confusing details. A dozen of beasts were thrown on screen but I feel like David Yate hadn't fully exploited them, which make those creatures less impressive, and fuzzy, even, to the viewers. Anyway, despite the fact that it didn't live up to my expectations, I am still happy to go to the theatre a second time. I mean, I would definitely pre-order ticket to see Mrs.Weasley doing the housework for 3 hours in succession.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic movie as its name suggests.,"Directed by David Yates, the steady hand who'd steered Harry Potter films five to eight to popular and critical acclaim has done the same with the Fantastic Beasts. Though Fantastic Beasts is genealogically linked to Harry Potter, with nods and winks sprinkled like cake crumbs throughout the script, in practice there's no particular reason it had to be. The catastrophic timing and tone of Depp's pop-up gurn sends you out of Fantastic Beasts feeling more anxious about the franchise's stamina. Solidly extending the Harry Potter franchise to a different era with new characters, Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them starts slowly before finding its groove, delivering sufficient spectacle alongside a little emotion. I go with 4/5 for this beginner of a new potential franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Found Beasts Fantastic!,"Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them- This is the latest J.K. Rowling magical adventure with Wizardry as the familiar theme but the cast of characters are almost all new and this time the story is set in America where Newt (Eddie Redmayne) has travelled from England and smuggles in his suit case of creatures. Newt immediately finds himself in trouble after violating various American wizardry laws. During some early mishaps, a number of Beasts manage to escape the magical suitcase and the chase is on to retain them, all while the the Magical Congress is in pursuit of him and they all try to capture an out of control Obscurus, which is a dark, destructive force inadvertently manifested by young magical children forced to conceal their powers. Eddie Redmayne is great as Newt, Colin Farrell puts in one of his better performances playing both sides of the field as ""Graves""(basically a magic world detective) and Ezra Miller is spectacular as Credence (an abused son to a with hunting theorist). Though this is a prequel to the Harry Potter franchise, this movie resembles the later Potter movies in that it is darker in structure than the earlier films. If you are a Harry Potter fan, I find it hard to believe that you would not enjoy this one as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Magic is gone, replaced by seven different visual effects companies","It is always good to try to summarize a movie you've just seen before you judge its quality, and in the case of Fantastic Beasts, the summary simply doesn't make any sense. It mixes things up, bringing up various ""magical and wondrous"" situations that, on further scrutiny, simply don't add up. But the special effects are great.One thing you learn, though, by... err... watching between scenes? is that they have fully prepared for sequels. They have prepared a purely American magical world, with its own quirks and idiosyncrasies, brought in characters that did almost nothing, but are interpreted by great actors like Jon Voight and Johnny Depp, they left some things unsolved and they made the effort to force Eddie Redmayne act very well in this film.However, one question I have to ask: why on Earth would anyone want sequels to this? It was a bland, nonsensical film filled with impossible to empathize characters like an almost autistic hero that loves animals more than people, an ambitious yet mostly incompetent auror that puts everyone in danger for her own sake, a child like floozy that reads minds only when it doesn't matter and a non magical character that does nothing but follow people around. The villain is hiding his intentions for the entire movie only to expose them for all to see in the final scenes for no real reason. The rest is filled with a side story about child abuse and special effects over special effects.OK, I agree, people are hungry for magic. Anything would work, as exemplified by many of the nonsensical plots in Harry Potter that everyone just gobbled up, but at least those were real books, with real story lines. This was just an ""Insert coin"" sign made into a movie. I lost all confidence that Hollywood, J.K.Rowling advising or not, is capable of bringing the sense of magic and beauty that the original books and films had.Bottom line: Probably Redmayne is an awkward person in real life, too, so it wasn't too difficult for him to play the role, but act he did and he did it well. For that alone I rate this average. Other than that, a pretty picture with no substance and a bitter aftertaste of greed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The visual were entertaining  but don't expect anything more,"First, I'm an ordinary movie goer that have never done a review before.Second, English is my second language so please forgive my horrible grammar.I've just return from the cinema and was extremely disappointed. There are only 2 good things from the movie: Eddie Redmayne and the special effects. Eddie Redmayne did a fine job and his screen time was memorable. The CGI was also amazing except for the monster in the end. Now for the bad things, personally I felt that this movie was blessed with no charm what-so-ever, it was too Hollywood-lized with all the clichés you can think of: fat guy for comedic purpose, dump lead female who is useless and love the male lead for no real reason (in this one even the chemistry between them is terrible and she's not even pretty), unnecessary explosions, predictable plot twist,... What makes it even worse is the confusing plot, it's like the director couldn't figure out whether should this movie is about fighting bad guys or about the adventure of finding the Fantastic beasts so he decided to put them all in a blender and turn it on. That leads to the lack of character development, except for Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who was somewhat interesting I don't really know what the other characters were doing in this movie. Even the supposed ""villain"" was feeling too forced and I'm not even sure why he was considered dangerous (he doesn't really harm anyone in this movie).Go see this movie if you are entertained by CGI visuals. If you expected it to be as good as Harry Potter then I suggest you should lower your expectation by like a lot because It will disappoint you. I rate 6/10.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

one of the most beautiful movie till date,"The movie was released on November 18 in India and somehow I missed, but luckily there were few shows available 20 days later.

Description penned down by J.K. Rowling was mind blowing in every aspect. Half work done direction came out as blooming of some beautiful flower. There are super hit movies like avatar and there are other movies like Journey to the mysterious island, but this one I find most beautiful when compared.Tone: We are set to see tone of Hogwarts, but my friends this movie is different. There's how politics work, there's beauty, there's love and all that adds to the tone. It's terrific.Music: There has been music in harry potter previous movies. No wonder Double trouble was one of my favorites'. This movie has got less of that, but it beautifully goes with the tone.Acting: I don't know how they do it but acting is terrific, the selection, the makeup everything adds to it.

"The beasts are fantastic, but the film lags","As a Harry Potter fan since the pre-film Harry Potter times, I was clearly extremely excited about the expansion of the magical world that I had come accustomed to explore in the film theatre. The awe-inspiring creativity and ability to project a completely new world onto the screen was what kept on bringing me and millions others back year after year to watch the next instalment of the Harry Potter saga. However, this is a new saga, and, unfortunately, as the reviewer from Entertainment Weekly aptly described, this one seems ""numbingly inconsequential."" Do not get me wrong, this is not a bad film. But it is not a *good* film either. It is just fine. And that is disappointing.I found it hard to get into the story for the first hour or so. It just did not grab my attention, despite of all the action going on. Later on, I did find myself engrossed in the film, but that was not quite enough. The darkness that the HP films went to by the end is well maintained here. The visuals are beautiful. The CGI is amazing and even a notch better than the last couple of Harry Potter films. There is nothing wrong per se. It is just lacking an emotional connection. And that may be because it is compared to Harry Potter and if we are holding the film to that standard, it never will live up to it. It just cannot. The most redeeming factor for me was the feeling that it was very appropriate to have such a bleak view of the U.S. in the wake of Donald Trump's election. While this was overall not quite as exciting nor engaging as I had hoped it would be, it did set a stage with enough unknowns about this new wizarding world of the U.S. that it will probably easily give itself to the other 4 sequels. Maybe they will develop this emotional connection that this first instalment failed to achieve.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oops! What can I say?,"I kept waiting to engage with either the characters or with one of the beasts. Such an engagement was not forthcoming. I like Eddie Redmayne, so it is nothing to do with him. So much emphasis on creating this alternate world that the basics of filmmaking appear to have been sacrificed. Never does anyone look into you, the screen, and speak. There is never any eye contact. You do not feel attached to Eddie's character. Even my children were squirming in the seats and looking around bored. They wanted food and said they were hungry. The movie therefore appears to fail both children and adults like me. My 12yo son who is a mega Harry Potter fan could not engage with the movie. ""I like reading J K Rowling's books but I am not sure about this one"" is what he said. What he means is that, after having watched the movie, it has put him off the book as well.I got up to get food for the kids, they followed me and were more keen on ice creams and sweets rather than getting back to the screen to what happened next. So much for fantastic pointless beasts. If you liked Harry Potter then that is not a guarantee that you will like this one. That is for sure. If you liked The Lord of Rings and sat through the trilogy, then you may have what it takes to sit through this one. Perhaps looking at this as a movie nothing to do with Harry Potter might help. If your children do not get attached to the movie then don't be surprised.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fascinating, beautiful fairy tail!","Fascinating, beautiful fairy tail. Meaningful and kind, probably the best mainstream movie I have watched for quite some time. I left the cinema with a crazy looking smile on my face that I have carried all the way back home and long after.It might be just a fantasy, but so were scientific laws for someone once, until they were proved with time. I have recently bumped into TED talks and an article on a topic of our five senses and how we perceive only a small piece of a world through them and how animals perceive this world differently just because they have been ""designed"" differently by nature. Also thanks to Jung and Freud for other things we know about ourselves and how our perception shapes. Still, there is a lot for us to get to know to uncover the world as it is.Stories like ""Fantastic Beasts.."" unleash some of the unseen reality that we call fantasy, magic or stupid just because we are not capable of seeing or comprehending it at the current stage of our evolution.

The beginning of new-old universe,"The fantastic beasts and where to find opens up new cinematic universe that every one of us have already known for a while.

The plot is simple and you won't expect any astonishing screenplay. It could be predicted from the first 30 minutes of the movie. But, the movie doesn't need incredible scenario and such simple story doesn't affect this movie negatively.The humor of the film is its one of the strongest aspects. Most of it comes to the Jacob Kowalski(played by Dan Fogler) and I really loved this guy.

"Better than the potter films, but merely a stepping stone","I just saw the film in theater today, and it had many highs and a few notable lows.It was nice to see an expansion of the potterverse, especially into American waters ( bad pun considering the literal plot, I know :P), though at times I was exasperated with the acting.NOw in all fairness it IS very difficult to act when a person is supposed to be looking or addressing a being or creature that is made up entirely of CG elements. That being said, for the most part, the main actor ( redmayne, I think his name was) did a good job. Was he high during? Maybe. But more than anything the wizard character the actor portrayed was way too meek and soft spoken for a feature film.At times I could barely hear the main actor's words, even above his British accent. Too often he would mutter and it was so annoying and off putting that it kept sidelining the movie.But I get it, every generation tries to emulate an actor or actress or singer of the past with a new age incarnation of similar quality; this redmayne guy is like the modern Hugh Grant, whom was also an overly speechless, stuttering half wit in his early to middle years of stardom.The beasts . But it was during prohibition years, hence why I found the film lacking in any sort of lively color most of the time. It will help to revitalize the potter franchise to go hand in hand with the new books that shall no doubt be adapted to the screen, so as long as its not terribly predictable like certain franchise that have resurfaced after years of absence, I say bring it on.The film was good enough, and well deserving of a solid 6, or even a 6.5 out of 10 rating if such a thing can exist.

It is a highly entertaining story in a magical universe with some adventure, some suspense and a lot of humor.The magic and the magical animals are quite cool. The pocket universe (or whatever they are called in the Harry Potter world) is simply gorgeous and cool. The story is not really much to write home about but it does not have to be. This is a magical movie where the magical atmosphere is what makes the movie. It is a good enough story involving a bit of suspense, action, friendship, bad guys, quite some humor and, of course, a lot of magic. More importantly perhaps, the story is not overly stupid nor does is try to peddle crappy SJW nonsense messages about gender or diversity nor climate. This movie delivers where it counts as far as I am concerned. It is entertaining, plain and simple.If I should endeavor try to find something to complain about it would probably be that the lead character was fairly bland. He did not really have much charisma. That and the fact that I never really understood which, despicable (presumably) acts the main opponent, Grindelwald, had actually committed before the events of the movie.On the whole I enjoyed the movie a lot and although it is perhaps not the absolutely best movie I have ever seen but it still deserves a top rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eddie Redmayne. And nothing more.,"Eddie Redmayne was, in my case, the motif for see this film. And it remains the only. Because I am not exactly fan of Harry Potter. Because , in our time, the mix of technology and imagination could not give great surprises. And because the feeling to be front to a chaotic story and a pretext for exotic animals show, the film is a sort of chewing gum for many viewers, a must see for fans and occasion for discover , for few minutes, a Johnny Depp as promise for second part. Sure, I am too old for this genre of film. That explains my reserves.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Definitive proof that the world of Harry Potter can live without Harry Potter,"As a 20 year-old Brit who has grown up with Harry Potter and considers it an integral part of his childhood, I went into this film more than excited, ready to explore a new part of the wizarding world.And Fantastic Beasts without a doubt delivers this; its whimsical, exciting and uplifting, embodied by Eddie Redmayne's perfect casting as magizoologist Newt Scamander. The remaining trio of main characters, particularly no-maj Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) reinforce this, with enough humour and chemistry to see the film through. In this sense then, Fantastic Beasts is a perfect extension of Harry Potter's world, with plenty of references for fans of the series.Where this film fails then is in the disparate nature of its narrative. The story is split into two; Newt's light-hearted escapade into New York to recapture some of the beasts that have escaped his suitcase, and then the parallel of single-minded Auror Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) in his attempts to capture some kind of force destroying New York. Graves' side of the story is far darker, containing elements of wizards and witches being hunted and the beating of children. Truthfully it was in the darker moments I enjoyed Fantastic Beasts the most; the big issue is that the two sides of the story are far too disparate in their tones, and the two never truly come together as a satisfying cohesive story. This is a problem compounded by David Yates' directing. With the Deathly Hallows he truly hit his stride, but Fantastic Beasts is a step back to the rigid, awkward and motionless days of the Order of the Phoenix and the Half-Blood Prince. Newt's story is constantly propelling forward, but this simply isn't reflected in the way its captured. Case in point are the scenes Kowalski sees magic for the first time.In all; Fantastic Beasts never quite reaches the highs of Harry's adventures, and doesn't really satisfy as single film. It is however a truly joyous and enjoyable adventure, leaving a LOT to look forward to in future installments. You should certainly go out and watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
FANTASTIC FOR FANTASTIC BEASTS,"I loved this movie. It doesn't matter what other people say to me, everything J.K. Rowling creates and loves is amazing.

It was a wonderful experience watching this well-known movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Relatively Enjoyable Installment in the HP World But Confusing Because of Lack of Focus,"Francis Ford Coppola once said that to make a film work, a filmmaker should be able to sum up the entire film in a single word or phrase. (He defined his epic ""The Godfather"" as ""succession"".) In ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", I wasn't quite sure of the main focus of the film, in other words I couldn't find a single phrase to sum to up what the story was about. Hence the film moves in many different directions, and while there is much to praise in the film, the screenplay was in need of a few more rewrites. At first the main focus seemed to be ""save the beasts"" but later it became ""stop the Obscurus"". Even by film's end, I wasn't entire convinced how these two ideas related to each other.Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a Hogwarts graduate and scholar of fantastic beasts of sorts, arrives in New York. Scamander's character seems literally a cross between Harry Potter and renowned physicist Stephen Hawking (whom Redmayne played in the 2014 film ""The Theory of Everything""). He's been engaged in a long quest to stop the highest officials of the magic world from exterminating the many magical beasts which infiltrate the magic world. The political body in America has been concerned that sometimes these beasts slip into the muggle (non-magic) world, and they are dedicated to ensure the muggle world never become privy to the magic world. Newt has brought with him a special ""case"" which contains many of these magical beasts, sort of like the magical equivalent of Noah's Ark.Scamander crosses paths with Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a lovable nobody muggle/no-maj who simply desires to create a bakery in the city. He is going to one of the local banks to plead for a loan, and he also carries a case similar in size, color and design to that being held by Scamander, although his is simply filled with samples of his pastries. Through several happenstance encounters causing several of Newt's beasts to escape into the muggle world, Jacob and Newt become reluctant bedfellows, so-to-speak, as Jacob is introduced to the magic world before he can be ""obliviated"", the magic world's term for erasing muggles' memories of magic encounters. Newt is then arrested by Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), an agent of the Ministry of Magic, Auror division, which enforces the strict law of magic, which includes keeping muggles ignorant of the presence of magic people. They also meet Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol), Tina's roommate who takes a liking to Jacob.Simultaneously, the city is being ravaged by an unseen ""force"" which seems to have supernatural qualities and inclinations. This thing enjoys chewing up buildings and streets and then spitting them into rubble. An anti-witch/anti-magic group run by Mary Lou Barebone is making street speeches that ""something"" is invading their city, preaching on a soap box a little bit like Aimee Semple McPherson of the Pentecostal movement in Los Angeles in the early 20th century. She seems to be aware of the presence of ""magic people"" and fantastic beasts in her midst. She also runs an orphanage and ""cares"" for several children: Credence, Chastity, and Modesty. The eldest, a young man, is Credence who wears funereal clothing and acts and appears to be constantly troubled. At one point, the Barebone ""family"" (if family they can be called) enter one of the local newspapers asking the editor Henry Shaw, Sr. (Jon Voight) to look into the matter. He refuses the request. Credence is then befriended by someone in the magic world: Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), one of the top officials in the Ministry of Magic in America. Graves promises Credence he will become ""welcome"" in the magic world if the younger man helps him to find the dark force, called an obscurus; Graves is convinced the force is someone in the Barebone orphanage.The story then moves basically on three fronts: Newt dealing with his escaped magical creatures, the anti-magic society among whom Credence has befriended a wizard and Ministry of Magic official, and the strange dark ""force"" which runs rampant through the city, smashing up the metropolis into the equivalent of Dresden during the Second World War. While these different ideas do finally converge by film's end, much of how all the pieces fit was very confusing. Some of the sequences where Newt was chasing escaped beasts, trying to get them back into his case, went on for too long. One good sequence, which is I think Rowling's strength, is when Newt introduces Jacob to his menagerie of beasts inside his case.Overall, generally a good film, but it needed to be tightened more. The Harry Potter films were much better focused while this film seemed a bit ""all over the place"". Personally, the first 1/2 hour and the last 1/2 hour were the most interesting. Some parts of the middle hour were often perplexing. I liked the acting of all the leads, although sometimes Newt (Redmayne) was a bit difficult to hear, and he would move his head somewhat away from the camera. When he describes the dark force ""the obscurus"", he was somewhat enigmatic in his explanation. Maybe I wanted a flashback to see the creation of the obscurus and what it was about rather than the endless ""lets get the creature"" before the muggles find out sequences. Still, generally it holds together, but it was close to a misfire.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"This is a huge step down from the Harry Potter films; but if you look at it as it's own series, it is entertaining and worth a watch","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Newt Scamander in 1920's New York years before the Harry Potter storyline. He tracks down magical beasts and captures them in a magical suitcase. He becomes a target when others are interested in gaining his creatures and the magic that comes with them...This movie is directed by David Yates (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows) and stars Eddie Redmayne (Les Misérables), Dan Fogler (Good Luck Chuck), Katherine Waterston (Alien Covenant), Alison Sudol (Between Us), Ezra Miller (Justice League) and Colin Farrell (The Batman).Every settings are fun and the special effects create an entertaining universe around the storyline. The bank scene was a great opening and how can you not love the bakery shop character? The dialogue is creative as are the creatures. You can never predict anyone or anything's next actions. Farrell delivers a great performances in this and I will say the final creature was fun but a bit too much at the same time.Overall this is a huge step down from the Harry Potter films; but if you look at it as it's own series, it is entertaining and worth a watch.

"A little more CGI, please.","I don't mean to disrespect Rowling fans, but one must look at it objectively and realize that, although the CGI in the movie could be viewed as convincing, it was sometimes purposeless.
Nevertheless, my score isn't meant to reflect the demographic this movie hoped to reach, but rather a view that spans into the totality of films.
Does it deserve 7 stars? No. Just look at the scene where the black prison guard speaks in a completely stereotypical manner, almost forced, whereas it seemed that the magic society had transcended ethnic differences which would cause these cultural aspects to develop in the muggle world.
After all, isn't the witch and wizard society born from the Salem witch trials (as explained by Hermione in HP2 or 3)? And not only that, but how little dimension do the characters having shown so little from their past?
In conclusion, and although I haven't read the book, I don't think this movie adapted fully to it, or if it did, the book fell short of the level of detail the HP series offered. Moreover, there was simply too much CGI.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Good Enough - Just wish it was more ""Fantastic""","I am a big fan of the original Harry Potter series of books and films. I'm re-reading the books now and have seen the films countless times.  So it was with great anticipation that I packed the family up and we headed to the local mega-plex to check out the pre-quel film FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM.And...it was a good enough time for the whole family that competently - if unspectacularly - returned us to this fantastical world (pun intended), but it wasn't...ahem...fantastic enough for me.Let's start with what was successful.  The work of the terrific Eddie Redmayne as our hero - Magizoologist Newt Scamander.  The character he created is eminently watchable, charming and shy with a slight deferential gleam in his eye, surely enough to draw an audience into his adventures.  Scamander arrives in New York City in the 1920's to find a Fantastic Beast and the adventure begins.And quite a bit of his adventure is chasing down creatures that have escaped from his magical case.  The best - and most charming - of these (and surely the beast that will be sold as a plush this Holiday Season) - is the NIFFLER, a small, furry almost platypus- looking scamp that is attracted to (and hoards) shiny objects. There is also the BILLYWIG and the OCCAMY and the DEMIGUISE and the...you get the picture.  Keep an eye out for my favorite - the BOWTRUCKLE and see if you can spot the similarity to this creature and another creature from another MARVELous movie.Another thing that works well in this film is the setting. Where the Harry Potter films transport you to another world, this film transports you to another time and veteran Potter Director David Yates and crew do a wonderful job in creating this time.  It was fun to see the settings, design, color and MAGIC of 1920's era NYC set as the backdrop to this story and when magical things started happening, it felt like it all fit in well.Add to this the work of Alison Sudol as Queenie - a Legillimen that becomes embroiled with Scamander. What is a Legillimen, you ask?  You'll have to see the movie to find out, but Queenie is a very good and charismatic.  It helped that she was paired up most of the time with the breakout star of this film - Dan Fogler as Kowlaski a ""NoMag"" (or Muggle as we know it) who is our eyes into this new world and spends most of the film reacting as most of us would have reacted - with shock, awe and a grin about how great this world is.And now to what didn't work...Most of the other characters.Starting with the female lead, Katherine Waterson as Porpentia ""Tina"" Goldstein, a former ""auror"" (you Harry Potter fans know what that is) who is trying to get back in the good graces of the American version of the Ministry of Magic.  Tina is bland and forgettable and serves as the ""Basil Exposition"" of this film - doling out long explanations of what is going on and what their quest needs to be.Director Yates and Writer Rowling then proceed to do something that is quite hard in a Potter movie - they make the rest of this magical Universe pretty uninteresting.  The other Magical characters are 2 (not 3) dimensional.  I can accept this as the Villain(s) in this film are 1 (not 2) dimensional.  And...I won't even begin to try to understand what Jon Voight was doing in this film.  If the villains were 1 dimensional, Voight's character was less than that - can a character be Zero dimensional?And...the beasts.  There are lots and lots of beasts.  The list I gave up top is just the beginning of the creatures we are introduced to and that is part of the problem - this film spends so much time world building that it falls short in character building.  I felt like I was getting setup of for a much bigger world - and seeing that this is the first film of 5 proposed in this series - that might be exactly what this is.  This film might grow in esteem as it is stacked up as the first part of a larger story, but as a film in and of itself, it's fine enough and a good time out for the family.I just wish it was more fantastic.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I thought Eddie Redmayne did a fabulous job with the lead role. He had an inner strength, even though his character seemed quite flawed when we first met him. Queenie was another endearing character, who even though she could read minds, and had reasons to keep her distance, was loving and accepted everyone for who they were.

A long time ago ...,"Or is it a long time has passed? As you probably know already without me having to point it out, this is based on a book by the Harry Potter writer (even in the movie there are references). I haven't read the books (I know shame on me), so I can't compare anything from Potter books or this in specific.What I can tell you though, is that this has great special effects. And a really neat story to carry too. Is it predictable? Yes of course it is, painting peoples characters pretty easily. But while people claim this to be more of an adult version of Harry Potter (and there is some light violence and death), this still can be called a kids movie. It's an adventure for everyone sort of. You can actually enjoy this without thinking too much. There is so much visual stuff in there, that your mind will be opened",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"First Hour is truly magical ... Second Hour, Not So Much","I believe it speaks to the enormous ""fun factor"" in the first hour of Fantastic Beasts that the second hour -- which is typical of the what passes for slam-bang action in many of Hollywood's current A-list films -- tries to keep up, but ultimately falls flat.The internal dynamic of the film that fascinates.In the first hour we get something most of us thought we would never see -- Hogwarts in New York.Every moment of that opener is more fascinating than the moment that preceded it, and I can think of few films this can be said about.The cast is uniformly excellent. Standouts are, first, Eddie Redmayne. He may be young but if you have followed his work you know he is an actor's actor with a brilliant career ahead Another standout is Alison Sudol who personifies the good-natured gal from 1001 American movies from the 1940s.Then unfortunately we get the second hour and everything starts to come apart as suddenly Harry Potter yields to Avengers (civil war, internal conflicts) and even (in the fight scenes) to Dr. Strange battling Dormammu.If you stick it out, Beasts has what can best be considered a happy ending but nothing can change the fact that the ""happiness arc"" for the viewer -- to coin a term -- starts at a high and heads downhill.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Dr Who Fan Fiction,"What a wonderful piece of SciFi, I should Steven Moffat should give props to this work. I introduce to you Dr Who, Harry Potter style. You think I'm joking? Not in the slightest. This is, quite literally, fan faction of Dr Who in the Harry Potter world. How so?Matt Smith. At the time this movie was produce, Matt Smith wasn't too far retired from Dr Who. And look at the similarities. The hair, the bow-tie, the general demeanor, the magic stick.1. The hair, combed over hair style. While Newt's is more fluffy than Matt Smith's Doctor, it's still the same general combed over style. Matt Smiths' was just more styled in a clean version.2. Bow ties are cool. Bow ties, nothing more.3. Similarish overcoat and dress style.4. Tool of choice. The magical wand vs the sonic screwdriver. Generally just as ""magical"" and the key to their general survival, but can function without it.5. The protection of misunderstood life. While this is common place among Dr Who, David Tenant and Matt Smith were most profound for this in the recent series, communing with misunderstood life, which wreaked havoc upon humans.6. A portable dimensional space. TARDIS or suitcase, both are bigger on the inside to house unimaginable things.7. Travel. The TARDIS is both a form of space transport and time travel. While the TARDIS is capable of time travel, here's the first real obvious difference between the two. Apparition is just teleportation, something both Time Lords and Time Agents are well versed in. The TARDIS is capable of changing its appearance due to the chameleon circuit. Obviously, Matt Smith repaired this to turn it into a suitcase for this movie, before it short circuited and reverted to the familiar police box again.8.The Doctor has been capable of traversing alternate universes, albeit by accident, in the most recent series.The Doctor ended up in the Harry Potter universe and adapted. His immense intellect allows him to pick up magic very quickly, which is just another form of science, based on the universe's rules. This is explained in the episode The Shakespeare Code, where ""witches"" use and terrorize William Shakespeare. He continues his belief that life is sacred and must be protected. He stores multiple life forms in his TARDIS. His antics match that of Dr Who in sticky situations.I've heard things about this movie from other people, and I've finally come around to watching it, with nothing else to watch, and can see nothing but Dr Who as a wizard.Good job, J.K. You made a fan-fic and dubbed it a new series in your own universe. Still a good story, by Dr Who standards, but mislabeled.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Slightly disappointing but worth watching,"I have high expectation before walking into the theater. However, the illustration of atmosphere of the film is not as mysterious as the previous series of Harry Potter. It seems to be more suitable for children. There is much room for improvement in the future. The monsters in the film are somehow more cute than magically terrifying. If the director can focus more in creating an atmosphere of mystery, magic and wonder, this movie can be a lot better. Also, the final fight is a little bit too simple that is not making me feel excited and nervous enough. Perhaps my expectation is too high because of the great success of the previous series. Another minor point is the female main character is not as charming as Emma Watson. Generally speaking, this movie is still worth watching if you are a fan of Harry Potter.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic but not so exciting,"This movie was very popular among fans of previous Harry-Potter series, and as a person who had never watched one of them, I didn't expect the movie to be so amusing.

I had wished to have watched it in the cinemas. However, the plot proved it to be just one of those big-budget fantasy movie. So do not watch it for the story, I would say. The story line is very predictable and unoriginal, but I liked some scenes that were visually wonderful or humorous.

In between, it gets a bit boring, but attracts curiosity and questions in mind throughout.

The second half of the movie quickens up the pace, becomes more sinister and ends on a high note in form of an epic battle.This movie never comes close to even the worst movies or novels of the Harry Potter franchise and is simply stated an average fantasy film. The hype around this film and its sequels is exaggerated and the cinematic Harry Potter universe should have concluded with one single movie about the seventh novel ten years ago.

The only problem is people who have seen MOST of the Harry Potter MOVIES ONCE review this movie and complain about it. To all of you who are like that, stop it. This is obviously for Harry Potter fans so don't complain about something you don't understand",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful,"This movie started off very slowly. It was so slow getting started that I almost wanted to leave... then all the stories started to come together and the movie took off. Once it did, it was wonderful. Rowling seems to have spent 45 minutes introducing us to all the characters and the plot lines to the story. She did not rely on formulaic characters or stereotypes so it takes time to see them as they are. (Technically, we are now ready for four more movies without the need for any introduction). I loved this movie and thought it was a wonderful world to go to.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
R u kidding..one of the worst movies,the movie is very slow. No story. Only some comedic situations. that also you can find in other movies. if harry porter movies were given 10 marks i would give this movie 1 mark. I am still wondering why people are saying this movie is good. is it trump effect? The story is very poor. t here is no villain... they defeat the villain with emotion.. no magic. only bullshit.. I don't know what has happened to people. people are giving high ratings to absolutely crap movies and good movies they are giving bad rating even without seeing them... Dr strange and This crap having high ratings then a gem movie like Train to Bussan really annoys me... Have people lost their mind,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Almost Great,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them follows a British wizard in magical America as he accidentally lets a few beasts out of his magic suitcase into the country, and how he goes about finding them. In the process, the American wizard police get involved, posing a serious problem.After learning that there would be several movies following this one, I thought there would be a whole lot of beasts roaming America. Turns out that's not the case, so hopefully they don't pull the same gimmick five times for the next few movies.I had a lot of fun with the movie. The characters are well-performed and often comedic. Colin Farrell in particular is good. His character adds a totally different atmosphere to the movie than the original Harry Potter movies had. He's probably the most real character in the movie, and he's excellently portrayed. And despite the often fun characters contrasting his darker character, he fit in perfectly.However, the special effects aren't very good. Sometimes they hit, but oftentimes they don't. They fall flat more when a live action character has to interact with a CGI beast. It doesn't look terrible, but it doesn't look good either. It didn't take away from the movie that much, but it was somewhat distracting regardless.The movie was almost great, save for the last 20 minutes. It suddenly decided to be generic and wrap itself up in a forced, unlikely way and throw in a barely developed, barely foreshadowed, not really even mentioned and utterly pointless twist ending. The movie couldn't find a way not to be generic and forced to wrap up, and that proved to be the tipping point for me.Overall Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is good. The characters are fun, the acting is great, but the special effects lack and the ending is painfully forced and poorly thought-out. In the end I'd recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Entertaining TransAtlantic Excursion,"I deliberately avoided this one for a while because I initially thought, ""oh no, not some diluted hogwarts cash-grab"" but you know what? I really enjoyed this film. Set in roaring 20s NewYorkCity, we get to explore the differences in how wizard affairs are handled on the other side of the pond, how bureacracy and bias affect relationships between the magic world and the ""no-majs"" (yankee for muggles) and how this leads to misunderstandings and internal strife.(This is much more exciting than I just made it sound) The pacing, visual effects and characters are all excellent. Great performances from a great cast. Eddie Redmayne is suitably quirky as a secret agent/zookeeper with a soft spot for muggles and creatures of all kinds. Also delightful in the role of Queenie is Fine Frenzy who bears an uncanny resemblance to Rachel Weisz (I am in love with both actresses) She is one to watch out for. Colin Farrell turns in his best performance since In Bruges. I really cannot overstate how much I liked this cast and cared what happened to them (even the cgi beasts, that range from adorable to terrifying) There are some minor plot points that could have been better handled, but they really did not take away from my enjoyment of this film. I would definitely recommend this on 4k bluray, streaming or wherever you may find it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Accio More Potterverse Movies,"I love Rowlings' Potter universe. The layered, diverse characters. The modern sentiments within classical aesthetics. The new yet recognizable good-vs-evil lore. Going into Fantastic Beasts, I fought hard not to let that pre-adoration paint this new branch too brightly too early. So when I felt myself snuggle in at hearing the familiar musical theme during the title sequence, I got a little nervous that Hedwig was carrying my critical credibility right out the window. As the film played out though, I became more assured. Not that this matches the near-perfect heights of the original series; this new narrative isn't as smooth or strong, nor is it trying to be. However, its lack of longing to match the import of its own predecessor allows it to be pure, magical fun. Occurring nearly a century before the Battle of Hogwarts, we follow wizard-zoologist Newt Scamander as he tries to wrangle some mystical animals that've been unintentionally released in New York, but ends up uncovering a secret sinister plot by mysterious dark wizard Grindelwald. Scamander's line, ""My philosophy is: with worrying, you suffer twice"", really captures his childlike naiveté and endless wonder, a feel the entire film really hangs on. The characters are sincere, sweet and funny, including a disgraced American auror, her bombshell sister, and a lovably goofy no-maj (aka muggle; aka non-magical human). That breezy tone carries the film past its shortcomings (pale comparisons, narrative clarity, slight fan-service) thanks to director Yates' comfortable visual control and Rowlings assured handling of her own creation. Fantastic Beasts is a fun start to what will hopefully continue to be a uniquely emotional, surprisingly comical & morally intriguing fantasy-action series.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well composed glimpse into a small segment of the Potterverse,"I've made an account just to add this and downvote a simply rubbish review that was on the front for this movie.I believe the majority of negative reviews come from the fact that the movie actually requires you to do a small amount of independent research to understand the background, leaving most people perplexed when things happened without explanation. This is highly rewarding for those that have read the source material, as the movie does not hold your hand, or provide droning exposition to make sure Grandma understands.In my opinion, anyone with an understanding of the references this movie leans on (American witch hunts, Fantastic Beasts the book, and the ""Potterverse"") will love the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I love Wizarding World...,"My love for wizarding world by Rowling is immeasurable, once I dive in it, its hard for me to come back soon. Even after watching this film I started exploring the franchise and spent 3 hours. Coming to the film, though unfortunately I watched it in 3 sittings ( due to Ramadan's timings )...my experience wasn't affected a bit. All I can say is Warner Bros tested their strength in CGI and touching the past of wizarding world, 70 years prior to Harry Potter's era. Film is tasty with useless details scattered around to make it humourous and light. Grindelwald's background was kept untouched but the character still felt completely described. Eddie Redmayer is natural actor ans I've been chanting this for years. Wonder why no one listens to my unbiased opinions lmao. Film is good and above average for potterheads and mediocre fantasy film lovers. For me it was lengthy but well filmed. 7/10 ( could've been better with addition of depth )",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Whilst we felt a deep and profound love for each other following the first Harry Potter movie, our relationship has experienced an extensive and frustrating series of on-again-off-again periods. This latest work of childish pablum only served to amplify the deep divisions we have regarding plot and plausibility - I want both she wants neither. Ms. Rowling has descended ever deeper into a world of crazed, inane, wince-worthy fantasy, whilst I have grown and moved on.

Eddie Redmayne is the weakest link.,"This sequel is of the same level as the first movie. It's a bit of entertainment, for the whole family, with some good CGI moments. If you don't like fantasy movies with weird creatures and alot of CGI's then you shouldn't watch this one because that's basically the whole movie. The story is okay, just a bit more complicated than the first movie, but still a movie to watch with the whole family, kids included. The acting is okay from most of the actors excepted from the main character Newt Scamander played by Eddie Redmayne. To me he's just a mediocre actor but that's my opinion. Like in the first movie he's the weakest link and both movies could have been better with another actor.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

At last I got it!,"I saw this movie in the theatre when it was first shown and, honestly, I rated it with one star. Where was the magic of Harry P? Where was the friendships? I was truly bitterly disappointed. But I bought the DVD because I loved the music and then a little bit of magic happened. I liked it! Seems that on the second time around I was able to take in the story, much of which had passed by me. However, it was only watching it the fifth time that I understood the nuances of the screenplay.
However, now we come to the negative side of the see-saw. I found the small pieces of exposition jarring. JKR could have done better. And I know that because I've written a few things myself. Unbelievably, I found Katherine Waterston's early parts in the film, lacking in timing, but it was only a few times. Yes, Eddie Redmayne mumbled a bit. I'm English, living in the UK and even I had trouble understanding some of his words. Seems to be an wretched pattern nowadays. I still don't know what part the little flying azure bug had but perhaps that'll sort itself out. And that's about it, so back to the positive.
The special effects were astonishing, Dan Fogler was very funny, the music (of course) was sublime and praise must go to David Yates and his production team. And although she may never read this, thank you, JKR for giving us this wonderous and magical world, and I look forward to the end of 2018 for the second instalment.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The first of several Harry Potter spinoffs,I was so excited when this was coming out. We get the world established by JK Rowling and more magic. Newt Scamander goes through New York City in the 1920s having lots of adventures and interacting with both Muggles (no-majs in America) and wizarding folk. The sisters didn't hurt either and the creatures were all well-done. Not your typical Ray Harryhausen-styled critters. But it was good for a period piece. Both American and English actors stole the show and it's a whole new ballpark for the Hogwarts saga. Now bring on the others!,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Review,"Fantastic Beasts and where to find them follows a British wizard Newt as he try's to round up the magical creatures that were set loose in New York City.I loved Newt played by Eddie Redmayne, he is a extremely likeable character. His goal is to show the world that these magical creatures don't need to be feared.Dan Fogler was amazing as Jacob the muggle or Nomaj. Not only he is hilarious but he never felt like a side character. He crucial to the story by being this character that is essentially the audience. He shows us what it's like to be a regular guy in a world of magic.Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol were both great as Tina and Queenie. Along with Collin Ferrell as Graves, who I which was given more screen time.The story itself is really broken up into two plots for the first half. The first being the search for these magical creatures which is extremely entertaining and well done. It gives us the magical elements that are highly entertaining all while building these characters which are very likeable.The other being graves investigation into strange disturbances that are revealing the wizarding world to the muggles. That second story is really misplaced, every scene that is building that story makes the film seem slow and it takes away from the fantastic beasts side.When the two story's finally do connect there is a period of down time where we just get a exposition dump and again it slows the movie way down.Overall this is a good film and gives us some really enjoyable characters and a fun entertaining plot, but it is dragged down by the film's attempt to create a villainous presence that never really sticks. If you enjoyed the Harry Potter films you will enjoy this film.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a travesty,"This is not a film. There is no discernible plot whatsoever. The film has no pacing at all, the cast should be ashamed to have taken the money to be in something which is no more than a CGI fest. Some of which - including the ending scenes are even taking the mickey out of that - The film is boring, the characters have no empathy with each other, the love interests risible, practically none of the creatures have any personality at all. the scenes are chaotic and move between locations with no discernible logic.

Reading the screenplay is more fun,"My grandma got me a copy of the screenplay to this movie and I liked it a lot.

And it was really easy to guess what would happen(I mean i read the screenplay and all, but even my 6 year old brother could guess what would happen) The CGI didn't really improve from the harry potter movies. Kind of the same. But it still looks a little cool sometimes. This isn't a great movie, but at least it isn't boring. The main problem is that you don't have any feeling for it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them can be defined as an experience that cohesively fits into the universe created by J.K. Rowling,"The story takes place in New York City in 1926, approximately 70 years before Harry Potter's journey. Fortunately, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a more adult work. After all, anyone who grew up with the franchise is now an adult today. But don't worry, there will be no lack of magic. The premise could not be simpler - and in fact it yields expendable and childlike scenes. But that's it, it's just the premise. The script, written by Rowling herself, is much more complex than that, inserting several layers, knowing how to insert new pieces in her large board, guaranteeing a totally new look from the viewer. As said before, the feeling is different from being in front of a Harry Potter film and much of this is also due to the way these creatures play an active role within the script, not just in a timely manner like the hippogriff in The Prisoner of Azkaban. The change of air, of course, already gives a new tone to the work.We see the magical universe of the United States being made and form in a magnificent way, with the right to president, congress and very different terms from which we have become accustomed, used in England. It is an excellent expansion of the magical world, in which for the first time we left that more restricted world of Harry Potter and started to realize that the magical world is present in the whole world, as well as in the world of non-magicians. Despite being in a world that shares practically the same rules, each witch society has its cultural differences (the American one is more conservative, in that it does not allow wizards to relate to non-wizards, for example, differently from British society).Leaving England and leaving for the USA offers us a totally different view of this world. Starting with the different laws in relation to non-majs, something that Scamander himself calls backward. It is quite curious, as it is a social / political posture that, on some levels, is similar to what Voldemort preaches, especially with regard to the loving involvement between the two groups. This question only guarantees greater depth to Rowling's creation, one point dialogues with the other, while the word ""bad blood"" (in addition to many other factors, of course), gains an even greater repulsion from the viewer / reader - see, we are speaking of a curse that reflects a position adopted seventy years before the events of A Pedra Filosofal, a gigantic backward conservatism.The interesting thing is the way the text deconstructs this archaic position taken by the Americans. Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) is the one who represents this evolution of thought. From the beginning she had already shown some hesitation in arresting Scamander, but she is in constant conflict between her duty and what she really wants to do. Her sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol), externalizes this internal conflict of the character - one is more restrained, while the other expresses her feelings clearly, acting as ideal female counterparts for Newt and Jacob. The beauty of this is that we do not need to hear this fact through some speech, but we see through Waterston's performance, who gives us a woman who is precisely in the encounter between the past and the future - she, more than anyone, represents the opening the mind to more progressive postures, something that is made clear by your willingness to save Credence and not simply kill him, especially in the final fight inside the subway.It is not that the work is absent from some slips, but its successes are able to stand out so much from the errors in such a way that we effectively feel as if we are facing something new. Although it takes place in the same universe, Fantastic Beasts does not have the same atmosphere as Harry Potter books or films, it manages to give us something totally new, familiar, but with its own identity, in such a way that we are hooked again into this universe of magic. and witchcraft. Rowling demonstrates her talent as a screenwriter by differentiating from the setting of her story, to the characters themselves, creating new personalities who do not simply copy those presented to us over the previous seven books. Above all, we are talking about a work that, despite being a spin-off, manages to stand on its own legs, allowing someone who has never seen or read anything from this mythology to fully enjoy the experience.The script also addresses topics such as fear of the unknown, repression, religious fanaticism and demonstrates an important concern with representativeness when placing a black woman in the position of president of the magical community. And that should be explored further in the next films. Here we have some ""reality clashes"" in moments of wonder. In one second we are amazed by that new face of the Wizarding World and in the other we see the characters having to deal with situations that evoke the worst prejudices and hate speech in our real world.Those who expect a production full of references to Harry Potter will be a little disappointed. But the truth is that it is good that Fantastic Animals is a work more closed in itself. There are quotes, of course, to characters like Dumbledore, to known spells, to famous surnames and to the relics of death, but nothing more than small tips or notes of what is yet to come. Rowling works well with these encounters and mismatches, uniting characters with specific functions to present a different, yet familiar, magical world.
Rowling's narrative mastery is also remarkable in the precise mix of enchantment and terror. The interesting thing is that the plot preferred not to explore Grindelwald's journey in search of a pure race: he decided to go the other way, showing the prejudice of the no-maj (the American denomination for ""muggles"") against the witch community. Prejudice becomes an essential part of the arc of Graves (Colin Farrell) and Credence (Ezra Miller), characters that underlie what we will see from now on.Yates proved to be the right choice for directing Fantastic Beasts. The director has matured a lot over the previous four features in the franchise and is already familiar with all the mythology created by Rowling. In addition, he was responsible for the most serious works of the boy who survived and knows how to print that more adult tone here. Not that children will not identify with the feature, but it is a more universal work in terms of age group, and it is not nearly as bureaucratic as Chris Columbus in The Philosopher's Stone or The Chamber of Secrets. The action scenes are able to deliver something that does not leave us completely confused and the director knows how to differentiate them throughout the film. Each brings us a different situation, allowing the narrative not to sound too repetitive. The presence of Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) is essential here as in the rest of the film. It acts as our new gateway, the non-magic that is recently introduced to all this magic. Our enchantment is ours, since we ourselves know new sides of this universe, from the new creatures, like the charismatic thief of objects that shine, to the terrifying Obscurus.Visually, the film is able to effectively present the contrast between Newt's journey and the destiny of the wizarding world, mixing scenes with lots of light and others that have a dense and gloomy atmosphere. This is very clear in the sequence where Jacob (Dan Fogler) walks inside Scamander's suitcase and walks through well-lit forests, meeting creatures with many colors, until he finds Obscurus, a beast of darkness. All this construction is very well accompanied by the melodies of James Newton Howard, who is able to resume all our fascination with magic through his songs with a more fantastic tone and inherits many of the great names, such as John Williams and Alexandre Desplat, who preceded him.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them can be defined as an experience that cohesively fits into the universe created by Rowling and also opens many doors, with the potential to captivate a new generation of fans who are discovering magic now, a definitive proof of how JK Rowling has control of this universe. More mundane than its predecessor Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them subtly presents the US context at the time, with the post-war, Prohibition and approaching financial crisis, to replace the hero's journey with a historical parallel that must reach World War II. The wizarding world has grown.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So I was in no rush to see this movie. Finally, having seen a preview for the second movie, I felt it was time to watch the first. The previews had dissuaded me as well, because the creatures all seem to be CGI. And they probably are, but I still found myself enjoying the movie. Yes, there were too many computer effects, but the characters and old time setting were fun and well done. The music was also very good. Truthfully, this movie probably couldn't be made with practical, non computer assisted effects, so with what they accomplished, it's actually pretty good.

A very charming and entertaining movie! (no spoilers),"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a movie starring Eddie Radmayne and it's apparently a Harry Potter prequel, although I did not see those movies. This movie tells the story of Newt a wizard who carries a suitcase full of fantastic beasts and from there all sorts of complicated things can happen and so we have a movie.I'll start by saying that for a guy who never seen a Harry Potter movie this movie made me wanna directly watch all those movies. It balances so well magic and real life story with some great set pieces that feel like you are in the 19th century or whenever this movie is set. It was a very entertaining movie with a fantastic performance by Eddie Redmayne. I don't know why this guy reminds me of Matt Smith and his 11th doctor from Doctor Who. Eddie's performance is very good in this movie and in my opinion very underrated. The other performances were also good and really gave the characters enough humanity to make them believable. The score was also excellent, once again James Newton Howard proves his a master with movie music. He scores an extremely versatile music score with comedic and dramatic music blending in so well. The story is somewhat rushed and underwhelming, although I got the overall main plot but certain sub-plots were very weird and not emphasized enough to absorb me into the story. The visuals were great although no match for The Jungle Book. If I was to have some issues i'd be that the movie is not so emotional moving when it tries to be or that some scenes and characters felt weird along with their motivations but overall I got the point of what the movies was about with them.Overall a good movie with good performances and very good music, excellent set pieces especially the costumes (which won an oscar btw), but somewhat of a underwhelming story and some weird scenes and characters. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Naturally this movie doesn't come within miles of any part of the original saga. He reminds the parody to the original more.

Boring.,"This movie indeed was magic! What was so magic? Well, removed the special effects and ... POOF! ... nothing left! JK is rolling in clover and one wouldn't grudge her that, but recycling the wide-eyed characters of Harry Potter films requires no imagination. This film left us literally yawning, hoping it would get better. No luck there.Many, many movies are escapist entertainment, rather than high art. That's okay, Hollywood does amazing things with sound and images, and the product doesn't always have to be profound to be well worthwhile. However, this rehash was as entertaining as television wrasslin', with none of the charmingly ingenious characters.Ideal if you're entertaining very young children.

It feels good to be back in Rowling's world again,"Despite the enormous financial success of the eight-part Harry Potter series, adapted from J.K. Rowling's equally successful books, they never seemed to reach the heights of greatness that their box- office receipts would suggest. The main problem the few directors chosen to adapt the novels faced was having to condense the increasingly bulky word count into a coherent 2 hour plus movie. They were never anything less than fun and enchanting, but the films suffered from cramming in too many plot-lines and character backgrounds, and often felt like they were frantically lunging from one scene to the next. With Potter's time at Hogwarts now over, many wondered where Rowling would go next, and if she would even return to world of wizards, witches and house-elves at all.To the fan's delight, she chose to keep her first screenplay within the same universe as Hagrid and Voldemort, but instead focus on a character frequently mentioned in the books as an author and good friend to headmaster Dumbledore. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was the name of the textbook Harry, Hermione and Ron would often brood over, and Newt Scamander the man behind it. The development of this revered encyclopaedia of the many weird and wonderful creatures unknown to mere muggles is the focus of Rowling's first movie attempt, and the action jumps back in time to 1920s New York to find the young Newt - played with a delightful hunched eccentricity by Eddie Redmayne - discovering a world completely different the one in his native Britain.He is in the U.S. to raise awareness of the need to protect the beloved creatures of the world, and comes with a magical bag stuffed with the oddities. But much like the dangerous world Harry Potter grew up in 70-odd years later, the wizarding community live in fear of an evil wizard named Gellert Grindelwald (I won't spoil who plays him), who has recently murdered several aurors all over Europe. However, Newt has more pressing issues when some of his fantastic beasts escape, and his suitcase accidentally ends up in the hands of bumbling wannabe-baker and muggle ('no-maj' in American) Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). Teaming up with recently-demoted auror Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), Newt must round up the creatures wreaking havoc while convincing the Magical Congress that his pets aren't to blame for several unexplained deaths happening across the city.There's certainly a lot going on in this movie, and early on it feels like Rowling is asking a hell of a lot of the audience in taking in this new ensemble of new characters and a whole new kind of wizarding world (wizard-muggle relationships are strictly banned here). Yet the story quickly falls into place, and Rowling delights in creating a wonderful array of genuinely fantastic beasts, each with their own unique look, quirks and special abilities. With a hushed voice and gently inquisitive personality, Newt instantly brings to mind Sir David Attenborough, one of the greatest human beings on this planet. His briefcase is like a tardis, containing an entire zoo of exotic creatures, each with their own habitat to suit their needs. When Newt takes the awestruck Jacob for a grand tour, it's almost like watching an episode of Planet Earth, and this use of commentary on the state of species' endangerment in the real world adds a bit of depth to the story.Although Alfonso Cuaron certainly made the best entry into the Potter film franchise, David Yates has been the steady hand to guide the series since number 5, so it's of no surprise that he was chosen to take the reins again. Like before, he brings a flair to the magical moments, and the special effects constantly impress (while they may not be up to the recent Jungle Book's standards). Yet the best scenes are during the quieter moments, and in particular a scene at dinner involving a dazed Jacob and Tina's sexy sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), and their charming flirtations. Newt's friendship with Jacob forms the emotional backbone of the story, and Fogler damn near steals the entire film. There's also fine support from Colin Farrell as a shady Congress official, and Samantha Morton and Ezra Miller as a fanatical mother and son rallying no-majs against wizards. While the climax may descend slightly into fight- the-CGI-fart-cloud nonsense, it just feels good to be back in Rowling's world again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Welcome back to the wizardy wonders of Rowling's universe,"They couldn't just leave the Harry Potter universe and shelve it after 8 movies when it proved to be such a success amongst both children and adults alike, thus the ""Fantastic Beasts"" prequels began developing with J.K. Rowling serving as a producer and a writer for the screenplay, putting pen to paper on how exactly she wants to mold the narrative and characters herself.""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" takes place in J.K. Rowling's Wizardly World and follows the adventures of Newt Scamander, a wizard and magizoologist, played brilliantly by Eddie Redmayne, who has a British fairy-tale charm to him that suits the main character to the tee. The movie has a well-bonded cast with the main highlights being Katherine Waterston as a down-to-earth witch and Dan Fogler as a mild-mannered No-Maj.
Unlike the other films of the Harry Potter franchise, this one is set in New York during the 20's and has a very different vibe then your commonly known Hogwarts grounds.While the spells aren't as complex or fun as the ones in Harry Potter, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" counters with various magical creatures to its lore, making it the perfect film for children.""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" continues on the magical stories of the overall franchise and it laid ground for new series of installments without the eponymous young wizard.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie. Average.,"Quite a mix. At times pretty good, but at several points some pretty unpleasant behaviours are ignored, as though inconsequential. And then there's the extensive scenes of no interest to anyone except small children, who probably shouldn't be seeing the carnage and death that pop up not infrequently.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cat and Mouse, Niffler and Newt","An interesting idea from the world of Harry Potter is that wizards could possibly exist parallel to our reality. You can take that world with you and throw suspicious eyes to previously innocuous things. Discarded coffee cups could be port keys. Strung-out homeless people, holding passionate conversations with themselves, could be talking to a great witch or wizard with a concealing charm that we mere muggles can't see. Their private world is such a marvelous amalgam of centuries past that it translates effectively regardless of whether it's 1920 or 2020. What ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" brings is a stunning marriage of the eccentric wizarding world, and New York during the roaring 20's. More than simply changing the venue to a different nation, FB (we are now using this shorthand, word count be damned) grows the fantasy without losing the familiarity of Rowling's brilliant series.One of the greatest elements of this setting is the preexisting climate that parallels the wizarding world. So much of New York's society in the 1920's was underground. The laws dictating temperance and gambling made for an underworld so iconic that it comes to mind, today, much quicker than the standard lifestyle at the time. Think back to when Harry took his first trip to Diagon Alley, through the back of a pub, to the brick wall, a secret knocking sequence opened you to that amazing world. All the best nightclubs in New York in 1926 worked the same way. Between these two subcultures, everything in the margins of the setting holds something astounding.A small concern I had before going into FB was how much time they would take bringing the audience up to speed. As it turns out, virtually zero. If you have no knowledge of the world of Harry Potter prior to seeing this movie, you will unfortunately be lost. For those of us who have devoted a shameful amount of time to accruing Potter knowledge, it's appreciated to get into the theater and hit the ground running. The familiar John Williams score brings us into the cobblestone streets of New York before we get our first glimpse of dark magic.Graves (Colin Farrell) investigates the Nomaj (muggle) streets after a dark force has destroyed half a block. Graves is a Tim Burton wet dream, all black and white without a hint of grey. Based on what we know of the title, a beast is loose. Soon an awkward Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) docks off of Ellis Island wielding his Mary Poppins case that bumps and squeaks with life. Redmayne has a great way of being both boyishly innocent and obliviously selfish in his pursuit to acquire his beasts. He has a one track mind and doesn't seem to have much regard for collateral damage. How he accomplishes this whilst remaining likable is (adjective pending.) The climate of the city is tense. The magical community is up against a Salem-like resurgence of anti-witchcraft evangelicals. Newt couldn't have arrived at a worse time. The Nomaj community's blind fear of magic is paralleled by the magical community's ignorant fear of magical creatures. Newt, obviously, becomes a suspect for the havoc wreaked in the city, and the rest of the film is a whirlwind of cat and mouse, niffler and Newt.We are introduced to many creatures and characters that I won't spoil, but there are two actors who deserve high praise for bringing a level of joy to the feature that makes FB endearing. Dan Fogler as the Nomaj Kowalski, adds beats of humor that are easy to overlook. With Redmayne playing everything straight, the comic relief is necessary but requires Fogler's discipline. The other is Alison Sudol as the witch, Queenie. Sudol is contagious in how much fun she has with this role. Queenie is the perfect complement to Kowalski's fish out of water Nomaj. Their dynamic with each other and as supporting characters is the highlight of the film. The Harry Potter films matured into some truly dark territory that FB doesn't quite venture, but the more kid-friendly feature doesn't feel overly precious. The mysterious antagonist and conflict may grow too far into the absurd for its own good, but how it all fits into the beloved world doesn't give the impression of a spin off cash-grab. The hunger for all things Potter is insatiable and the inevitable sequels to come have an admirable bar to hit.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great Moments, Sme Disappointment","The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.There is plenty to like here. Eddie Redmayne is great (as always), and Dan Fogler is quite a treat. The time the film is set in is interesting. And some things (like the Niffler) are cute and somewhat amusing.The film does rely far too much on CGI creatures, which I suppose is understandable given the source material. Another reviewer said the first half of the film is like ""going to the zoo"", which is fairly accurate. Also, I thought the two child actors were pretty awful. Credence, who is a central part of the story, is just awful... really ruined the whole film. The albino girl was no better.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastical enough,"A fun, fantastical film that extends the universe of Harry Potter. With the screenplay written by J.K. Rowling herself, you can expect some 'Harry Potter' talk in the film. Honestly, being someone who isn't educated with the world of Harry Potter, some terminology did get lost on me. There are too many creatures with names that you can't really follow which they are referring to.In regards to the cast, I do have some doubts. While I agree that Redmayne has the ability and look to fit his character, I think his role in The Danish Girl may have affected his acting here. His tendency to bow his head, and tilt it to the side is characteristic of his previous role, and is out of place in his character as Newt. A bit more charisma from him as the protagonist could have helped the flow of the movie. Farrell, and Waterston did their roles well enough, and while Morton portrays a typical character, she was likable. Another likable character is played by Fogler. His role as Kowalski is pretty much to provide the laughs, and he is easily the best character in the film.I was quite surprised to find out that Miller was the actor behind Credence, as I did not recognize him. He did extremely well in his role of a disturbed child seeking guidance. The emotions he portrays are intense, and fit that of his character perfectly.Visuals play a major element in this film, and the creatures are all agreeably detailed. Some are anthropomorphized (given human attributes), while others are more animal like. Either way, the detail is impressive, and you can tell from the overall shape what type of animal inspired the different creatures.The wizardry effects of magic are also well done. It is nice that the filmmakers included mundane uses for magic (like housework), and not just that for fighting. All the fancy light effects add to the overall theme of the film, and bring color to certain dark settings. I also noticed the soundtrack at certain points - especially during comedic scenes. The background music during these scenes are quite amusing, and definitely exemplifies the atmosphere.Overall, a funny and magical enough film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic!,"*MUST READ*It's a fantastic movie. I know why people hate it.... many people hate it because they think it's incomplete.... the story is awesome but the main story is still not began... it will begin from the second part when grindelwald enters in the story... this movie deserves at least 7/10 but I'm a potterhead...

Fantastic Beasts and where to find em review.,"OK am I the only one who got really frustrated of this movie? I love Harry Potter series, I read all the books and I watched all the movies the minute they were out there. But I was waiting more from Fantastic Beasts. Nice cast, nice characters, but where was all the scenario? What was the point of all this? What was the point of using a good actor like Jon Voight in that role? The only good thing about the movie was Colin Farrel and his transformation which I have to admit was a pretty nice revelation, but I got the feeling that the whole movie was an introduction to a new wannabe good trilogy. Maybe the next movie will be great but this one, not even close. Nice colors, nice humor, nice feelings, but what was the point of the obscurus and Grindewald and the whole chase when everything ended like an ancient Greek tragedy (Deus ex machina)?! Until the end of the movie I could not learn or remember the name of the protagonist, because I did not care. I did not care for anyone of the characters. Harry Potter made you live the story with him, I only felt sad when they caught Grindewald, and that was not supposed to happen. I am bored of all this new movies who try to exploit an old good franchise and a good story but they just don't go further (star wars VII). At least the star wars VII movie was a copy of the first star wars movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great Harry Potter prequel,"Around 70 years before the events from the Harry Potter series, a weird magician travels around the world in search of fantastic creatures which seem to be misunderstood by his kind and without proper care, they can cause mayhem in the non-magical community. In his latest travel to the United States, he has an accident with a normal guy and together get involved in a deep mystery which is threatening the normal course of every day events.Although it doesn't seem much, this plot manages to create a wonderful atmosphere, powered by some very impressive CGI, keeping you interested in the faith of the main characters and their creatures. It's a very good display of magic in the same universe which brought many wonderful moments in a lot of people's childhood. The actors do a good job in portraying their characters, making the whole story more pleasant, very enjoyable and also unexpectedly funny! It's a must see for every Harry Potter fan, every fantasy loving person and everyone who enjoys this genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too bad Eddie Redmayne plays in it,"I wouldn't go that far as saying that this movie is bad. It's a bit of entertainment, for the whole family, with some good CGI moments. If you don't like fantasy movies with weird creatures then you shouldn't watch this one because that's basically the whole movie. The story isn't bad either, not complicated at all, and that's good if you want to watch it with the whole family, kids included. There are some big names in the cast and there are some good actors and actresses, but the major issue I have with this movie is the main character Newt Scamander played by Eddie Redmayne. He is the major letdown of this movie, not only because of his stupid face (that he can't help of course) but because of his acting. He's just not a good actor, and I really don't get what the fuss is about this actor. I can simply not stand his face, and so why women would be attracted to him is just a mystery to me. The movie could have been much better if they had somebody else playing Newt Scamander. For the rest the movie is okay if you like special effects, that are well done, and a bit of fantasy as entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exciting and endearing,"This movie was both exciting and endearing. The set-up is strong: while admittedly setting the stage for further entries, an entirely new magic world is introduced in New York City, with a cast of characters that are exciting to watch. The level of imagination in realizing the setting is, as the title suggests, fantastic. The digital work accomplished on this film is stunning - more than enough so to rival the best of the Harry Potter films. The cast is wonderful with Katherine Waterston- she proves to be a true leading lady- Alison Sudan -wonderfully flirty- and especially Dan Fogler. His dynamic performance and emotional relatibility is the key ingredient to the films success. While Eddie Redmayne portrays the main character admirably, his performance comes off as one-note, making it clear that his acting chops, while underutilized here, are being saved for future installments. Looking forward to what comes next in this franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A worthy extension of the Harry Potter universe,"I like so many others around the world grew up around the Harry Potter universe.At first the wondrous books, then the equally magically movies, author J.K Rowling created an incredible landscape by which we could be encapsulated by and to this day the plight of child wizard Harry Potter and his faithful friends growing up whilst battling the evil forces of Voldemort, remains one of the world's most enduring pop culture experiences.It was inevitable that the continued success of this series would lead to further studio experiences centred around the wand filled world of wizards, witches and in this case fantastical beasts and with Harry Potter creator herself Rowling here adapting her very own short story into a fully-fledged franchise starter, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them will quite simply be a joy to all those who call themselves Potter fans and will offer a fun, often smile inducing adventure for those newcomers to the brand.To be perfectly blunt, Fantastic Beasts is no Harry Potter, but how could it have ever been? Harry Potter is a unique creation and one that will likely never be matched for the consistent quality it provided us with over a series of 7 (now 8) captivating books and 8 incredibly well made films but taking away comparisons to the series laid before it, Fantastic Beasts is one of the most entertaining and original blockbuster films of the year and an often impressive groundwork to what feels like a world filled with possibilities for future installments.Directed by David Yates, an old hat when it comes to the Rowling universe, Fantastic Beasts doesn't bare the initial set up wonders of Harry Potter's first venture into Hogwarts and suffers slightly from a mildly paced middle section but when the film clicks into gear it really rockets along as we're transported into an equally majestic world where suitcases offer portals to animal filled habitations, unique beasts run amok in a visually spectacular recreation of 1920's New York and muggles threaten to expose those with magical powers. With the world created here by Yates and his team so lively and energetic, it's within the films characters that Fantastic Beasts has the most area to grow in with Eddie Redmayne's bundle of nerves Newt Scamander a relatively forgettable central figure, even if his work with the various animal creations of Rowling's universe are anything but.Surrounded by comic relief supplied by Dan Fogler's non-magical wannabe baker Jacob Kowalski and Katherine Waterston's hardworking ministry employee Tina, we might not exactly have Harry, Ron and Hermoine but you get the sense there are clear possibilities for this trio to become every bit as endearing as the old gang, even if Redmayne has his work cut out for him.With solid support provided by the slightly underused Colin Farrell and Ezra Miller (giving of those creepy Kevin vibes) as the films potentially dangerous members, even more so than the escaped beasts of Scamander's suitcase, the all-round vibe of Yate's film is one of quality and assurance and you very much get the sense that everyone involved here is in for the long haul, just as we the audience will be to.A joy to back in the universe that has given so many memories that will last forever, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a worthy extension of the Harry Potter universe and while this first entry into the new franchise may lack certain important ingredients that would've made it just as memorable as our first year in Hogwarts, there's enough here (including an end game reveal likely to either excite or frustrate audiences) to suggest our future journey's discovering the magical inhabitants of the world are going to be highly entertaining indeed.3 ½ mating rituals out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprised by the negative reviews on IMDb,"As the heading suggests I am very surprised by the negative reviews on here, I am a big fan of the Harry Potter movies & wasn't overly keen to see a new franchise start up just yet as they did such a good job with the original films, so I did wait a while to see this film, but I was impressed with how much better it was than I thought it would be. This was a great prequel to the Harry Potter world, this movie does a good job at setting up a whole new world without relying heavily on the original Harry Potter movies.The things I liked about the film:The visuals - were outstanding here as all the monsters were really well done & quite different from what we have seen before (especially that oversized rino). Especially once you seen what was inside that suitcase, the world & monsters within really were visually impressive.Characters - Newt was generally a like-able character as the main hero, I hadn't heard much about him before but thought he did a good job in this film. Kowalski was good as the comic relief for the film but also added some surprising emotional scenes towards the end of the film which I did think was a nice addition to his character. Colin Farrell as Graves was quite menacing as the main villain & the nice little twist at the end only enhanced his character too.The only negatives I have for the film is that as it kicks off a new universe I feel that there was some things left unexplained such as the Lestrange character, sometimes getting the feeling that often happens in set-up movies that there are many story lines crammed into the one movie, however we can only hope that these story lines are touched on more in future films.I am now certainly looking forward to the fantastic beasts & where to find them franchise & what lies ahead.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A fun film to watch with friends or family, though nothing noteworthy...","IMDb is probably the only place in the world where I can proudly go around saying that I watched the movies and never read the books for anything that has a movie or a book. In that sense, I wouldn't consider myself a rabid fan of the Harry Potter franchise, but I have seen every single one of the movies and loved each one as a kid. Now, we're getting another look at the wonderful world of wizardry, and though I was skeptical at first (I'll admit, I don't like sequels or spinoffs), to my surprise, this was a really fun movie to watch.I went to go see it with a friend of mine, and we had our fair share of laughs, wows, and ""awww""s. It was an interesting and, compared to the original series, original story with some pretty quirky characters. Sometimes, these characters felt really cheesy (the cast being filled up with the awkward protagonist who actually knows what he's talking about but no one will listen to, the fussy law abiding sidekick, the love interest, and the comic relief), but in the end, it really didn't make a difference. I honestly didn't walk into the theater expecting for the character ark of a lifetime. Sometimes, you just need a few cheesy characters in an action flick, which is exactly what this movie offers.Overall, the film wasn't anything noteworthy. Don't expect something that'll last with you for more than a month, or even a few days. I probably won't see this movie again in the near future, but hell I probably would say the same thing for something like Warcraft or maybe even Star Trek Beyond. It's neither a good thing nor a bad thing, it just goes to show that it's nothing more than a fun action movie. It has cute cgi, cool characters, a good plot that kept me awake after 9:30pm when I went to go see it... But it also had it's set of flaws as well.Now to those of you who've actually seen Harry Potter and are expecting to see some more wizard action, here's some good and bad news. The film really had that whole Harry Potter ""magical world of wizardry"" feel to it. The characters ran around and pointed their wands at things, the pictures were moving around like real people, everything you wouldn't find in the real world had freaky names like ""Squigglewiggles"" or ""Shnorpblops""... The only thing that I thought was lacking was the actual world the characters were in. In the original series, the protagonists were surrounded by floating candles and shifting hallways. In Fantastic Beasts, though, the protagonists are running around in... the real world, surrounded by...... real people. I didn't pay $9.50 to see regular people in the regular world! It might not sound so important, but there was something so charming about Hogwarts that Fantastic Beasts lacks. There were only a few scenes that took place in actual magical locations that had these freaky floating candle style things, but the rest just lacked the charm.Another major issue I had with the film is pretty minor, but it had to do with the antagonist. You see a quick shot of the antagonist at the very beginning and the very end of the film, and that's it. You don't even see his face until the very end. He might've been mentioned in passing in one of the original films or in one of the books, but I know I missed it and was pretty confused as to who the hell this guy was. I ended up having to look him up to find out why he was actually significant, cause he really doesn't seem so bad in Fantastic Beasts. There were some newspaper clippings at the very beginning which I assume described this guy at least a little, but they just flew right by so quickly that I didn't really get a chance to understand what they said.All in all, Fantastic Beasts is a good, fun movie. Nothing more, nothing less. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. I wouldn't see it a second time, but I'm glad I saw it the first. I was very surprised in the end to find out that this spin off was worth my time to go see, and would gladly suggest it to anyone looking for a good time with some friends or family.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantasy and the art of animalove,"This is one of my favorite movies that I have watched this year. The setting of the movie is reminiscent of London in an old style. I felt that the movie suggested that some hidden problems in society are better to be left to the elite away from the laymen whom it's better for them to be obliviated. Whether this is a true or false is a matter of personal choice. In other words, the movie depicted a world that has an alternative world where a group of people have more power, secrets, wisdom and transcendence. A world that is so centralized to the extent that the government, the people are to accept the wisdom of the Group who has the power. This rhetoric repeats over and over in many other movies where few govern many because the many are helpless in facing problems bigger than them unlike the few who are surrounded by mystics and mysteries. This leaves us with the question: do we need magicians so we can breed and tame these fantastic beasts? some questions will have to wait.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Harry Potter-lite,"Though I can't say that I loved this film, it did get me excited for the entries to follow this one.

A worthy conitnuation AND a great new start.,"A Harry Potter spinquel (spin-off prequel for those playing at home) relocated from the wonderful wizarding school of Hogwarts to the streets of New York circa 1920, the latest Potter-verse entry is an adventurous old-school delight. It thankfully ditches the origin story template to throw us headfirst into the escapades of clumsy British wizard Newt (Eddie Redmayne), as he bumbles his way through the bustling streets of Manhattan trying to recapture his exotic creatures before the close-minded humans harm them. Along for the ride is lovable muggle Kowalski (Dan Fogler), an inspiring baker just trying to catch a break in life, and by-the-book wizardry enforcement agent Tina (Katherine Waterston), a socially awkward love interest for Newt. This ragtag group—also including Tina's mind-reading sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) on occasion—stumble upon a curious string of incidences involving dark magic which, although a little too convenient at times, keep the pace rollicking along at such a speed you'll barely notice the contrivances. Series veteran David Yates is calling the shots on his fifth Potter-verse outing and at this point, with his fantasy-action chops refined after the climactic battle of Deathly Hallows, he knows how to hit all the right buttons. The dragon in a teacup set piece is immensely enjoyable; the wand battles are always gratifying to watch; and the havoc-wreaking finale is largely engaging despite featuring a strangely nondescript villain that really could've done with some sprucing up. Visually it is an upgrade from the preceding movies with the stunning period set design and advanced CGI giving it an edge, although the visual palette is still very much shared with the other instalments. Both a worthy continuation and a wonderful fresh start, Fantastic Beasts avoids franchise fatigue with quirky new characters, a superb period setting and a quick-moving tale that establishes an intriguing over-arching storyline.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Welcome Back, Wizards","As a Harry Potter fan, it is hard to judge ""Fantastic Beasts"" without comparison to the Potter films. Fantastic Beasts has its own magic and charm, but gone are the supporting characters--Dumbledore, Snape, the Dark Lord, etc, which made the Potter stories so good. I can't see any of the characters introduced in ""Beasts"" as stepping into those roles. Colin Farrell does well as the dark magic heavy; Eddie Redmayne is great as Newt, the Zookeeper. As usual these days in Hollywood the special effects carry the day and make what was an OK movie into a very watchable one. They say this story arc has five more movies and I would imagine they'll take the story right up to the birth of Mr Potter. Should be fun!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Welcome back to the Wizarding World,"It has been quite some time since the last Harry Potter film that ended off the battle against Voldermort and Harry living happily ever after. The story was over and we were all sad to see it leave, but we were also happy back when we heard we were getting prequel films. Still there were a lot of mixed reactions on the idea if Warner Bros was just trying to milk the franchise for all it was and wasn't caring about telling a good cohesive narrative. But let me put those fears to rest.Fantastic Beasts is a joy to watch.It is a world were we the original Harry fans are finally older now and these new characters are all adults too. The beasts are fun and good to watch. The story keeps you entertained and Newt's development is a ride you will enjoy taking from beginning to end. You learn to love these characters and the story there trying to tell. It is just in general a really great time to see. Fantastic Beasts is quite amazing.The film does suffer from some pacing issues though. I didn't really like how it transitioned from the dark and terrible story to the more light hearted stories they were trying to tell. Katherine Waterson's character I thought also needed more to do in this film as her journey wasn't as compelling as I really wanted it to be either. Ezra Miller played a very good villain, but because of the strange transitions didn't really allow for you to care enough about his struggles or what he was going through.Still overall this is a very well made film. It pulls the fans of this franchise back into this world in a big way and keeps it fun as well. I love all the actors involved in making this movie and I love the characters that go with them. The story was engaging from beginning to end and all in between. This movie gets a thumbs up for me",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"Much more than expected, a variety of surprises, a new legend of the cannon! Once again, she was overwhelmed by Rowling's talent.

Cringeworthy Rubbish,"I like Harry Potter series, the last film of 2 parts was really spellbinding, and the serious tone of later books / films was oretty cool. OK, I said, this film is a part of Potter universe, and also, there are several excellent actors there - this one should be great effort. No, very loud and very clear No. Eddie Redmayne is te first and the main cringeworthy factor here - his drunken, sloppy, shaky delivery smacks of such obvious amateur aura that it makes it not even funny - it makes it sick and shallow. Evrything is a flop here - it is not a kid fairy tale, being too violent and vile. It is not a serious later Potter film, being too silly and sleazy. It is not even a parody, being too serious to its demerit. Another awful mess is Colin Farrel's part, leaving only smork and sickness

"Entertaining, but with a lot of problems","Let me say up front that this is not a bad movie. But I notice a lot of Potter-fans are looking at this movie through rose-colored glasses, and are unable to see its obvious flaws. This is a pretty flawed movie. Fun, but not great.But lets start with the good. The characters are fun, the visuals are stunning and impressive. And the amazing Potter atmosphere of whimsy is all over this film. I also liked how the music of the movie starts with the soft Potter-theme, and then immediately abandons it for the rest of the film, and sticks with its own new theme music. There's plenty of references for fans to enjoy, but you do not need to be a Potter fan to understand what is going on in the film. This movie can very much stand on its own.But now the bad. The movie seems to forget that it has a plot for about half of its running time. For most of the movie we follow the main character in his quest to retrieve his missing animals all over New York, which is fun, but has very little to do with the main plot. It seems as if the movie suddenly remembers that it has a villain (who is briefly mentioned with quick flashes of newspapers during the opening) and it forgets that it still has to build towards a finale. Out of nowhere the final act is suddenly dropped into the movie. That is a bit sloppy, and it leaves the main villain very undeveloped. I also think many of the characters are a bit shallow, and steeped in stereotypes and clichés.Technically, the movie feels a bit sloppily edited at times, which makes some scenes hard to follow. And especially during the final act there are a lot of bright flashing lights that are a pain on the eyes if you are sitting in a dark theater.That said, I was still entertained. But the film critic in me feels that this should have been a lot better. I also noticed that I had a hard time remembering the names of most of the main characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Harry but not bad,"One of the most endearing things in Fantastic Beasts is a cast not entirely chosen from the 1% most beautiful people. Instead we get an eclectic mix of cute, interesting, and folks like you and me. This makes the movie more approachable, although there are a few overly sappy and contrived moments.There are no potential Oscar performances, and despite the amping up of some stock evil baddies to fuse blowing levels no moments of genuine terror. That's not to say there is not a lot of talent - there just isn't enough depth in any of the characters to bring it out.Those expecting a Harry Potter movie will be disappointed.

The potential of The Wizarding World is limitless,"Have you ever wished you could erase an entire series, book, movie from your mind? Just so that you could experience it for the first time all over again. Of course you have, but we never get that opportunity. With this film we do get something pretty close though. I never thought I would experience the Wizarding World for the first time again, and yet with the release of this film, we do.There are no spoilers here but I will tell you to look out closely for the name of Jacob Kowalski's bakery's name when he is showing his plans at the bank. The initials JK for a man selling rolls has the potential for a nod to the most important person associated with the franchise.The question Warner Bros will have been asking themselves is - How do we make more Harry Potter films without Harry Potter?In the end they settled for new compelling characters, a new environment, new beasts! But underlying all this was the same atmosphere from the earlier Harry Potter films. Light-hearted humour that entertains, with serious scenes that remind you that even in the world of magic and wonder, there is threat.From eight fantastic Harry Potter films we have developed a good understanding of the British Wizarding World so where better to explore next than America. From smaller changes such as using the term no- maj in place of muggle, and outrageous laws such as no marrying a 'no- maj', it becomes clear that the US will be a very interesting location for further Fantastic Beast Films.The film features fantastic actors that play their roles perfectly and incredible CGI that really brings these fantastic beasts to life.

Being a huge fan of the Harry Potter books,"Being a huge fan of the Harry Potter books and an okay fan of the movies, I was excited to discover more about Newt's beasts: kudos to the screenwriters for the intersting characters and story, amazing Redmayne and such a funny Fogler who makes a hilarious newby thrown into the magical madness.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A J.K Rowling tale about the muggle society and how wizards manage in such areas,"I've read all the Harry Potter books including the 8th screenplay based book except for Fantastic Beasts. But after watching the trailer, I realized how much I missed the HP franchise. This movie focuses on a complete different story but with major elements from previous films.Acting- the performances were highly strong. Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterson were great in their respective roles. These 2 actors will raise the bar in this reboot franchise.David Yates is a phenomenal director apart from Tarzan, he still accomplished the end of the last 3 Harry Potter movies with the resonance he captured of Hogwarts and the wand battles. Similarly for this movie, he brought back the same mentality by shooting New York consistently well.Rowling's story and screenplay was well maintained by the cast members although the memory erase scene was a too short which ended the movie a bit too soon. The vintage concept was executed a mile up which means it was wonderful. This fantasy drama will keep you to the edge of the seat especially how they showed the relationship between muggles and wizards especially the No-Mahjs on how they were dealt with.This movie will describe the benchmark of the fantasy drama in Hollywood Cinema. Can anyone give Tim Burton some advice on how to use VFX and set designs properly because Ms. Peregrine was just absolute rubbish apart from the acting.Overall, this movie was great but be a bit cautious about the climax but for bookworms, they'll change their minds and go for the suspense of the ending. J.K Rowling is on her way for the best writer award anytime soon. Honestly I enjoyed Harry Potter films than this but it's still a worth watching film. Since it has a suspense, focus on finishing your popcorn rather than gazing your eyes towards the suspenseful scenes.This movie deserves a Wigardium Leviosa in terms of box office.4/5- Bollywood franchises suck but not Hollywood as long as they follow the same ethics and procedures",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wish I'd waited for Redbox,"Was expecting a well crafted story with characters I would like to follow into sequels, so disappointed this movie didn't deliver.

A delightful watch!,"As a person who is not a 'fan' of the Harry Potter universe per se (I enjoyed the books, the movies, the games, but that's about it), the movie was thoroughly entertaining in terms of the totally new perspective of the wizarding world that we know of - a fully fledged wizarding community in an entirely new environment, outside of Hogwards.The two male protagonists are brilliant - Eddie as Newt, a cool wizard whose slightly clumsy, but is really caring of his magical 'beasts'. And Jacob Kowalski, the food-loving No-Maj (American 'Muggle') thrown into the accidental beast-hunt, provides most of the comic relief.The storyline itself is slightly overcooked, with abrupt plot-changes, but enjoyable all the same with some splendid visual effects.Worth watching, especially in 3D.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better then i thought it will be,"Greetings from Lithuania.I never was a big fan of ""Harry Potter"" series, but i liked all of the movies. Those were kinda better then ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" (2016) - in my opinion. That said i never intended to see ""Fantastic Beasts"", but yet i did finally at at the end i wasn't disappointing, but that is because i didn't expect much. It has a lot and good special effects, but not that special. Set design was very good as well all of production design. Yet the movie dragged, not much but at running time 2 h 5 min it could have been a bit shorter.Overall, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is not a bad movie at the end, i wasn't disappointing.

The Hobbit, a simple, lovely, one-volume children's story was over-inflated into a bloated three-movie monstrosity.And now, the Potter universe is being stomped and punched and bled to death in the same manner.I morn.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun Flick, More of an Introductory Film Into Another Harry Potter Series","Movie captures the glamour and mystery that many other Harry Potter films have done. Like many of the Harry Potter films, it was able to introduce new lore into the film. Newt, the main character in the film goes to the United States with a brief case that contains a collection of mysterious creatures. He introduces a new wizard world of the United States that seems to operate separately and independently from the Ministry of Magic, Hogwarts and the rest of the European Wizard World. You can hear comparisons between how the wizard world in the United States governs as well as how good their Wizard Schools are. If and when they decide to expand the Harry Potter Universe there is a lot of potential settings and plots that they can create. The film seems to try to venture a new route that stems away from a more traditional, European, feel.The real connection between the movie and the book is going to be Grindlewald. In fact, the plot in the film stems around his influence. As such, this creates another window and direction for the film to go to. For those fans who know, his history actually has a lot of dark vibes and connections with characters that are important to the franchise.As far as I can tell, this film creates potential for a lot in the series. I actually think this film acts as an experiment with a different setting, different time period, and different type of characters for the franchise.Now for the important part... WHAT ABOUT THE FANTASTICAL BEASTS... saved this for last because I'm afraid the film didn't really hit a home run on this one. I guess you care more if you really read the books and know a bit about them already about the creatures and history of the Harry Potter world. The film focuses on a few of the creatures. You briefly see a few beasts when he enters his briefcase, which is essentially a beast haven where they live together peacefully... An attempt here to not scare children I assume. If you look at the creatures in the actual book its quite a bit darker. You have a brief view of this world for a few minutes. After that there are like three creatures that escape his briefcase that he needs to put back in. The main creature that we have an issue with in his film is the Obscurus, which is essentially an wizard to develops a dark side that is uncontrollable. Not really a fantastic beast because it pretty much behaves like a possessed human being except its something the wizard creates. The film definitely fails to show the magic of the actual book. The movie portrays something more resemblant to zoo animals and fails to show the more interesting creatures. No dragons.... really?Again, the movie does some nice and interesting things for the rest of the series. Overall, a fun flick. If you are a hardcore fan who is expecting that really looks into the creatures of the Harry Potter world, then you might be disappointed. I feel Goblet of Fire actually did a lot better job showing it's worlds creatures. Besides that though, I think the film does a good job at giving you several ways it can expand. As such, it gives you hope considering there was so much lore... history... and plots in the Harry Potter universe that it was a shame it was thought to have ended with its last film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts is a fantastic adventure which is a must watch for Harry Potter and J.K.Rowling fans and an entertaining watch for other audience.,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016): It has been 5 years since we bid farewell to Harry Potter series.But still we live in that same magic world and roam in the corridors of Hogwarts with many memorable characters.But surprisingly J.K.Rowling wrote Fantastic Beasts,a spin off for Harry Potter series which happens seventy years before Harry's visits Hogwarts.Fun fact is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a subject for first years in Hogwarts.So how is this revisit to our memorable era?Plot: In 1926,Holding a mysterious leather suitcase in his hand, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a young activist wizard from England, visits New York while he is on his way to Arizona. Inside his expanding suitcase hides a wide array of diverse, magical creatures that exist among us, ranging from tiny, twig-like ones, to majestic and humongous ones. It is the middle of the 20s and times are troubled, since the already fragile equilibrium of secrecy between the unseen world of wizards and the ordinary or ""No-Maj"" people that the MACUSA Congress struggles to maintain, is at risk of being unsettled. In the meantime, the voices against wizardry keep growing with daily protests lead by Mary Lou Barebone(Samantha Morton) and fuelled by the increasing disasters ascribed to a dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). At the same time, by a twist of fate, Newt's precious suitcase will be switched with the identical one of an aspiring No-Maj baker, Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), while demoted Auror, Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), arrests Newt for being an unregistered wizard. To make matters worse, with the suitcase in the wrong hands, several creatures manage to escape to unknown directions. Before long, this situation will catch Senior Auror Percival Graves (Clive Owen)' attention who will target both Tina and Newt amid panic caused by an invisible, devastating and utterly unpredictable menace that still wreaks havoc in New York's 5th Avenue. Is there a hidden agenda behind Graves' intentions and ultimately, what will happen to the remaining magical creatures still loose in the streets?Plus Points:1)Screenplay: J.K.Rowling is highly successful in writing her debut screenplay for her own book.This movie is highly entertaining with memorable scenes and characters.The scenes involving Newt and Jacob searching his escaped beasts is adventurous at its best.Even the beats are so likable like adorable Niffler, who is drawn to shiny objects, an emotional Bowtruckle called Pickett who has attachment issues, a thunderbird, an occamy (a cross between and dragon and a bird), and an Erumpent (a giant beast that's somewhere between a rhino and an elephant), just to name a few. We have a lot of hilarious moments in this entertaining adventure.2)Visual Effects: They are brilliant.As you'd expect from a Warner Brother production, the 3D effects would literally make you jump off your seats. It has good popping out effects but its in-depth is bit unsatisfying.3)Performances: Academy Award Winner,Eddy Redmayne is at his best form after since Theory of Everything.Eddie Redmayne did justice to his role as the awkward, blundering yet adorable wizard Newt. His love for beasts and outwardly creatures reminded us of Hagrid.Dan Fogler and Eddie shares great chemistry as pals.Clive Owen is decent in his villainous act.Alison Sudol and Queenie is so beautiful with cute and sexy expressions.Katherine is decent in her innocent Auror role.4)Music: Movie starts with classic Hedwig Theme.SO nothing else to say about highly nostalgic music which reminds us of our Harry Potter days.So,Fantastic Beasts is a fantastic adventure which is a must watch for Harry Potter and J.K.Rowling fans and an entertaining watch for other audience.My rating 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as Good as it Could Have Been,"The premise is exciting, the cast is interesting, the scenery is great. But somehow it doesn't hold together really well, or to say differently: it's not better than the Harry Potter movies.It will be a good TV movie for children to watch, but it's never going to be remembered as great cinema.It suffers from the same ""dryness"" as the Harry Potter series. Director David Yates simply has difficulty transmitting the magical world atmosphere in his adaptation of J.K. Rowling's material. Some nice CGI will not make up for conventional editing.The biggest flaw is the very limited and barely functional usage of music. For long period of times there is no music at all, and if one thing is important in a movie about magic, it's music. It's just stack on under some scenes in a cheap fashion.Then there is the music itself, that after recycling the Harry Potter theme in the intro disappear into the realm of unimportant art forms. It's just a few orchestral effects here and there, no memorable themes.David Yates doesn't seem to understand that music is just as important as the images.In short: The direction in general is way too conventional for a movie about magic. All the costume, set designers and actors did an great job with what they had.Just wished it had been better.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ten Stars,"A real review of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: They're beasts we'd all wish to find in our closets or under our beds. Life would be so very much more interesting. It's not hard to understand why Newt Scamander wants to carry them all with him in a suitcase.Eddie Redmayne stole my heart in the first five minutes. He's somehow so wizardly, so exactly what you'd expect to find trotting around J.K. Rowling's phenomenal world that you instantly know that he could be your best friend. His gentle kindness calls to mind Hagrid, the Weasleys, and Dumbledore all at once. Remember thinking that the good wizards were so much nicer than any of us?Dan Folger was a completely enchanting surprise. The nasty side kick from Good Luck Chuck is indiscernible in this innocent and spell- bound U.S version of a muggle. I wanted to put him in my pocket and take him home with me. If ever there was a worthy exception to the rules about muggles remembering, he is it.The movie is a visual masterpiece, not least because Johnny Depp is in it. It's joyous, mysterious, magical and tragic. Tragic because putting Johnny Depp in a movie for only two seconds and then making me wait two years to see him in the role is an absolute tragedy. I love J.K. Rowling's skill at weaving a tale. It's unrivaled. It's breathtaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Magical Fun that Subtely Brings us Back to this Universe,","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a fun, light hearted film that takes us back in to the Harry Potter universe in an enchanting way, as we follow Newt Scamander in 1920s New York, in which the beasts in his briefcase escape and he gets tangled up in the city's secret community of wizards. The effects are dazzling and the creatures are brought to life in a manner that will make you smile, while keeping you at the edge of your seat.The pacing was slightly off, and that is why I am giving it an eight instead of a nine. There are a lot of scenes that were much longer than they needed to be, dragging out and being too dialogue heavy. As well as that, there are exciting moments that the audience would have been anticipating that were cut short, I found the sequence at the end to be particularly quick. I believe this is a result of J.K. Rowling being used to writing books and not screenplays, which will not take up lots of time to develop their characters, something that becomes a bit tedious in a film.The cast certainly shines, Eddie Redmayne is terrific in the lead role, truly dedicating himself to the character as always. Katherine Waterston is so good I did not even realise it was her till I saw her name in the credits, Dan Fogler brought in great comic relief, as well as playing a well rounded character and Colin Farrell has a great, mysterious presence on screen.It is a feel good film that kept me smiling throughout, the magic reminded me of the cinematic experience I had been missing since 2011. Whimsical, fun and with a stellar cast, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has its flaws, but it was a fun ride, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy or adventure.An adventurous wizard enters New York with a briefcase fool of wild beasts, chaos ensues once he mixes his bag up with a mortal and several creatures escape.Best Performance: Eddie Redmayne / Worst Performance: Ezra Miller",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Fantastic Beast all on it's own.,"I was not sure if I wanted to see this or not, which is one of the reasons why I waited so long to catch it. Not that I'm a super huge fan of ""the Wizarding World of Harry Potter"", but I did feel that this film might be a stretch. I remember the book being mentioned in one of the films, but never thought it would be such a big deal that you can make a movie about the author.Newt Scamander is a wizard and Hogwarts alum, that comes to New York sometime in the 40s with a bag full of beast and the knowledge to handle one that's terrifying the city .The movie is set apart from the Harry Potter franchise which is really cool. Rather than doing a spin off of one of the other kids that went to Hogwarts with Harry or about one of the teachers when they were students at Hogwarts, JK Rowling goes big showing us a world seventy years prior to Potter and across the pond as they say...across the pond. American wizards are slightly different than those in Great Britain, like there treatment of Muggles (which they refer to as No-Majs).I think I prefer the adult Wizarding world as well. The film deals with some dark themes like child abuse. Although at the same time it's ironically less complicated. Fantastic Beast reads like an action adventure more on the action side than the adventure.The film has a pretty impressive cast as well. I was a little surprised that Eddie Redmayne, who just recently won an Oscar off of two back to back academy nominated performances was willing to play Newt Scamander. Than again, he was good in it as the awkward unlikely hero of the film. Ezra Miller has a small role in it, but I guest his starring role as DC's the Flash has not come out yet. Plus Collin Farrell. Not the draw he use to be but still. Overall, an amazing cast. My Favorite is Dan Fogler as the Muggle...I mean No-Maj, who has the fortune of being in the right place at the right time to see all the magic happen.Fantastic Beast I think is my favorite film in the franchise, not much from me as I'm not a huge fan of the movies or the books, but as a stand alone one of the best action adventures I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Before Harry Potter...,"First of all, I have to say this: J.K. Rowling is a GENIUS. She's one of the few genius storytellers that the world should have more of. She's one of the few storytellers who created an entire universe, like J.R.R. Tolkien with Lord of the Rings or George R. R. Martin with Game of Thrones. And now, after her enormous success with Harry Potter, she writes a spin-off based off of a textbook that belonged to Harry Potter in his first year at Hogwarts: ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" by Newt Scamander. It takes place in 1920's New York, 70 years before Harry went to school. The visual effects of the film certainly displayed the production budget of $180 million. The money was definitely on the screen. I went to see this movie in Harry Potter apparel, complete with a Deathly Hallows necklace, expecting it to expand on the Harry Potter universe and when I came out, I was slightly disappointed. I felt like it didn't really expand on the universe and instead aimed to be its own film, which in a way is good. Don't get me wrong; it still was wonderfully whimsical, but I feel like it just didn't have that much to offer. Because of that and also its slightly incoherent and confusing story, I'm giving this film a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horrible,"I can only summarize the movie as horrible. This movie is confusing, poorly acted, awfully directed and a five year old can write a better script.I love Harry Potter, read all the books (a few times) and seen all the movies. This movie is something completely different and though it tries to hint that it is in Harry Potter world I can't seem to find one redeeming quality in this film that has any connection what so ever to Harry Potter. The movie was flat out boring and unwatchable, some cringe moments added in with sup par effects made me face palm myself saying out loud ""What is going on here?""To make it short, this movie is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long while, it's a complete mess with a very weak plot.

What this movie is NOT,"It's NOT a grand view of the wizarding world of New York. It barely exists.

The story might be subpar and derivative but the quality of the acting and delivery is first rate.Our Newt Scamander is an AMAZING character in the HP universe and Eddie Redmayne nails his role so perfectly, you could see this movie once and never forget him.It's worth it for the noble tale and the incredible cast.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Another taste of magic to keep Harry Potter fans satiated.,"As someone who never fully immersed themselves in the Harry Potter fandom, this spin-off wasn't high on my ""to watch"" list. Sure, I liked the movies well enough for the continual narrative they provided (still haven't gotten to the books yet), and I understand that this parallel universe full of magic is a unique idea that hasn't been explored in this fashion, but this just seems like a tag-along to capitalize on a successful franchise. That's not to say that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) isn't good, it's just that it does require a bit of background knowledge in order to fully ""get it.""Partly because seeing wizardry and magic in the modern era might still seem odd, this throwback to the past is only made better by placing it in the United States. Both of these settings differ from the main Harry Potter franchise enough to be both a side-story as well as a prequel that explores some of the more obscure aspects of the mythos. While there are subtle chastisements at the closed-mindedness of Americans, there also wasn't much difference between the American magic and the British kind (other than what they called things). I would have almost liked it better if there were ""Tommy gun"" wands and New York magical mafias. Granted, there was a little of this last one, but not enough to be truly ""American.""In the end, Fantastic Beasts fails to deliver a solid antagonist for the ""uninitiated,"" since the anti-magic character didn't seem to affect the actions of the main character much at all, and the ""true"" villain was revealed at the end, but with no context (other than spinning newspapers at the very beginning) as to why he was bad or what he did to deserve his punishment. All this being said, Fantastic Beasts did provide a bit of entertainment and managed to show us some ""fantastic beasts"" along the way, as it promised.Another taste of magic to keep Harry Potter fans satiated, I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 3.0 stars out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Redmayne was great...,"Redmayne was great...As well as Waterson and a great job by Kowalski... these 3 characters carried the movie...Ferrell was completely miscast ... he's not the actor I once thought he was.. he plays the same solemn angry guy every time, I think thats his real persona. So many actors are like that.. they play themselves but can't ever really act when they're called to creat a character. He's way way overrated as an actor...but the other 3 were just 'fantastic'.
The movie had great scenes of the Beasts and such but there wasn't much of a plot. If it weren't for Redmayne I suspect this would have been a major flop. Kowalski too was just great...

"Unrelatable characters, show off CGI, 0 emotional impact.","I went into this movie with a very open mind. I am not a Potter-head, but I am not totally ignorant either, I heard about a horcrux, I know who Dumbledore is ... and I like magical fantasy movies ... but I have not been that non-entertained in a long time. The characters all felt distant to me, could not relate, as if I had missed a prequel or something. Hence I ended up not caring about the convoluted plot that felt like the old Potter problem: too many things in one book trying to squeeze into one movie. I found myself checking for the run time of the movie in the middle to see when I can go. The CGI and set pieces were great eye candy, which is a total waste when the audience lost track or simply does not care anymore. The creature design felt very uninspired.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pretty good,"As the movie started it turned out to have a great mix of creativity. Many movie reinstatements run out of ideas (like Star Wars) and have a plot that reuses introduction and much of other parts of their previous releases. This movie is a great exception to this tradition.The movie, I will refer to it that way since the name is long, contained what other Rowling movies usually contain, imagination and newness. When When you watch this new installation you will not feel like it has been played before, and that it contains materials unique to its own making.Humor is grand in many parts, including satire, sarcasm, bluntness, and other means. Bits of romance also exist in the movie, but even with slight presence it had my admiration.

Not for the youngings,"So much about this movie was delightful, I don't even know where to begin. I've had the pleasure of meeting Eddie redmayne and he was perfectly cast as the kind, gentlemanly newt. His chemistry with his co stars flowed so well and everyone was well cast, although I will say I hope we get to see more of queenie in the sequels. She was so sweet and felt quite neglected. On to my title of this review, I am a 30 year old woman who grew up with Harry Potter and am used to JK venturing into dark places. (The actor who played young tom In 'half blood prince' was especially creepy) but the extraordinary casting (and acting) of Ezra miller made me downright terrified. That whole family was disturbing but his twist (along with Colin Ferrell's) was just jaw dropping and bone chilling! I rate this film excellent for a reason- JK gave it equal measures light, whimsical and fun, and dark and scary all at once! Definitely a film made for the potter generation but IMO too dark for anyone younger.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lackluster spinoff from the Potter-verse,"British wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) shows up in 1926 New York carrying a suspiciously animate briefcase and soon strange beasts are running wild in Manhattan. Superimposed on this situation are some secondary stories of a dark wizard trying to establish a magical Reich, a disgraced Auror (Katherine Waterston), and a muggle cannery worker (Dan Fogler) who wants to be a baker. There is not much of a plot, the movie is primarily a series of CGI set pieces strung together. Typical of Rawling's 'Harry Potter' stories (and movies), there is a lot of clever imagery and imaginative moments that serve to cover frequent inconsistencies or lapses in logic in the plot and the ending of the film is especially contrived and flimsy (see 'goofs' for details). The 'fantastic beasts', while well rendered, are not particularly interesting, perhaps because they were just made up for the movie (the vivification of 'mythical' creatures was one of the highlights of the Potter series). The movie also suffers from the trend in the HP series to make the 'magic' more action-friendly: the wizards now handle their wands like handguns and fire spells at their nemeses, making 'magic battles' look like shootouts in Star Wars. The script is OK and the actors are all quite good in the roles (especially the central three characters) but overall, the movie is an uninspired 'by-the-numbers' opus targeting a guaranteed audience of Potter-philes.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Messy, yet decent","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is messy, yet decent. Although it's weakened by distracting storylines, the core premise of capturing beasts is enjoyable. Fittingly, Redmayne is more comfortable around animals than humans, which is heartfelt and vulnerable. Plus, Fogler and Sudol are lovable outsiders of their own. Unfortunately, whenever Fantastic Beasts visits plotlines outside these main protagonists, the film suffers. Grindelwald, politics, and Ezra Miller just aren't as fun. Also, those ancillary threads don't gel with the small adventures of creature hunting. Clearly, Fantastic Beasts had duel intentions, and because of that, the film is diluted.Meanwhile, the technicals of Fantastic Beasts are solid. Just the editing is questionable due to its stumbling momentum. Besides that, however, the craft is proficient. The cinematography uses engaging movement, the sound is complex, and the effects are comprehensive. Furthermore, the music incorporates the iconic Potterverse tune and some era-appropriate melodies. Yet, it's the production design that stands out for cohesively blending fantasy with period piece. Both elements synergize to create immersion. Overall, Fantastic Beasts is a fun movie that's held back by superfluous narratives. It's satisfactory, but would've been better as its own thing.Writing: 6/10

Mostly For The True Potterheads,"This will be one of my simplest film reviews on IMDB, as it is pretty clear to me along what lines this film will be split. Casual fans of the Harry Potter universe? They'll probably leave a bit disappointed or mystified. The true Potterheads (who know every nook and cranny of that universe)? My bet is that they'll come away with a much greater sense of enjoyment.For a basic plot summary, ""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" tells the story of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a young wizard with a penchant for studying odd creatures. While just trying to conduct his studies, he gets mixed up in a power struggle between the muggles (or ""no-mags"" as they are referred to here) and the wizarding community. His only ally seems to be Tina (Katherine Waterston). In a separate subplot, a wizard named Graves (Colin Farrell) is fixated on a boy named Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), who seems to be more key to this storyline than his meek appearance would suggest.I consider myself a very casual fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I've read all the books, watched all the movies...and that's it. No multiple readings/viewings, no obsession over all the little details and names. To me, the Potter universe is more shallow than deep (my own experience here...I know that universe is indeed quite rich if one chooses to do a deep-dive). I enjoyed watching Harry and Co. grow up in their journey together, but that is about where ""Harry Potter"" ends for me.As a result, there are two reasons why I found this movie to be just middle-of-the-road:1. Put plainly, the story of Newt Scamander just isn't as engrossing as the other previous material. Whether this was meant to be the case (more of a ""side quest"" mentality) or whether the execution was flawed I can't say for sure, but to me this was a tale that just kind of meandered in terms of narrative. For a movie that is supposed to be the launching point for main character Scamander, it sure spends a lot of time elsewhere. One wonders, then, if Scamander was used more as an ""excuse"" to re-enter the wizarding world than being fleshed out as a great character within it. Even the charming acting of Redmayne couldn't quite make me believe that I was seeing anything special in this case.2. This is the kind of movie that obviously is building off fragments of the Potter universe. Because most fans are of the obsessive variety, I think, there isn't all that much context given. The film just assumes that a base layer of knowledge is already present in viewers...a base layer that I did not posess. A good example of this: the reveal of the name Grindewald in the opening minutes of the film. That name did nothing for me, and nothing was ever really done to hammer the significance home. The film just assume viewers know the significance of his place in the wizard world.So, I think this is one of those reviews that leans more towards my subjectivity than perhaps the overall quality of the film. This isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. Based on filmmaking alone, it is probably more of a 7-star film. However, in terms of its appeal to me personally, it gets dropped down a few pegs. I'm just not a big enough Potter fan to understand all the little inside winks-and-nods or ""easter eggs"", and those are things that must be understood to truly be enveloped in the experience.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rowling & Yates: A Winning Formula,"Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them is a well executed prequel that reinvigorates, an already great franchise. This 9th film in the Harry Potter universe pays its respects to its predecessors & successfully conveys new, thrilling experiences, unique to its own achievements.Fantastic Beasts engrossing feats are thanks to the create genius of writer JK Rowling, & director David Yates. Its screenplay absolutely captivates, as it creates a new universe that prompts new imaginations, never before seen in the Harry Potter adaptations. From the premise that boasts of artistically designed creatures, to the fascinating magic, quirks & dark elements, the film's offerings are brand spanking new & peak wizarding world interesting. Amazingly, these are held together by brilliantly executed action sequences & striking special effects; both of which born from mastery of this always appealing universe. Also, well deserved props to the character setup that takes its time. Each backstory, motivation & peculiarity are given importance & never rushed, leading to quite an affinity towards its characters.Apart from its filmmaking elements, Fantastic Beasts' casting also deserves mention. Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller, Alison Sudol & Katherine Waterston were absolutely stellar in their portrayals. It is however, Eddie Redmayne & Dan Fogler that takes the cake. Redmayne personifies Newt Scamander remarkably, conveying an overly likable character, driven, with a seemingly imperfect past that grants him a certain awkwardness that grounds & charms. Fogler meanwhile, dons the comic relief role to perfection. As Newt's Muggle comrade, he is the constant subject of both ire & intrigue, sparking interest or hysterical moments in his every interaction.Overall, it is mind boggling that Fantastic Beasts has a meager 66 Metascore in IMDB. It is a film that stands on its own, a film that doesn't simply build on the success of the Harry Potter films rather, it earns its majesty through original, imaginative & praiseworthy writing & direction. With on point casting to boot, I for one, am enchanted on what comes next.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another good movie from the Harry Potter world,"This movie exceeded my expectations, J.K Rowling truly never disappoints. Even though it is not a perfect movie, it is best continuation for the Harry Potter franchise. The story about a British wizard/beast whisperer who really loves his beasts. The movie really showed how much this guy cares about these beasts. The beasts that are shown in looks amazing, it is a great example to use cgi. The one thing like the most about this movie is the way it is constructed, David Yates once again proves that he is a director who understands this world. Even though this has less magic spells than the other Harry Potter movies, the action sequences were just as epic. Overall i think this movie is a solid Harry potter series movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hoping you'll love it just because its related to Harry Potter,"Don't get me wrong, the Harry Potter series is great in its own right with good stories and characters, however I was not impressed at all with this frankly not good spin off. What little story it had was passable but boring, and talk about an over reliance on CGI to carry your story. I understand that creating magical monsters requires help from technology but seriously were there any practical effects? I appreciate CG when done right but this movie may as well have been animated since nothing feels real. This movie bored me to tears when it wasn't blatantly trying to remind me of better things in Harry Potter. The lines and plot were flat with no interesting characters, except for Redmayne's cute and lovable Newt. Apart from him I can't remember the names of any characters and I watched the movie an hour ago! I didn't feel upset when our characters were in danger because there were no stakes! Seriously I think this could have been great if only it didn't rely so heavily on basic CG and a few references to Harry Potter. Boring and uninspired, a waste of time.

An English Wizard in New York,"So no Harry Potter. No Hogwarts. No Voldemort. And a film based on a throwaway Christmas cash in from a few years back. Not a promising start. However in many ways the lack of a ""Potter"" novel to fall back on is the strength of the film. Allowing it to take new directions and explore the wider world of Magic in the Rowling universe. Setting it in New York is a good move. As well as making it more appealing to American audiences it breaks the mould of English eccentricity and delivers a world of magic with more bite and a hint of social conscious. Set in the time of the Great Depression this world of magic has a more jagged raw feel than the whimsy of the Potter sagas. Newt Scamander (Redmayne) is the English man in New York, a shy awkward person who doesn't quite fit in and immediately falls foul of American Magical law (no importing of beasts, no wand permit, consorting with nomag (muggles)). It is this law which sets the tone of the film and gives it its own slant. The Salem witch trials of the past have given rise to a situation where magicians are hidden from the non- magical world, which sees magic as sinful, evil and dangerous (they have good reason on this last). Mary Lou Barebone (Morton) is the main witch hating focus for this stance and is suitably chilling in this role. The underground nature of magic in America riffs on a host of witchcraft films and TV programmes of the past. While not making any actual references there are elements of ""Bewitched"" and the problems of relationships between magical and non-magical folk. Which brings us to Kowalski (Fogler) as the comic light relief and our nomag view of the world. I like Kowalski, I like his aspirations to be a baker and his wide eyed wonder at the magic he encounters. I do however feel that he is put into the clichéd fat funny guy role. My main criticisms are that while the ""keep it under wraps"" view of magic is different it also gives rise to the problem of how they manage to do this when New York seems to be getting torn up by magical events on a fairly regular basis. Surely they can't obliviate everyone and keep on repairing the damage or passing it off as a gas explosion? And there is the oh so tedious your superiors won't listen to you when you have something important to say (even if you do keep gatecrashing meetings) don't people ever follow correct procedure? Still these are minor quibbles and Newt's TARDIS like suitcase is a fantastic nod to Hogwartian eccentricity",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Caters to its fans, but there's enough there for the rest of us too","This movie has a great cast and a very interesting setting. The cast inhabited their characters and the universe well, with Redmayne making his character feel more sincere and interesting that it probably has any right to be. The setting, New York in the 20s, could have been used a bit more, but I guess it's a fine line between too little and too much.The story itself is just fine, where the clumsy hero manages to make a mess for himself, at the same time that something more sinister is going on. It's obvious that they are building up for a story to lasts many movies, and mostly they do a good job making a story that feels self contained, but that also leads into a bigger picture.My main problem with this movie, is the side-quests (to borrow a term from the gaming world). There's quite a lot of time spent on them retrieving beasts, something that is only partly related to the underlying conflict of the movie. I'm sure these scenes are loads of fun for those who are into the Harry Potter-universe, as you can see the creatures come to life. But as I am not really that engaged in that world, I got tired of that part of the movie pretty fast.That said, the rest of the movie is enough to make it interesting, if you like these kinds of movies. And I'm sure this is a movie that many people will end up seeing many, many times.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I hope that they make more movies in this trilogy and maybe even bring back some characters from Harry Potter. loved fantastic beasts and it was truly FANTASTIC.I loved the acting. i loved the graphics. i loved it all. my heart was pounding was excitement and i couldn't stop talking about it after it was over.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hedwig's cadaver,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a pleasant watch with some charmingly cute moments. It's high production value and its basis in the official Wizarding World of Harry Potter make it a very decent and entertaining watch.The magic is, however, so abundant and almighty that this movie holds little mystery and danger. Plotwise, it doesn't differ much from your average Marvel movie, the special effects have not yet crossed the uncanny valley and the humour is sadly infantile and... American.All the famous, high-grossing actors in this film are merely vultures feasting on a dead franchise, with the exception of Eddie Redmayne, who continues to surprise with his spot-on performances time after time.The score by James Newton Howard tries to capture Harry's wondrous world, but is never interesting nor exciting. It doesn't have the frivolous extravaganza of John Williams, nor the drama of Patrick Doyle, nor the wit of Nicholas Hooper; instead, it mostly resembles the basic sound of Alexandre Desplat's score for the Deathly Hallows. It shamelessly copies Hedwig's theme and puts it in a moment of little meaning.But don't get me wrong! It's fun and decent enough to pass. But at it's centre it's no more than the final convulsion of Harry Potter's success.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The story moves along great too with a great comedic performance from Dan Fogler. While I don't know if other would enjoy it as much as I did I feel confident saying it would be enjoyed in whatever capacity that is, is up to you.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magically entertaining and Fantastic Visuals... Though Something is Missing,"Harry Potter, a series that so long ago took us on an adventure none of us would ever forget. Years later, it is still the talk of the town and despite the books essentially ending, the Hogwarts Express money train is still charging ahead to bring out more ideas. This weekend J. K Rowling brings you another installment in her ever expansive world in the form of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Seeing that they were making a movie on what was essentially an encyclopedia of made up creatures, I couldn't help but wonder how good this movie would be. What is the verdict? As always read to find out.LIKES:  A J.K. Rowling story  Funny and Intense  Fantastic visual effectsAfter the recent 8th book and half of the movies, I feared Rowling's quality had been wrung dry from the constant demand of her fans. Glad to see I was wrong. Fantastic Beasts recaptured the magic we fell in love, bringing back the storytelling she started all those years ago. This film has mystery, suspense, and a character driven element all beautifully integrated together, crafting an adventure that is certain to enchant. While the main quest seems to be a simplistic game of hide and seek with gigantic creatures, this tale has many more depths to further draw you into Scamander and friends' life (potentially expanding into more movies should they decide to pick up the option).Story aside, the film has the other elements you die hard Potter fans want in an adventure. For one thing there are plenty of laughs to go around: such as Scamander awkwardly solving a problem (e.g. doing a mating dance that is a bad rendition of the Thriller dance) or his No Mag friend Kowalski having a few one liners and slapstick to get a laugh. These moments keep things fun and fresh and help relieve some of the darker points of the movie. The intense moment isn't so much in the movie itself, but for me in the hopes that Scamander will find his creatures before any are hurt or killed (which you know Rowling is famous for doing). Other moments are suspenseful, but not at the level the other Potter tales have.However, the biggest win for me are the visual effects of the film. Many of the spells you've seen before: white lights for blocking projectiles, or colorful lights before a door opens. However, my favorite spells involved repairing broken objects, which we have seen before but never to the city rebuilding scale. But all the magical quirks pail to the design of the diverse beasts that inhabit Scamander's suitcase. Many of the creatures are exactly what you expect from Rowling's imagination, a combination of deadly and cute in a variety of colors and shapes. Their animation is flawless and their integration into the tale, for the most part, makes up most of the adventure.DISLIKES  Something is missing  The evil element was lacking  A little cheesy in dialogueDespite all the fun I had in the film there still is something missing that the first installments of her series had. One element was a lack of grandiose palaces and magical alleys that we love to get pulled into, or perhaps it was that most of the spells were simplistic and old hat. Or maybeit was wanting more creatures to involved in the tale to bring further suspense or drama. One thing is for certain though, the ""threat"" of this film was more diluted than I had anticipated. Fantastic Beasts primary baddie still has the mystery behind it as you try to uncover what thing runs afoul in New York. However, when it is finally revealed, it disappoint me as it lacked the menacing quality most Potter villains possess. Oh sure the circumstances about its' origins scream Rowling, but the design, execution, and threat were dropped in this film. And yes there is a twist that was very welcome, but it wasn't enough to save the unimpressive bad guy after all the buildup. As for the dialogue and script, this too is another element that could have used some tweaking. At times our characters deliver lines that bring back the nostalgic feeling of the first installments, being both entertaining and empowering to fans. However, this film felt a little more overdramatic and preachy, dropping the clever for emotional, cheesy bologna that took away from the scenes rather than add to it. While this dislike is minor at times, there are some really hokey moments that had my eyes rolling.THE VERDICT:Overall, Fantastic Beasts is a grand adventure, with beautiful special effects and a dynamic tale that is sure to entertain the masses. However, there is still something missing from this movie that makes it pale to some of the predecessors Warner Bros have made in the past. Regardless, this reviewer encourages you to go see the magnificent specimens of merchandising (the beasts) in theaters by the effects alone as this film was better than many of the latter movies for me.Adventure/Family/Fantasy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Completely independent from the Harry Potter saga with a single small connection to put them in the same universe.,"Because of the fact that I've only watched the Harry Potter saga and not read the books, I was completely unaware of the fact that this book was written by J.K. a long time ago as part of the Potter Universe. Nonetheless, I was pretty impressed by the imagination behind the looks of the creatures and overall how the city and everything looked, suggesting that the ideas were taken from the book of course. However, even tho the visuals were outstanding throughout the whole movie, especially in the climax, I was underwhelmed by the main character and his stiffness, boring nature and irritable tone of speaking which could not be heard even when I turned up the volume on my TV way higher. The supporting characters were also pretty pale, aside from Dan Fogler as Jacob who was an outstanding supportive role. The plot is simple, but engaging, even tho it can be pretty slow for some viewers. The villain played by Collin Farrel was also dissapointing, I guess his personality did not fit the character's shoes and that is why he was not the person to be chosen for the role in my eyes.

Not really a wow but solid and compelling,"It's finally here, and one of the usual questions would be: is it a worthy addition to the series?For those who have followed Harry Potter, I think the answer is yes, and in fact this is an interesting addition that would appeal more with the older audience. Although a bit predictable, the film has a solid climax, and has a rather compelling conclusion. The film was able to establish a starting point for Grindelwald's story, but I have to admit that the character's demeanor as I saw it in the last part of the film spoiled my anticipation to see more of him. For the rest of the audience, it is understandable that Grindelwald is not that interesting based on how the film developed the character. Moreover, he is quite familiar already given that we had Voldemort. So this makes Grindelwald no longer unique, and I find it important that in the succeeding films, J.K. Rowling should present a fresh and compelling case for this character. The dark apocalyptic theme is already worn out, but I'm optimistic that Rowling could give the much needed twist.I find the creatures interesting, but the scenes involving the search for the creatures on the lose are quite slow, and sometimes feel flat at times; and at one point, I did wonder when the film will finally take off. At least, the Niffler, the kleptomaniac creature, did steal the show. Maybe the problem is with how Redmayne carried Newt Scamander in those scenes and how Yates handled the subtleties of the writing. The script contains many amusing lines that are subdued (might be actually challenging for the director to carry out), and I think that there are a lot of misses in hitting the intended impact.Generally, the leads did a good job, and what compensates for the low points is the presence of Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), who mainly provided the comic relief. Top that with his love interest, Queenie (Alison Sudol), and we see an amusing and compelling subplot. Eddie Redmayne's Newt and Katherine Waterston's Tina did not really stand out, but I think they did something adequate. However, it would have been better if we see more compelling performances like in their last scene.After the first two-thirds of the film, I felt relief that the film finally embarked on its take off. With the film's central plot revolving on a particular dark beast, I find the character development to be adequate. Lots of cliché surround the plot, coming especially from DC and Marvel movies, but I think this one has established a unique case such that it generally transcends those cliché. I also think that Yates did a good job in handling the more action-packed parts of the film, and I think that the final third is great and memorable enough to compensate for the lows of the earlier parts. Moreover, watch out for Ezra Miller's Credence and Samantha Morton's Mary Lou in the darker aspects of the story.The effects are generally topnotch, and there are parts of it that came close to something groundbreaking. There's actually a wow in the production design and we see this at the last part. Cinematography's good, and New York City is a nice backdrop for the story, although the script could have made use more of its culturally complex identity. Also worth mentioning is the music that seamlessly blends with that of the Harry Potter world, especially with the work of John Williams; and more remarkably, James Newton Howard has offered us with iconic themes.At the bottom-line, the future of this series looks good although some are skeptical on how the story can be stretched. However, if one is familiar with the background stories of Harry Potter, Dumbledore's backstory is particularly interesting, and it did raise a lot of questions. In this case, the material is not really a problem, and hopefully, Rowling together with the cast and crew will live up to the expectations. The first offering as a whole is not really a wow but is memorable enough to be worthily labeled as part of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's no 'Harry Potter' but it still entertains,"We will never be able to capture moviegoers' excitement of, love for and connection with the 'Harry Potter' series, whether we're talking about the blockbusters or the books. This point should be understood in order to fully appreciate 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,' and even so, it's still hard not to compare it with its sibling series.To get it out of the way, it's true 'Beasts' has commonalities with 'Potter,' including the fact that the story comes from the pen of J.K. Rowling, takes place in the same universe (albeit a few generations earlier) and it's directed by David Yates (who also directed the final four 'Potter' films). But there is a lot more at the center of 'Beasts' than meets the eye.We're introduced to Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who arrives in New York City from London with a magical suitcase filled with...well...fantastic beasts. New York City has been under siege due to magical disturbances with notorious evil wizard Gellert Grindelwald at large, which gives rise to an anti-magic movement that forces the American magic community underground. After a chance run-in with a ""No-Maj"" (non-magical person/muggle) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and fellow magic person Tina (Katherine Waterston) in a bank, Newt and his newfound friends (along with Tina's flirty sister Queenie, played by Alison Sudol) are taken on a wild ride through 1920s NYC to capture escaped creatures while battling a sinister force in an ""obscurial.""Aside from the core cast, there are some other noteworthy castings in Colin Farrell as Graves, a high-ranking official from the American Magic Ministry, Carmen Ejogo as President Seraphina Picquery, Jon Voigt as a high-profile NYC banker and a bonus cameo from Johnny Depp himself. The cast are not the best part about 'Beasts,' though. The CGI has got an upgrade from the days of 'Deathly Hallows Part 2' in 2011, and the focus on all the crazy, creative creatures featured here makes this most apparent. Additionally, the score from James Newton Howard brings to life a lot of what takes place on screen.Again, it's not the best thing to come from the mind of J.K. Rowling, but 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is an exciting thrill ride through the magical world that we've come to know and love.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not special,"After making one of the best movie franchises ever, Warner Brothers brought David Yates, Heyman and their team back to make a new movie settled in the Harry Potter universe, reminding us of the beauty of the Wizarding World and offering us a great new story. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a pure success. The characters are relatable and likable, the story/the plot is fun and the whole introduction to the American Wizarding Word is well made. The whole thing is simply good, but not on a high level as Harry Potter itself, mostly because it is no book adaptation but a simple screenplay.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A little less than Fantastic,"For the second time this year we have been asked to return to JK Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizardry. However, whereas the stage play was able to fully capitalise on Rowling's strength for story, world and character in ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"", poor direction somewhat comprises this cinematic effort.The film tells two stories. The first concerns Newt Scamander, a young wizard, and his attempts to reclaim a number of ""fantastic beasts"" who have escaped his stewardship in the city of New York. He is joined in his attempts to reclaim the beasts by a factory worker, amateur baker and muggle (or no-mag), Jacob Kowalski. The other story concerns a mysterious evil presence rampaging around New York City, despite the best efforts of the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA), and unwittingly aided by an anti-witch hate group.These two stories have just enough of Rowling's talent for intrigue and mystery to be interesting, but they are deserving of two different films (and considering five sequels to this film have already been announced, they certainly can afford to provide the breathing room). The two intersect and inform each other quite clumsily, culminating in a scene in which Porpentina Goldstein, a witch working for MACUSA but assisting Scamander in his search, says to Scamander ""We must capture the rest of your beasts so MACUSA can't keep scapegoating them!"". You see Scamander is the chief suspect of the crimes perpetrated by the mysterious evil, and so he is drawn into the second story.This is a contrived connection and ultimately neither is really allowed to flourish. One story line is resolved by the end of the second act, and the other must capitalise on setups that have been diluted amongst the rest of the action. You'd be forgiven for losing track of Percival Graves' motivation as we spent most of the film not knowing who he is or how he pertains to the rest of the story.However the real problem with the film is the direction and editing. The film awkwardly cuts from one scene to the next. A scene of chaos as Scamander's bag is opened, unleashing some of the beasts within, is very abruptly cut with a mundane scene of a child playing hopscotch. The cut was so abrupt I expected the chaos to extend into her scene. That is the grammar of film, which when interrupted can be very jarring.This is most noticeable in the action sequences. Large-scale destruction must unwind slowly and deliberately. If you have a great monster storming down a street, knocking cars aside as if they were nothing and charging through solid stone and iron without slowing, then the actions lose all meaning. The images have no weight to them and there is no emotional impact to the destruction. Fantastic Beasts is unfortunately, for such a frequently charming film, all too often lacking any emotional content.Take for instance the opening sequence. Five wizards are seen walking across a dark field, wands drawn, when they are all suddenly wiped out by a wave of menacing light. This sequence is achieved in less than ten seconds of footage. We have no incentive to empathise with these characters. I don't believe we even see their faces before they meet their fate. What may be an attempt to establish a darker atmosphere and genuine sense of threat is robbed of its effectiveness by the lack of decent pacing. There then follows some very clumsy exposition delivered by a series of newspaper headlines flying at the screen.This may seem inconsequential, but something important is being missed here. An audience member makes a decision early in a film; the decision to consent. If a film's opening sequence seduces the audience member then they will suspend their disbelief and invest themselves into the film. If the grammar of the film is clumsy, even subtly so, then they will remain firmly planted in their cinema seat, retaining their disbelief. Once the audience member decides that what they're watching is a bad film, they will commit to finding further evidence to support their conclusion. Unfortunately, anyone who makes that decision early in Fantastic Beats will find plenty of this evidence. Which is unfortunate, as something is being missed.The film has plenty of strengths. Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizardry is as charming as ever, as are the films characters, all ably played by the international cast. The stories, though muddled, are engaging. But be prepared to ignore some very poor transitions and incredibly jarring pacing. A fantastic missed opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a magical movie.,"Since this takes place 70years before Harry Potter but in the same universe, the expectation was high for this movie. Of course the lion part takes places in the world o f muggles (or no-majs as they say in USA) and only some parts on the magical side it's still a great setting because of 1926 New York. The characters play there part perfect, especially Eddy Redmaine is terrific as Newt Scamander. There is also the suspense like in the Harry Potter-movies but than of course without Harry but instead Newt. Also his accidental sidekick Jacob plays an important part and has an happily ever after at the end of the movie. I can't wait for the second part.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016),"I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I read the books as a teenager and was enamored with the wizarding world that JK Rowling managed to create. The films aren't without flaws but they were very enjoyable for the book lovers and casual movie fans alike. The films were enjoyable for adults and children alike. Initially, I didn't care for a spin off or prequel to the Harry Potter franchise; I didn't need anything in that magical universe anymore. I was of the opinion that Rowling should have closed that chapter of her life and focus on a more unique project. However, I still decided to check it out as I heard many people enjoyed this film.I'm sad to say that I did not like it anywhere near as much as the Harry Potter films. The first hour of this film seemed so inconsequential and bland. There's an overabundance of CGI usage to depict some of the beasts. While some scenes with the beasts look great, others looked so reliant on CG that it was distracting and takes you out of the picture. The first hour of the film focuses on introducing the beasts that escaped Newt Scamander's briefcase. I quit the film an hour in because I was sorely disappointed with what I saw.After getting back to the film, I'd say the film gets stronger in the second phase. Once the severity of the Obscurus is revealed the film becomes a bit darker and engages the audience more. There are still questions to be asked and I expect them to be answered in the trilogy (I'm not very fond of the idea of sequels to an unnecessary film). While the film gets better, it still carries none of the charm and fun that made the Harry Potter films so special. The HP films had a purpose and you knew that everything was well thought out, I can't say the same for a very uneven FBAWTFT.I'm not the biggest Eddie Redmayne fan. He can put in a tremendous performance but isn't in many films that I really like. He was a considerably weak leading man. Its hard to get invested in his character who is just there and becomes second to whoever else he is on screen with. Katherine Waterston is committed to her role and was one of the best features of this film. There seems to be other characters who are kind of thrown into the film to serve the plot. There are also a few easy way outs in this film. Something big gets solved by a convenient circumstance that gets explained on the spot.This film failed to make a good impression. It has prolonged action sequences and an introduction of many new types of beasts, however outside of a few references to the HP universe the film just feels like it doesn't need to exist. I don't have a lot of faith in the expected trilogy but its going to exist and I pray that it is better. Right now this film is what The Hobbit was to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. LOTR was great and we absolutely did not need The Hobbit trilogy. These beasts and this films concept do not need finding.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A solid 6.5,"In a nutshell....If you are not some type of Harry Potter mega fan, this should be a good movie to escape reality for a couple hours. Its got all the special effects and a decent plot to go along with for the ride. You shouldn't be disappointed, but it won't be one of those movies you will rave about for the next 2 weeks either. Get the popcorn, candy & soda and enjoy.I start rating movies at a 5 and then go up or down from there. There is no such thing as a 10 and very hard to get to a 1. This movie is better than average but doesn't deliver enough on the plot to make it to a 7. FYI - the highest rated on IMDB is Shawshank Redemption at a 9.2.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the best movie after harry potter,"It's probably not easy to follow ""harry potter ""and its success. It a big challenge for the director. He realizes a wonderful movie with a lot of magic and a beautiful story! I explain me: First, the soundtracks. Throughout the movie, your mind is carried away with the sound. You can't resist. It's always with magic, that make you feel so good and in the story with the characters. That make you feel all of emotions! You cry, you're laughing and smile with characters. I always love the music from movies but in this one, this special. In second time, characters are good, the game of players is just and not over played. The main character is Eddy Redmayne. It's a very good actor. He has already played in ""The Danish Girl"", ""The Miserable"" and a lot of big production. This movie is the first for him who he played for children. He receives some rewards for this movie and for ""The Danish Girl"". The director chooses him for this and we understand why. He brings something mysterious. In last time, the story has something special. Is not easy to follow ""Harry Potter"". The director has made that with genius. Every event is chosen for different raisons. First, it's always surprising! And that explain one thing every time. To finish this review on Fantastic Beats, I have one thing to say: I love it. The director has managed the challenge.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was a fine adventure by J.K. Rowling,"Just watched this pre-Harry Potter-set movie by J.K. Rowling with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed the story and characters and plenty of special effects that abound throughout. It takes place during the '20s in New York City. One of the characters is a ""No-Maj"", an American term for ""Muggle"". Some scenes do feel a little padded but I managed to not be bored most of the time. Actually, this was quite funny and a little exciting most of the time. Oh, and there's a surprise revealed in the closing credits of who played a certain character that appeared near the end. I really don't want to spoil anything so on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic Beasts,"Once I heard there was going to be a movie that stems from the Harry Potter series I knew that I had to see it for myself. And once I heard the Harry Potter theme music to start the movie I knew it was going to be a good one. If you are a Harry Potter fan then it is a must see, well it is a must see either way. There were so many references throughout the film such as Bellatrix Lestrange and Albus Dumbledore, but they don't just lay it out there for you, you must pay attention through the movie to catch them. Each of the characters in Fantastic Beasts was similar to the three main characters in Harry Potter which were Harry, obviously, Ron and Hermione. Newt was most similar to Harry in that he was a witty wizard who always had a plan on his mind and how to get out of situations. Kowalski had a parallel with Ron as he provided a lot of comic relief throughout the movie and seemed to be along for the ride. Tina ran similar to Hermione as the no nonsense character and did everything by the books written by the ministry of magic. J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job as this was her first screenplay done by her and I hope and look forward to more films coming from this series!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Full of Fluff (and some fun),"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I love the books and the movies. I would consider myself a ""Potterhead"". While this movie is entertaining, it lacks the layered complexity of the Harry Potter story. The reason why ""Harry Potter"" was (and still is) so immensely popular was because Harry himself follows the classic hero's journey. His parents died at the hands of a monster, his Aunt and Uncle mistreat him terribly, and he seems to have everything stacked against him. We, the readers and viewers, are emotionally invested in Harry. I found it hard to invest my emotion in Newt Scamander. The story line is very surface and while the movie is well done and I will watch the other movies in the series, I feel myself and other truly passionate Harry Potter fans just won't have the same reaction to the Fantastic Beasts movies and the characters and we did with the magical world of Harry Potter.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
@@MaGicaL@@,"This film was a wonderful spin off of the wizardry world of Harry Potter, and the other lives that wizards live. It gives you an idea that Hogwarts, and everything you've seen in Harry Potter is NOT the only wizards going about their everyday lives among the world. They also include the United States in this movie, instead of mainly Europe.The acting in this film was terrific and the creativity that went into designing the beasts, that are included in the plot of the movie, was beyond the normal limits of imagination. I also like how they included some familiar names with the original Harry Potter characters, and connected them with involvement in the plot of the story. That was impressive.This movie is a breathtaking experience. With the wonderful imagination of J.K. Rowling, how could you go wrong. She never ceases to amaze me with her imaginative story telling. I would definitely recommend this movie for those in need of a good fantasy/adventure film to endure. I would love to say a lot more about this movie, but I do not want to spoil a newer title for new viewers. I personally think most people will appreciate this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
8.5/10,"By a fortuitous event Newt Scamander's (Eddie Redmayne) magical suitcase, containing all different kinds of magical animals, is mistakenly swapped with muggle Jacob Kowalski's (Dan Folger) ordinary one. Kowalski opens the suitcase and some creatures escape and are now running rampant in the middle of No-Maj New York. It is now up to Newt to retrieve them all quickly before an already delicate situation with the No-Maj community goes even more south.The Magical world of J.K. Rowling is back once again on the big screen in all of its glory and as a fervent Potterhead, as a fan of J.K. Rowling's writing, as a fan of Yates and Heyman and as a film fan I can confidently say that this feature satisfied me on all of those levels and, might I add, it even gave me something more.First and foremost it is remarkable to see how well this new installment fits overall into the mythology of Potter, but even more so how brilliantly and surprisingly it expands upon it. J.K. Rowling once again proves her unquestionable brilliance in storytelling, because other than being a wonderful addition to the Magical Saga this is more than anything a great screenplay, full of the classical wit we have come to expect from Rowling, filled with intelligence in the character web and how it connects to the themes and full of great humor that has always been an integrating part of Rowling's writing.As always Yates and production designer Stuart Craig (what a pleasure to see him back again!) do an amazing job on the world-building and if I may, this might be their best work yet on that level. This is probably due to the direct influence Rowling had in the making of the film and it just gives it this bump in quality that I really did not think I was going to get. The beasts in this film are amazing and drive story as much as the characters, they are beautifully drawn and filled with the great imagination of this writer.Rowling proves her skill by giving every story element a meaning, a space in the narrative and a functionality that is reflective of that in the world. Her storytelling skills are simply baffling, every living being, human or animal, in the film has its distinctive characteristics and they reflect what their arch is, giving weight to the narrative in a way that feels organic and motivated. The reason these stories have so much success is because of the characters and as usual we are graced with a canvas of rich and varied individuals, from Newt right to the smallest speaking role every one has a chance to shine on screen exactly because these characters are written so richly and come from the mind of a writer who simply knows how to do them right.Still, a lot of credit is due to the cast and I mean a lot of it because this is the best cast display I have seen all year, beating even the greats we've had like ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""everybody Wants Some"". The leading quartet composed by Redmayne, Fouler, Waterson and Sudol is chemistry gold. I mean I would actually consider giving them the SAG best ensemble award right now, that's how good these actors manage to translate their characters on screen, there is simply no filter, you just see these characters. Sudol is a revelation, she lights up the screen with joy and plays her quirky part to the perfect balance, giving credibility and gravitas to a character that could have easily become annoying. Yet her fellow actors aren't less deserving. Waterson is on fire here, Folger too, bringing incredible comic chops to the table. Redmayne is perfectly cast and brings young Newt to life just as I imagined him. Farrell, Miller, Morton I mean the list just goes on and they were all simply glorious.There's even more to be admired here, the social commentary, the thematic exploration that furthers even more themes in the Potter Saga and brilliantly introduces new ones like abuse. Still I have not given Yates and Heyman the credit they are do for making yet another great film, that makes Heyman nine for nine not even counting his incredible success outside of this franchise. Yates is still directing these pictures beautifully and he gives this one a particular sense of joy and adventure, pulling off some truly spectacular set pieces that had the whole audience in my theater laughing, holding their breath and applauding in relief.There are a couple of flaws that kind of annoyed me. The final confrontation is partly breathtaking but on the other hand how some of the logistics are handled was kind of lazy, there are a couple of moments that really drop the ball and undermine the resolution of the whole drama. There are some minor inconsistencies that a Harry Potter nerd like me caught and that could be analyzed to the bone, but the bottom line is that they bothered the narrative and could have been dealt with further down the line without needing to dilute this film.Fortunately, the overall result is as far away as being defined diluted as possible. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a great addition the the Harry Potter canon and it stands on its own as a magical, joyful ride that will give a great theater experience to audiences of all ages, I am sure.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magic continues,"So the 2016 Fantasy, adventure movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", which is a Prequel to Harry Potter films Directed by Davis Yates. This stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, a guy who is looking through old New York City many years before harry potter story, and he is looking for various creatures that has escaped from his magical suitcase. I myself am also a very huge Harry Potter fan since my childhood. And I enjoyed all Harry Potter movies too. Not only the movies but also the books as well. Fantastic Beasts is also written by J.K Rowling and once again she has shown herself to be one of the most imaginative writers working today. You can't stop admiring her creativity as you see the movie. I love all the creature designs, just like all the harry potter films Fantastic Beasts also has able to live up to everyone's expectations. What really I liked about the movie, was the way it was constructed. Action sequences and special effects are stunning. Setting up the main characters is also interesting. One other important thing to notice here is that Fantastic Beasts doesn't rely on Harry Potter films. Of course it's in the same universe, but you can't say that it's just a prototype of Harry Potter movies. It has a completely different taste. This movie stands on its own. It is something fresh, something new, something appreciable, and something definitely to be praised.
Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander is amazing in the movie. He is very likable and extremely charming. Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, who is a non magical normal person; also known as muggle. He kind of caught up in this whole journey unintentionally. He really added a lot in this movie like lot of humors, lot of funny moments. Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein also looks to be the perfect choice for her character. She is investigating the things that are going on in the New York City. She has done an incredible job. I especially liked Colin Farrell playing the villain character here. Who finally turns out to be none other but Johnny Depp. That finale scene of Jonny Deep is really cool and it looks awesome when it comes to the screen. Ezra Millar performed as required. His character is very dark, very powerful and also very horrible. A lot of stuffs are going on in this movie at the same time. This movie literally gave a perfect platform for many future projects. It's an extremely entertaining film; it is amazing and fun to watch at any time. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is without a doubt the best. You kind of get nostalgic when the modified version of old Harry Potter music comes in the movie at several parts.

"Gotta catch 'em all, gotta save 'em all","Once upon a time, there was a peaceful city of New York, the only place where action ever happens. And it was living its usual mundane life, with self-righteous people fighting the badass people and the badass people fighting back. And they would have been confronting each other happily ever after, but then came a sociophobic British pokemon catcher moonlighting as a WWF volunteer, and it all went haywire...Just as a disclaimer, I'm a total muggle, devoid of any worship for the Harry Potter universe. So all these people who are so powerful, but only as long as they have a phallic symbol in their hands to play with, have absolutely zero effect on me, well, maybe besides cracking me up. Yet I was hoping that maybe the ties of Fantastic Beasts to HP would be loose enough for me to enjoy the story it tells. And while the connection was pretty thin indeed, at least allowing me to understand what's going on without the previous experience of watching the Harry Potter movies or reading the books, the essence of this film was still too weak to my muggle taste.Yes, we're given some sort of conflict. The magically endowed people are in hiding, something like what the mutants were doing in X-Men: First Class. And, just like in First Class, the mere mortals don't really enjoy the perspective of having such potent and unpredictable neighbors. Those who want to retain the status quo are obviously the good guys, but there's this mysterious baddie who rebels against the set order of things and wants the magical world to be reckoned with at last (wonder if he wears a metal helmet too). To make things worse, some chaotic forces wreak havoc on the peaceful city, threatening an already shaky balance.So what's gonna be the last straw that breaks the camel's back? What will be the center of this convoluted story? Maybe a tormented and cast-out creepy young dude played by Ezra Miller, who's been brilliant at portraying such twisted and complex characters since The Perks of Being a Wallflower and We Need to Talk About Kevin? Maybe an unlikely bond between the depressed foster kid and our loner monster lover? Maybe a fragile feeling between a sensitive ginger Brit and a hyperactive American brunette? Nah, forget this petty nonsense. We'll put in the very center of the story a kleptomaniac platypus and a huge whale/hippo in heat. And don't forget a big shiny griffon, because this is what the audience wants to see!Seriously though, Fantastic Beasts suffers from the same illness the whole Harry Potter franchise seems to have been susceptible to from the very beginning. That is, it brings in so many visually fascinating, but substantially hollow things, but when it comes to the real human drama it's awfully shy to develop things or let them at least be fully revealed. The mysterious villain remains a mere rumor until the very end, and even when he's finally exposed you're left to wonder what's so villainous about him at all. The chaotic threat to the very foundations of the world gets disposed of within minutes with no second thought, making you guess what the fuss was about to begin with. And the characters that showed the most promise walk into the sunset without ever unfolding their true potential.In this story full of magic and weird creatures, the only character that stands out is that poor no-maj who just wanted to get a loan in a bank and simply ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. For him, this kaleidoscope of magic flickering and slapstick action is genuinely novel, so the guy is enjoying every second of it. And why shouldn't he? After all, his real life takes action in a canning factory, so a fairy tale dream would make a pleasant distraction. But it's not the dream itself that makes it so precious, its the inherent fleetingness of it which allows you to take only the best into the real world. And while Mr Kowalski had been graced with a gift of oblivion, nobody is gonna erase our own memory. So, when the two hours are over and the credits start rolling, we'll be unfortunate to ask ourselves: true, it's been all cute and easy to digest, but is that really all the film had to offer?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Long, dull and uninspiring","This is certainly not Harry Potter or anything like it. I gave it a 4 because the story-line is convoluted, the movie is long and dull with very few substantial scenes or narrative to keep the viewer enthralled. The sound of Eddie Redmayne's voice is also so muffled that it's sometimes hard to discern what he's saying.I wish I could relate in my review what the story is about but it was so convoluted that I lost track.

I think I even enjoyed the film more than most of the 'HARRY POTTER' movies!,"'FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A prequel to the 'HARRY POTTER' film franchise, set 65-years before the first film (in 1926 New York City). It tells the tale of an introverted wizard activist, named Newt Scamander, that travels to New York, from England, while writing a textbook (for the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry) titled 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. The movie was directed by David Yates (who also helmed the last four 'HARRY POTTER' films), and it was written by debut screenwriter J.K. Rowling (adapted from her 2001 book). It's the first installment in a planned series of five movies. It stars Eddie Redmayne (as Newt), Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller, Samantha Morton, Carmen Ejogo and Jon Voight. The film has been a big hit at the Box Office, and it's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I enjoyed it.Newt Scamander (Redmayne) is a British wizard, and fantastical animal rights activist, that's traveling form England (in 1926) to Arizona. He stops in New York City, and while he's listening to a 'No-Maj woman (Morton), speak about the dangers of wizards and witches, a 'Niffler' escapes from his magical suitcase; which also houses several other magical creatures in it. While he's trying to catch the Niffler, Newt meets a baker, named Jacob Kawalski (Fogler), and a witch, named Porpentina (Waterston). The witch arrests Newt, for the havoc his critter causes (and for being an unregistered wizard); and while she's taking him to America's Magical Congress headquarters, the two learn of much greater dangers, that are facing the city (and the world), of the fantastic kind.The film is filled with dazzling visuals, wonderful characters (and critters) and magical charm. Redmayne is great in the lead, and his character is extremely likable (and possibly autistic). I think he's a very positive hero, for children of all ages because of this; and so is the beautiful Porpentina (who has just as strong of a heroic role). I really like how the film deals with animal rights too (even if they're of the fictitious kind). I think I even enjoyed the film more than most of the 'HARRY POTTER' movies (if not all of them).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/GAMlEeVv1H0",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dan Fogler is the CUTEST!!!!,"Dan Fogler who plays Kowalski is easily the best thing in this movie, he's so hug-able!!!!It's almost worth it to see this in the theater just to watch him.... almost.I wanted to judge this as it's own thing and not as part of the Harry Potter world but it's clear the movie wants you to associate it with HP from the opening theme to name dropping Hogwarts and Dumbledore, their target audience is obvious.This is the main problem, as a movie this is pretty muddled, unlike HP that created a separate world for wizards and witches here there is no line between them, no wonder, all shades of beige of the 1920's with a colourful bug thrown in there and lets call that bug the magic...The writing is also surprisingly generic from someone amazing as J.K. Rowling, you can easily predict the next line of dialogue and there are no magic spells, seriously sometimes they say nothing and just point the wand for it to do things like a gun!!!! did they forget how this is supposed to work? The plot is weak at best, contrive a reason for the main to go to the U.S., have the beasts be whatever the plots need them to be etc... not what'd you'd expect from a great writer.The weakest element is the main and the villain, Eddie Redmayne is forgettable in this and I don't even know who the underlying villain of all this is (the one in the newspaper) who doesn't remember he who must not be named? and what's with the child abuse story in there? it seemed odd in such a movie to have that, the kids in the theater were actually scared and some parents left!Overall an OK but meh movie that is more suitable for TV then the theater and requires focus (and a point beyond milking HP fans!)Also if you have motion sickness take your pills before entering, they do the 3D ride thing with the effects and the 3D bug popping out of the screen at you which was really annoying and distracting.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
