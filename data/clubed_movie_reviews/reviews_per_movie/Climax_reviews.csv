"A Great ""Feel-Bad"" Movie.","Love it or hate it, this film is technically astonishing and whatever it's trying to do, it's doing it very well. It's almost like they've trapped the true essence of French Extremism, set it on fire, and followed it with a steady cam.The camera work in this is surreal and its movements, along with the actors' choreography, are surprisingly well coordinated for a ""write-as-we-go"" film.Climax will make you feel a lot of things and I don't think you're going to like how most of those things feel, but that's exactly what makes Climax a very well executed horrifying experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Gaspar Noe has never done acid,"Really horrible and boring. Basically no story and the visuals are nowhere near interesting enough to make up for that. Why did taking LSD make everyone insanely violent and psychotic? Overdosing on acid does not make you hateful, violent, or scream at everyone you see. Totally stupid waste of time.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Weak 3.5 // Mostly succeeds as viscera,"As an exercise in pure viscera, Argentine provocateur Gaspar Noé mostly pleases with Climax. A group of dancers unknowingly drink spiked sangria which slowly warps their afterparty into an LSD-soaked nightmare. With a premise like that, it may be evident that this is a film meant to be experienced rather than thought about. The pleasures of Climax come nearly entirely from its sheer audiovisual power: the ceaselessly pulsating score, the fluid one-shot takes, the lurid colors. It's closer to performance art than what most people would characterize as a ""movie"" and should be approached with that mindset if you're to enjoy it. However, as enjoyable as its best sequences are, the lack of nearly any thematic depth imbues much of the film with a subtly nagging tediousness. And even when viewed purely from an experiential perspective, it is far from watertight in its pacing and flow. Still, there is a cumulative power in its sound, visuals, and theatrics that's hard to deny.Weak 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not bad, but not impressive either","Pros: Amazing choreography. The opening scene really got me (as did the intro credits roll part). Very good acting, and a creative use of camera. Loved the first act of the movie.Cons: A story with no conclusion. The ""brave"" use of camera was kind of overemphasized to the point where it got exhausting. Reveal of who was guilty of pouring LSD in Sangria gave us no satisfaction, no conclusion, and the movie takes such a big curve in the second act, that everything that happened in the first act is utterly meaningless.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I give it 3 stars for the dancing,"The only good thing about this movie was the dancing. Literally, everything else about it is annoying. It's actually really boring. It has no plot and no point. The dialogue is puerile, at best, and you can't possibly empathize with the characters. If this is your first introduction to Noe, you'll likely never feel the need to watch any of his other films.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"An intense, exhilarating, exciting and terrifying experience.","I always feel excited and a little bit anxious watching a new film by French director Gaspar Noe. His past films have have included the controversial ""Irreversible"" known for its unflinching and brutal portrayal of sexual violence, the mind bending and psychedelic trip that is ""Enter the Void"" and the erotic drama ""Love"" which features unsimulated sex presented in 3D.
Noe is pushing the limits for not only what Is allowed to be shown in a film but also for what the film medium is capabale of. Unconventional narrative structures, mind bending visuals and camera angles you wouldn't even dream of. These are just a few things that can be found in his films.I am happy to say that Climax may be Noe's tamest film in terms of its sex and violence. And I am very excited to say that it may also be the best film he has made yet. I feel that it's best to know as little as possible about the film before seeing it to have the best possible experience. What I will say though is that the film grips you from the start, and only tightens that grip throughout the running time. The film makes use of one location and one situation and one set of characters to put you in the moment. The excitement and exuberance that you feel during the first dance sequence which is shot entirely in one take will change and evolve throughout the film into sequences that are much more frightening and intense. Go along for the ride though because it is a unique work of filmmaking worth seeing in a cinema and if you hold on tight, you may experience something that is close to an outer body experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Gaspard Noé : his best and worst,"After an incredible 20 minutes opening, Gaspard Noé seems to be himself and put a movie that could be a masterpiece into a boring provocative piece of art. By the half of the movie, you won't discover anything you already seen in Gaspard Noé's movies. Still, the filming of dance and the idea that dance is art language is interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Was hoping for much more,"CLIMAX or how long can you stand watching boring dancers and average at best actors pretend to be on drugs? Zero story, lots of screaming, no surprises. I'd even say this film is pretty tame (for Noé). And it's neither radical nor inventive anymore to simply turn the camera upside down or to show the end credits first. Apart from big respect for some well done one-shot moments, I'm quite disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Influenced by ...,"This is not an easy watch. And while Climax may suggest this to be very sexual or at least sensual, you might be dissapointed if you're looking for that kind of ""satisfaction"". The choreography of the dancing is really good, the cinematography is something to behold too. If you don't mind long uninterrupted shots that is of course.This is about addiction, about people driven to go the extra mile and about people hoarded in a secluded location going ""nuts"" as some might describe it. And as a different reviewer wrote: this is an experience. It will split a lot of people as it did at the various festivals it played. This is not an ordinary movie, but when has Noe done that? So if you are aware of his body of work, you at least know not to expect something ""normal"". Now some have stated, that if you had experience with certain drugs, you may understand or ""enjoy"" this experience more than others. I can't talk to that, not having had that experience. I can say though that this is quite rough to watch. Especially when things spiral downwards ...Still very enticing and tension filled. Technically almost flawless it will depend what you make of the ""story"" or rather the excuse of one to get the viewer to go on a ... well ""trip""!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
experimental French dance party,"A group of dancers has a party in an empty school. Things turn bad when their punch gets spiked. I love the energy of the dancers. There is great exuberance and they dance with abandon. It took about fifteen minutes before I realized that the movie isn't cutting. I assumed it for the rest of the movie and then it changed again. I wish they go for broke and do the movie in one take.It's hard to concentrate on any main character. Sofia Boutella is probably the only noteworthy actor. Some of the others could do more. It's the filming style. They're not allowed to hold the screen and being non-actors, they can't grab it for themselves. Maybe they are better off as an amorphous mob. Again, that would work better as a single take.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not a fun movie, but awe inspiring nonetheless","This is the first movie I've ever watched that almost made me physically ill. It's nihilistic, ugly, erotic, and so devoid of humanity I almost screamed partway through the 40+ minute shot just to get some of the feelings out.At the same time it's a beautiful tour de force with the most visceral dance sequences on film. There are moments of shocking beauty within the chaos. And, most surprisingly of all, it somehow manages to avoid exploitation in any form.This is my first - and probably last - Noe film. I have purposefully chosen not to watch Noe before now. Noe is who Lars Von Trier wishes he could be: dark, subversive, and shocking to the core without cheap gimmicks or an ego visible in every frame. Noe sees brutality and finds beauty, not just because of but in spite of.This isn't a fun movie. If you're unsure if you should watch it, don't. And if you do, watch it sober and with something light as an immediate chaser.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Bonkers,"""Climax"" is less of a film than it is a visceral experience, and that will immediately turn off a good population of moviegoers who will invariable dismiss it as ""artsy garbage."" If you're one of these people who can't stand films made by ""artsy"" directors, what are you even doing going to see a Gaspar Noé movie?But whew. If you appreciate film or dance, you are going to be blown away by this masterpiece. This is ""Step Up"" on crack cocaine.A group of young people who subscribe to an underground dance culture meet for a three-day weekend of intense rehearsal. On the final night, during their closing party, someone spikes the sangria, and well....best not to say much more.The first 45-60 minutes of the film are made up of impeccably choreographed dance sequences that had my eyes glued to the screen like I had just rail-lined a bunch of Ritalin. Some may call this ""boring"" but I found it to be electrifying and mesmerizing. The music in the film is constant, like you're watching it in a nightclub instead of a theater. Electronic powerhouses such as Thomas Bangalter, Giorgio Moroder, and Aphex Twin contribute to the dazzling soundtrack. After the first dance sequence, which lasts about 10-15 minutes, I wanted to stand up and applaud. Then I forgot that I was in a movie theater.I especially enjoyed the cast of characters, which reminded me so much of my days doing musical theater in high school. If you've done performing arts in either high school or college, you will appreciate ""Climax"" on an entirely different level. The awkward politics of being in such a troupe come out in full force -- while everyone is generally nice to one another, rivalries and furious envy exist in the shadows, in addition to cutthroat attitudes and the occasional best friend / power couple dynamic. When things go wrong after the sangria is spiked, these politics are blown up into a larger than life spectacle. It was a neurotic joy to watch unfold.And boy do things get wild. The key theme once the action begins is pure, unadulterated panic. Gaspar Noé's trademark direction brings us back to the chaotic, irregularly lit sequences seen in ""Irreversible."" The action is so dense. Some keep dancing. Some commit acts of violence. Some have passionate sex on the dance floor. Your eyes and senses are overwhelmed and you have no idea where to look, until a fast camera pan takes you to a completely different part of the room.Speaking of which, the cinematography is top notch (although that's a running theme in Noé's repertoire). You've got all kinds of shots here -- dutch angles, long cuts that contribute to the chaos, even slow inversions that make you feel as if you are in a fun house at the Jersey Shore. It's incredibly disorienting, nauseating, and a whole lot of fun.While watching, I also noticed a lot of similarities to Aronofsky's ""Black Swan."" If you enjoyed that one, definitely check out ""Climax.""The ending of the film seems less complete than it should, but it's really no big deal, and does not spoil or ruin the rest of the film.This is one roller coaster I'd happily ride again, and I'd say it is destined to become a midnight cult classic. Keep on dancing.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
It's about the behavior of these people. It's not about a story.,"A party with a lot of dancing people (because it is a dancing group) alcohol and drug abuse cliches. That's pretty much the story of the film. I have to admit, the 2nd time I watched it, it was better. I think, this movie is not about the story, which is predictable, this movie is more about observing these people, and how they behave. And this is done pretty well. Therefore it deserves a 6-star rating but not higher.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"Shocking, dazzling, extraordinary filmmaking","Gaspar Noe is an infamous filmic provocateur, who has inspired the kind of aggressive derision and accordant lofty praise that would be the envy of most other directors. With Climax, he is as dynamic, acerbic and occasionally pretentious as ever, resulting in a film that could be made by no one else, and an experience that is utterly harrowing and genuinely original. 
His ensemble is uniformly believable, giving the scenes of utter chaos a sense of gruelling horror the likes of which I haven't quite experienced in any other film. The soundtrack is booming, the cinematography dizzying, the narrative utterly insane and brazen... an absolute must see, albeit not for the faint of heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Experiential viewing. You have been warned!,"Well. If you are after an experience, I guess this is one. Like a night when you really pushed the boundaries on drink or drugs and you're at the stage when you either need to be sick or walk it off, either way, it's a long night.This is a film about expressive dance, colour palette, drugs and primitive release. It walks the line between nonsense and art.It has shades of Suspiria but is not as refined, it is harsh, like nails down a chalk board at times.It's certainly a trip, I felt I lost balance watching it at some point!Sound up your street?

So pretentious it made me write a review after soooo long,"So I get the premise because I've seen many of of Noe but this was just was too pretentious and trying to neglect character building with the justification of artistry...
Dancers aka bad actors(so much overacting here) taking acid and freaking out in a bad trip....Oh and quirky lighting and rotating camera angles that's all. Supposedly an experience rather than a movie but believe me Noe and sooo many others have done so much better at delivering an experience rather than some dark lighting and the classic upside down camera... It would've been better if he just gave some E or acid to the actors and just observe and tape the reactions.
Concluding, an pretentious avant garde art experience (whoever has had a fair share of art and experimental cinema will know that it doesn't deserve that title) that doesn't even deliver at least that experience while failing in all the rest. And do some research on drugs next time",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Horror art at its best,Don't listen to the negative reviews. Poole who didn't like it don't understand psychology or art.

"Well-made, but utterly pointless","A French dance troupe's party is wrecked when someone spikes their sangria with LSD.This is a really well-made film. The visual style will be really familiar to anyone who's seen a Gaspar Noé film. Lots of long long long takes and bright colours and twirling, tumbling cameras.There are two group dance sequences in this film. They are both utterly phenomenal ... the best thing that this film has to offer,Noé seems to have never taken LSD, or really know much of anything about it.I don't find this film to be shocking. Noé kind of lacks the courage of his convictions here. There's a lot of hypothetically shocking stuff in this film, but most of it happens off screen. The last part of this film is mostly people writhing and screaming.This got old for me pretty fast. About the third time we were following someone down the long green hallway while people screamed in the background, I suspected that there wasn't really going to be any point to this.I was right. At best, this is a really trite version of ""Irreversible"".It's still well-made with a phenomenal soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"An Unparalled Experience, Hard to Even Describe.","The Good: Everything. This film is an unrelenting, powerful, unforgettable experience. Think of it as a dance party from hell. You really should see it, so I'll keep it brief. It captures the kinetic experience of dance with some of the best dancing I've ever seen put on film. The music is unreal, and for a fan of French house is the definitive representation of it on film.Which is funny, because Climax is easily one of the most horrifying films I've seen in a long time. Not for the faint of heart. But honestly, if you take a chance on it, you'll be rewarded with a film you can't really describe. You just have to experience it.The Bad: Nothing, honestly. Gaspar Noe's best film.The Ugly: Again, this movie is NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. If you've ever been clubbing and enjoy it, this might be your perfectly tailored nightmare.

MAMI Review: Climax (7 Stars),"There is so much energy in Gaspar Noe's Climax that I wanted to jump out of my seat and start dancing to the beats of the continuously humming techno soundtrack. Sadly, my fellow audience wouldn't have let me, but deep inside I believe that if I actually did, they would have only joined me. Such is the power of Noe's beautiful, philosophical, and insane techno-dance thriller that hypnotizes from the first frame itself through its immensely talented actors to the anti-climactic credits placement and shots of textual philosophical one-liners to eventually the conveyance of the moral of the short story. The story about a group of French dancers practicing in an old abandoned school premises for an upcoming tournament so that they can compete with the Yankees and show who rules the dancing world takes an ugly turn when the idiosyncratic characters - not one as same as the other - find out that their cocktail was laced with LSD by someone. Who? Why? These questions is in everyone's mind, but the music never stops and no one is in their right mind to sit and think and investigate. And by the time director Noe ends the shots - most of which are single takes - you realize that what you are seeing in front of you is the definition of intoxication and its consequences in its purest form. Climax is true madness and it will blow you away with its truthfulness. TN.(Watched and reviewed at its India premiere at the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
It was a spectacular movie with a great beat.,"It was that beat that made everything consistent as Climax successfully attempts to mix up the format of a narrative and toss us off a bit.(For some reason) set in the mid-90s (Maybe because this type of House music was really popular during this time),a dance troop being assembled for some music event are getting their groove on when someone spikes the punch with some LSD, which has a bizarre variety of effects on the group. It's like an Urban Legend come true.Surprisingly, there is not as many dance segments in the film as I would think, tidbits here and there but not flooded with it, but that score was impressive, and had me bumping. It's like the film composer was a DJ just spinning the sounds of Daft Punk (and a few other dudes from that house era that I'm not going to pretend to know). Maybe that is what happen because that's what it overall felt like.I think the movie was cast with french dancers (Not actors). The only one I knew was Sofia Boutella, who had supporting roles in some great action movies like the Kingsmen and Atomic Blonde (She was also in Star Trek Beyond) Not much acting was needed, the filmmaker just turned the camera on some of these kids and just let them talk naturally (or at least that's what it seems like cause, you know, I don't speak french). There was actually more talk than there was dance, before the movie got really odd with the heavy trip.I've never done LSD myself and in fairness, these kids seem to have done so much in one dose that I'm surprise the film was not far more crazy than it actually was.A simple story made interesting by a kinetic flow to the narrative, sexy people in motion, and a full proof plan to make sure you cannot just up an leave without sitting though the list of everyone credited in making the film.Nice!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Saying it was horrible is an understatement,"It's very hard to put into words how bad this movie is. Nothing interesting really happens, almost half of the movie is filled with seemingly endless dance scenes (some dancing is ok, while some is just random movements like the dancers are having a seizure).The other half of the movie is just disorienting camera work, culminating with the picture being upside down, while the screen is red and blinking. For 15 minutes straight. I almost threw up.Overall, this movie is just a pretentious attempt at making an art movie, but really it's just a waste of time and money. I found it insulting that someone would create such a monstrosity and expect other people to waste their time to see it.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
An Unique Experience,"Before people start screaming about how in Noe's other films some themes are explored better or he handles some techniques the best , this is the first time I've seen one of his films, and it gave me an emotion no other movie (or real life event, for that matter) had ever given me before. Never in my life have I hated so much experiencing something I adored with a passion. And that's Climax. I never want to see it again, and that's surprising, because I never had a problem handling dark themes or gore in films, but this was something else. So anxiety-inducing, so claustrophobic; it made me feel trapped and I enjoyed every second of it. It is a crime this movie did not get at least nominated for best cinematography at the Academy Awards, because the way the camera is handled is superb.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Gaspar Noé, a name you won't forget once you watched one of his movies.","Climax is not a movie for everyone, and that becomes clear when you read the reviews that go from excellent to bad, but you got to give it to director Gaspar Noé, he can make provocative movies like no one else can. But not only the provocative aspect of the movie is interesting but also and mostly the way of filming his subjects. It's all very weird and special, a visual fest for the eyes. The story is quite simple but effective and that's all due to the strange ambiance that reigns throughout the whole movie. Seul Contre Tous is still Gaspar Noé's best work, at least to me, but with Irréversible and now Climax he showed everybody that he's a natural talent and that his movies make people talk about it. I can't wait for the next Gaspar Noé movie, as I'm always curious what it will be this time.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' ceremonial gathering scenes on bath salts,"Gaspar Noé's 'Climax' is labelled as a ""trippy drama horror musical."" Not a lot of people read ""trippy drama horror musical"" and think ""Now that's my kind of movie!"" Indeed, most people will find the movie to be quite objectionable, but that certainly doesn't mean 'Climax' is devoid of artistic merit or accomplishment.The film is a menagerie of dance, neon lighting, long takes, and astounding camera work, propelled forward by a pulsing EDM soundtrack that fills every scene with a frenetic energy. It may best be described as Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' ceremonial gathering scenes on bath salts.

Mind blowing cinematography with a cult feel,"This movie was an outstanding feat to begin with, with most actors having no prior experience and the brilliance of the cinematography. There was a 42 minute take I believe, no jump cuts just switching up who the camera followed taking you along for an excellent ride. And the whole film was done in such a short timeframe.I liked the realism. While not the biggest fan of Vice I found the portrayal of what it's like to do psychedelic drugs in a bad setting quite on point and I think they were the right choice to make a film like this. Of course there is some extremity here and there baring in mind this was based off a true story where nothing really happened, but just the right amount.

"""Climax"" - A Mind-Bending Trip","Climax, directed by Gaspar Noé, is an intense and mind-bending film that takes viewers on a hypnotic journey reminiscent of Noé's earlier work, Enter the Void.The film revolves around a group of dancers who gather for a rehearsal in a remote building. However, their celebration takes a dark turn when they realize that their sangria has been spiked with hallucinogenic drugs. As paranoia and chaos ensue, the characters' descent into madness becomes increasingly mesmerizing and unsettling.Gaspar Noé is known for his unconventional storytelling techniques, and Climax is no exception. The film immerses the audience in a nightmarish and disorienting experience through its non-linear narrative, long takes, and intricate choreography. The camera work is stunning, capturing the raw energy and emotions of the dancers as they spiral into a collective nightmare.The performances in Climax are exceptional, with the ensemble cast delivering raw and visceral portrayals. The film heavily relies on improvisation, which adds to the sense of spontaneity and realism. The actors skillfully convey a range of emotions, from ecstasy to despair, and their physicality is mesmerizing to watch.The visual and auditory elements of Climax are equally captivating. The pulsating electronic score heightens the tension and adds to the film's unsettling atmosphere. The use of vibrant colors and bold lighting further enhances the hallucinatory nature of the story, immersing viewers in a sensory overload.While Climax is a visually stunning and thematically rich film, it may not be for everyone. The explicit content, disturbing imagery, and challenging narrative style can be overwhelming and polarizing. However, for those willing to embrace the experience, Climax offers a unique and unforgettable cinematic trip.In conclusion, Climax deserves a rating of 8/10 for its audacious storytelling, mesmerizing visuals, and powerful performances. Gaspar Noé once again pushes the boundaries of cinema, delivering a film that is both a visually arresting experience and a thought-provoking exploration of human nature.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

One of the most immersive experiences I've had from a film.,"So I saw Climax a few days ago at the theater. I literally have not stopped thinking about the movie and the overall experience the film provided. Casper Noe is a master provocateur and he certainly made a film that will stay with you for days. I can't say it was an enjoyable experience, but I don't think it was supposed to be. It was an incredibly unique and jarring film that should be experienced though.The plot of the movie can be summed up easy enough without spoiling anything. ""Drugs are bad M'Kay"". The film follows a diverse group of dancers as they finish up an intricate and well choreographed dance routine. After a long and tedious introduction the film descends into a nightmare fever dream that is designed to provoke emotions and make you as uncomfortable as possible. The film certainly was a success in that regard.The movie was populated with acts of violence and depravity that will leave many in shock. One of the most terrifying aspects of the film being it was grounded in reality. All these depraved and shocking moments on screen were not exaggerated, but gritty and raw. This only further added to the experience the film provided.I'm having a hard time really classifying this film under any given genre. It certainly had elements of psychological terror and put forward a number of disturbing scenes, but it's not quite horror. Hell it's almost hard to classify this as a film in the first place in the traditional sense. This feels more like an interactive art project than a coherent story.Like the best abstract art this movie acts as a Rorschach test designed to push viewers experiences. I normally don't read other reviews before writing my own, but I had to see how other people interpreted the film. Is it a philosophical meditation on human nature? An allegorical masterpiece? A product of insanity or genius? Is it pretentious nonsense? Or is it simply exploitive trash? It can be all those things and much more. It was an experience that demands to be felt. I can't say I enjoyed the film, but it was one of the most immersive experiences I've had from a film.Climax asks the audience a complex question. Is art designed to be enjoyed or experienced? In the case of Climax the movie is designed specifically to provoke an emotion. Climax wants you to feel something as a viewer. Something primal, uncomfortable, and anxiety inducing. It's the kind of jarring experience that will leave you in shock for day. It was the kind of experience that will really make you think about the movie. Climax demands that you are an active viewer. It really pushes the boundaries of what it means to be a film.From a purely technical point this movie should be seen anyway. The cinematography and choreography were outstanding. Of course all of the dance numbers were intricate and well done, but the most impressive aspect being how they were shot. The film utilizes single takes for long stretches of time all the while the camera seamlessly floats around capturing some truly wonderful scenes. There's almost a 20 minute stretch without a single cut all the while the camera acts as an omnipresent viewer following different characters and their drug-induced stupor. Plus the color and lighting of the film were perfect to push the changes that occurred in the narrative of the film. It's not my genre of music, but the techno dance soundtrack was also perfectly incorporated. The technical aspects were the best part of the film and really stand out.That all being said Climax was not what I would call a good movie in any traditional way. While the film is relatively short, around 40 minutes of the movie was literally nothing but mindless dialogue and dancing. This wasn't a case of a slow burn start to build suspense. It was a tedious and mind-numbing experience just to make you feel uncomfortable. There simply was no driving plot for the bulk of the film. All of your expectations as a viewer ultimately fall flat as the movie never really delivers on its promise providing terror. I will also add that while yes, the scenes were designed to be provocative, I have certainly seen worse in film. The content didn't make me feel uncomfortable as much as the movie itself did.I also have to mention how utterly terrible the acting and dialogue was. All of the dialogue felt utterly pointless and added nothing to the film. It would be one thing if the actors delivered their lines in a believable manner, but they all failed to do so. The whole thing felt far more like a College term project instead of a major film. I will also mention that the abstract and allegorical aspects of the film were purely unintentional on the directors behalf. He has gone on record saying the film is not a allegory and ultimately he wasn't making a social or political statement. Sometimes viewers read into things that simply aren't there.So Climax was one of the most disturbing experiences I've had since Salo. In both cases the films weren't truly scary, but they were uncomfortable and anxiety inducing. Climax is less of a coherent film and more of an art project. It is the kind of ultimately pretentious content that will have critics raving. I did not enjoy Climax as a movie. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the film and I liked that they tried to make an immersive and powerful experience. The film was very successful in that regard. As far as crafting an intricate psychological thriller this movie falls flat and will leave many bored and scratching their head wondering what the hype was about.This is an incredibly difficult film to try and rank numerically. It succeeded in everything it was trying to accomplish, still it had too many glaring issues for me to call it a good movie. I would still highly recommend everyone watch it though for a unique and powerful experience. Climax will certainly make you feel something as a viewer and if that is enough for you the film is sure to wow. For me it was just a muddled nightmare that tried way too hard to be cool. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

He is clearly trying so hard to shock the audience and make everyone hate the movie to such a degree that I don't see a point in indulging in his twisted fantasies that have no ultimate payoff. The film is just mindless violence and stupid shock value with terrible characters,plot and sub-par acting.Noe might say he draws inspiration from Kubrick but he's just an art-house version of Eli Roth. The craftsmanship of some shots and some good cinematography are the only reasons why the movie gets two stars even though the last fifteen minutes are shot upside down which made me want to pick up my TV and throw it out the window to make sure that it never has to endure another of Noe's films.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

A Haunting Ball,"I watched Climax without knowing any plot detail or having watched and footage that had to do with the film.But, even if I had watched them, I assure you that nothing can prepare you for what you will expercience while watching this film- Climax is a truly immersive and intoxicating ride that cannot be described or compared to anything else.
 Gaspar Noe plays with your mind and your emotions in every way possible. The nightmarish cineatography, the unsetting colours apperaing in the screen, the horryfiyng soundtrack ( Supernature is spectacular!), the the non-stop movement of the camera and the incredible work by the cast- which mainly consists of kids between 18 to 23 years old who only do sorts of krump dance-offs or voguing balls mash up in a 1 and a half hour film which is as electrifiyng as hell. 
I really admire such films, that are able to make you part of their universe, even if it is totally odd and ablnormal, and force you to feel one of with the situation, thus creating a completely genuine cinematic expericence.
 I also love the filrst dance scene, which is actually a single shot and you can actually see the amount of effort that the actors put to take you by the hand and pull you in their own world filled with fleeting plesures. And this is what CLIMAX really is.
 It's horrifying but beautiful, sick but true, dark but colourful, dead but alive.
It's nothing BUT everything.

the pleasure of feeling uncomfortable,"I loved Enter the Void (2009) and Irreversible (2002) and i knew that Gaspar Noé will make, this time too, an unforgettable movie. Through atypical technique which he masters terribly good, with psychedelic visuals and a heavy but dynamic load of suspense, succeeds to put in image the violent creeps of the world hidden in the human mind at certain moments of implacable delusion.
Important in this film is the hue - the contrast between the white of snow outside and the wild colour inside, the neon cinema which spread shades of reddish darkness (like a bleeding nightmare running through the hallways), the racial and sexual diversity. The whole dance floor looks like a sangria - the drink that represented the center point, the mechanism that made everything spin in a chaotic circle of dementia.
The eye of the camera reveals incredible dance skills, a hypnotizing choreography and the paranoia that grows in intensity to climax.
Life and death presented as terrifying experiences and the endless music that maintains an exhausting atmosphere, make you remember this movie a long time, make you live with it, love it, but did not want to see it again.
If this movie succeeds in making the spectator uncomfortable on this exhausting journey, Gaspar Noé will fall asleep satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

A Beautiful and Brutal Experience,"Wow.I've been a massive Gaspar Noe fan since I first watched 'Irreversible' at age 11 (I sure regretted that experience), and was crazy excited to hear he was working on a new movie. A group of dancers drinking sangria laced with potent LSD? And their slow descent into madness is shown through their dance moves? Sign me up!Then I watched it. And there was honestly nothing that could have fully prepared me for the ride this took me on. I haven't been so disturbed by a movie since 'Hereditary,' and honestly, this is kind of on the same level as that movie (for me, at least).From a technical standpoint alone, this movie is a masterpiece. The camerawork is inventive and often hypnotic, and even the sound design and subtle CGI elevate the moods and frenetic energy of the dancers. Speaking of, the dancers all do an amazing job; their dialogue is almost entirely improvised, which makes their conversations feel so natural and real. The soundtrack, of course, is the main star of the film and will entertain you at first, then utterly disturb you when you see how the characters act (particularly the Giorgio Moroder song near the end).Any emotions Noe wanted to convey, he succeeded in doing so. While not every character gets as much screen time as the next, they are all interesting and add something to the film. Every time a character takes a sip of sangria, you get a bigger pit in your stomach. When everyone realizes what's going on, everything goes off the rails and we're subjected to an absolutely horrific and chill-inducing experience unlike any other. This movie blew my mind, I really don't know what to say. I've seen a lot of negative reviews for this movie, and I kind of understand why. This is 100% not a movie for everyone. The dialogue gets graphic at times, there are a few scenes of really shocking violence that some might not be able to handle and there are no moments that alleviate the constant tension once the going gets good. But for those familiar with Noe's works and those who are willing to take a wild ride, Climax is one of the best films you'll ever experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Kill the dance floor, but do not kill the rhythm.","Noé concentrates all his author traits, but incorporates enough novel elements to leave us satisfied. Once you start the plot you can not stop looking. We're trapped.The film seduces us with its rhythms and its daring staging through the corporal expression of the actors-dancers. Beautiful and brutal.Technically and artistically it is splendid, it borders on perfection, but, the argument does not go that far. Presents a choral cast and then focus on a single character. We know the motivations and fears of the characters through a brief interview at the beginning of the film and through the psychotropic trip. This leaves us with a film that is more empty than it seems.When he talks about human drama, the plot is great, however, when he leaves this drama, the film falls apart. The last 45 minutes are long, slow and obtuse.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Masterpiece,"The cinema of Gaspar Noé reconfirms itself as a unique visual experience, its long-awaited return has not disappointed expectations and brings us back to the world of psychedelics as only he can do.
We are in the 90s and a dance company meets in an abandoned building to practice and have fun. The title is clear, it is a real ascendant climax, everything flows in the right direction until they start one at a time to feel bad and the atmosphere becomes more and more anxious. The reason is discovered shortly after, in the buffet next to the improvised dance floor LSD is placed in the sangria, creating panic, death and destruction among the dancers.Gaspar Noé is a provocateur, a director from whom you never know what to expect exactly, but you know he will be able to enchant you and horrify you. Trying to make comparisons with his filmography we can say that he has extreme scenes that can be traced back to Seoul Contre Tous and Irreversible, which remain his cinematographic apex, and Enter the Void as use of the video camera and theme, so he places himself in the middle. As for the cinema in general, it is a fusion of Salò by Pasolini and Step Up, a crazy combination that works.I think the purpose of this film is to disorient, starting with the credits that appear first on the screen, followed by the opening credits 10 minutes later. I particularly appreciated the fusion of psychedelics and the fully articulated dancers, I am not kidding about hypnosis, anyone who has seen that Enter the Void trip will know what I mean. The physical skill of the actors and their naturalness make their mental failure caused by drugs very credible, regressing in a few minutes to primitive beings and making the climax explode in all its delicious violence. For the rest there is not much to say, we have the usual long and wonderful sequence plans that follow the actors, we have an omnipresent care for the lights and colors, in particular the red, in short everything that was expected from the genius of Noah.

"Hypnotic, beautiful, thought-provoking, silly, and a bit boring","What a film. When I wasn't mesmerized by the insanely beautiful dance scenes, I was bored to tears by the characters explaining the plot each other or trying to cover my laughter in the theatre. Some of the scenes were hilarious. I'd really like to avoid using the word ""pretentious"", but the dialogue, or general interaction between some of the characters felt pretentious. Weird for the sake of being weird. Which is sad, since most of the scenes manage to capture the eerie euphoria of the party perfectly.The party is a joy to see and hear. The soundtrack was nothing short of perfect, but after two visually stunning first two ""parts"", the third part is somewhat bland looking.I wish there'd been more of the good stuff. The movie turned out to be pretty lame, I was told that this movie is terrifying. It was, but I really mostly laughed at the movie, in a positive way.

Maybe it's better if you're French,"There's no denying that Gaspar Noe has developed a unique and arresting visual language. The camera is as much a character in his movies as any of the people. In the service of a great idea, this can make for a stunning film, and Noe did that very adroitly in Enter the Void.In this film, however, his visual innovations are largely wasted, as they contribute mostly disorientation without any seeming reason for it.So, the plot in a nutshell: A bunch of French dancers get together for a rehearsal. Someone spikes the sangria with LSD. They all go nuts in an orgy of sex, violence, and general screaming and confusion.There are certainly references to Dante's inferno, and I would imagine that there's a good bit of commentary on French politics, in as much as there's a big red white and blue curtain that forms a giant French flag. One of the characters even remarks on it, in case you don't catch it.I will say that I did not find this movie nearly as disturbing as some of the other reviewers here. Yes, some of the violence was pretty nasty, but I was expecting something much much worse.The camera goes a little nutty during the acid sequence, and while I suppose the effect is meant to be hallucinatory, it really just makes the scene confusing.This is clearly meant to be an allegorical movie that's not meant to be taken literally, but even taking that into account, I can't get over my main beef with this film: To the best of my knowledge, LSD has NEVER made a group of people act like that. One might thing that Gaspar has no knowledge of LSD whatsoever, apart from war-on-drugs propaganda, but having seen Enter the Void, that doesn't seem possible.I'm giving this movie six stars mostly for technical excellence. There are some arresting images, and some of the camera effects couldn't have been easy to pull off. But unless you're really interested in oblique commentaries on French politics, I think you could miss this one without feeling like you've missed out on anything important.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

I was fortunate to watch this movie in Mumbai Film Festival. The movie is a rollercoster. It keeps you intrigued till the end of the movie.

Where is all the sex and violence,"I am, I suspect, in the minority here, but I feel that after seeing all of Gaspar Noe's body of work you come to expect another boundary pushing instalment of art. Climax, for me, was dull and predictable. on first discovering Noe, I was invigorated by his fearless approach to filmmaking, his choices in content and texture were exciting and straddled the realms of decency and the taboo. I would always seek out his newest creation, until now. Climax seemed like a lazy and confirmative tick box exercise that never really gets out of the gates. It neither disturbs or delights, or tackles anything that I would normally flinch at, this is what I expect to see when buying a ticket to a Noe film. Red backdrops are now boring, I get it, red means danger, love, sex, blood etc etc. pumping pulsing soundtracks are there to disorientate and unsettle, boring, next, move along. drugs drugs drugs, erect dicks and maturbation, need I go on. Show me something new Gaspar, not snippets of your better films cut together like a bad greatest hits album, you are better than this, Climax was a sloppy idea and I can only surmise that you have now run out of ideas.

Amazing dance sequences, cinematography, and sound design. Some of the directorial choices (e.g., the opening ""end credits,"" the name titles appearing in the middle of the film, the ending) I wasn't sure how to feel about, but it certainly made the entire thing even more interesting. Overall, it literally felt like the film experience of what a ""living nightmare"" would be like. Certainly an experience to remember. Also, very strong acting.

Have a Bad trip with Gaspar Noe,"Gaspar Noe's ""Climax"" is a disturbing work of art that is sure to pull the viewer in using both beautiful and disturbing imagery.I rate this film highly because of the unconventional methods employed by Noe to create this memorable and haunting narrative. Noe said that he only had about three pages of writing about what he wanted the movie's plot to encompass, and the rest was improvised by the cast. The cast, besides the two main female characters, are all professional dancers and not trained actors at all. Noe utilizes a method of filming that involves the camera on his shoulder as he follows one character until they intersect or interact with another. These long shots following characters is something Noe is known for; in this film it creates a sense of not being able to escape or skip past certain parts of the plot.Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk is to thank for an immersive and high-energy soundtrack. The dance sequences, as well as the credits occurring in the middle of the movie, separate this film into pre-trip and during-trip sections and are amazing to see. I love that Noe celebrates dance in this movie. After the sangria is spiked, this movie is the epitome of a bad trip, and I feel claustrophobic watching it. It's certainly a ""worst case situation"" movie. I can only describe this film's journey as pulsating.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Technical Brilliance With Not Much More,"This is technically brilliant. The lighting, camera angles, and long shots are among some of the most effective I've seen in cinema, leaving the audience brutally disoriented.However, that disorientation flows over into the rest of the experience, leaving little more than primal fear and confusion for the viewer. I think that Noe has the technical chops to be among the greatest horror directors in this decade, but needs to connect these cinematic tools to a narrative and message that are as compelling as the execution themselves.If you were to consider that half of a rating is for execution and technical considerations, and the other half for storytelling and narrative, then Climax has a perfect half of the former and falls flat in the latter.It's worth a watch if you enjoy indie horror, french experimental film, or liked Raw (Julia Ducournau, 2016) but felt like it was too linear in its message.If that last part applies to you, please message me. I don't think you actually exist.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Drug-shaming conservative garbage.,"This movie is ridiculously stupid and pretentious. The good reviews are baffling.This is ham-handed poser arthouse cinema.Marketed as based on a true story -- which is a lie. After some digging you can find an interview where Noe reveals the ""real life"" incident involved a ""much smaller"" dance party where drinks were spiked and things ""went sour...BUT NOTHING BAD HAPPENED"". OH OK! Noe decided to make club goers into drug-crazed raping incestual violent simpletons completely and totally as artistic license. In most interviews he asserts he just took some artistic license to avoid dealing with the real people involved. That is nothing but BS considering ""nothing bad happened"". This movie is based on Noe hearing about drinks being spiked at some party sometime. With a foundation that vague, it's no wonder the movie comes across like a performer who didn't prepare before they took the stage.It ranks up there with Reefer Madness in the portrayal of LSD and drugs. If you have ever taken LSD or been around people who are on it, you will be confused. It's absolutely preposterous. They act like they are on some combination of bath salts and PCP.The characters are terrible and nasty people. The gay characters act with the same toxic masculinity as the straight characters. Just wrong. It's over the top to the point of of ridiculousness. All the characters act like nihilistic young Republicans, carelessly offensive and unashamedly selfish. These are supposed to be professional dancers deep in the club/dance music scene -- it's preposterous. This is nothing like what the dance music world is like.I was hoping for at least some cool psychedelic scenes to simulate the LSD use, but there's none. Noe turns the camera upside down for the last 10 minutes of the movie. No reason. Ohhhh cooool.Three times during the movie he blasts boring, asinine, glib phrases onto the screen, like ""death is an amazing experience"" or ""birth is a unique opportunity"" -- oh really, Mr Noe? Tell us more you wise, wise man. The birth statement comes across as an anti-abortion message -- it follows characters discussing abortions, unemotionally and unflinchingly, y'know, cus that's how people who have abortions are like. Cold and heartless and open to talk about it with virtual strangers.Midway thru the movie Mr Noe flashes his own name on the screen repeatedly, each time imitating a classic dance music label logo. It's incredibly egotistical and appropriative.The movie has a great soundtrack with real quality electronic music, like Dopplereffekt and Aphex Twin. Someone who really understands and loves club culture curated the soundtrack. And the dance scenes before things ""go sour"" are cool.Mr Noe however does not understand club culture. He made a movie that is an insult to club culture and comes across as a deeply stereotypical, conservative anti-drug movie. The only way it could halfway fly is if there was some nightmare unbelievable-but-true event that inspired it, but there's not..at all. You have to buy the idea that LSD does this to people and that club culture is just a druggy nightmare filled with hostile and dangerous people, which is how it's almost always presented. Raves=drugs=bad. Give us a break already.Anybody who thinks this is a good ""arty"" movie is being taken for a ride.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

What the hell happened to Gaspar Noe?,The movie script appears to have been written by an amateur who has never used drugs. Was that the same Gaspar Noe from Irreversible and Enter The Void who wrote it? A GIGANTIC retrograde.,1.0,Anonymous,Music
Unequivocally the best film of 2019 (already),"Gaspar Noé is one of the boldest, most unmistakable artists of all time. His films are so relentlessly horrifying, on visual, emotional, and even auditory levels, that they oft induce literal nausea (but still impress). Their colors are stark, their actors show authentic agony, and their camera work is ambitiously executed, including takes that last upwards of 30 minutes. His camera has its own life, even if we don't always feel as if we're on the mortal plane.Climax, his latest piece of French extremism, is not as hallucinatory as you may expect; it never lets us see that which is seen by its drugged protagonists, but simply observing their gradual descent into madness and anarchy in an isolated space via the hovering camera is still an outlandish experience. This is, of course, largely due to the acting. Even when the shots are seemingly endless and contain 20-ish actors doing things at once and several subplots intertwining, no-one in the cast or camera crew ever miss a beat. Or the special effects crew for that matter.It may qualify as one of the most flawlessly coordinated movies of the past 20 years, although I must note that many scenes (excluding the early, astonishing dance number) are improvised - so many, in fact, that in spite of its intricacies, Climax proved a relatively brisk production. The horrific intro in the snow was only added because, well, it had been snowing.The plot concerns a diverse class of dancers who, on a cold and dark night in the year 1996, gather in an abandoned school to celebrate a succesful rehearsal, only to find that the alcohol has been spiked with LSD and things go to Hell and beyond. There are some nods here to the works of Noe's old friend and fellow filmmaker Dario Argento, including a clearly visible Suspiria case during the prologue (I also spotted ""Labyrinth Man"", The Possession, and something by Fritz Lang).Most famous on the cast list is probably Sofia Boutella, known to overseas filmgoers for Star Trek Beyond (i.e. the one film from the new batch that actually feels like Star Trek) and the infinitely insipid Mummy reboot. I want this to be the film that truly opens the door for her and showcases her skill. But then, the acting all-around is unthinkably good.The setting, as I wrote above, is tight and isolated, and the music played in this place is perfectly selected. Trippy songs by the likes of Aphex Twin, Coh, and Wild Planet go well with the unnerving sounds of frequent Noe collaborator Thomas Bangalter.Noe has previously made Irreversible (which I found too disorienting on my first viewing and need to finish) and Enter the Void, which I've only seen a handful of times but confidently include amongst my favorite movies of all time. People weren't too hot on Love, but this is no doubt a return to form.I saw someone call Climax an anti-drug film, irately so. I believe it is only anti drugs in the same way that Requiem for a Dream is an ""anti-drug film"". If straightforwardly depicting the effects of acid makes a film ""anti drugs"", take it up with the drugs. Noe has first-hand experience with illegal substances; they inspired him to master the hallucinogenic imagery of Enter the Void and Irreversible. He seems the right man to portray their users.I don't care that we are only 3 months in. This is, unequivocally, my favorite movie of the entire year and may yet become even more than that. It is directed, shot, acted, and presented without fault, creating an experience that (despite, again, lacking outright surreal images) make nightmares seem escapist. I expected to utterly love it and it still went beyond. If it was mathematically possible for me to give it more than a 10/10 and place it higher on my list than number 1, I would. My God, Noe, you absolute madman!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Intense Bad Trip: Don't do Drugs Kids,"So I don't even know if Climax counts as a movie to be honest. Its more like a filthy documentary or a bad trip on steroids where all kinds of crazy stuff happen. There is lots of dancing in this movie, much of it is very awkward and random but I really really enjoyed it (i love weird dancing). I wouldnt call Climax horror, it has certain horror elements but also it has lots of drama and a kind of thriller vibe because you don't know what kind of depravity will happen next. Something you should know about this movie is that there is no plot, none... literally. Its mostly people dancing, people walking around, sexual scenes, people freaking out, rolling on the floor, crying, fighting in a random order.You can certainly enjoy it for what it is, I havent seen anything like it before. Made me wonder what effects LSD would have on an actual group of people. In this movie LSD caused everyone to have really perverse behavior, creating a really dark atmosphere. One thing is for sure, you will feel weird while watching the entire thing, you will even feel a little bit weird after the end of the film. I guess you could say that the symbolism of this film is that we all have a dark side and under the right circumstances this dark side comes to light or maybe the symbolism is ''don't do drugs kids'' haha, I don't know you decide.If you want to watch a movie with a plot, structure, a beginning and an end, you should avoid it.

Fantastically lit with Noe's neon style, we are brought into the heat of this story through the spinning frames.It was perhaps slightly too long with sequences that could have been cut shorter and some dialogue cut out to hide some of the slightly questionable acting. However this doesn't really seem to affect the film, as they are all on drugs, so their lacking of technique at times fits well.Me and my friends left the cinema and couldn't talk for atleast 10 minutes, which tells you how much of an effect this film has on you!Go and watch it, you'll probably learn something about humanity, and if not atleast something about great filmmaking!Ignore the bad reviews, I expect they couldn't handle the psychological trauma and the bad ratings are a defence mechanism as they couldn't really comprehend the vision.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
the drugs don't work in 1996 (or 2018),"Whenever a director decides to make a period piece I always ask myself from which place in time s/he is looking back from.Is this movie advocating a lost time in which we were less consumed by technology or is this a rehab talk down memory lane?
If your answer is ""it shouldn't matter"" you chose to obviously ignore Noe's capitalized messages informing you of ""universal truths"" through which you should observe his film.I couldn't shake the feeling that it had a surprisingly moralizing attitude towards itself - that was rightfully missing from his previous ""crimes"" (as he loves to coin it) and lacked the riveting heart and soul that kept me engaged during ""Irreversible"" and ""enter the void"".",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"An earnestly disturbing, finely executed second half is worth the wait","I've seen enough movies from A24 to place great trust in any films they're involved in producing or distributing. To date I've seen only a couple of filmmaker Gaspar Noé's other movies; I thought 'Irreversible' was good, if broadly too unremarkable and specifically too sadistic, while I found 'Enter the void' to be dull overindulgence - a good idea for a short film that was erroneously expanded to almost three hours. I'll watch almost anything, however, and I strive to find the value that anyone has to offer, so given an enticing premise for 'Climax,' how could I refuse? It takes awhile for its worth to present itself, but when all is said and done, the profit here as a viewer is well worth the price of admission, and this is easily the best of Noé's films I've seen so far.It's worth observing that as the picture first begins, the first impression it makes is unfortunately a bad one. Whoever was responsible for designing the subtitles in 'Climax' should reexamine their choice in careers, for the text built into the feature is so ridiculously small that I think only those with eyesight that's far better than average have a real chance of catching every word. In fairness, this stylistic decision may have been deliberate, for ultimately the characters and dialogue are mostly superfluous. This is a movie that is, specifically, very visual in nature, and the details of who characters are or what they're saying to one another don't matter a whole lot. On the other hand, given that these two aspects were accordingly improvised by the largely non-professional cast, given free reign to create as they would, it seems a disservice to them to have so heavily deemphasized the work they put in. I don't necessarily like the choices they made as such, but I admire the approach and the effort all the same, and it's a pity all this was downplayed so much. To speak off the cuff, right away, about the subtitles may superficially seem like nitpicking, but in this instance I feel like it's surprisingly revealing, one way or another.Put these revelations aside, and there's a great deal to like about 'Climax.' At its best Benoît Debie's cinematography, and Noé's direction from a standpoint of arranging shots and scenes, is utterly brilliant and inspired. The long shots, tracking shots, freely moving cameras, and unconventional angles are all fantastic. I love the art direction, the costume design, the hair and makeup work, and the use of lighting. Not least with an ensemble predominantly comprised of dancers, the artistry and physical prowess the cast demonstrates with their improvised moves is extraordinary - a real treat; would that we'd gotten still more. Moreover, as the course of events takes a turn, the cast demonstrate a marvelous fierceness in their acting that's delicious; Sofia Boutella is the one person here who is at all familiar to me, but as fine an actor as she is, in 'Climax' she's hardly alone. Even the manner in which the credits are displayed are unorthodox, but inventive and enticing in its own right. And it should be said - the music assembled for the soundtrack is fabulous, rich and invigorating, adding tremendously to the somewhat delirious viewing experience.With all this having been said, there's a decided lack of narrative in the feature, but nor does it especially need any. The premise quite speaks for itself - a dance rehearsal that devolves into a nightmare with the addition of spiked drinks - and all the details that round out the content appear to have been conjured on the spot between Noé and his cast. My commendations to them all, for while the film is split into discrete halves, and the first is troubled from a standpoint of attaining and sustaining viewer engagement, the second half handily compensates for it. As 'Climax' takes a turn, and the characters all experience meltdowns, the resulting portraiture is pointedly unsettling if not altogether disturbing. The cast spiritedly embrace the madness, and those fundamental elements of film-making that already impressed in their own right are likewise employed to ever more imaginative ends, amplifying the genuine sense of horror that arises from the grim tableau. This neatly fits the bill as psychological horror, only, it's atypically unbothered about how the breakdown is depicted.The greatest fault of Noé's movie is the considerable imbalance. That the full second half of 'Climax' is so good is wonderful; that it is necessary to pick up so much slack from the first half is frustrating. The poorly designed subtitles are especially notable given the wealth of early dialogue and character development that is later dispensed with entirely. The dancers get their time to shine both as non-professional actors and with their chief skill set; would that we'd have gotten more of the latter, and less of those bits which are all but entirely discounted. The first 45 minutes or so come off as a bit of a slog, requiring patience, and not particularly demanding active engagement (or even discouraging it). Again - all congratulations for what is done well here, but the unevenness is a glaring flaw that nonetheless detracts from the whole.Still, much more so than not, I find myself thoroughly entertained and invested, and the payoff is worthwhile. Where 'Irreversible' and 'Enter the void' both failed to earn my favor in various ways, with 'Climax' Noé unquestionably illustrates the ingenuity as a filmmaker and a storyteller that in my mind at last makes him worthy of his reputation. Hereafter I hope to watch more of his pictures, and I hope he impresses elsewhere in his oeuvre. Even if not, though, this one title already feels like a diamond mined from less than shimmery environs. Characterized by stupendous camerawork, superb contributions from the cast, and a sincerely disquieting prolonged ""narrative"" peak, 'Climax' is an excellent, absorbing slice of underhanded horror that deserves more recognition.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Kind of a comeback for Noe.,Irreversible was done better though.. His camera tricks are getting overused now. What was once artsy and innovative just seems a bit lazy now. His upside down tracking shot he uses in this had me frustrated because by that point in the movie I really wanted to see what the heck was going on and not struggling to see what madness ensued.

More French Arty Garbage.,"This is an extraordinarily bad movie experience.
This is from same director who made Irreversible, the movie which prompted mass walk outs and for good reason. He seems to enjoy disgusting people with violence most would not class as entertainment. We yet again are subjected to extended discussions about anal sex which seems to be a theme in this directors work, to what purpose? It seems its all about intentionally trying to provoke disgust ""in the name of art"". In Climax we see pregnant women being kicked in the stomach, small children drugged and electrocuted and incest between siblings.
That is the tone of the movie and it beggars belief that this has any high ratings on here at all, or it says alot about the moral compass of those who enjoyed this trash. Its basically aimed at a pretentious audience who believe they have superior taste to others because they think ""enjoy"" things the majority rightly ignore or that because the movie is in French its somehow above critique. If this had come from Hollywood or if more people knew about its content it would have been slated.
The film itself doesn't amount to much. Its based around a group of dancers, we initially see them being interviewed then it moves to the dancefloor. An extended stylised dance sequence takes place before a party where most the dancers drink a sangria spiked with LSD. The remainder of the film is basically each dancer having a bad LSD trip and the final act is just plain nonsense with everyone writhing around on the floor while a red strobe flashes and camera is shot upside down. Oooh arty.
The odd thing is that none of the dancers seem to have any clue as to how LSD affects individuals, they all have the same reaction which is negative. This rings hollow. Anyone who has attended a rave or music festival where hundreds if not thousands of people may be on drugs do not all decide to try and kill each other. Its not a realistic premise. Nor is the premise that despite bad things happening they would all decide to hang around in the same room. Its difficult to make a movie about being trapped with others when the doors are all unlocked. Fail.
There really isn't anything about this which is positive, its odd that quite a few well know electronic musicians agreed to have their music attached to such a bad movie. That being said the musical choices of each artists don't exactly fit well with the scenes they are used in. Although the soundtrack is probably what attracts some of the audience.
Oh yeah the closing credits of the movie are at the start and some of them are written upside down or backwards. If you think thats ""edgy"" then you may like but if you just find it tedious trying to read upside down or backwards then head for the exit because it just gets worse,way worse after the credits roll.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
CLIMAX.......Gaspar Noe's Best ??? Definately.,"Climax is not only the best !!!!! According to me but also the film which tells us the effects of drug on humans.
The ""Opening Dance Choreography"" is the best one which grabs the viewers attention quickly.

"Truly ""way out there"" experimental film","""Climax"" (2018 release from France; 96 min.) brings the story of a dance troupe. As the movie opens, a choreographer is interviewing each of them to get more personal background information. We then switch to a rehearsal, where we see the dancers perform as classic dance tunes of Cerrone and Patrick Hernandez are thundering. As the rehearsal concludes, the dancers start talking to one another, while most of them drink lots of sangria. The stories become gossipy rather quickly... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from noted experimental French director/editor Gaspar Noe. Here he brings to the big screen a story inspired by true events that took place in France in 1996, as we are reminded by the movie's opening credits. When I see the term ""inspired"", I translate that as ""very loosely based on, with lots of artistic licensing, just because"". The movie is really two films in one: the rehearsal and its immediate aftermath, and then the transition into personal hell for these dancers. The film was made on a very small budget and with little to no prior dancing experience by the cast. Oh, and did I mention that the movie's opening dance rehearsal and subsequent conversation comes in one long shot of about 15 min.? And that there are subsequent single shots that run even longer? Yea, it's kinda like that. The contrast between the movie's opening scenes and the last 15 min. or so couldn't be further apart mood-wise (and screaming-wise). There is a ferocity in these acting performances that are bound to unsettle some (they sure did unsettle me). Bottom line: this is a movie that is truly ""way out there"", but not without its merits (I don't really want to use the word ""charming"" as that is really the exact opposite of what this movie is). Last but not least, there is a ton of great dance music featured throughout the movie (Cerrone, Patrick Hernandez, Giorgio Moroder, Soft Cell, and on and on).""Climax"" premiered at last year's Cannes film festival and finally opened in US theaters this month. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati, was attended dismally (5 people, including myself), and I'd be surprised if this plays more than one week. If you are in the mood for a weird cocktail of dance and talk and all hell breaks loose, all with a French twist, then by all means I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater (not very likely at this point), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

From paradise to hell,"Climax is a French-Belgian movie written and directed by Argentinian-French filmmaker Gaspar Noé. It is apparently based on real event that date back to mid-90s. Climax is the insanity, hallucination, and fear of using acid; it has an ordered chaos; it's a cocktail of panic and music that starts with dancing, then reaches terror, and finally collapses into frenzy; it is aesthetically admirable and ethically questionable; it's migration from paradise to hell; it's the downfall of human civilization; it's the realization of savagery. Climax is dance-inducing, dizziness-causing, headache-giving, nauseating, annoying, exhausting, musical, breathtaking, unharnessed, excessive, inhuman, filthy, harsh, bloodstained, colorful, high-contrasted, noisy, thrilling, crowded, torturing, revenge-seeking, nightmarish, abusive, intruding, shameful, horror, inverse, obscure, frosty and hot; it takes you to death.

Electro-Dance Madness,"Climax is an intense and hallucinating experience. I watched this film at the Sydney Film Festival last year and still can't get over it. In my opinion, Climax must be the second or third best film I watched in 2018. Once again, Gaspar Noe has reinvented his very characteristic style to create another unconventional arthouse film. As most of Noe's films, Climax is disturbing, polarising and highly controversial. Meaning that it's not a film for everyone. Having said that, for the ones that appreciate experimental cinema, this is a must-see.Climax is an absolute audio-visual feast. The dance sequences, beats and long shots are beautifully assembled, creating a hypnotising and electrifying spectacle. As the film unfolds, the characters all fall into a frightening atmosphere of tension and death. Climax represents the multiplicity of human emotions at the same time: euphoria, joy, sadness, surprise and fear. Every frame of this film is composed with amazing cinematography and perfect editing. This is a film to be watched on the big screen with the best audio system. Climax is an absolute masterpiece and I will never forget it.Score: 10/10FJ Medina",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Toxic, wild and visceral","Having been an admirer of Gaspar Noe's work, this has to be the most accessible of his work. So yeah, if this movie did not really appeal to you, you are probably not gonna like his other work.Noe is quite a polarizing figure in cinema, for you will either find his work interesting or find it banal....and this is a film by film basis. Critics will have a hard time judging this against Noe's other films, pro-drug advocates will hate the unfair representation of LSD, and of course identity politics gatekeepers will accuse the film of portraying toxic homosexual characters as no different than toxic heterosexual people. Regardless, not everything is uniform in this world.Anyway, what makes this film unique amongst the current pantheon of cinema is the fact Noe once again heavily relied on non-professional actors, scant scripting and even fewer camera movements and cuts. It has all the hallmarks of his past work, only this story took an incredibly dark turn and we were also going to witness the aftermath.I don't recommend Gaspar Noe's films to people unless they are used to watching this type of cinema. So yeah, if you want to expand your mind....start with this one in Noe's library. If you wanna keep watching simple comic book movies, this might not be for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"I guess you can call this movie ""Requiem for A Dream but without great acting, meaningfull scenes and good music"".","I was looking for something intense to watch, something scary and disturbing that would make me think and I wouldn't forget as soon as the credits rolled. Climax is sure one of those movies but not in a good way I'll tell you that. The thing is the pace is terrible and by that I mean that the first half of the movie is so unbelievably boring and meaningless, full of scenes of people dancing and talking about sex, drugs and gossip that it makes you angry. I felt so tempted to give up on the movie during the first 45 minutes but I decided to stick on it since I was assuming that some action was building up and I was right. The second half is full of desturbing scenes of people doing crazy and violent stuff, blaming eachother, dancing (again), screaming (all in all it's a complete mess). I really enjoy intense movies but this is something else. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for the simple reason that the first half is boring and the second half is so disturbing that it's impossible to go through without cringing to the whole craziness of it all. If you hate yourself and you want to watch something that is going to make you feel terrible and empty then watch this movie. Also if you have any friends who think drugs are cool I recommend you make them watch it because after this they're going to change their mind.

"Intense and effecting, it needs to be experienced to be believed, a truly visceral film","CLIMAX is written and directed by Gaspar Noé (Irreversible, Enter The Void) and tells the story of a French dance group who's sangria is spiked with LSD during a party after rehearsals, what proceeds is a night of increasingly intense, disturbing and cringe inducing events as the friends slowly become effected by the drugs.I had never heard of this film until it was recommended to me online, and as a lover of the horror genre as well as low budget independent films I was eager to see this film. It's been a few days since I watched it and it is still in my head, this film is above all else an experience, not just a piece of media that demands viewing but a film that is so unrelenting in its violence and disturbing content that it deserves recognition from fans of the genre. The slow burn nature of the film eases its audience into its intense subject matter and only becomes an outright Horror/Thriller around the 40-50 minute mark. What proceeded this was largely getting to know each individual character though conversations with each other or though interview format (how the film is opened), and long, unbroken takes of choreographed dance sequences. This really was not what I expected but it got us familiar with each person's role in the group as well as giving the film a character and personality that many films, especially one from this genre lacks. So that must be the biggest positive of this film, the production design from sound to lighting, chorography to camera work, this film excels. Great wide shots displaying a variety of characters and the repeat shots to show the juxtaposition before and after they have been spiked is truly something to marvel. The final act (the CLIMAX of the film) uses sound, lighting and unconventional camera angles to unnerve, unease and discombobulate the audience, although I was uncomfortable with what was on screen I found myself truly effected and when the film ended it had, and still is having, a lasting effect on me.The slow burn nature of the film however is something that results in a negative for the overall quality of the film as the films plot doesn't really ""get going"" till around the 40-50 minute mark resulting in the film feeling inconsistent and struggling to decide on a tone. This is not always a negative, films like the Nicolas Winding Refn's DRIVE (2011) slowly puts our protagonist into the uncomfortable situation in a way that doesn't make the films tone feel confused, something that CLIMAX don't get so clearly. Although the end result is an exciting and visceral final act and a pay off that is truly spectacular this is proof of the director fully presenting his stylistic flare and unique ability to position his actors and the camera to create a film unlike anything I have seen. To me however, tones clash before the hour mark and I wasn't sure if I was watching a horror/Thriller or a French remake of STEP UP.Every actor who appears in this film really shines in their respective roles; each actor has something exciting to do throughout each act. The actor who really stood out from the ensemble cast is Sofia Boutella (THE MUMMY), who though her scenes interacting with other actors or performing alone really brings her A-game, making me suspend my disbelief and act as if I was witnessing a night that is truly traumatic for each character involved, as a performer this is where she, and everyone, truly shone. The scene in which Boutella is alone in the red lit room, dancing to sitting in agonising fear to climbing the wall made me fear for the characters involved, I later learned that a lot of the film (bar the choreographed dance) was improvised by the actors and cementing Boutella as a born, natural performer.Overall, CLIMAX is unnerving, brutal, and in the end devastating for everyone involved, including the audience, as a film that sets out for that outcome I cannot praise this film enough. Although it does have issues with pacing and tone towards the beginning of the film, the latter half is an explosive look at the effect of drugs on a unknowing group of people with expert camera work, performances and choreography elevating the content, that results in what can only be described in a unique experience and notable addition to the genre. Just be sure to take a walk when its finished.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Unique, dark and dying experience, THANK YOU GASPAR NOE.","Undoubtedly one of the best movies I saw of the past decade and of all time for me. The way that he mixes and relates dance, personality, drugs and states, making all this see in different singularities is simply magnificent.The characters themselves are not important, what matters is their role in this context, what decisions they make and what things they are subjected to.It is amazing, one of those experiences that one does not forget. It generates interest and then surprises with the increase in horror it projects.As a dancer I say that this work has the best choreography and opening of all time. As the dance is accompanied by the play of lights, the camera approaches, the theatricality, the presence of the voice and reaching the maximum physical states makes it transcend as a creepy contemporary piece.I could say many thousand things but the idea is not to go around the bush, it is undoubtedly one of my favorites of all time and I consider this tape of those that I can see a thousand times and it will always generate the same thing from the same desire to be in that grand opening dancing to that despair and claustrophobia at the end.Gaspar Noe is a damn genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

An amazing psychedelic drug trip!!!,"A film directed by Gaspar Noe with a bunch of dancers snowed into a dance academy whos sangria is spiked with LSD.

If you give this film a chance and watch this with an open mind, you will be impressed with the amazing preformences and the amazing direction and cinematography. If you like films that do something different and experimental I think you will enjoy this film. If you want to watch a relaxing movie this is not for you.There is many interesting character dynamics that the film sets up at the beginning that we get to see unfold throughout the entire film. The film contain a lot of uncut conversations between the dancers which is a very different approach. This film reveals its themes slowly and gradually as the film progresses and begins to become more insane and this film does not spoon feed you. The audience has to figure out what the film truly means and what is actually happening.The never-ending soundtrack is the heart beat of the entire film It is very loud and intrusive that accentuates the very insane mood of the film. The cinematography mirrors the effect of the LSD that it is having on the dancers as it gets more interesting and insane before it reaches its climax at the end of the film.

I was pleased that the cinematographer from Enter the Void (which is one of my favorite films) joined with Gaspar again. The dancers are remarkable for their talent, clothing (or lack thereof), fitness and freestyle movements. The camera goes above, close-up and spins round them, mimicking and enhancing their movements and energy. Members of the cast that are not professionals were culled from Paris night clubs and YouTube. The hypnotic, pulse quickening beats come from Cerrone, MARRS and Aphex Twin.

Art House Party,"I have a love-hate relationship with Gaspar Noe. Actually, it's more like a tolerate-hate relationship. As an art house filmmaker, his visuals are stunning to look at. But the films themselves have offered very little meaning to me. They range from pretentious, to downright unwatchable. Climax, however, is an exception. This is Gasper Noe's best film. Despite having a completely minimal story, it sets it's goal and achieves it brilliantly. A group of dancers meet up one night and overdose on LSD after drinking laced sangria. That's it. That's the film. It doesn't beat around the bush, or tries to be something it isn't. It's exactly how you'd imagine a situation like this would go down. What starts as a fun night of dancing and flirting turns into a screaming, bloody horror as the entire dance troupe implodes in on themselves. The final 30 minutes play like a bad nightmare. The commitment to it was really impressive. I also didn't mind the set up characters early on as it ultimately ended up helping us understand their decisions, irrational as they may be, during their respective bad trips. One criticism I have were some of the visual decisions. Turning shots upside down can be effective, but not every time. Also, allegorical onscreen texts are really unnecessary, but telling that to Gaspar Noe is a fool's errand. I say, see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Intoxicating and brilliant,"Climax is a story about a group of dancers who have their drink spiked with LSD, the night only goes downhill from there. I loved watching these people change and begin behaving extremely irrationally. These people go from being mostly friendly with each other to very aggressive towards other becoming extremely violent and making people do completely insane things as the film gets more insane as well. Everything about Climax becomes crazy by the 40 minute mark, the camera does not stop moving at all from this point, it is upside-down for very long periods of time. Even when the camera is not filming upside-down every shot is still very interesting, whether it's showing impressive dancing for following someone around as the mingle with the crowd something interesting is always happening. Every performance is great, so good In fact I could not pick out a best or worst performance. Having so many long takes and pulling off some very difficult dance moves in pretty much all of them along with acting high on LSD would have been a nightmare but as I said the cast was great and pulled this off flawlessly. There are so many unique aspects shown in this film that just don't come up that often, like the Birdman esq long takes or the completely original dance choreography. All the technical aspects were also brilliant, I could not point out an obvious problem with these either. I should also mention there are some quite horrifying sequences in this film that personally tend to enjoy but these may put some viewers off. Despite all of this praise, there are a couple of things I did not enjoy . I first being some of the convocations felt a bit pointless. Second even though I loved the dancing in this film there was a lot of it at the start of the movie and it got a bit repetitive at a point, it became much more entertaining once the film picked up, but I feel a couple minutes of dancing could have been cut. Other than these two minor issues I loved the rest of this film and highly recommend you watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The most fantastic sensory overload you could watch,A movie filled with an extreme vision of what being on drugs is like and what can happen when a group of people dont trust eachother and how they all deal with being high.

They should have spiked it sooner,"Gaspar Noé's ""Climax"" is a rarity in that it is a movie that does exactly what it says it will, and really nothing more, nothing less. If you are reading this you probably already know what it's about, even if you haven't seen it yet: a group of French dancers meet in a remote location to rehearse, and realise too late that the ""sangria"" they have all been drinking is spiked with LSD.Their behaviour gets increasingly crazy, in some cases attacking each other and themselves. In one instance a woman is accidentally set on fire, though typically Noé's camera doesn't follow her.Eventually they all just end up gibbering wrecks on the floor.If the movie has any serious problem, however, it's how long it takes to get going. More than half the movie is spent with these characters just talking, and their conversations are dull. It's not until over half way in that the drugs start to take hold. Before that, these characters aren't interesting enough. I don't know if you're supposed to care about them or not, but I certainly didn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Dancing the Macabre,"If you want to watch this movie you should prepare yourself because Climax is not your grandmother's bedtime story and definitely not a movie for everybody.
Take for example the first 45 minutes which is basically one big dance scene - - at this point I would like to note that the dance performed by the actors is easily one of the best group dance I 've ever seen in a movie - - Also here you get to know the characters, the relationships between them and you can hear and see some realistically written and performed dialogues.
Interestingly the inciting incident happens at the middle of the movie, and then all hell brakes loose... paranoia, fear, violence, madness. Gaspar Noé brings us the living nightmare which stands till the ending of the movie. These scenes are like we just watchng the neverending videolog from Hell of the Event Horizon. That's a little exaggerated I know, but that's what I thought while I was watching the movie. The camera scans around the location's every half-lighted corridors and dark corners, and thanks to the director's clear and definite direction, it finds something interesting and scary thing everywhere. By the movie ends, only a few lost souls are dancing.

A headtrip of a movie unlike anything else,"Renowned for his uncomfortable viewing experiences and boundary pushing narratives, Argentinian filmmaker Gaspar Noé is undoubtedly one of the most unique directors working in the industry today, with his bizarre and off-putting Climax well and truly likely to please diehard fans of the auteur.Arguably his most accessible film yet (not a hard task when up against Love, Irreversible and Enter the Void) but also entirely the opposite to mainstream film-making, Climax may be billed as some type of horror experience and while there are horrific moments of shock value and unexpected occurrences, Climax is more of a fever dream of a film, that when combined with its off-putting structure and often dizzying feats of camerawork, creates an experience that is hard to pin down in words.Confined in its duration to a French dance school that is hosting a collection of bright up and coming stars, who after days of hard work are looking to party the night away, only to find that their Sangria punch may not be the wisest choice of beverage, Climax takes its time to unravel its true identity as Noé feels no need to rush to get to the craziness that lays in wait, eager to take us off our guard and open our eyes.There's a large group of performers for us to meet here, with Sofia Boutella's Selva what you'd call the films lead and all performers acquit themselves well to Noé's kooky affair, that's highlights include a number of impressive dance sequences that are both energetic and hypnotic while oddly terrifying and the films opening 40 - 50 minutes allows us to spend our time getting to observe and overhear these various characters interact with one another, blissfully unaware of what lays in store for them.The horror, oddities and general all-round craziness that does come as the film rockets along to its ""climax"" is what lets Noé's experience down, as while things are constantly keeping you wrong-footed and second guessing, there's no genuine amazing revelations or sequences that bring what's come before to full circle.In some weird way it feels as though Climax could've gone further with some of its half-baked scenarios, plot-threads and horrors as you keep expecting the ""big"" moment to come but with all that had come before, including its quite thrilling opening segment, Climax ends with a whimper not with a bang.Final Say -Hard to describe in words, Climax is a totally unique and often dizzying experience that once more confirms Noé's stature as a one-off talent but despite all its promise and teases, Climax never quite gets to payoff we think is coming our way.3 power supply boxes out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Music
One word: INSANE!,"I've been wanting to see Climax after hearing all the buzz surrounding it. After a few months, I finally got the chance to view it and it was the MOST INSANE EXPERIENCE EVER!By the end of it I was just in awe at what I just witnessed. This film was like no other. Climax was helmed by director Gaspar Noé who is known for the controversial films Irréversible and Enter the Void. He has a style for making very disturbing films that will be polarising between audiences. Climax goes through the same treatment. NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE.First of all, I have to praise Gaspar Noé on his direction because it was shot masterfully. The camerawork on this film is one of the best I've ever seen. The way the camera moves in the small location it's set in, especially in the second half where it gets crazy, makes The movie feel more anxiety inducing than what it already is. The camera lingers on the scene for long periods of time, one lasting over 40 minutes. I find it a huge achievement for everyone involved to stay in character for that long.The music creates a fearful and disturbing atmosphere which suits the overall tone. The cinematography and choice of colours also intensifies what's going on.The acting is top-notch. Considering that this film is most of the dancers' first film is incredible. Everyone did an incredible job especially when they all get drugged. All of them had great chemistry with each other as shown when they have conversations with one another. Their reactions to the situation felt so real that it made the film so much more engrossing and hard to watch.The only problem I have was the story. At times, during the film, I wondered how will the story progress and by the end it didn't progress much. If the story was tighter then this film would have been perfect.Overall, Climax is an experience that's worth watching. It may be a film that will haunt and disturb you for days and make you feel extremely anxious by the end of it but you should watch it just to appreciate the amount of effort put into its craft as well the praising the outcome.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
crazy insane LSD trip.,"The first shot opens and it's like it's straight out of a Tarantino film, long title sequence then transitions to us meeting all these dancers that are brought to this studio. The first 40 minutes is all about getting to know who each of these young characters are before things.get.crazy.the second half is just insane. constant screaming with a pulsating heart of music constantly playing in the background. This whole movie feels like you are watching a music video... lots of dancing, there is not much dialogue, really no plot instead it's all based on character interactions.Sofia Boutella (who has an extensive dancing background - including dancing for Madonna - i've been a fan of hers for years and really love the acting choices she has made recently), she plays our main lead that we follow the majority of the time and this is where it turns into a Birdman style camera work that seems to never break. The camera just follows character to character with a series of shots of crazy things happening, either to the character we are following or any of the character's nearby.You are trying to piece together what exactly is happening, but the camera doesn't let you know anymore than these characters do, until the very final moments.i'm not sure how much I liked this, but it's very creative, the french director Gaspar Noé really captured this crazy frenetic night in a really insane way. so just for that, it's worth checking it out, if you can handle it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Climax (2018): Review,"A group of dancers practising for their American tour celebrate while unknowingly drinking LSD-laced Sangria; what could go wrong? Gaspar Noé is back with his newest, and possibly most accessible, film. Noé has been on a list of directors that I would label 'watch cautiously' ever since I originally saw his film Irréversible (2002) years ago. It was, and still is, one of the most emotionally detrimental films I had ever seen. With his use of amazingly unique cinematography, lighting, and camera movements, Noé immediately peaked my interest. I thought he knocked it out of the park with that film and hasn't matched up to it since. While Enter the Void (2009) is an extremely interesting film visually and conceptually, the characters and story just did not work for me. The same can be said for his film Love (2015).Climax is an extravaganza of dance, sex, chaos, and, the most importantly, panic. It is comparable to one long, 96 minute, looming panic attack. But in a good way. The film reels you in with a wicked-long dance number with blaring synth music and it is honestly enthralling to watch. It is one long beautiful take and it prepares you for the style that encompasses the rest of the film. Noé can make a shot last 10-15 minutes without it coming across as if he is showing off. It takes real skill to set up these complex shots that last for so long and to pull them off flawlessly without having the actors mess up a line or having the continuity be broken. His long takes simply engage you as an audience member and make you feel as if you are part of the situation. It feels natural.Seriously though, beware. This film is emotionally exhausting. It has a way of sticking a horrible feeling in your gut and keeping it there until long after the movie is over. It is a spectacle of a bad acid trip. The actors, camera work, and storytelling make it feel as if you are a witness to this chaotic event that is taking place. Sofia Boutella is fantastic in the film and so is the rest of the cast. Every character feels so believable and honest. There is a lot of information given about the characters within the first 20 minutes or through dialogue which can be a bit confusing considering there is a lot of them and we do not immediately learn all of their names. However, I think that this will make for rewarding rewatches.'Climax' is much more accessible compared to any of Noe's previous works. It is not ultra-violent, nor is it an excess in experimental filmmaking. It is a fairly straightforward story with fantastic performances, beautiful cinematography, and unbelievable camera work. It is by far his best film since Irréversible and may be his best film, period. Although multiple viewings will have to confirm this. It is enthralling in every regard and should be seen for the first time in a theatre if possible. I cannot wait to see this one for the second time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Surreal but realistic horror which exceeded my low expectations.,"In a lot of discussions, people will explain that they find movies about break-ins, serial-killers, torturers and the generally non-supernatural as scarier than movies about supernatural evil. I have always disagreed, until I watched this movie.I expected some sort of horror show. Instead I got a slow (very slow) descent into madness. While I think the movie could have lost 20-40 minutes easy, I did enjoy it more than I expected. Losing control of my mind is much scarier than an intruder. There's bottomless horror there that you can do nothing about but endure and hope to retain your sanity.The cinematography is never boring. Most shots are long and mesmerizing. I often caught myself wondering how long a shot had lasted, only for it to just continue.There were a couple of great horrifying moments in the movie, which I will not spoil. But the pacing detracts from my overall enjoyment. The middle is great, everything else dragged.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The ultimate conglomeration of all that is Noe,"It is incredible that by taking all the boldest signature elements of his other films and ramming them all into one movie, while ceasing to do much experimentation and instead just delivering a no-holds-barred assault of everything that makes a Gaspar Noe movie what it is, he has crafted what I perceive to be his most accessible film and what many may see as his best (for me, it's my 2nd favorite right behind Enter The Void - but unlike the atmospheric spiritual journey that ETV brings a viewer on, Climax is ""all killer, no filler"").As far as I know, this is the world's first true TECHNO-HORROR film. Full-on techno culture crossed with full-on psychological horror. It's completely one-of-a-kind. I had a massive smile painted on my face through the majority of the film. This made me feel so much more than Luca Guadagnino's recent Suspiria remake, especially through it's incredible dance sequences - I couldn't help but groove in my seat during the majority of them. The soundtrack was fully up my alley, from Dopplereffekt to Legowelt to Aphex Twin to Giorgio Moroder - all the best in techno/electro. The diversity of the ensemble cast was impossible not to admire - so much personality to take in. The cinematography was absurdly impressive as always with Noe, functioning like you're watching through the eyes of a wandering ghost or almost another voiceless character in the room, effectively making you feel like the majority of the film is happening in ONE shot, without cutting.If you're a fan of film as an art form, or simply put, really INTENSE movies - you NEED to go see this ASAP, in the theater. This is a theater movie, not a watch-at-home movie! I will absolutely be seeing it a second time in the theater!Avoid this movie if you can't handle relentless psychological horror. Though it made me incredibly happy, this is the kind of movie that could trigger a certain claustrophobia for those who suffer from certain anxieties.It's MINDBLOWING! Noe has done it again.

A trip you should decide to take or not.,"Putting simply, Climax is a movie that many people will like and many people won't. I didn't like the movie. It was a good experiment though. The cinematography, choreography and performance of Sofia Boutella are the only positives. Even though the movie is only 90 minutes long, you find it difficult to stay your chair. The first forty minutes are used for introducing characters and dance and I didn't like the way he did that. For a 90 minutes movie, you're just sitting simply for 45 minutes.

"If you've tripped b4, watch this. If not, don't review it.","Reading these low reviews, it makes one thing clear: these reviewers never experienced LSD before. Or else they would understand the art and depth of this film.After seeing and enjoying Enter The Void, I wanted to give this a go. I knew the premise of the film and was curious to watch it. The interviews in the opening really gave us a good idea of whom we were about to watch in the film. Dance students willing to do anything for dance. (Did anyone else notice the ""Suspiria"" DVD to the right of the tv?)I loved the opening dance sequence. I don't care that it was long AND one single shot. Brilliant in my opinion. The juxtaposition of the dancers being their normal, happy selves enjoying the party, to the slow (slow) build up of tripping their balls out. THAT'S HOW ACID WORKS. It can take a solid hour to kick in. I personally have never had THIS bad of a trip, but have seen people have them. I'm not sure if the amount of screaming in this film was necessary, especially since all of them had a bad trip and not a single one had a good trip makes me wonder. But again, it could happen. I've always wondered ""what would we look like if sober people fake in and watched us rolling around on the floor""... this. This movie IS what people look like tripping. It is a front row seat to a bad trip.Is it horror? Not in my opinion. But the horror of a bad trip and the events that take place? Yes.
Is it drama? Yes.
Is it art? Yes.

This movie has the best sequences I've seen in my life not to mention that picture and color palette which intensifies that atmosphere of the 90s.On the other hand it lacks character building and plot in general which it's very disappointed but that doesn't matter when you want to show the reality of human behavior in such a raw way.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An acid trip of a film about an acid trip,"I went into this film knowing near nothing about it aside from it being about a group of dancers at a retreat who end up drinking an LSD spiked drink.And that pretty much sums up the entire film. As I read subsequently, this was a largely improvised production with minimal script. The film is mostly a collection of dance sequences (quite impressively done- the actors are very talented), conversations between the characters (about a large variety of things including sex, abortion, incest, drug use), and a slow decay into madness as the LSD kicks in, with people doing increasingly insane and bizarre things. It features quite impressive long takes that are a sight to behold. The combined use of music, lighting and odd camera angles/editing make it feel like you the viewer are also going on this acid trip with the characters.On the other hand, I felt the film was really devoid of a plot (and hence much substance), and frankly that's not what the filmmakers were going for. This really is more of an 'experience' than a story per se, and if that's what you're after, I think this does it quite well. What did annoy me was that a lot of the scenes just went on for far too long. There's a collection of interviews at the start of the film that introduce the characters, and some scenes later on in the film that I think overstayed their welcome. I think what they were trying to do with the film was to draw you into it with these long scenes, but I felt a bit lost and alienated by the end of some of them.So yes, if you want to experience a big screen acid trip, watch this film.

Homo homini lupus,"Caspar Noé's latest movie Climax is an experimental combination of a musical, drama and horror film.Climax is a musical because it revolves around a group of young French dancers who get prepared for their new show over the course of three days in an abandoned school building. The movie starts with interview sections as the different dancers talk about their motivations to join the group. The second scene shows the elaborate dance choreography. The third scene is the party after the last practice when you can see the characters dance to electronic music. The entire first quarter of the film focuses on dance moves and electronic music to portray how the characters express themselves artistically.The movie slowly shifts towards a drama. Someone has poisoned the sangria with LSD and the dancers start acting erratically, emotionally and aggressively. We observe a brother who overprotects his younger sister who is longing for more independence. We get to know that one of the female dancers is pregnant and she doesn't know who the father of her child could be. We come across a nervous mother who is desperately trying to protect her son from the dancers.The film ends as a horror movie as the situation escalates. Prejudice, rape and murder occur as the drugs bring out the worst in each and every single character. The film's second half and especially its final third are certainly hard to digest. This movie should only be watched by adults with an open mind and a strong stomach.The cinematography of the film needs to be pointed out. There are almost no cuts as the camera randomly follows characters throughout the fateful night which gives the movie a quite fluid vibe. The fact that the movie values music and movements over an actual plot or even dialogues is also particularly outstanding. The film starts with the credits, introduces chapters like silent movies used to do and the camera sometimes turns around to portray a world that has been shaken upside down.As nightmarish as the film might seem, Climax is actually based upon true events. Without pointing fingers, the movie certainly includes a lot of social criticism. It shows how partners, friends and even family members turn against each other once a drug has eliminated their self-control. The film also uses a lot of stereotypes that may be shocking at first contact but that turn out being more realistic that one might be willing to admit. It leads the viewers to question their societies and their values.In the end, Climax is a mindblowing experience unlike any other film. It's not easy to digest because of its explicit violence, thin plot and absence of dialogues but the aesthetic aspect, vibrant atmosphere and underlying messages pardon for its minor flaws. If you are an adult, have an open mind and strong stomach and like experimental cinema, this might become one of your very favourite movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Barf bag recommended,"A group of dancers are gathered in a former school in 1996, they dance and party but the Sangria has been spiked with LSD and a horrible nightmare unfolds. I really enjoy modern French cinema, the films often push the boundaries and Climax is one such movie. I found it to be clever and very well made, but at the same time it was also hard to watch, not a pleasant experience. The camerawork is fantastic, the camera flows and uses many angles, including upside down giving the impression that people are walking on the ceiling. This, plus the dance music, is a relentless assault on the senses. The dancing is very good and I felt that the actors put a lot into their performances, both on and off the dance floor. There is a great deal of very explicit sex talk, I felt that this was unnecessary, we have some incest too just to add to the shock value, plus a girl urinates whilst stood on the dance floor in front of everybody. Add to that drug taking, violence and some explicit self harm, this isn't exactly family entertainment! Difficult movie for me to review, I was both impressed and repulsed at the same time. In my younger days when I went out drinking some nights my head would start spinning in bed as soon as I shut my eyes to go to sleep, not a nice sensation - watching Climax had a similar effect!",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Stupid Dumb People Making the Same Stupid Dumb People Mistakes.,"Leave it to Gaspar Noe for always illuminating the darker, seedier, ugly side of human life. Pushing film boundaries like Marian Dora, Jorg Buttgerheit, Yorgos Lanthimos, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and others, he manages to sculpt movies Hollywood would never touch with a ten foot pole. ""Climax"", one of his tamer offerings, is still far from Hollywood, or Bollywood, fare, but it can get under some people's skins if they're unprepared for the weirdness. I'd give this film a higher rating but, in the end, it was really a flick full of pretentious pap that answers this question: What would happen if you give a roomful of stupid, non-thinking, non-intellectual young people a spiked drink that loosened all their inhibitions? Not recommended to anyone with half a brain.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Gasper Noe once again proves that he is the obstacle ruining his own films,"Within Climax is an almost perfect film (I know that can be said of any film but it's more realised here). The idea is intriguing and really well executed. This also feels like a culmination of other Noe films and themes and styles he has tried before and getting them to work (Enter the Void and We F*** Alone being the most obvious) here. It's also on the shorter side which is another positive as previous films have fallen ill to the dreaded 2+ hour runtime.The camera work is inventive and exciting and the lighting is dramatic and jarring, which pairs perfectly with the animalistic dancing and character actions. It also gels perfectly with the decent into drug induced hysteria that follows. There are also extended dance sequences and scenes where the camera tracks which are both styling and gripping.The script also has many of the hallmark strengths of Noe's writing style, characters being abysmal to each other whilst not feeling forced or 'shocking for the sake of shocking'. The usual narcissistic characters are back, but in this setting it fits and is less grating than in previous films (such as Love).However the weaknesses are still as present as ever; namely pretentiousness. The opening sequence is an interview with all the characters, which aside from being boring serves very little purpose as the following dance scene (which should have been the first shot) is a much more effective way of establishing them, as well as being more interesting. There are also scenes of characters talking, which is probably improvised, and having some banter, but is insufferable and largely about sex (not surprising). They may seem small, but they kill the momentum and engagement the film builds. However this is largely in the first half and the final 45 minutes or so are fantastic.I recommend this film but highly recommend it with this small caveat; skip the first part (start the film on the overhead shot of the turntables) and when they're drinking sangria and talking, read the first few lines and then skip to the next pair until things start kicking off. With those steps skipped you'll have watched one of the most unique and visceral films made and be left wondering why Gasper Noe isn't considered one of the greatest directors ever. Without you'll have watched a unique and visceral film, but with some glaring floors.",,Anonymous,Music
Bring the entire family to watch CLIMAX,"This is a film worth watching atleast twice. I've seen it six times in total and it still gives me the unnerving feeling i felt watching it for the first time. So needless to say, this is a film i love dearly.Gaspar Noe is a film maker who just always breaks the rules, he disregards the tradition of filmmaking. Credits in the end? Nope. He'd rather put it in the beginning and middle, and reveal the title of the film in the final frames. Decent camara work? Nope, we're going to spin and go upside down and not have a cut for almost 50 minutes. I love it all.The premise revolves around a mystery person spiking the sangria with LSD on a dance party, and everybody attending this party unknowingly consumes who knows how much of this spiked sangria and have the worst night of their lives. The track shot follows every individual character as they try to get thru this nightmare. Some characters dance, some characters commit some horrific acts like breaking their own limbs and... alot worse.The music is all this electronic techno house music, theres a DJ in this movie who also gets involved in this mess so thats where all the music is provided. Rollin and Scratchin by Daft Punk for example is used in this horrifying way that sent chills down my spine.This film is divisive as hell, i think thats what Gaspar aims for. He knows his films arnt for everyone. So if you like seeing hypnotic dance sessions and people be stripped down to a primitive state of mind and commit horrific acts, watch this movie i love very much.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Viscerally accurate horror,"Who expects good trips when a group of mostly strangers-peers in competitive dancing-and their handlers are unsuspectingly mega-dosed with LSD, at a remote location during the first night social of a weekend dance workshop? Gaspar accurately captures that complete unmooring of a bad acid trip, with visceral intensity. Using the camera as observer and an incessant dance beat, he never attempts to replicate the visual experience of tripping (because you can't). What he does do superbly is to capture the utter horror of being stuck in a raw, real, timeless, insanity, where there are no handholds of anything familiar and everyone is reduced to characters acting out of their most fundamental fears.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Primal,"A group of dancers have a party but something goes wrong.If you do not like watching dancing, this film will be an automatic no. But if you do or even love to dance then you will definitely enjoy and may even join in during the dance sequences in the first half. This movie almost encourages you to stand up and enjoy yourself, really emulating the atmosphere of a party full of dancers. The music choices may be disliked by some but ultimately further the sentiment of a party and, later in the film, evoke primal or instinctual movements and feelings in the viewer. The setting also begins appropriately regular but alters as it mimics the state of the characters throughout the film.Climax lacks plot, instead placing all its effort into the cinematography. The camera movements are utilized expertly to portray the feelings of the characters you are watching and to emphasize the audiences involvement in these characters' spaces. Immersively and emotively are words that best describe how the camera transports the audience into the position of the characters.The character moments are plentiful, possibly giving the illusion of depth, but are not profound and come off more like a pay-off of foreshadowing or a distraction than actual character building. The dialogue is natural but mundane and would tire on a second viewing, although I do not speak French so this may be an unfair criticism. There is no real attachment to any character, which can come with territory of having no protagonist, and characters come off more as people than instruments for a story, likely due to the minimal script and heavy improvisation. This is effective in letting the audience lose themselves within the camera but loses any sort of stakes or investment in what happens to anyone for the most part. This film is a feeling much more than an emotion, it's instinctual, but you'd have to wonder whether a great album with some visuals couldn't do what Climax does better.By the end you'll feel something, even if it's that this movie was terrible or sickening, and that's what it was going for so it gets a 7 (I would give 7.5). I'd recommend if you are interested in cinematography, if you like dance or if you want to get a primal sort-of feeling from a 90 minute film. Definitely don't watch if you want a story or interesting characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

C L I M A X: The Twisted Musical,"Climax (2018) is a twisted psychedelic overwhelming experience of a motion picture, it has non stop trance music and plenty of extremely creative choreography and cinematography. It manifests itself as a disturbing thriller but in fact it's a horror musical. The film incorporates many different elements of the musical genre to extenuate the psychedelic effect that is experienced by the characters.Much like your typical musical there are extended sequences of dancing to music, in creative ways which is the actual appeal of the scene in addition to bringing characterization to each character with their own unique way of dancing.Although the film has an extra narrative appeal, the film takes place over a crazy night with a bunch of crazy people high on LSD, and about a few minutes in someone dies. so it gains that feeling of a battle royale psychological narrative of trying to manipulate the group. where each character ends their story is one of the most interesting elements of the story, with everyone by dawn having a very different experience but the viewer getting to see what each of them got by the end.climax is awesome go see it",9.0,Anonymous,Music

After that it all seems to go down hill for me.Don't watch this film if you are looking for a 'standard' experience, or even a real story. All of the second and third pieces are mainly constantly screaming in the foreground and background. Lots of pivoting and turning camera's POV.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
I rarely find something this pointless,"This is a clear example of what I dislike about a certain tendency in contemporary art (not just cinema, high brow institutional art at large), that is, the idea that being crude and brutal, rubbing salt in the wound, can already be considered a form of creativity (if you want an example, search Cattelan's hanged children puppets). I personally don't think so, unconscious darkness and the horror of existence are by now something trivial, we live in a desacralised visual world in which they have become ordinary, part of pop culture, and it's been so for some time too (think of the series Andy Warhol on car accident, that by the way, was exactly pointing to the trivialisation of violence).
In Climax you will experience exactly this empty visualisation of a descent into amorality and darkness, as if going down into a hell where no hope was left. There is some symbolism, here and there, given randomly away, like the huge french flag behind the stage (are we looking at the darkness hidden behind the good appearances of a country? If so, it is a vague and populist stance).
I've read that in an interview that the director wanted to portray the fear and rage people experience when someone imposes them something (in this movie, a psychedelic trip). Well, I personally don't find the idea itself that compelling and I don't even think that many viewers would get it. Instead, I know that many people like it because it's a raw and rough experience, my point is, it's shallow and it's hard for me not to think that it works simply because it draws the viewers' attention with something strong and dark (let me call it a pornography of darkness and violence).
Just to clarify, I'm fine with films that don't have a strong meaning, but I expect them to be truly creative and to bring me to another ""level of consciousness"", think of David Lynch, his movies are not meant to make ""sense"", they can be random and obscure but their eerie atmospheres and distortion of reality are worthwhile watching. I personally don't find that in climax.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"How Anyone Could Interpret This as Conservative, Proves They're on Drugs.","I didn't like this film, it's garbage content -wise, but from a film-making perspective, it is very well done. However, the review by Etmachina is also garbage and very rude, it says ""drug-shaming conservative garbage"" & "" and all the characters are like young new nihilistic Republicans carelessly offensive and unshamefully selfish"", "" it ranks up there with Reefer Madness in the portrayal of LSD and drugs.""Clearly this person takes a lot of drugs, while I'm not going to comment on that one way or the other, all I'm going to say is stop being so sensitive. I know someone who has un-knowingly took drugs, they had no idea what they consumed had drugs in it, and guess what? It went very bad for him. He was a complete and total mess and was doing bizarre stuff. I can only imagine if 30 people like that were locked in a building taking some sort of hallucinogen they had no experience with.... It is ONE THING to willingly consume drugs, and another to take them without knowledge and having NO IDEA what is going on, especially psychedelic drugs, which was clearly the case in both regards with this film.This film is about a dance troupe that clearly doesn't normally use drugs, whose punch unexpectedly gets spiked with a hallucinogen. They don't know what's going on, and neither do we, that's the point. As repulsive as the content is, if you are looking for some weird message like the person quoted above, maybe you need to rethink your life?When you know nothing about these drugs and someone gives them to you without your consent, it doesn't go well, even if it's a ""good trip"", and especially in group setting, while this film blows it out of proportion, if you take it literally, wow, I feel sorry for you. This film is definitely not literal in any sense. It is all mood and feeling.Bottom Line, don't Act all open-minded, as the reviewer above pretends to be, and then insult people that you don't understand and insult something because you THINK it goes against what you believe. Seems a bit counter-intuitive to what you're claiming about open-mindedness, and I would advise anyone else who thinks like this, to take a good hard look at themselves. Again wish I never saw this movie, it was definitely a work of garbage, but beautifully filmed garbage. The whole point wasn't about the drug trip it was just an excuse to throw a bunch of repulsive content together in a movie and shock people and create a visceral reaction, French cinema is famous for this, this would likely fall into the branch of Extreme French Cinema that was popular in the 2000's.

A funhouse of horrors,"In 1996 France, a dance troupe gathers for a rehearsal in abandoned school, practicing for an upcoming performance. After the rehearsal is complete, they hold an after-party that descends into complete madness when the dancers find their celebratory sangria has been spiked with LSD.With ""Irreversible"" as my only point of reference for Gaspar Noé, I was bracing myself for something extraordinary, and ""Climax"" delivered. What is perhaps so interesting about it is that Noé takes a simple (albeit odd) premise and blows it up to extreme proportions. Dance enthusiasts will find the first twenty minutes particularly enthralling, though I personally found the interpersonal drama that follows to be much more involving.Stylistically, the film is made up of long, continuous takes that follow the characters as they begin to descend into their own personal drug-induced hells. The interchange between them happens as they pass one another while ambling around the abandoned school, and there is a naturalistic flow to how this is all presented. What is particularly harrowing is that the audience sees this all unfold from an objective point of view, and we are never allowed the characters' warped, hallucinogenic perspective--we simply see anxieties and tensions rise, resulting in dire consequences. The abandoned school, which is already atmospheric enough, morphs into an utter funhouse of horrors.Made up of mostly non-actors, the cast delivers realistic performances that are likely successful because of the improvisational nature of the production, and the cinematography is appropriately mind-bending. Those who have derided this film for having ""no plot"" are truly missing the point. This is not your typical narrative film--it is more a fleeting snapshot of the world crashing down on a group of people. There is a tangible sense of helplessness here, leaving the film feeling, at times, like a meditation on the tenuous grasp we have on our lives. We are in control, of course, until we are not. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

So basically, nothing happens.Second half, everyone finds out they have been drugged and it gets chaotic, but again, nothing really happens. There is lots of screaming and writhing on the floor with spinning cameras and neon room colors. The End. I also found the drug depictions really annoying. I don't think the people who made this movie had ever tried LSD because it is NOTHING like this movie. You don't run around rending your clothes and screaming for no reason. You don't suddenly stop listening to reason (the ""who drugged us"" incident). You don't turn into a raging violent lunatic. Their behavior was more akin to bath salts.There are SO many characters, and we know almost nothing about them and the things that we do know about them isn't interesting (mostly they talk of sex).

Climax is a climax,"It's pretty sad, that only a couple of theatres in Germany showed this film. For me it was the most excellent and entertaining movie experience in 2018. Choreography, camera, music, lighting and story meshed in perfect harmony to drag you into a thrilling horror-trip. It actually feels like you are tripping along, knowing things will get worse and more intense with no chance of coming down. Each of the characters can be found at any party in real life and their feelings are portrayed in an authentic way. The fact that the actors are more professional dancers than actors plus the short script make it so realistic. Especially the camera seems to move like it's intoxicated as we know from 'Enter the Void'. The soundtrack is well chosen, with songs which makes you wanna dance, but also get more and more terrifying. The songs recorded on vinyl and the volume decreasing when we move away from the speakers add to the atmosphere. All in all this film is disturbing, a classic Noé. Not as morally shocking as 'Seul contre tous' or 'Irreversible', thus way scarier. It was a pleasure to watch such a piece of cinematic perfection.

Disappointing,"For a horror film with high rating, I expected to be horrified but the movie delivers nothing just boredom and confusion for me as a viewer -- if that counts as horrifying. There are some interesting credit/title sequences but that's all the positive I see in this film.The first half of the film has no story and too much dialogue. The characters are all shallow and forgettable. They talk a lot in the beginnings. A few sequences just go on for way too long for their own good, with nothing meaningful being developed.The second half has the characters going bananas as they're high on LSD, becoming more unsympathetic, annoying and just pure mean and nasty and screwed up. Technically they all went insane. Again not in a intertaining way..As for the cinematography, this film uses lots of dim lighting which I'm not a fan of but to each his own.If you want to see weird movie about people tripping on acid (in a

A terrifyingly mesmerising experience,"This film is not for the faint of heart. A truely terrifying glance into a party gone wrong, Gaspar Noe's Climax is as beautiful as it is disturbing. The interlocking storylines flow from one another with ease, the smooth camera work guiding it slowly down a darkly disorienting path. Every change of angle and every movement seemed to have purpose to the visuals and characters, and created a nightmareish sense of dread that continued until the end. Similar to Enter the Void, the drawn out sequences of people dancing around and screaming added to the feeling that the film would never stop, which only but added to the horror of the events unfolding on screen.A truely anxiety-inducing film, it's an experience that I expect most fans of Gaspar Noe will highly enjoy.

masterful cinematography,"As many others have said, this is a movie I don't ever want to see again. At some point, when the craze its at the highest; you became claustrophobic and anxious, where the director purposefully makes you part of the madness. Nonetheless, their harsh themes, terrifying camerawork, alarming relationships, subtext charged with political/sociological critiques and frightening dance choreographies, made me appreciate quite a lot this film. More than a film, this is a unique experience you will never see in another work, like, NEVER; the lens throughout we're driven in this hellish pseudo-high school dance is dominative, eats-it-all in a kind of magisterial way.I really admire and praise the technical skill and intensity poured into this artwork. Without hesitation I would say this is a horror movie. idk why, people in the US are very accustomed to ""horror"" in a tacky format; with dull plot lines, one dimensional characters, lacking soul, full of cliches and cringy psychopaths (without its honorable exceptions, obviously). THIS, is another thing. Like, it shows the degradation of the human soul in a traumatic, terrifying and very scary format. This is real horror, citing Sartre: ""Hell is others"".Gaspar Noe gives us here not what we want, or what we knew we want, but what it's needed. Art and more specifically, cinema needs to keep pushing the boundaries of storytelling, and this is a masterful example.I understand not everyone will see it in a objective lens; but if you do, prepare to be thrilled, shocked, amazed and terrified. Prepare to travel through a dark place of madness.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Simple, Visceral Cinema","I'll start with saying that I thoroughly enjoyed 'Enter The Void' and found 'Love' to be long and draining. So I went into Climax with mixed expectations.Considering the other two Gaspar Noe movies I've seen, I expected lots of unique camera angles and long cuts. And Noe definitely delivered on that front. The cinematic style lends itself well to the many hypnotic dance scenes in the first half of the movie as well as the emotional breakdowns experienced from some of the more prominent characters in the second half. The music being played for the all-night dance party doubles as the pulsating soundtrack that adds to the overall visceral feel to the film. Two thumbs up for the music.The plot is very straightforward with no perceivable depth which works just fine for what I believe it's trying to be-a cinematic portrayal of a night's descent into chaos. A group of French dancers practice their choreography at a wintry cabin somewhere in rural France before leaving for some sort of international dance competition. Once they finish up their last practice session, the dancers waste no time getting the party started after a long few days of choreography. They jump right into the sangria that, unbeknownst to them, has been spiked with LSD by an unknown culprit. The rest of the movie is mostly hysterical screaming, more dancing, some fighting, and did I say hysterical screaming? Don't let that elementary breakdown fool you. Some might find this stylish take on accidental group LSD consumption rather entertaining. I certainly did.In terms of the acting, I'd score it as average with no major standouts (good or bad) which is a pleasant surprise given that most of the performers are apparently professional dancers as opposed to professional actors.Climax may not be Noe's best work but it's a (subjectively) fun and chaotic, albeit simple cinematic experience unlike too many others.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Turning point to my sensitivity,"Climax is a thought-provoking movie for me about the internal attitudes of human beings. Several years ago I dance, and this led me to go see this movie, thinking about a crazy dance party. This movie definitely made me feel in the party atmosphere and the mood they were in. At the beginning it was difficult for me to understand this movie ... at first I found the way of dancing of each character interesting, the context in which the party is located ... and I really loved the soundtrack, the costumes and the lighting of the movie; however, in general, this movie made me feel a bit of discomfort that I liked, i don't know why. It was the first movie I saw of this style, which caused me a not so comfortable feeling, but I liked to understand that this is part of our human nature and, if it weren't for some trigger we wouldn't show hidden parts of our interior. This is a film that leaves me with several questions about the individual follies we have and in what circumstances they manifest themselves,
the other personalities that consume us sometimes",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Clearly most people reviewing this have not taken LSD in significant amounts.,"I have. And the movie is the epitome of a bad trip which could easily happen. You see, human society is the convergence of many people that have egoistical concerns. It's amazing that we manage to keep this world together despite all the differences. A lot of it is due to law and moral values that are based in major religions but not everything. There is a social contract every step of the way which is crucial for the world to work.LSD is a dissociative. At certain concentration it makes your ego separate from your perception of reality and throws in a decent amount of visual and audial hallucinations. You no longer are you and the world is no longer what it seemed to be. A very real notion that the world might never be the same again visits you time and time again. This can be a very positive introspective experience where you realize the socially acceptable limits of your ego but it can also be a frightening one if you have not been the best person you are. We live in a ""me, me, me"" age where over the top exhibitionism of our accomplishments or just vanity is looked up upon (thanks to popular media for that). LSD cuts right through this mirage. And the movie shows just how horrible it might be if every single person realized this at once, in fear of it forever staying the same. A true nightmare, if you will.Overall, I think that it has both artistic and real-life value but it succeeds in only portraying the negative side of dissociative use. To put things into perspective, there should be a diametrically opposite movie that would show the other side of the coin (inherently positive experience) and, thus, the waking life of our realities would be smack in the middle.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A Great Experiment,"This film is a lot. The film is composed of very long takes with fun, disorienting camerawork; the dialogue and many of the events themselves were entirely improvised; there are a lot of fascinating things going on here. The first half of the film is magnetic: there's some great improvised dialogue, a really well shot dancing segment that felt totally natural, a great title sequence that was clearly a labor of love, and a lot of intriguing and shockingly good performances, considering there's only one professional actor in this film. Very good beginnings.However, as the film progressed, the long takes start to feel longer and the characters, as they descend into madness, somehow become terribly boring to watch. The story flatlines partway through the second act, and it becomes more of a show than a story. TLDR, the latter half of the film is mostly just people screaming, and it's a bit tiresome.I admire this film, and I admire its director and his vision, but it lost me in the 3rd act. I recommend this film to anyone that wants to see something strange, or if you're high and want to go for a ride.

There is just so much screaming, and so much pure terror that the only way to describe it is psychological horror, but nothing like I have ever seen before. But that's just what makes it a good movie. My main critique is that the opening sequence is MUCH too long and this movie could have been about 30 minutes shorter as it just kicks into a turbocharged mess of insanity at the exact halfway point in the film.

When the party's over.,"This starts with our cast, all dancers being interviewed. Their VHS recordings played back on an old CRT TV framed with DVDs and books. It's impossible not to pick out titles like Suspiria, Un Chien Andalou, Possession and books from Kafka, Fritz Lang and Nietzsche and not begin to expect a wild ride. Gaspar Noé is at the helm, so expect the unexpected. To be honest, it's hard to get a handle on to start. The group is large and have a habit of dancing everywhere so you have to keep up. Everyone's getting to know one another at a party after rehearsal. The music loud, the camera moving fluidly through long takes, sweeping around as they drink sangria and complement each other's dance moves. Before it morphs into a series of confessional vignettes, two characters at a time in corners of the room, amplifying the brewing tension, mostly sexual and setting the dynamic of the group. The setting is some abandon theatre space. It's not rundown, but it has character and along with the frenetic choreography and camera work, it's a heady mix. Something is going to go wrong. The first half is a swirling messy set up, punctuated at the half way point by the credits in the now typical Noé graphic style. It's a bit jarring, but works well for what's about to come. The room is reset. The party dwindling. Our dancers exhausted. The tone muted and menacing. The sangria is spiked with LSD, the messy narrative is about to be usurped by murderous nightmarish rampage that spirals far beyond any semblance of control. The one take long shot returns with a devastating sequence that runs unfathomably long, a magnificent piece of hellish choreography in itself, soundtracked by Aphex Twin, M/A/R/R/S, Daft Punk and screaming... a lot of screaming. There's a lot asked of these actors and they all deliver. Totally believable in their debauched craziness. The whole thing is magnificent though, from the obvious to the less so. The lighting crew for instance, bloody phenomenal. I have to be honest though, despite its successes. It's structural mess makes it hard to enjoy and for all the chaos, it's oddly linear. That said, it's certainly one to be seen by anyone who appreciates challenging cinema. It's not my favourite Noé, but it certainly is a wild ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Tiw Climax,"Today I watched climaxI really like this movie, I love the soundtrack, cinematography, choreography, and it feels like each character is relatively believable. I do have some criticisms but that doesn't really detract from the fact that this film is an intense anxiety inducing nightmare scenario.This film is just absolute chaos, from the intensity to the dancing to the pounding of the music, it's such a unique film. This is not a movie I would expect everyone to love, and though I really don't LOVE it, I thoroughly enjoy how realistic the way these characters subtly act.The technique in the way the film is shot is just so great. This movies last act is insane and I am so stunned at how far this movie goes in that regard.What I would say I wish the film did better was exposition scenes. I wanted there to be a better effective way to setup the characters, the way they did it in the movie was kinda long and slow in comparison to some other parts of the movie. Also, this made the movie much more predictable in my opinion. The people I watched this movie with (multiple times) all pretty much predicted what happened to the T. I guess it's not really that big of a deal when the characters can't predict the future but eh.Also one character made a very stupid decision but I guess you can MAYBE justify it. It just didn't feel like a reasonable thing for anyone to do.Overall Very good movie, I recommend it to people who like being anxious and also techno.

He knows nothing about drugs but it is obvious to me that someone in his life has died of an overdose and he blames drugs. It is only an art piece but it is a fear-mongering art piece.

2 - the effect of drugs on the human body and mind without at any point having an actor saying a single thing about what they saw or felt

"An Electrifying, Horrific Experience.","Gaspar Noe is not a director I particularly praise. Like Lars Von Trier, I'm in a polarizing category of cinephiles where some of Noe's comes off pretentious and over ambitious where his other films are hypnotic and captivating. Fortunately, Climax ranks as the most white-knuckle film experience I've had in a very long time.Climax has a formula that is very, very difficult to achieve: being groundbreaking in its stylization; a phantom-esque style of the camera just floating around. The shots are less like Into the Void and more like Birdman. Additionally, the film feels very organic. These are characters that don't need to be ""fleshed out"" because they feel like real characters. I was a skeptic when I heard that trippy visuals were not going to be utilized, but I am so glad Noe took the approach of focusing on the characters and how their madness unfolds on screen. If you're having trouble finding a movie that scares you, Climax might be ""the one"" that will finally make your palms sweat. The movie knows how to instill angst in the viewer. I can't remember the last time I let out a huge laugh after a film was over because I was so freaked out. Watch this movie but be warned it might make you feel strange for a few days after.

For me, the soundtrack is on the nose for electronic music fans, but hearing the last few minutes of Aphex Twins 'Windowlicker' swim in and out of the chaotic action so nonchalantly is just, so dope. He treats the rest of the soundtrack with such gravity. You barley even notice seminal tunes over what you are being subjected to visually, yet they are driving.To keep it brief, it hurts, (it's obviously not LSD), it's great and what I hope this guy can be able to continue to push, as he is of few in the position to keep cinema dangerous.On a side note, the intro interviews framed in the television and surrounding films are great fan service, because I believe it's one of the more subtle of Noe's infamous warning tableaus.Cheers!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Straightforward story, average runtime, and nothing outwardly ""controversial."" But if you thought Uncut Gems was anxiety-inducing, this is possibly worse. And I loved it for that.All the acting was pretty great across the board (especially for so many of them being non-actors), and the camerawork is (as per usual with Noé) very well done and distinct, with lots of looooong takes and impressive coordination with the cast. I also really liked the score, which consists of almost non-stop dance music playing throughout.If I was to have a gripe, I'd say there's one character moment that seemed a little unbelievable to me (no spoilers), but even that was still stressful to experience-in a good way.Overall, I loved it, but it's definitely not for everybody (which is a cliché thing to say nowadays, but it really applies here).

Outstandingly Unrivaled Legendary & Disturbing Hall of Fame Cinema,"10/10🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠When you rate something a 10 your basically saying in short, whatever endeavor your rating before you is a perfected work of art. There are 3 types of amazing films, Those that keep you highly entertained, Those that expand your mind on what's possible and Those that shake you to the core and invoke disturbing emotions carving out a little piece in your mind that will never allow you to forget what you're eyes reluctantly seen. ""CLIMAX"" By all accounts doesn't just embody all of those traits it pushes the limits of those attributes and dares to raise the bar. When you first begin the film it kind of whispers as you watch slowly creeping along as the characters ramble and speak giving you a glimpse of what they're mind may percieve. But all bets are off once the stage is set and after 5 mins. Of revving the engines the gas peddle is smashed and like a rocket the film blasts off. The dialogue of this film is so jaded and amazingly fresh. As you watch a lifestyle to most that's absolutely foreign and yet each scene reveals elements you can relate. The beauty of the characters dancing and the videography form such an amazing connection you never lose step of what is seen. And as the movie unfolds so does the camera angles bringing you the viewer and the characters to a climactic embrace you literally feel the effects that they are portraying on screen. The realism of this film is terrifyingly unmatched and it doesn't take the peasant road of filming it through found footage to try and fake feeling real.. No it's authenticity is the dance group who some are admittedly just meeting each other so as there relationship grows the viewers grow along with it amplifying a feel that's genuinely real and not rehearsed. There are so many characters to meet at once it may seem hard to distinguish on first glance but every character is tied to a specific style of dance and you get acquainted by watching them move. With amazing talent that everyone of them possess you feel an admiration and respect regardless of how much your really into dancing yourself. To say Gaspar Noe is a great director and writer would be a pitiful label to thrust upon his film that ignites a magnificence rarely achieved by the best filmmakers of all time. It may be compared to other films I really loved like ""SUSPIRIA"" to name one and I'm ok with that, It's fair game to compare but the feeling I got when the final shot turned white is way past and above any of those compared films whether it's the remake or original... 10 stars means one thing..

I have never liked Noe's movies ... Until Now,"Before Climax I have actually disliked his films ... I haven't found anything clever or interesting about them ... In fact I've found them annoyingly and deliberately difficult, not an approach I appreciate ... Climax is SERIOUSLY WELL DONE ... He is growing up ... I still would have liked to know more ... Why he only concentrated on the negative aspects of the experience and the people who had a ( really ) bad time ... Why a certain person died when they could have easily got away ...

Good dancers don't make good actors.,"This movie only gets a 2 because of how well the dancing was, besides that it was a complete waste of time. If you like to watch people be rude to one another for no reason and watch bad actors pretend to be on drugs, this one's for you! No plot to this movie at all, sexual conversations that last way too long, and they are just trying way too hard to make this movie like ""artsy."" Putting some words upside down and twisting the camera in around in circles doesn't make the movie look ""cool,"" just honestly made it even more annoying to watch. Would not recommend this movie to anyone. Total waste of time.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
A new favourite director,"Going into this movie to be actually honest I was expecting your over the top arthouse film , but I was totally wrong . For a Gaspar Noé first timer he left me in shock , fascination and appreciation for the art of film .Climax is a simple story of a group of dancers rehearsing and partying till they discover their drinks were spiked with LSD or a drug of some sort , so if you expect your three act story with complex characters sorry to disappoint , but that is not it .Noé in this movie as an artist manages to capture in the most disturbing way the feel of being possessed , losing control and falling into madness as a group and makes you the viewer part of that , so it is a movie you may not like but I think it is an experience and a ride you should try .",9.0,Anonymous,Music

ollective Hysteria,"""Clímax"", new film by the illustrious, technical and accurate Gaspar Noé does not have the same impact and power of his previous works, but continues with a very clear technique and keeps his signature present, the objective of moving the viewer, what is displayed, and that goal is reaching to perfection.
The film tells the story of a dance group that goes to an abandoned room to do their last rehearsal, and they end up being drugged, and during that trip they find their inner self, their real beings come up without the re-usation of social reins, your inner monsters come along with your fears. Will I be a good mother? Will someone ever relate to me? Love me? Who I am? I feel forbidden desires. These are questions that arise in each character. Even so, this is a depth of script that exists but is not quite as deep, but works, it works to contextualize the real meaning of the long, cinematic immersion.
We have a camera that starts behaving, with wonderful sequences sequences aligned to good and uncomfortable choreographies, but that with the passing of the film, it gains a life of its own and goes into the habit of each character, and thus, if lost completely, The camera rotates 360 It gives jumps, closed planes, medium planes, aerial planes, we do not have a pattern. We have only one focus that is to cause the viewer to immerse, so we need more technical devices such as photography and games of lights, dark and reddish, that shine according to the state of the film's spirit, its strong and vibrant colors bother, such which is a kind of classical music, electronic and urban, is exquisite, it has a cool touch and at the same time is long and nauseating, it is uncomfortable and at the same time attractive, such a junction of technical aspects added to the delirious and ungovernable performances culminate in a film difficult to digest, but rewarding.
Because Gaspar Noe can again fulfill his goal as a director, we are sucked into another dimension during the film, a dark and dangerous dimension, it is tense. like every movie, it seems that life is always on the line and that we are going to die due to insanity and our inner monstrosity. ""Climax"" is far from perfect, with some gruesome performances and repetitions of the idea. Gaspar Noe's new film takes on and perfectly fulfills the promise (despite the exaggerated marketing).",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Off the charts,"Gaspar Noe's films are notoriously intense (like really crazy intense) and this one is no exception. It is a beautifully directed film and is a brilliant display of cinematic skill that is generally unmatched by a large portion of mainstream directors. However it would also be very difficult for the average moviegoer to get through most of his movies and this is again no exception. I would say that I think its a very good film, but would be hard-pressed to recommend it to most of my friends because I'm afraid that a good portion of them would be traumatized by watching it. There is certainly some kind of draw to his movies but they are very hard to forget and again are hard to recommend to my lighthearted friends lest they have anxiety attacks and/or seizures while watching it.

Why there are so many negative reviews.,"It's an arthouse film. Other films in the same genre include: The 400 Blows; In the Mood for Love; Pi and Tokyo Story. These movies are not designed for the majority of people (I'm shocked it's rated as high as it is) but a niche.Positive - This is experimental high art. The dancing is mesmerizing. The cinematography is captivating. The music is fantastic. The characters are defined. It's a visual and audio spectacle, an exploration of mass hysteria.The plot is a kind of character study, the unraveling and disintegration of who this people try to be. Perhaps it's even a microcosm of modern France with a metaphor for her future.Negative - The acting is not the best but it's believable enough, the actors had passion for the project and you can feel it. The story itself is factually misleading, LSD would very unlikely have that effect on people, PCP would be more likely candidate.If you're looking for something weird and you wanna try something new. This might just be the movie for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Extreme whiplash,"Noe invites you to a dance into the downward spiral. With pumping electro tracks, endless dance sequences, parallel montages, and a head-up camera, not only the bodies within the film are destroyed here. Therefore, you should use the first ten minutes for acclimatization to tune your senses and your hearing to the following 80 minutes. ""Climax"" is both a radical experience and a cinematic intoxication. Deafening noise, trance-causing red and green images mixed together to a destructive polka when untreated people begin to mangle. Terror in its purest form distilled in wild dance routines and escalating behavioral patterns until the point of view is literally upside down and the bodies and speakers are only fragmented on the battlefield.

The actors' performances are nothing short of impressive, contributing to the movie's overall allure. Complementing the stellar acting is the fantastic music, enhancing the cinematic experience.

"Wild, Hallucinatory Nightmare","This was a film that I heard about when it was making its festival rounds and it had me intrigued. Podcasts I listen to gave some non-spoiler reviews and from what I gathered, it had been kind of hit or miss with those I listen to. That first viewing was in the theater where I thought it was solid. I'm now giving it a second viewing as part of the Summer Series for The Podcast Under the Stairs. To get into this, the synopsis is French dancers gather in a remote, empty school building to rehearse on a wintry night. The all-night celebration morphs into a hallucinatory nightmare when they learn their sangria is laced with LSD.We kick this off with a woman walking through what looks to be snow. She is screaming and the film then informs us that this is based on real events that happened in France back in 1996. The film also interestingly enough follows this up with the full credits before shifting to interviews of all of the dancers that are in the film. They are asked similar questions and it is quite quick, but we really get an idea of each of their characters. This is further done when we see them breaking off into pairs to tell more about themselves or to make comments about other dancers.In between the television interviews and them breaking off is an impressive performance. This is actually the rehearsal they are there for. I'll be the first to admit, I'm not great at dancing and I really don't understand how people can move this way, but this was fun to watch. At the end of the performance, there is food and drinks for everyone to unwind and celebrate. The problem is that the sangria is laced with LSD. We then see the people as they start to experience their trip as they go for their carnal desires, blame those around them for spiking the drink and a lot of madness. We see the truth of each of the characters as this becomes a psychedelic nightmare.I wanted to keep this recap short as this film doesn't really have a lot to it without spoiling different things. What I mean there is that I'd be going through different 'events' piece by piece. I found it interesting that I read this film really didn't have a script. What they had was about 5 pages to start it off and the rest of it was improvised. I do find this to be quite impressive. The film also feels very Hitchcockian as it has extremely long takes and it feels like it all one continuous shot at different times. It is able to do this as characters move around the perspective as it jumps to follow what the next person is doing. This involves some good rehearsal and interesting camera work.This film has an arthouse way of telling this story as well. The issue of abortion is raised as a character thinks they could be pregnant. We see that this bothers Selva (Sofia Boutella). I believe she is talking to Lou (Souheila Yacoub). There is a flash of a message that birth is a miracle. There are a couple more of these that existence is a fleeting illusion and death is also a magical thing as well. This commentary plays out later in a horrific way. Lou is bullied and we also see something happen with Emmanuelle (Claude-Emmanuelle Gajan-Maull) and her son Tito (Vince Galliot Cumant).We also get a lot about sexuality. David (Romain Guillermic) is a player and he admits to it. Others around him know it too, but he still on the prowl. He his sights set on Selva, who he claims to have hooked up with before, as well as a lesbian couple of Psyche (Thea Carla Scott) and Ivana (Sharleen Temple). He does admit he would hook up with any of the women that are there. There are a couple of guys who also talk about how they work as a team to hook-up with women. I know one goes by Cyborg (Alexandre Moreau) and I think his cousin is Naab (Naab). I find this interesting that they are open about their sexuality and what they are looking for. It is misogynistic though in some of the things they say. Along with the lesbian couple, there are also some gay men as well, which their plight I found intriguing with the other men around. One of them is named Daddy (Kiddy Smile) and I think the other is Taylor (Taylor Kastle). On top of that, there is the concept of rape, incest and a horrible parent as well that is explored.I will admit though, I did have some issues with the pacing of the film. It takes entirely took long in my opinion before we get into it. I'm come to realize that we need it though. We get the two sections of interviews to get an idea of the characters before things go wild. I thought it was solid once the LSD starts to kick in and we see the craziness happening. Part of this is the amount of characters and the director trying to introduce and let us get to know everyone. I'll be honest that I don't know the names of most of the cast and it took this second viewing to piece this together. I did like how things end up once we get to the climax of this film.Despite me not being able to tell you who all of the characters are, I thought the acting was good. I was a big fan of Boutella and I liked when her character was the focus. I should point out; this film doesn't have a star per say we follow. It shifts around to everyone in this film at one point or another. I'd say that the movie does well in giving us enough of each and following different interactions to build tension. We have enough different personalities to make this film work.This brings me to the effects. For the most part, there aren't a lot used. I wasn't sure since I know that Gaspar Noé films I've seen in the past can be quite brutal. We do get some of that. There is a scene with someone being set on fire that I liked. I think the bigger thing would be the camera work. We don't get the screen going too crazy to show the effects of the drugs, but there is some good lighting. We also get the camera showing us things upside down, which is a solid allegory to what the drug is doing to them. I have to give credit for these aspects.Next would be the score of the film. I thought the music selections were amazing for this film. It isn't necessarily my type of music, but it fits the film in multiple ways. First is the dance performance, which matches perfectly. Then once everything starts to go crazy, the music becomes haunting. When characters leave the room it is playing, it is quieter, but that almost makes it a bit unnerving. I have to give a lot of credit for the soundtrack for this film, especially since it got my heart rate going with anxiety.Now with that said, during our set-up of the movie, it can feel a bit boring. That is needed though to get you introduced to our players. Once we get to the craziness, I was locked in and there might have been more than once that I was shocked by something I saw. I thought this film had good acting and it does have a solid build up once we really get into it. The effects, how it was shot and soundtrack were great. There were some choices by Noé that weren't necessarily needed in the film, but this is a solid hallucinatory nightmare like the synopsis said. I found this film to be above average after this both viewings though.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"A cinema experiment that has its moments, but ends up to be very confusing and inconclusive","I love when directors experiment and try to push boundaries. I often search for strange and different movies that separate from the most ""conventional"" and commercial cinema, but unfortunately not all experiment are good and ""Climax"" is the perfect example of a failed trial.First of all, it is too long and the buildup is too slow. I was almost giving up after 35 minutes of absolute nothing, just a bunch of people dancing and speaking about dirty and trivial stuff. This goes on for half of the movie. In the other half finally things start to move: we see characters tripping and while we go on, the situation gets worse and worse. There are a few scenes that are really uncomfortable, especially when drugs start to kick in, but then the movie becomes crazy. I understand that the director wanted to give a sense of confusion and he manages to do it at the beginning, by rotating the camera, or with unusual shootings, but then he decided to randomly panning and zooming, and I was completely lost. I don't even know what I watched in the last 20 minutes, because it was impossible to understand what was going on.Actors scream and panic for the whole time, and while this at first is effective because it creates a sense of discomfort, if does not evolve into something else, it is annoying. This is exactly what happened in ""Climax"". There is no evolution, there is no character development and this means that I don't really care about what is happening. Sure, we learn something at the beginning, but it is not enough to bound with them, because information given are vague as they speak only about superficial stuff, as already stated.Cinema is plenty of unconventional movies that are way much better such as ""Enter the Void"" or ""The Neon Demon"", just to make a couple of examples. ""Climax"" had potential, but it completely wasted it. This could have been a really nice short movie of about 1 hour. It would have been much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

""Horror theme too sparse at beginning"".
""Not enough plot changes"".
""Slow build up to ending"".IntroductionClimax is a 2018, Drama and Horror movie, according to IMDb. It's produced in France, which mandates watching with subtitles on, if indeed you only speak English like me.StorylineFrom the word go, horror and music themes are suggested casually. Voices and temperaments are clearly engaging, from the opening instant. A clever beginning.
Ideas to be taken further, are quickly introduced, giving you a clear sense of the main movie themes. This provides a hook to retain the viewer. Introduction is slightly too long however.
Following this, things retain interest and intensity, but the plot is slow to progress, which after a time makes things appear tiresome.
Following a slightly mediocre centre, the film progresses towards the ending nicely. Themes such as gore were well implemented here, with despair, stress, profound sadness, fear, and anger. Labelling sections with title pages throughout, also adds something. Not many films feature this.GenreThe progression of horror vibes after the opening was too slow. It took far too long for anything shocking to occur. In parts, the film was more Drama or Adventure focused than Horror, sadly.
From the middle though, the genre became more and more of a Horror, until it actually earned it's reputation as a great film. It was very unusual in it's set of themes, but eventually lived up to it's name. It was in fact, difficult to tell exactly when it became a true horror, but once the whole film had elapsed, it almost certainly did.CharactersCharacters quickly differentiated themselves by their responses to questions asked. This allowed the viewer a way into their personalities, which emotionally seemed nicely variable.
The character emotions were tested hugely from middle to end. As the film name suggests, it does build up to a ""Climax"". It's a shame that the beginning half an hour, didn't provide sufficient horror themes, leaving the viewer only partly engaged. Thankfully though, from this point onwards: Pleasure, satisfaction, fear, despair, grief and turmoil, all ensued. Characters were well portrayed throughout, and really sculpted a distinctive signature for the film. It's one you'll struggle to forget.MusicEerie music from the word go, ramping up to more sinister tones. Contrast used well. Music was a central theme throughout, helping its variability.
From middle to end, the music really develops into it's own. Becoming a haunting backdrop for the horror themes that develop. The overall soundtrack is a real triumph, and very cleverly created and selected.Summary""Fabulous conclusion and profoundly unique"".Follow us: Reasea dot orgTags:Comedy, horror, thriller, horror movie review, monster, monster party, 2018 horror review, gory horror, monsters, clowns, clown horror, dungeons, Micky, reaseaorg, benandthegang, Fossafitness, followus, moviefans, reasonedandseasoned, hey Micky, Mickytheclown, adrift, open water, open water 2, no sharks ?, climax, french movies,",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Nightmarish and graphic in a psychotic kind of way, not an ""enjoyable"" horror film kind of way.I found the acting to be believable.

"Impressive, bold and deliberately uncomfortable.","From start to finish the film was thematically impeccable but perhaps too uninteresting. A hell-on-Earth scenario that highlights how easily humanity can get complete chaos with the simplest of changes. It's not a film I'm ever going to watch again as there is no subtlety in the way it was made, but am glad I experienced it. It is literally a story told in two 45-minute halves; the first a character build up with solid editing, cinematography and choreography. The second half a terrifyingly exaggerated experience which, whilst competently filmed, deliberately relies on tension that the film expertly dishes out in a very gradual way. An extremely enjoyable but uncomfortable watch. Not for everyone.Other notes: Glad that the film wasn't too explicitly sexual as it would have seemed gimmicky. The violence is definitely tamed down from this director and it's good to see he doesn't need it to make a great film. The overhead shots were the best scenes. The wardrobe seemed really fitting to the individual personalities. The sound editing actually stood out as the music could have been droning but it wasn't.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Climax by Gaspar Noé,"The stories about a group of people who are having fun in any kind of places, to celebrate a party or even to prepare for the next days rehearsal, are one of the most unexpected stories to tell. As these parties are surrounded by loud rhythmic songs, with more or less choreographed dancers, who express all of their emotions through the dance as body language. Until something unexpected would happen to the main characters, who would live in a nightmare which they cannot escape. Some of these stories would end with the main characters who survive from the nightmare, while other stories would end with the main characters who die from the nightmare. The auteur filmmaker Gaspar Noé seems intrigued to explore this theme, in the most unexpected way and unforgettable way. As the shooting of the movie took only 15 days, which is unusual to shoot a film with that brief time, in 2018 came out Climax by Gaspar Noé with Sofia Boutella, Kiddy Smile, Romain Guillermic, Souheila Yacoub, Claude Gajan Maull, Giselle Palmer, Taylor Kastle and Thea Carla Schott. The movie's plot: In the mid 1990s, a group of dancers join in a boarding school, for three day rehearsal with a DJ, their choreographer and her little son. All of them are having fun, until they would realize in the drink sangria is filled with LSD, which everyone is going to live in an irreversible nightmare. The movie would capture the audience attention from the beginning to the end, without letting them be distracted by anything. The camera and the lightings work to be compatible, in every single angle shots and in every camera movements, especially to see what would happen to the main characters. As most of the long takes help to capture the audience attention, to see how much the nightmare would go far. The editing was specifically elaborated to create scary atmospheres filled with suspense, without ruining the narration's rhythm, needed to see what the main characters would go through. Each of the actors, especially the ones who play the dancers, did an excellent performance as some of them have initially a bond with each other. Until the nightmare would cause them to not have anymore trust with anybody, as they would be unprepared with what is going to happen with all of them. Each of the actors who play the dancers have done an extraordinary choreography, as the main characters would communicate their feelings only through dancing. Especially in the dance sequences surrounded by the rhythmic songs, which can be felt their rhythm in their movements. Climax is one of the most thrilling and unexpected movies of all time, as well as one of the best Gaspar Noé's movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Another disturbing one,"Once again Gaspar Noe delivers a very weird and disturbing movie. It's more like an extreme experience. When I finished to watch it, I was wondering what was that ? What did I just watch !!?? As if I was the witness of a violent trance... nothing like Seul contre tous (1998) or Irreversible (2002) but still provocative and nauseous.
However, the soundtrack is excellent and the dance scenes are quite good but some characters are very annoying.

One Hell-A-Julia for Gaspar Noe,"If this isn't something truly special, then I don't know what is! This masterpiece, with one of the best soundtracks ever created, is a relentless thrill ride of tension and horror, with a climax that's nearly impossible to watch.As someone who's been to my fair share of parties, this film brought back memories-some not so pleasant. In recent years, I've watched countless movies, but most of them failed to live up to their promises. G. N. Doesn't disappoint, proving once again why he's one of the best directors of our time. He keeps you on the edge, blending realism with raw, unflinching brutality-exactly what makes this film so unique.It will stick with you long after you've seen it, lingering in your thoughts, still as disturbing as when it first hit you.Now, let's talk about the music. This film features the crème de la crème of electronic music: Daft Punk, Aphex Twin, and many more. The soundtrack vibrates through you, making you want to move, yet the visuals and music don't always seem to match-or do they? That's something you'll have to explore for yourself.To sum it up: this is about as mainstream as it gets from a true enfant terrible of modern cinema, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart. Get ready for a rollercoaster of emotions, accompanied by phenomenal music and chilling images that show just what humans are capable of when there are no limits.Watch and enjoy!Cheers!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Some kind of terrible...,"I don't know what movie all these people giving out 6,7,8+ star ratings were watching, because this movie is one of the dumbest, most idiotic, pointless exercises in stupidity that I have had the unfortunate displeasure to have seen.I am forced to give it 1 star, I suppose for being able to get the camera turned on running the credits.I'm unsure what the exact Budget of this ""film"" was, but if it was over 500 dollars, was grossly wasted. IMDB reports a budget of 2.6 million... Which is absolutely hilarious considering the whole thing could have been done with a couple of iphones and a handful of volunteers, in less then a week, on a budget of like 78 dollars....2.6 Million... haha, what a complete and utter waste of money.The acting is not just bland, or necessarily awful... it was all just pointless grunting, screaming and crying... I can imagine the director yelling "" Ok, I want to see giant, mindless and Violent babies""It was like watching a bunch victims of severe brain truama try to act as unintelligent as they could muster.And as icing on this cake of writhing poor quality and mental illness indulged, the producers were keen to make sure they included some female homosexual sex action, complete with a solid scene a boyfriend being humiliated, emasculated and locked out of the room... the trendy man hating was splattered on heavy.As was the obvious racial bias, with several scenes depicting peaceful timid white people being not just attacked, but brutalized and, taunted and ridiculed... or just attacked by a group and brutally beat down..These types of films are not art, they are not social commentaries they are more like pornography for those with violent, racially biased and obviously very skewed ideas of social justice.While I would never suggest that people not be allowed to produce these sorts of shamefully transparent .... things, nor would I deny any individual's right to watch them if that is what brings them joy, additionally I wouldn't deny that I found this film worse then bad, worse then ""in poor taste"" ...It was like a low budget, student film effort attempting to combine some Reefer Madness era ""cautionary"" propaganda fueled hysteria with extremely far left Social Justice ideas... only it has nothing to do with justice, and everything to do the indulgence of violent fantasies and an attempt to make some sort of social/political statement based on what are apparently severely skewed and wildly perverse ideas and/or opinions.Don't waste you time on this ""movie"" unless you enjoy subjecting yourself to poorly produced attempts at suggestive ""programming"".If I could have given this film 0 stars, I would have still wished I could have given it a lower rating, It really is the theatrical equivalent to Valium,... or brain damage, hopefully it will fade from memory again",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"An impressive watch, but one that I would never want to see again.","Climax is the type of movie that you'd watch on a dare. Unconventional in almost every way, and unflinchingly disturbing as soon as the group realizes what's wrong. Gasper Noe is no stranger to off putting filmmaking techniques, and if you've seen any of his previous work you know what you're in store for.When it comes to the colours, performances (especially the dancing) and immersive tone; Climax has plenty to offer if you're up for the challenge. However, like Noe's other films, the amount of people that laud this as a masterpiece or a disaster will likely be even.The largest aspect that bothers me with this film, similar with Noe's other works, is what is his point with a story like this? Is he just enjoying reveling in disturbing material? There are already filmmakers making much more disturbing films so I can't judge him. However I can't help but wonder what his intent is in telling a story like this.Still I can't help but respect a filmmaker that time and time again makes films that are so deliberately inaccessible and, depending on who you ask, unnecessarily disturbing. But with such incredible visuals and performances, I can't ignore the talent that's on display.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Would be a cult movie if Gaspard Noé have done a real work,"Climax would be great if Gaspard Noé had put some more work on it. He filmed it very quickly and letting too much freedom to the ""actors"" (who are just dancers and in general really bad actors). The movie has a really nightmare ambience and visual thanks to the creepy dancers. But, with the work that Gaspard is capable and better editing, it would be a cult movie! In this state, it feels more that he tried to put almost all societies taboos in a failed recipe just to schock the viewer. At least, the shocking part worked really well.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
I like it!,"After reading a bunch of 1 star reviews on here I had pretty low expectations and I think that made a difference. So I'm hesitant to oversell it. I also got stoned which in hindsight was a great idea since the first act is mostly dancing. It's kind of a slow burn the first 30-45 min I felt indifferent & bored. However a bunch of pro dancers on acid does sound like the start of a nightmare so it sets a tone. About an hour in I started to love it. Then I thought maybe love is too strong a word but I definitely like it. This movie really captured the feeling of experiencing a bad trip without relying on cringey filters or camera tricks. As I left the theater to mixed reactions (a couple talking through out gave the credits the middle finger and booed, such rebels) I felt disoriented ""is this a dream? Am I awake??"" The guy loudly and frantically playing sax on the subway home added to this movie induced pseudo trip. As I walked home I kept thinking I really like how I feel right now!...not for everyone but I'd definitely recommend seeing it in a theater vs a laptop or tv.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Bizarre mess,"There are no spoilers to give because the trailer pretty much summed up the movie. Too bad because I like some of what A24 is putting out.Literally 10 minutes of interviews for the opening. Then a 5 min dance montage, followed by another 5 min music montage peppered with superfluous dialogue.
Only at 23 minutes do you see a break from music and dancing, to quickly get back to more music and gibberish.The music and dancing were okay, but does this make a film? I don't think so. Should films have rules? Maybe not, but guides. If you are going to make a movie why not do something that hasn't been done before? Paris is Burning comes to mind, but this is no Paris is Burning.This was total bizarro land... and not in any interesting, unique or groundbreaking way.

"Will Definitely Make You Say ""WTF"" but You'll Keep Watching","Director Gasper Noe's horror dance movie has to be seen to understand why you'll saying WTF throughout it's second half but you'll be compelled to keep watching. A group of dancers is recruited (I think) to take part in some kind of dance...thing. I dunno. The establishing part of the story was lost on me but it didn't matter.The first main scene (or set of scenes) are brief interviews with each of the dancers. What might seem tedious isn't as each of the actors is compelling in their own right. They were all naturals.Then we cut to a truly mesmerizing dance sequence that was shot uncut. For once a contemporary director shoots a dance sequence the way they should be: straight on with no cutaways. This is how big dance numbers were shot back during the golden age of movie musicals (the 30s, 40s and 50s). The effect is enthralling, enchanting and truly mesmerizing. Then we get to hear conversations among the various dancers where we get a glimpse of their personalities. Then there's another dance sequence (shot from above!) that, while not as good as the first, is still fantastic.Then something happens. There's a discernible shift in the film's tone and the characters attitudes. Where before they were pleasant and encouraging to each other now they are hostile. Things go from bad to worse to nightmarish. What could have caused this to happen? A force from outside? Were they drugged?Some of the scenes during the ""nightmare"" portion of the film bordered on being silly but I still could not NOT watch. Amazingly the film actually reveals the cause of the disturbing behavior and it is a solid resolution. Believable and effective.I'm not exactly sure what the point of ""Climax"" is or even if the Noe had a point to make. Perhaps he just wanted to mash together the dance and horror film genres.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Unscripted and Uninhibited Art,"I've always been really interested in Gaspar Noé's divisive use of surreal and unorthodox filmmaking techniques. Climax is no different, and I've come to the realization that it's one of my favorite films of all time. The usage of continual tracking shots lasting minutes on end throughout the film documenting the dance troupe's spiral into madness as the effects of the LSD kick in was just beautiful.One of the film's standout moments was definitely the uninhibited dance scene after the title card. When I initially saw it, I was just mesmerized; I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The raw energy that oozed from the dancers really came through to the viewer and I can confidently say that it's one of the best scenes that I'd ever seen in any film.I usually favor works that are scrutinized down to the smallest detail, but the spontaneity and grittiness of Climax are what make it stand out to me. If it were to be more structured, I don't think that I would have enjoyed it as much as I did. Overall, the unscripted nature of this film was something I was wary of before I'd watched it, but I'm glad that I gave it a chance because that particular aspect was exactly what made it such a different and compelling experience for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A Convoluted, Cinematography Masterclass","As it presides, I watched this film a year after it's release and gave the film a 5/10 rating. Now that I've seen the film for a second time I've experienced a more mature view of the emotions that Gasper Noe conveys to us while also interpreting the unexplained. The film struggles to keep a strong narrative due to it's entire premise being established in a dance studio. The film leaves many questions that can only be hypothesized which is a key signature of Noe's filmography. As a pure representation of hysteria among a wild unruly troupe of dancers contains a lot of substance that could be there. The dialogue is on par for an award winning screenplay, yet the story that the actors contain at their own presence seems to be saying something other than their dialogue.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

An exhilarating EXPERIENCE that will most definitely take your breath away.,"Gaspar Noe's Climax is a work of art, I can end the review right here and no additional words are needed, Noe exercises chaos in its most beautiful state, he crafts this perception of things much like an actual LSD trip, few minutes into the film and I assure you that you'll be consumed by it, it has a psychedelic rhythm that sways back and forth and shocks you out of your mind, having watched Noe's previous works, I feel like I'm familiar with his bold and shocking style but this takes it to a whole other level, much like an actual climax this sets in slowly and beautifully, it's truly amazing, to say the least.Not a lot of people get Gaspar's style, it's often mislabeled and it sometimes comes across as pretentious, none of that is true, his work is fascinating and captivating, I dare you to find a dull moment in this film, it's an exhilarating EXPERIENCE that will most definitely take your breath away, Incredible film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Incredibly dull,"I expected an erotically charged fever dream full of twisting paranoia, complex choreography and intermingled expressions of lighting, sound, and visual excellence. You know, something that would live up to the simple yet potentially good premise, and serve as an appropriate vehicle for a movie using dance to explore themes of decadence, loss of control, and fear, all of which can be skewed as inherently sexual.What I got was a poorly paced, repetitive, and above all painfully tedious soup of mediocre and messy choreography, bad acting that was neither compelling or 'authentically' real, some very lazy stereotyping (now with extra by-the-numbers racism, misogyny, and homophobia!) in place of any actual characters or psychological avatars, and some relentlessly boring shots of the same group of people doing the same thing over and over and over again.There are some relatively committed performances, and some very tired 'enfant terrible' tricks that one would assume Noe would have grown out of by now (flipping the camera upside down, putting the end credits first, and flicking up trite little title cards about the enormity of birth and death are just some of them), but nothing really makes up for the sense of wasted opportunity and, frankly, wasted time.The best thing in this film is the lighting, and even that - by minute thirteen of a red- or green-drenched shot of the same hallway - wears its welcome very very thin.

Shocked by how bad this was,"I think this may be the first IMDB review I've ever written. But I am so baffled by the high praise for this movie, I have to give my opinion on this movie.First off, I saw Irreversible by this director over 10 years ago, and that movie was somewhat traumatizing to me. I actually had to look away during a couple different scenes and I never feel so repulsed by something in a movie that I have to look away, so that's saying something.I heard only great things about Climax, and was cautiously excited to see it, mostly looking forward to how crazy it seemed it would be but also mentally preparing myself for anything that could possibly happen.Then nothing happened. The very first (really last I guess) scene with the snow and person writhing around was the most interesting part of this movie, and we see that scene in the trailer. The dancing was cool, but gets tedious after awhile. It took forever for whatever the drug was (they mention LSD I think? But the way it makes them act doesn't really make sense) to kick in, and when it does, it's still tedious and just silly. I was hoping Gaspar Noe, the director, was going to film it in a way that made the audience almost feel the effect of the drug too, but his upside shots and shoddy handheld camerawork didn't bring me into the trip at all. I felt like I was watching mostly bad actors who've never done any drugs try to act like they were on drugs. The violence was very tame compared to what I was anticipating.When it was over, I actually apologized to my husband for asking him to see it with me. We were both really shocked how bad and boring it was. I should have learned by now that review aggregators are not to be trusted, yet I still believed the baffling hype.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

Certainly that's what I would think if my mom accidentally watched the film and told me of her reaction to it, but I don't think that's quite the case with me. I saw and loved both Irreversible and Enter the Void prior to watching this, so I thought I was generally on board with Noe's ""thing"", but Climax mostly left me cold.I'm not sure how to characterize my problem with Climax. I'm normally a champion of movies that seek to provide an experience rather than focusing on story and character, and while I admire the technical craft and the no-holds-barred performances on display here, the film as a whole just lacked something.

Did we watch the same movie?,"Ok, so when I first saw it, I thought it was ok. Nothing to write home about, easily forgotten except for the amazing dance scene shot in a single take.

Still not sure if I'm missing something.

I'm not a film connoisseur, but I feel like offering my opinion can save someone an hour and a half. It's not that great. The director has other films under his belt that are much more bizarre without the pretentiousness. It's not that edgy or groundbreaking. I would simply say ""meh.""I wouldn't tell anyone they gotta see this movie though.

An unwatchable piece of scrap result of a bad attempt to be deep and artistic.,"The fact that this has a 7/10 rating scares me. It shows how easy is to make a ""deep and controversially artistic"" type of movie. Just throw a bunch of nonsense junk in a fancy way trying to cover a moral or polemical matter and you got yourself a genious film.It's stretched out with extremelly boring and awful scenes to compensate the lack of content and concept, feeling like a truly waste of time. The plot is almost non-existent, the acting is average, and the second part that is suppossed to be intriguing and unsettling is nothing but painfully boring and horrible.120+ movies rated and I've never given a 1/10 rating, until now.

First Bad Now Movie. Shame,"Casper is pretty much a genius. I was so looking forward to this more than any other of his films because I love concept, the music and the dread I felt before I saw it. Unfortunately it is UTTERLY flawed from the start as the director obviously has no idea what it is like to be on LSD. I do and it is NOTHING IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM how it is portrayed in the movie. Ok so if it was 100% it would just be loads of teenagers lying on a floor looking at a ceiling going ""wow"" every 10 minutes but EVERY SINGLE character DOES not act like they are on LSD. Simple as. I therefore spent the whole movie just shaking my head and shouting NO at everyone. And Gaspar.

hypnotic or horrific depending on your taste,"Greetings again from the darkness. A wounded, bleeding, hysterical woman is seen crawling through the snow. She's not dressed appropriately for the weather, and it's apparent she's suffered some type of trauma. This opening shot is from a bird's eye view, and it's the way provocative filmmaker Gaspar Noe (LOVE, ENTER THE VOID) opens his latest film. This vivid visual sticks with us as we flashback to the progression of events that led to this woman's unfortunate circumstance ... her situation being the conclusion to what we are about to watch.The initial dance sequence is shown in full and it is quite stunning in its energy and physicality and athleticism. As best I could tell, it was a single long take with dancers writhing and music thumping, both in frenetic mode. Much of each dancer's personality is depicted in their movements, and the video interviews we see as part of their audition reveal a culturally diverse group of young adults unsure of where this is headed. We are watching a troupe of mid-1990's French dancers rehearsing in a large, otherwise empty facility on a snowy night, and we too are unprepared for what's about to unfold.After that initial performance, the dancers begin mingling as the camera takes us inside the various conversations. Lust, jealousy, and insecurities fill the air as the choreographed energy we first watched in awe slowly disintegrates into a bizarre type of hand-to-hand combat ... some psychological, some more physical/violent in nature. The dancers are slipping from sanity, unsure if it's temporary or possibly deadly. One of them traces their spinning head (not literal) and unexplained sensations to the Sangria punch - leading to some angry confrontations and outrageous behavior.While none of the individual performances really stand out ... this is not a film about certain interesting characters ... it should be noted that Sofia Boutella (HOTEL ARTEMIS) plays Selva, the dance company's choreographer, and Kiddy Smile plays Daddy, the DJ who keeps the music pumping. Watching the movie is truly like observing a group acid trip through the eyes of someone on an acid trip. The camera is sometimes invading intimate moments, while other times hovering or wildly spinning above or below. Sometimes it felt like a GoPro was strapped to a frantic parakeet that had just been set free from its cage.Combining the camera work with the constant thundering of music, some might describe the film as hypnotic and hallucinatory (I prefer horrific).
While most of the dancers seem to lose all sense of reality, some react more violently than others. Hysterics run rampant, especially in a sequence where a young boy is locked in a utility closet by his mother. Whether the scene was for shock value or merely in keeping with the filmmaker's demented approach is unclear - either way, this came across as too much on top of too much. Simply put, the film is a relentless assault on the eyes and ears and all sense of decency ... just as Gaspar Noe likely intended.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"Hard to watch, harder to turn away.","Director Noe certainly makes movies that are both hard to watch and captivating. And doesn't seem to know the concept of editing. The movie starts with many of the dancers stating what dance means to them, and then into a very intense dance rehearsal which is stunning to watch. The choreography so they don't bump into each other is not simple, as the movements are very rapid with a lot of dancers and lots of arm movements. They break, and there is a punch bowl of sangria. It happens to have been spiked, probably with LSD. For about half the movie one watches the dancers on a very bad trip. There is pulsating music, color filters, and even upside down camera work. It goes on much too long, but also draws one in. And some of the dancers are having a very, very bad trip. The technical aspects of the film is what I rated it on, for without that, it would be extremely boring.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Wicked nothingness,"Let's start by making something crystal clear: I'm not a big fan of gore, torture, snuff or such kind of content in cinema. Not that it disturbs me or freaks me out. I'm simply not particularly fond of it, but I've enjoyed my share of it when it serves a purpose. Unfortunately, in Climax Gaspar Noé has no story to tell, no message to deliver, just a poor, weak excuse of a remotely imaginative concept to let loose on the screen an increasingly annoying collection of sexual graphic scenes, violent imagery and deranged acts that feel out of place even in the context of the movie. It's just a lazy effort to get all avant-garde critics to come out of their shells and claim it's a bold take from a brave director, a raw experience showing the true nature of humans and whatnot. The truth is that besides the interesting cinematography and a solid music score that fits the film perfectly (although gets a bit tedious after a while) there's nothing else to salvage from a film so meaningless and empty it could only produce an equally empty review.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

These dialogues would even be embarrassing for movies like American Pie.Then after around 45 minutes into the movie the effects of the drugs begin to show.

Horror for the X-Factor generation,"With Climax Noe injects all his trademarks with good effect, such as 'out of the comfort zone' themes and stunning cinematography and effects. However, where these are used to great effect with titles such as 'Irreversible' and 'Enter the Void', with Climax they are the only elements worth mentioning. The afore mentioned films had a lot more going for them, where Cilmax, seems to me, to fall flat. The first hour of the film is full on ITV Saturday night mainstream entertainment. Great fun for the lovers of X Factor etc, no doubt. The characters are also 2 dimensional and not very likeable, were the only topic and conversation seems to be about sex. Now I know most of the characters are young and they are placed in a party scenario, but this doesn't lead to a very engaging script or narrative.

"If you are going to make art for yourself, keep it to yourself.","And if Gaspar Noe doesn't care what people think about his movies, then people should take him up on that and not care about him and his works in kind.That being said - this movie is dismissible. Noe mistakes annoying for provocative. He mistakes repetitive for poignant. And shrieking while thrashing about is not shocking or discomforting to the audience - not when the cast is as unrelatable and as unpleasant as they are. He has also clearly never been on an acid trip.Most of the dancing epitomizes the worst of the Vogue period of 1990's terpsichorean culture. So I had no interest, sympathy or investment in the events that befell them - one way or another. In fact, I let the movie play off to the side like the ignorable noise it is.

I was hoping for more...a little bit disappointed.,"First of all, at the first hearing of the scenario and idea, was looking very interesting.
I was anticipating to see Gaspar Noe's view of such an intriguing story.
The results was far from good, unfortunately.
I believe that we can see the result of a 4 pages script, full improvisation and a professional dancers cast.
Lot of dancing, sometimes was good, most of the times was boring and waited to see where it was leading. Unfortunately nowhere.
The worst thing is that the whole acid trip experience was badly given. Over reactions, exaggerations etc. I know that he wanted to give the chaos, and the return to raw human instincts, This is what I also wanted to experience, but I'm sorry with no success.
I am curious, if this movie is accepted better from people that never had substances experience, and watch it from a clean perspective.
Also one more thought is, if the negativity about this movie from people that had experience with hallucinogenic substances, is coming from the fear of a bad trip for themselves (in the past experiences).
But again these two are just philosophical/psychological questions,
the result was not good.

Dull and pointless,"In the beginning we see some people being interviewed for some dance job. They're asked about dancing, about their ambitions, and most importantly, whether they are willing to do whatever it takes to succeed. This takes a while because so many people are interviewed. But we don't see this directly rather through an old CRT TV. There are books to the left of the TV and VHS tapes to the right, the most recognizable: Suspiria.Then we see the entire dance troop, apparently everyone got hired, rehearsing their routine. The dancing isn't particularly impressive, we get a bit of everything from ribbon dancing to slam. Fortunately as a European movie we get some good electronic music. Once the rehearsal is finished, there's food and sangria and they party/hang out. We hear some lame conversations and learn insignificant things about some of these people, the majority of whom are unattractive. The name that most often comes up is one Selva (jungle in Spanish) played by the unappealing Sofia Boutella.Then they start dancing individually with everyone else surrounding the dancer. Here the camera is on top. A dumb move that doesn't let you see the dancing, which gets progressively more frenetic and ends almost in a mosh pit. Next everyone starts screaming and acting up and all weird. They realize that the sangria has been laced with LSD (?). They blame a Muslim guy who doesn't drink and therefore is alright and kick him out.Things do advance a step in terms of what we learned about the characters while they are all drugged. Nothing particularly interesting or extreme. At this point the camera is upside down and close to the ground traveling through the bodies. Coloring has turned black and red--as in the climax of Suspiria.Next day some guys arrive and walk through the building finding our troupe in various states of intoxication. One isn't alive. And there's a revelation about who put the LSD in the sangria.At best this movie is a whodunit. Except, who cares. There's no effort to get us to care. Nothing interesting goes on. Despite the two cinematographic curiosities: the camera on top, the upside down camera close to the ground, the whole movie is flat and dull. No character stands out or matters particularly. There was opportunity to give us some extreme and shocking developments, but Noe oddly enough doesn't quite go there. There could have been sex and nudity. But we barely get that. I take it Suspiria was the inspiration for this mess, but it doesn't do it any favors or justice.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"An overlong, over-loud, pretentious bore!","Who did they think to please with this?!? It's 97 minutes of nothingness, of which 80 minutes are wasted on seeing a bunch of unattractive people (supposedly professional dancers) jump like crazy up and down in some dilapidated school hall, on a nauseating, full blast electronic sound drone. Apparently someone spiced their sangria with LSD (seriously!) so this results in an increasingly orgastic frenzy of ecstasy and violence. Well, that's at least what the synopsis suggested, labeling it pretentiously as a shocking intense experience. If so, I totally missed it, probably because of yawning too much. It's endlessly the same tedious yelling and grabbing and jumping and sexing. In between we hear (as far as the over-loud music allows) various people exchange various incoherent titbits of gossip, flirtations and insults, and then we see them going at each others throats. But some kind of narrative is nowhere to be found. There's even a cute little kid dragged into all this, who in the wake of the drug-infused insanity is misplaced and locked in a closet. I wonder what child welfare would have thought of that. So to sum it up: a ludicrous pretentious bore. Avoid!!",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Pretentious vapid rubbish,"This is one of the most tedious things I have ever watched. It's just an endless onslaught of dance moves peppered with banal dialogue. The characters are completely one dimensional, providing no insight or relatability. Paired with some truly atrocious acting, I felt nothing towards any of them. They weren't interesting enough to like or dislike in any way. They may as well have been cardboard cutouts. The violence intended as a display of the characters descent into madness isn't shocking or gritty. It pushes no boundaries and elicits no visceral response from me.As for the drug angle... This dude has never taken acid. Is this meant to be a joke? I've used a LOT of LSD, and everything else that can mess with your brain. I've experienced bad trips, violence, depravity, insanity. I've properly lost the plot both with and without the aid of narcotics. This film in no way depicts the reality of that stuff. It's like hearing all about the horrors of addiction from someone who has never experienced it and lacks any insight into what it actually is.Holding the camera upside down and shaking it around was simply nauseating.

A Really Horrible Film,"Gaspar Noe is one of the worst directors France has ever had, moving in a world of negativity that ends up in a cul-de-sac.

It is, it is said, based on real events; a dance event that starts off with the usual frenzy of youthful bodies frantically dancing to the limit and ending up due to a spiced drink in separate worlds of unspeakable terror. Is it even good as film ? In my opinion, no, but others have the right to believe otherwise.

The first 49 minutes are the director not understanding that his scenes last WAY too long to continue to be entertaining, making the average movie goer saying in their head ""ok, next scene already!"" and still having to agonize for untold minutes before switching to another too long segment.The director has also obviously never done LSD, and only researched BS propaganda about it and made up a completely nonsensical, totally boring film.Ok at 1 hour and 18 min we finally see some nudity... but it's barely worth fast forwarding to.Skip this movie, its slow paced, boring, and while has a really cool dance scene... has nothing worthwhile in it.

ANNND repeat. It was Dance, Dialogue, Dance, Dialogue, over and over. But, mercifully, someone remembered there had to a plot inserted and it got interesting.

Climax it's a meaningless movie about a bad LSD trip and even that's not so believable as Noé's intended to, the cast sreams (literaly) amateurish from every pore and with that comes unbearable overacting.

You'll need to be under the influence of something to enjoy,"Simply a waste of time. I generally don't mind slow-burns or potboilers, but this movie goes absolutely nowhere. Much of the problem is the large cast involved (20+) and but none of them are actually captivating to care.The film starts off with each dancer's ""interview"" where they discuss various life goals which goes on forever since they have to go through everybody. Then they break into a remarkable uncut extended ensemble dance routine which is the absolute highlight of the movie and worth 1 solid star.Then they sit and talk. And chat. And discuss. And gossip. And banter. And gab. And confer. And parley. And argue. And converse. And babble. And spout. And prattle. And jabber. And vent. And whine. And cluck. And yak. And yap. And yammer. And yarn. For over a brain-mushingly half-hour!I should've followed my instincts and just left. The supposed upcoming ""climax"" was an empty promise; you would see better drug trips by drawing circles on paper.After another, less spectacular dance-off, people realize they've been drugged and a brief confrontation while trying to figure out who spiked the punch ensues. For the rest of the time, everyone is either wandering around aimlessly or continuing to dance (which the camera spends an obnoxious amount of time focusing on). There's some interpersonal relationship drama that pokes its head out once in a while (earning a couple more points) but nothing worth sitting around for.Don't be fooled by the title or tagline of ""Horror"", there is nothing scary, suspenseful, or rewarding.

2. Dancing - Some moves are alright, but for the most part none of them can actually dance.
3. Drug - Whoever watches this and thinks it is believable clearly never tried acid before however I believe the cameraman may have been on LSD while shooting half of the film upside down (SO ARTHOUSE YO!)
4. Story - After a quick google, this never happened. Not even close - I won't ruin it for you but check on the internet and prepare to be amazed at how far the original story was blown out of proportion. Mind-boggling.
5. Music - Absolutely no audio techniques to create change of pace or mood, just constant generic techno drivel, maybe to create a tense atmosphere but instead resulting in a terrible headache. My ears are ringing 30 minutes after viewing.

The film is therefore reduced to a useless waste of time without any plot outlet and without any real moral, a useless film without meaning and meaning destined to attract viewers only for the fact that it is an excess of drugs and sex without the minimal texture.

'Climax', by comparison, doesn't compel the viewer in-the-same-way to seriously consider human nature in its most degraded form.

It left me somewhat numb - weary, even - with regard to the escalating, depraved behaviour on view. Disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
