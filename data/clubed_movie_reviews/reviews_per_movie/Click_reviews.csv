"It ""Clicks"", Alright","When one thinks of an Adam Sandler film, the phrase ""juvenile humor"" immediately comes to mind, filled with low-brow humor and outlandish acting. Fortunately, ""Click"" is a departure (for the most part) from that categorization by providing an interesting story, developed characters, and very solid acting.For a basic plot summary, ""Click"" sees Michael Newman (Sandler) struggling to find time for his family while wearing himself out for his never-impressed boss. On a routine trip to find a universal TV remote, Michael runs into a crazy scientist (played by Christopher Walken) who gives him a ""universal remote"", alright...one that can control his entire life! Hilarity, emotions, & hijinks ensue.Besides the novel concept, this movie outshines other Sandler flicks due to its heart. While shaping up (in the early goings) to be a hijinks comedy, somewhere along the way a heavy dose of emotion is thrown into the proceedings. By the end of the film, the viewer will actually care about the main characters and want to see their resolutions.Granted, ""Click"" does still contain some of the typical Sandler low-brow humor, but it isn't too over-the-top or suffocating. Far outweighing that aspect is the above-average acting from pretty much the entire cast, which produces a real connection between characters and audience.Overall, ""Click"" is a fun little movie (though not for the younger kiddies) that may (at least in a small way) change your perception of Mr. Sandler. This isn't his goofy ""Waterboy"" or farcical ""Billy Madison"". Instead, director Frank Coraci crafts an actual storyline filled with character development and fun concepts.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This review is for those who generally DON'T like Adam Sandler movies,"I have never been a fan of Adam Sandler, though I have seen a few of his movies. I am in my 40s and I notice that the appeal for him seems to be with teenagers and young adults--and I assume most of the reviews here are by younger reviewers. So here is a review that might be a little different--a 40-something who is a bit of a hard sell.Overall, I was surprised that I did like this film as much as I did. It was far deeper and less dopey than films like BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE and seemed like an attempt by the rapidly aging Sandler to make a more adult film. While there are still lots of crude jokes that fell flat for me (such as the dog and the stuffed animal), there was still plenty to like and a depth that surprised me. Also, while there were some comedic moments, after a while it became obvious that this was really a comedy-drama--with the second half of the film being very serious and even touching.So here we seem to have an Adam Sandler movie that might just appeal to kids AND parents--one that everyone can get something out of and enjoy. I am happy I saw this one and wouldn't mind seeing more films like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Adam can act,"It's not the typical Adam Sandler movie and thank goodness for that. This movie has some actual drama, some real heart to it. It's not all lowbrow toilet humor. Has Adam Sandler grown up? Even in this more grownup venture he apparently just couldn't help himself, tossing in the obligatory disgusting fart joke. But we'll give him a a pass on that one because pretty much everything else in the movie shows a refreshing maturity. Well, OK maybe not the humping dogs. But what do you want? Sandler's never going to go full-blown serious dramatist and who'd want him to? This movie maintains the humor Sandler is known for but also gives you a story you actually care about and moments of great emotion and poignancy. Along the way Sandler gets to show that he does have some actual serious acting chops. One scene with him and his father, played by Henry Winkler, particularly stands out. Here Sandler's character has so much emotion coursing through him. And Sandler performs the scene so well you feel the emotion right along with him. Very well done, and more than a little surprising from an actor who is not known for this sort of thing.The story revolves around Sandler's character of Michael, an overworked architect whose family takes a backseat in his quest for career advancement. He loves his family, he just doesn't have the time for them. Then he meets Morty, a mysterious man who bestows upon Michael a gift which will make things so much simpler. It's a universal remote which actually control's Michael's universe. Now he's got all the time he needs. He can pause, rewind, fast forward. But inevitably there will be complications. Michael ends up fast forwarding through his whole life. He misses everything. And he gets really, really fat. It seems in order to really appreciate life Michael had to miss it. Can he get it back? According to Morty that's not part of the deal.Those expecting a straight comedy are going to be very surprised with Click, but probably pleasantly so. There are plenty of laughs but nothing that's really uproariously funny. And most of the comedy is shoehorned into the first half of the film. The second half takes on a more serious, at times even somber, tone. A somber Adam Sandler movie? Who wants to watch that? You should. Sandler breaks out of the little box that is his admittedly wildly successful career to try something a little bit different and it pays off. Sandler is really terrific in this. And he's got great support from the rest of the cast, most notably the always reliably brilliant Christopher Walken playing the eccentric Morty. Not everything in the movie works perfectly. Some jokes fall flat, some dramatic moments don't grab you quite as much as they should. But most of it works, and works very well at that. Adam Sandler can make you laugh. Turns out he can tug on your heartstrings too. Who knew?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Honestly, this is one of Adam Sandler's better movies","Alright, I know this has been out for 18 years now and a lot of people have seen or at least heard about it, but for those who didn't, this review is for you.Click is probably one of the few Adam Sandler movies where he actually tries and doesn't just make it for crude humor and stupid jokes. Sure, it has some of his typical jokes that can be a bit dumb, but this has a bit of drama to it that actually is a little surprising for an Adam Sandler movie.The plot is about Michael Newman, played by Sandler, a workaholic father who tries to balance out his work life and his family life, but has a hard time doing so as he spends so much time at his job, which frustrates his wife, played by Kate Beckinsale. Then he comes across this inventor, played by Christopher Walken, who gives him a universal remote that allows Michael to skip over time. At first, Michael is fascinated with the remote's abilities as he can use it to skip over the stressful times, but soon realizes it takes over his life and begins skipping over several important moments in his life that he misses out on. Michael then realizes that he should've cherished all his moments with his family regardless of how stressful things have gotten.Now, I have to admit, the first time I saw this, I was quite surprised at how it was actually pretty decent. Like having some drama in an Adam Sandler-produced movie was not exactly something you would expect, but here it was done pretty well. The concept of balancing work and family was done well here and the moral of family coming first no matter how stressful life/work can get was presented rather well too. Yes, things do kind of get a bit dramatic towards the middle to the end for Michael Newman, but things do end up well as a result and leaves feeling grateful for your family and got to give credit for Adam and his team for presenting that well here (I won't say what exactly happens in the end, but that'll be something you have to see for yourself!).Also, the concept of a universal remote being used to change your life was pretty cool. Using it to fast forward through your life or edit things in your life was interesting and it makes you kind of wish that actually existed. However, at the same time, having a remote like that can have its flaws as skipping over moments in life will result in it automatically fast forwarding on its own and can lead to consequences and missing out on important moments in one's life and you can't go back to living them. So kudos to Adam and his team for pointing out that the best things can also be the most dangerous as well and sometimes, it's best to deal with what you have and not wish for something that'll take over you're life.So overall, I personally think this movie is one of Adam Sandler's better movies. Now it is still overall a comedy and has a lot of Adam's typical humor that does get a laugh out of you in my opinion (like Michael making jokes about his boss and a guy his wife meets later on, as well as a running gag with a stuffed duck and his dogs), but having the addition of drama was a nice touch and was done well too.Now true, the concept of Click does borrow quite a few plot elements of It's a Wonderful Life, but honestly, despite copying those plot lines, I thought it was done pretty well here and seeing them in one of Adam's movies was something different for him. Some people may not find it new and interesting, but to me, I still think it worked out pretty well here.So I know a lot of people probably saw Click by now, but if you haven't, I recommend you do because yes, it's another Adam Sandler movie and does contain his trademark sense of humor, but it really is one of the few he made where he tries to make it good and to me, he did it decently well for the most part here and I'd say you should give a chance and watch it for yourself. Plus, it's a good reminder to cherish moments with your family even if work can get a bit stressful, which is something that everyone should remember.So go see it!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A beautiful blend of comedy with drama-warning, if you have a heart, you will cry","Michael Newman has it all; a gorgeous wife that really loves him, two beautiful kids, a great home and a job he does well. Still he is not entirely satisfied with how his career is progressing and resents spending time away from big projects that might further him in the company.One night in a Bed Bath and Beyond, while looking for a universal remote for his TV, Michael runs into a guy named Morty. Morty is a bit odd, but gives Micheal the remote. Instead of being meant for a TV, this remote controls your life. Soon Michael is skipping life events that he dislikes and tries to only be present for the good parts.Before Michael understands what he has unleashed he is an old man, dying in a hospital and alone. Can he correct the error or his ways before he dies?Every damn time I watch this I cry. Why? Because it is so damn relatable. How many of us as kids could not wait to go to school? Then graduate so we can be adults and ""do whatever we want""? Then as adults, how many of us wish the work week would fly by, etc, etc, etc? Before you know it your kids are grown and you have lost a huge chunk of what little time we have on this planet. Watch this movie and learn something from it.

I think that we should all know by now that technical wizardry is not nearly enough and that audiences are smarter than what the smart ass marketing experts seem to think. Is this movie making money?

Rewatched it for 5th time in 2019,"I love this movie . I've been watching it since I was a child/teenager and I rewatched it now in my middle 20s and I still love it . It gets me so emotional every time .
It's a comedy with a deep meaning that has me feeling delighted and content every time I watch it. And I confess I cry near the end every time . It's not the ""ha ha"" type of comedy really. It's just a light hearted movie with a few jokes here and there and a good emotional message to pass to the viewers. One of my favorites .
The only reason I'm writing this review now so many years later is that I saw the 6.4 rating and I could not believe it . How is that even possible?

A bad movie,"I just returned from seeing this movie and I was not impressed. I found the humor crude and sophomoric...it appears the movie was aimed at an audience of 15-year old boys. The movie premise was good,but the writing quickly degenerated into cheap sex jokes and very little else. Total waste of money...I wonder how much money they had to throw at Christopher Walken to get him to damage his career by allowing himself to be associated with this forgettable piece of cinematic trash. I was not impressed by the inclusion of the questionable talents of David Hasselhoff and Henry Winkler...I suppose it is so difficult for such fringe talents to get offered quality work that they simply say ""yes"" to any script that they are presented. Considering the low standards demanded by the typical American movie-goer, this sorrowful film will probably make a great deal of money...that is a very sad commentary indeed.Summary: a bad movie...one star.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Really interesting concept, doesn't quite work as well as it could have done","I am not saying here that Click is a terrible movie, because it is not. But I couldn't help feeling minutely disappointed. I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan, though he has done some good work in some surprisingly good films.While Sandler was just about bearable here, even if his character wasn't particularly likable, the film didn't quite work for my tastes. Granted, it does have a very interesting concept. A work-aholic architect who acquires a remote control that allows him to fast forward through things that peeve him? Hmm, I like that idea, really I do.Some of the things that do happen:1. What do you do if your wife starts bitching? Zip past her.2. What do you do if a dog barks at you? Put him on mute.3. What do you do if your boss starts irritating you? Hit pause, and fart in his face many times.The concept of the story as I have said is a good one and is put to a decent amount of use. There were parts where I laughed, not many though, and there is an emotional core that does leave a lump in your throat at the end. The film is nice to look at and has a good soundtrack. Out of the supporting performances, David Hasselhoff looks as though he is having a lot of fun as the self-absorbed boss, and Christopher Walken does what he can with an underwritten role.However, while she looked stunning, Kate Beckinsale is wasted as the long-suffering wife. The script has its weak spots too as there are parts where the humour is overdone, leaving certain characters(especially Walken's) underdeveloped and card board. Also the direction was disappointingly lacking, and some parts did get quite silly or heavy-handed such as how the dogs behave. I also felt the film was a little too long, some scenes in the middle half didn't have to be as dragged out as they were.Overall, it has its moments, but doesn't quite work. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sandler spins his charm yet again,"CAST: ADAM SANDLER; KATE BECKINSALE AND CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.Adam Sandler is renowned for his irrepressible comedic genius. He possesses a rare talent consisting of an ensemble of slapstick buffoonery and egocentric satire. His formulaic comedies have spawned a generation of die-hard Sandler fans expecting nothing less than the pervasive wit and guile of Adam Sandler in full swing.In Click, Sandler plays Michael Newman a workaholic trying desperately trying to make partner in a successful firm. His demanding boss is adequately portrayed by David Hasselhoff. Sandler tries frantically to please his superior, but his efforts largely go unnoticed. The result is continual work dissatisfaction and mounting pressure on his home life.Sandler's wife is played by the exquisite Kate Beckinsale. To label her gorgeous would be doing her a grave injustice for she is the quintessential picture of beauty. She is the doting wife of an overworked architect and the attentive mother of two delightful children. The strain of her relationship with her husband is driving a wedge between them  that is until Sandler is gifted a universal remote.This is no ordinary remote though: it controls the passage of time and allows for a thorough revision of the past and a rapid transition into the future. What it doesn't allow for are changes to deeds already committed. The angel of death, who hands Sandler the remote, cautions him that the device is non-returnable.Naturally Sandler's curiosity is piqued and he begins toying with the quirky device. A series of humorous incidents ensue, but the comedy is hardly worth laughing at. The audiences remained largely quiet throughout the duration of the film, with the exception of the usual sexual innuendo and toilet humour which cracked a few smiles.The film goes off the rails for a while but just when it starts losing the audience; it utilizes drama to great effect to reel the crowds back in. Sandler is surprisingly effective in his dramatic performance. It is a detraction from the norm but one which will leave you teary eyed and heartbroken, until the final ten minutes of the film. Christopher Walken is a spectacle to behold in this dramatic comedy.This is a must-see Sandler film, not because the laughs come thick and fast, but because it is able to work on raw emotions so effectively. The concept of family and priorities are essential to the film and you are bound to be wiping the tears from your face in the last quarter.Two-thumbs up!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly well done.,"Isn't it so nice when a product that you expect to be mediocre turns out to be just that much better than expected? This is the case with click. After seeing trailers and most of Sandler's other characters, I had a pretty good picture of what was going to happen, but that picture turned out to be an incomplete one.Sandler plays Michael Newman, a bright young architect struggling to impress his boss (David Hasselhoff) and get the promotion that he has always dreamed about so he can live the life he has always wanted to live with his wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale) and two young children, Ben and Samantha. The first forty-five minutes or so was pretty much what I expected. It was entertaining. Funny, but not hysterical and not particularly memorable or thought provoking. A lot of time was spent on Newman learning to use his new toy, a remote, given to him by a mysterious man, Morty (Christopher Walken) working out of a lab in the back of Bed, Bath and Beyond, that controlled everything in his life. There was cheap physical humor such as the family dog humping a large stuffed duck. Then, suddenly, a little past the halfway point, things took a turn for the better. A film that could have continued down the path traveled by countless doofus comedies before it took a sincere, unexpected and heartfelt bend away from the stereotype. As his remote adapts to Newman's mannerisms, it begins fast-forwarding through events automatically. The ending of the movie, without giving away too much more of the plot, showcases a more serious side of Sandler. Think 'Punch-Drunk Love' and you'll get the idea. He manages to grab you by the heart and pull you deeper into this already interesting film.All throughout, 'Click' is wonderfully entertaining, and it managed to pull me into it like few films this year have. It manages to blend both sides of Adam Sandler well. It isn't just a good Adam Sandler movie, it is a good movie. Period.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Fun, derivative idea engages with universal theme","This easy concept of a movie will keep casual movie fans engaged with it's silly exploitation of Sandler's newfound abilities to manipulate the space time continuum. The initial concept gets a full workout and technical buffs can gawk at the simple yet effective editing that goes along with showing how this character sees his world, through his control. Obviously the moral ramifications of such unnatural bastardization's comes at a price, which slowly paints the arc of this story with more serious, dramatic colors. To say that this movie is a unique idea however would be a joke, as derivations linking up to just about every other time traveling morality tale are abound but in the end, whether you enjoyed the goofy site gags or the melodramatic buildup more, the overall message this movie wishes to convey (which could be argued far outweighs the actual material) should stick. This philosophy that the main character came to speak of was a perfect way at translating through more zen-like nods to the ""moment"" then most mainstream American films have the patience of realizing. Kudos to Click for making the case for this frame of mind without having for one minute to act it out pretentiously on screen, this is how you do NOT just preach to the choir.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Can't Get Away From Its Uncertain Genre,"15 October 2006. This movie can't decide whether it's a comedy or a drama or both. The commendable ambitions of Adam Sandler to continue to expand his acting roles can't escape the director's pull back into the dumb comedy that Sandler has been relegated to many times. The ending portion of the film is representative of how good the movie could have been only to be vacuumed back into the predictable stereotypical ""It's a Wonderful Life"" fantasy. With a better writer and more careful direction, the premise of this movie along with Adam Sandler could have been one of the breakthrough movies of the year. Yet, unfortunately, while the creative spark and special effects are fun and entertaining, this movie was stuck in the summer fun category instead of Oscar award quality.

Just when I thought I could like an Adam Sandler film...,"I have tried... honest, I have tried to like Adam Sandler. Granted he was on SNL and when you think of the quality of that program lately, that's not saying much.And I've tried to watch several of his movies including Punch Drunk Love and none of them have ever done anything for me. Now, there is one more to add to the list... Click.Any time I get to look at Kate Beckinsale usually makes the rest of any bad movie go away. But not even her beauty could overcome the rest of this stinko.It started with the dog humping the oversize stuffed duck... and then again... and then again. And then remark by Donna about the repairs needed to the duck. And then came the ultimate insult to my movie going sense... the ""fart joke"".I don't know why anyone over 12 in the movie industry won't come to the realization that ANYONE can do ""fart jokes"". They are the most common form of humor because anyone can do them. And if that is the range of your comedy, whether it is ""The Family Guy"" writers or Adam Sandler, then you are pretty limited. I have now seen Adam Sandler urinating against a building, farting in someone's face, beating up an old man (Bob Barker) and making fun of someone with a disability (Carl Weathers). Is there no limit to how low Adam Sandler can go with his humor? Take a look at Robin Williams... at least he balances out his ""potty"" humor with something worthwhile every now and again like ""The Fisher King"" or ""Awakenings"" or ""Midnight Sun"". And Steve Martin can go for hours without one ""fart joke"". But not Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider or any of the lot of ""new comedians"". It is as old and thread worn as wearing a dress and thinking that no one since Uncle Miltie has done it.I couldn't even watch the end of this movie. I had to turn it off. It makes my list of 10 worst movies, which is now populated by at least 4 Adam Sandler movies; ""Little Nikita"", ""Big Daddy"", ""Happy Gilmore"" and now ""Click"".I just ain't cut out for this ""new comedy"" stuff.

Sandler needs more work on adult comedy routines...,"This is not a bad movie. In fact, I rather enjoyed it. But, in my mind, this is strike three for Sandler, as far as adult comedy goes. He tried (and failed) in ""Spanglish,"" before retreating to what he knows best ""The Longest Yard,"" which, in my mind, just made it all the worse. If Sandler would pick a line of comedy and STICK to it, he would be on the track, but he's all over the place.Sandler plays an architect with a family that is expecting just as much time from him as his boss is, who is holding a promotion to partner over his head. In the course of his daily life, even the little things seem to get to him, like all the remotes sitting on the coffee table and opening the garage door and turning on the ceiling fan when all he does is turn on the television to find some cartoons for his kids to watch.Out to blow off some steam, he turns to a department store to find a universal remote, where he meets Walken, who supplies him with a remote that can control everything around his life, including people, places, and things, not just the television, ceiling fan, and garage door.7 out of 10 is what I gave this film, because I really did enjoy it. I got lost in the movie, so I didn't really find myself thinking how it would end. Not bad, theatrically, but could have used some fine tuning in the end.

There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in ""Click"" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh.

Loved it... every minute,"""Click"" is about a harried workaholic architect, Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) who doesn't have time for his family. Wishing for a way to make his life easier, Michael encounters a quirky sales clerk (Christopher Walken), who gives him a remote that allows Michael to fast-forward and rewind to different parts of his life. Complications arise and hilarity ensues as the remote gradually starts overruling Michael's choices.The previews for ""Click"", at least from the previews I've seen, make it out to look like a comedy and nothing but. So naturally, I went into the film expecting to see Adam Sandler make an idiot out of himself.What I got was something entirely not what I was expecting.Sure, there are a few elements of standard Sandler fare, like the farting and the dog humping. But when it took a turn for the serious, that's when the film's message is hammered home, and Sandler's skills as an actor really shine. It was hard fighting back the tears at some parts.Of course, Sandler couldn't have done it without an exceptional supporting cast. Kate Beckinsale was excellent in her role as Michael's wife, Donna. And Christopher Walken was great as always as the eccentric Bed Bath & Beyond sales clerk.""Click"" is funny. Maybe not as funny as Sandler's other movies, but funny nonetheless. It's also a very powerful, emotional, and moving film. Definitely one of Adam Sandler's best, if not the best. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good laugh, but also likes really well done drama. You won't be disappointed.10/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad,"This movie had some humor but I feel the generic family stuff overrode it. And the generic family plot wasn't even that good or interesting. It was barely developed throughout the movie. In bits and pieces it was but throughout, no.Adam Sandler looked sort of out of it during the movie. He brought more energy to his earlier comic roles (Billy Madison, Happy Gillmore) in the mid 90s.Not a recommended movie.The advertisement of this movie was also bad. It focused on the remote too much and it made the movie seem like a Rob Schneider (insert random dumb role) movie, except instead of a random dumb role it was just ""look, now Adam Sandler has a remote control, see what he can do"" movie.

Pushing Buttons.,"An architect (Adam Sandler) with pressures aplenty from work and a general lack of time unwittingly solves his problem by getting a remote control that can literally control his universe. The remote is given by a mysterious man (Christopher Walken ala Christopher Lloyd in the ""Back to the Future"" series) and it comes equipped with all the features, but these features go way beyond just manipulating the boob tube. Immediately the device becomes a prevalent part of Sandler's life as he is able to fast forward through mundane parts of his life and also make potential difficult feats go by in a matter of seconds. But what happens when the great power gets abused and the device takes on a life of its own, making decisions to fast forward by itself as Sandler just becomes an unfortunate spectator in his own life? Amazingly impressive feature that markets itself as a typical summer comedy, but is that and so much more. More dramatic than comical, ""Click"" is a curious over-achiever that is best-described as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""A Christmas Carol"" without the holiday season settings. Throughout Sandler is presented with choices and unfortunately he has to prioritize his life and of course the pressures of work (represented primarily by boss David Hasselhoff) sometimes overshadow the time that his family (wife Kate Beckinsale, their children and parents Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner) rightfully deserves. Director Frank Coraci (best known for light weight Sandler vehicles like ""The Waterboy"" and ""The Wedding Singer"") shows real growth as a filmmaker as he handles the deceptively heartfelt script with style and flair. Wonderfully clever, well-executed, entertaining and life-affirming, ""Click"" is one of the more pleasant cinematic surprises of recent memory. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Click... a good flick,"I'm an Adam Sandler fan in general and I expected nothing but a quality production in the movie ""Click"". I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. ""Click"" triggered a lot more than just laughter. Click was a thought provoking piece that any working family man or woman can relate to. Many of us would love to fast-forward, rewind, or pause certain things in life, but what if it happened automatically? What if you were automatically fast-forwarded through all of the nuisances and stresses in your life: just how much would you miss? ""Click"" deals with just that, and of course Adam Sandler does it in comedic fashion. This is a decent movie with a good message, a movie everyone can learn from.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Adam Sandler will be Adam Sandler,"I really should give up hoping that this man will ever make a movie as good and different from his usual work as ""Punch Drunk Love"" again. Of course, I wasn't expecting anything like this when I went into ""Click"". I just hoped that Sandler's style of comedy may have changed a bit over the years. Unfortunately, it didn't. Sandler is still painfully underacting and mostly unfunny.The premise of this movie is a good one for 90 minutes of light fun. It could have been another fantasy/comedy classic about a guy who needs to be refined in the vein of ""Groundhog Day"", ""Scrooged"" or even the sub-standard ""Family Man"". Sandler just happened to step in and re-defines ""light"" as ""undemanding"" and ""vulgar"". People get farted in the face, kicked in the balls and the ever so horrible Rob Schneider makes his obligatory cameo appearance. That's not the way it should have gone down.To be fair, though, it isn't just Sandler's fault that this movie is so disappointing. The script is a huddle. It starts of too quickly, the characters don't really work together - starting from Sandler's way too beautiful wife to his way too idiotic boss - and finally the movie gets inappropriately dramatic in the end.On the plus side, Christopher Walken delivers once again as the funniest thing in an otherwise horrible comedy. (When will he finally treat his career with some respect again?) It's always good to have David Hasslehoff in a movie, too, but just having him alone isn't funny per se. However, that's apparently what the makers of ""Click"" thought, since Hasslehoff's character is extremely uninteresting.As gooey as it may be, I do like the main message of the movie. The metaphor with the pot of gold was nice and the way Christopher Walken's character told it throughout the movie was really haunting.""Click"" doesn't quite deliver, but there are different scales on which Adam Sandler movies suck and at least this one was on the upper half.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A funny and touching crowd pleaser,"At this point in his career, Adam Sandler has proved to the American audience that he can star in films without his character being mentally challenged or handicapped in some way, as in Little Nicky or The Waterboy. Had this been realized earlier, we may not have been subjected to those flaming bags of trash.But 'Click' is quite possibly the most pleasant surprise of 2006. The premise is not particularly inspiring. Sandler is Michael, a hard-working man who is trying to get promoted to a partner position in his architectural company. This is much to the dismay of his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and his two children, who believe Michael no longer have time for them. In search of a universal remote control for his TV, stereo, fan, etc., Michael wanders into the 'Beyond' section of a Bed, Bath, and Beyond store. He finds Morty, played by the always entertaining Christopher Walken, who gives him a universal remote control. After taking it home, Michael soon discovers that it is literally a 'universal' remote control. He can pause moments in his life, fast forward through the fights and work, and relive past memories.With this premise in mind, most people would surely think this film will be funny occasionally, but in the end it will be predictable and sappy, and lessons will be forced on us that we've already heard a million times before. 'Click' is often very funny, even hilarious. But the last thing 'Click' should be referred to is predictable.'Click' often bounces back and forth between funny and moving, which is not always a bad thing. In this case, it creates a very good balance that will keep you entertained for the duration of the film. It is sure to tickle your senses the way 'It's A Wonderful Life' did, the film 'Click' is loosely based off of. Being touched by an Adam Sandler film is a brand new experience, but nevertheless, it is more than welcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One great summer tear-jerker comedy,"This movie reminds you some what of the movie ""Family Man"". It's about an overworking husband who tries to please his wife and 2 kids but finds out the true meaning of life- the hard way. Usually knowing Adam Sandler you expect a laugh-out-loud comedy- well you did get that- but there were also some scenes where i held my hand to my mouth and just said, ""Oh My GOSH."" Walking out of the movie theater I really started thinking about my life because if I ever had to go through what Adam Sandler's character went through it would not be fun.But basically, watching the film or not- remember that life is short so you better make every minute of it worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Excellent feel-good movie,"A very underrated movie. You don't often hear people talk about Click, while in my opinion it's a classic. Maybe this movie isn't universally loved because humor is subjective. The style of humor in this movie is goofy and in your face. Nothing subtle and while I found it hilarious and was laughing throughout the movie, this might not be appealing to others. So maybe this is a movie you either love or hate.There's also an important life lesson. It was powerful and made this movie not just be a good movie but a great movie. What they did right is that the drama didn't get the overhand in the movie with the risk of becoming preachy. The movie is playful for the most part so even if has heavy moments it's mostly a feel-good movie. Overall just a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sadler's best effort,"Yes, that's not saying much. Adam Sadler hardly deals in 'high-brow' comedies. And, basically, this isn't one either. However, it does easily kill an hour and a half.It's a 'one-joke' movie. Sadly is given a magical remote control which can pause, rewind and fast-forward time (and much, much more). This, therefore, leads him into all sorts of trouble.Luckily, Sadly is surrounded by a talented cast which frequently take the pressure off him to be the film's sole attraction. Christopher Walken is - as you might expect - excellent as the man who gives him the remote (and frequently pops up throughout the movie).There's not a lot of 'meat' to this movie - it's just one to munch popcorn to. Personally, I would have preferred if the film ended about ten minutes before it did - but that's just me being cynical - you'll have to judge for yourself.It's nothing perfect, but then it has Adam Sadler in, so what are you expecting? If it's watchable, it's definitely one of his best (I'm still reeling from forcing myself to sit through twenty minutes of 'Jack and Jill.')",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mildly entertaining but not original,"Too bad the movie isn't that original. Throughout the movie, I kept trying to remember where I had read a similar storyline but it kept evading me. Then, recently, my daughter picked up her R.L. Stine book called ""30 Tales to Give You Goosebumps"" and announced that there is a short story in it called ""Click"". She read it to me (I read it to her sometime ago first) and both of us were amazed at the similarities. In Stine's ""Click"" story there is a kid named Seth Gold whose dad (not surprisingly) brings home a universal remote that allows him to replay, fast forward, mute and slow mo' real life at his home, school and with his friends. I actually found R.L. Stine's ""Click"" to be more amusing than the movie, but then again, Goosebumps movies are pretty darn scary - even if they ARE supposed to be just for kids!!!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
contrast,"Another simple and highly used formula for Hollywood comedy: a simple, supposedly deep, honest sincere, moral issue: you have to seize the journey, living is the most important thing, don't choose work and success over your family.Than you add a device that allows you to move further and explain the morals, in this case a remote which controls time development, and which allows you to move forward and back in time, and eventually making you loose control (he uses preferences).Than, Sandler, who is supposed to make it work. Well, i don't give much for his comedy skills, with few exceptions. But even for those who enjoy his best performances, i think this may stay a couple meters below what he can deliver.Comedy and Drama can be a very powerful mixture in the right hands. Chaplin may have invented the notion, and is probably the absolute master of the genre to these days. It's something that is based in high contrasts, therefore enhancing the drama bits. If it is well driven, it can tear you a part: the filmmaker makes you laugh out loud, enjoy yourself with the ""frivolities"" of life, and than, suddenly, or gradually, you're pushed into a narrow abyss of sadness, which is enhanced by your previous state of joy. Contrast. Well, these guys didn't do it, they weren't close to it.My opinion: 1/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not exactly what you're expecting, but does it work?","If you want to enjoy this movie then you must first willingly undergo a major suspension of disbelief.""Why, because of the supernatural aspects of Sandler's ability to control his life like it was a DVD or TiVo?""No, because it's completely unbelievable that any man would want to fast forward through massaging Kate Beckinsale or having ""marital relations"" with her. Movie or not. I made this comment as we were filing out of the theater, and Mr. Shade acted like it was a plausible idea, replying, ""Well, maybe if you had to do it over 100 times.""Balderdash. IT'S KATE BECKINSALE! I'm willing to step up to the plate and test this theory (with Stephanie's permission, of course). We'll call it the ""Kate Beckinsale Massage Challenge."" After massage #101 I'll let you know if Sandler's desire to fast forward through it is anywhere near believable. I'm willing to do this for all you readers out there. All for the sake of improved believability in our movies. Drop me a line, Kate. This is all in the name of science; I promise.""That's great, Johnny. You'll never hear from her, delusional boy, so how about the movie?""Oh, right, the movie. Thanks for reminding me. I guess I should point out that I'm an Adam Sandler fan. A fan who has learned to forgive him for Little Nicky and a fan who thinks Punch-Drunk Love is mystifyingly overrated, but a fan nonetheless. That being said, I enjoyed the movie. I was entertained. Is it great? No. Is it in the upper echelon of his work? Nope. Could Kate Beckinsale just stand there motionless on screen for 90 minutes and send me home with a smile on my face? Oh yeah.There are moments when the crudeness is overdone (seriously, how many times can you show a dog humping a stuffed animal before you realize it stopped being funny about 40 minutes ago?) and apparently I'm one of the few people left in the world who doesn't think little kids cussing is adorable (yeah, I'm sure you'd giggle if it were YOUR child dropping ""s"" bombs), but the film still managed to coerce a good number of out-loud laughs from me.I'm not gonna sit here and wax poetic about what I would do if I came across a remote that could control my life. That'd be a waste of my time and yours. However, I found it interesting to watch Sandler as he made his decisions in regard to this little technical wonder. I especially liked the menu and its special features - including a commentary track with James Earl Jones. Funny stuff.Sandler movies, by their very nature, are quite easy to review. Do you hate the guy? Then skip it. If you love the majority of his work then you'll have a good time. However, I feel it's my duty to warn you that Click is a little different than what you might expect.In an effort to show it ain't just a one-trick pony (and probably to appeal to a broader audience), Click takes a strange dramatic turn about 2/3rds of the way through, and it stays pretty serious for a good 20 minutes or so. Fan base be warned. The teenagers in the crowd started to get restless as they were obviously desperate for Sandler to hurry up and say something like, ""Gippity bop simmidy doo.""References to It's a Wonderful Life are accurate, though I feel it taps more into A Christmas Carol complete with Christopher Walken as the Ghost of Really Bad Hairdos. Some of the dramatic aspects are handled well, albeit with little originality, but things got a little too solemn for my taste, especially since I was in the mood for something purely comedic. Much like the majority of people who give speeches at wedding receptions, it tries just a little too hard to wrestle out the tears. Sandler's attempt at crying is particularly unconvincing.I'm sure there's a section of you who will ignore the predictability of it all and appreciate the fact that Sandler is trying to show a little maturity these days, and that's fine. I'm just pointing out that the transition in tone is awkward, and the drama overstays its welcome. Take some lessons from Liar Liar on how to add dramatic elements and life-changing revelations while remaining consistently funny.The bottom line, America, is Click will have quite the mixed reaction, even among Sandler's staunchest fanboys. Can you handle the dramatic shift? Will you buy into it? Can you tolerate the sometimes juvenile and sophomoric humor on display? I've equipped you with the necessary knowledge; it's now up to you to make your choice.Oh, and did I mention that Kate Beckinsale isn't too harsh on the eyes? Can't remember if I did or not so I wanted to make sure I pointed that out.THE GISTIf you can't stand Adam Sandler then I have no idea why you'd wonder if you should see Click or not. If you're a fan of the Sand Man then chances are you'll be entertained, but reactions to the dramatic tone shift will be very mixed. Don't expect Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining... wish it was better though,"I tried not to expect too much out of this movie. The plot was very simple, a man uses a remote control to control his universe, but his life starts to change once the remote control uses its memory to program itself to what it thinks are Michael's (Adam Sandler's) preferences. We knew that this was going to be interesting, but newest Adam Sandler movies are not as glorious as everyone provoked them to be.I was pretty surprised by this movie however. As decently funny as it was, there was a lot of drama thrown in there also (especially towards the end). The dramatic scenes really showed how this movie was unlike the previous line of Happy Madison movies, so it will tend to stick out. The comedy was good but not as much as I would have liked; a few key lines stick out. I thought overall it was enjoyable and entertaining, a good time waster if you will.Probably the best it could have been, so I can't ask for much more. 6 out of 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But with all the crude comments and the above mentioned scenes I can not recommend this film especially to anyone under 15 and I would not recommend it for anyone over 60 as I know both sets of parents would be very much put off.The basic story line of what happens when you become consumed with your job at the expense of the family is a good story and has a lot of merit in its own right.

"Refreshing comedy gags meets heartfelt, reflective story to appreciate life's little details",Going in to this movie I expected to have the normal 2 hour thoughtless escape from everyday life that these type movies normally deliver. Instead I laughed. I even cried. I left pleasantly surprised. Leaving the theatre I couldn't help reflect upon the need to really appreciate life's little moments and close friends and family more. Walken was outstanding. Sandler was effective and really funny in his toned down approach to this more intelligent comedy than the usual Sandler fare. Kate Beckinsale is very lovable as the wife and mother of his children and Hasslehoff couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the cluelessly self-absorbed exec/ boss. I liked it a lot and I'm not normally one to feel either way about these type of movies.

"It just doesn't  ""Click"" for me","Sure, it's a fine melodrama, but I expected more comedy. I know that this movie really deals more with morals, but we already got the message halfway through the film. Now don't get me wrong, all the performances by Adam Sandler, Kate Bekinsale, Christopher Walkin, David Hasselhoff, et al are wonderful, but this movie just wasn't what I expected it all to be. I was hoping that Adam's character's journey would be more of a funny try to pull everything together. There was too much sadness in this movie, and even you get confused as to what had happened in the fast-forwarded time. Early on, the comedy was right on key, but after that, drama took over, and very limited humor occurred from there on out.

A  surprisingly good film,"Yes the critics slammed it. It actually got to me eventually, after seeing enough of ""A surefire box office flop"" and ""Sandler's worst movie"", I was swayed, to put it lightly. It didn't help that Sandler's last few movies were about entertaining as watching paint dry (Not to mention as monotonous as Ben Stein reading you to bed). But most of all, they weren't funny, nor did they bring anything to the table. I swore never to see a Sandler movie again (at least until it came out on DVD. I couldn't take disappointment after disappointment). Click intrigued me, however, despite my promise, and despite the critics, I was interested. My friend suggested we go see it and I hesitantly said yes. I went to the movie expecting the worst, what I got was one of the better movies I have seen in a very long time. The movie will not make your sides split, but it did have moments, all a comedy needs is moments to make it successful, and these moments of hilarity were funny enough to keep the first half of the movie afloat. The second half was actually a touching story, it jerked a few tears from my eyes. The thing you must do is go into this movie not expecting a GREAT movie, because then you will be disappointed. Expect a decent movie and you will find a very good movie. I was charmed by click, I liked it a lot, I would see it again, and I am not a huge fan of Sandler anymore. So see Click and experience the wide array of emotions that it makes you feel in this insightful, if not completely compelling story.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Heartwarming un Sandler like Adam Sandler film,"Click was one of the more popular of Adam Sandler's films which was a hit among the general public and that's because this is not a typical Sandler comedy. There are gags and jokes but the tone is serious and by the end of the film it turns into a tear-jerker. Click accomplishes what it sets out to do: tell an occasionally amusing, occasionally affecting drama about how adults often lose sight of what matters. Click works because Sandler doesn't throw out the drama in a quest for laughs. There are times when the comedian falls back on his typical shtick, but the film doesn't shy away from the darkness inherent in this kind of story, and it has a heart. Sandler is Scrooge in the last act of A Christmas Carol and George Bailey in the last act of It's a Wonderful Life, and he does justice to those who have preceded him down this path by using the template and reapplying it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
the perfect universe to control,"On one level, ""Click"" is the typical Adam Sandler movie, with him as a nervous every-man who explodes when it befits the situation. However, there is more here. Some reviews have said that this is basically the same sort of thing as ""Bruce Almighty"", how he gets an unusual power but discovers that it isn't exactly what he expected. I guess that it's true - right down to his relationships with everyone - but if it was just 98 minutes of complete silliness, wouldn't that just be a total repeat of most such movies? As for what specifically happens in the movie, the way that Michael Newman (Sandler) gets to control his surroundings is done sort of like a DVD, what with start, stop, rewind, forward, commentary (by James Earl Jones) and even different languages. Christopher Walken is especially neat as the guy who gives him the remote control, but when does Christopher Walken not bring an interesting presence to a movie? And overall, the movie is a good lesson about the importance of family over career...even if they use some goofy things to show it (e.g., the part about Michael Jackson).So, overall, director Frank Coraci - who previously directed Adam Sandler in ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""The Waterboy"" - created a really perceptive look at life in general. I recommend it. Also starring Kate Beckinsale, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner and David Hasselhoff.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Modern Day ""It's a Wonderful Life""","I really enjoyed this movie. Sometimes Adam Sandler's comedy is a little too low-brow for me, but he hit a good ""Happy (Madison) medium"" in ""Click."" The premise of the movie is that Adam Sandler's character (Michael) has, somehow in the course of his adult life, lost the realization that he is striving for something he has always had. He has a beautiful wife and two cute, loyal, lovable children, but this isn't enough - he thinks he also has to have the high prestige and high salary that comes with a promotion at his architectural firm. Throw in the acquisition of a truly ""universal"" remote (that comes with some humorous special effects), a kick-ass soundtrack, and you have ""Click."" The ensemble of actors in this film is really impressive: Henry Winkler, Christopher Walken, Rachel Dratch, Sean Astin, David Hasselhoff (who has a great comedic touch in his role). I was especially impressed with Jake Hoffman, who plays the 20-something version of Michael's son Ben. Not only does Hoffman look like Sandler, he also has some of his facial expressions and voice quirks down to a ""T."" I would recommend this film. It had me almost crying at times, but the majority of the time I was laughing out loud. Some of the funniest scenes in the film feature Michael's relationship with the neighbor kid, and pretty much every scene with Hasselhoff. I am surprised this film didn't receive better reviews by movie critics.P.S. Walken's character's name (Morty) seems to be chosen for a reason. Those who know French may figure it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good topic ... Adam Sandler's best performance ... typical realization,"Sincerely, i don't like the films of Adam Sandler. This is an exception, but maybe a wrong exception. Because the performances of ""Click"" are great, maybe the best performance of Adam Sandler, the topic of the plot are fabulous and well made. Besides a nostalgic message.

And this make just acceptable the movie.The story talks about the love of the family, the dominance of the work and the complications of the new technologies in a man. A man that after the ambition, he recognizes their errors. We all have a opportunity. This is the message of ""Click"". And is beautiful.

A lot of the time people that write comments will judge a film without seeing it and it gives the film a bad name. Ignore what you hear about this film and take a look, I'm sure you will be surprised with it also. Adam Sandler has shown that he is capable of playing a serious character in contrast o the aggressive and funny character he normally plays in his film, Click is no different, Sandler is both funny and serious at the right moments, Kate Bekinsale is great as Donna his wife, and Christopher Walken is excellent as always as Morty, the Bed, Bath and Beyond Employee. David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, and Jennifer Coolidge are funny in their supporting roles in this film. Australian audiences expecting to see Sophie Monk in a major role will be disappointed as she is honestly a very minor character in the film, in contrast to what the Comedy Chanel is running about her on Foxtel/Austar.All in all I do recommend seeing this film, if not to learn a valuable lesson about priorities in life, but to have a laugh and to enjoy a film that is better than what was expected of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice little moral lesson,"What starts out as a basic, yet toned down, goofy, predictable comedy evolves into a nice and touching story about family and life. Adam Sandler earns himself some more plus points to make up for movies like ""The Longest Yard"" and the distressingly un-funny movies of his acting dawn.With a nice supporting cast, Kate Beckinsale, Sean Astin, David Hasselhoff, it's easy to predict the movie will be friendly and cheery and a bit funny. Thanks to adding Christopher Walken to the mix, things get funnier and at the same time a bit darker, like adding contrast to a digital photo.Walken's role is cool, he talks and walks cool, and he squeezes in a little dance scene(check!). He's a nice counterweight for all the cheery, wholesome characters. Thanks to the script, the story never get's too sentimental and never to cutesy. It keeps it at a good level over-all.So when the movie is over, you feel good. That's the point, it's a feel-good movie. And of all the feel-good movies out there, this one doesn't patronize it's audience. Thumbs up for that. There are still some bits with childish and low humour, but one gets the feeling Sandler is getting too old for it and that he's in a transitional state.

Some parts you want to fast forward in this movie,"This was a okay film, just not Adam Sandler's best. It just felt like they could have done more with the power to rewind, stop and fast forward time, cause it was mostly used for cheap gags which aren't even that funny and at the end it finishes off with sentimental stuff that sort of drags. The movie has a moral about how time is important and should not be put to waste and that there is value in the good times and the bad times of our lives, which was fine. So it was a nice comedy, just not a great one, cause when the credits start to roll it's not that satisfying and mediocre at best, it just wasn't that creative or engaging. Every other cast members did a good job, just wasn't noteworthy or anything. The thought that Adam Sandler's character is married to Kate Beckinsale's character wasn't believable either, he just didn't have a good personality and just came off as obnoxious and childish.

It looks very high tech, surreal and dream like. Adam Sandler in the obese make up was also very well done.The concept of the film is new and fresh. I also like the fact that it has also some unexpected touching moments towards the end.This film is excellent entertainment!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Charming entry on a well trodden path.,"Michael Newman is overworked and under appreciated by his boss, worse still, he doesn't have enough hours in the day to devote time to his loving family. But then he happens upon eccentric salesman Morty, who puts a universal remote control Michael's way, a control that perfectly controls his life.......at first.Films that deal with second chances via gods, angels and devils are not in short supply, everything from the mighty It's A Wonderful Life, to the amiable Mr Destiny have covered this fantastical field. Enter Click, starring Adam Sandler {Newman}, another spin on the genre with the added kick of encompassing modern day technology into the equation. Split very much into two vastly different halves, Click finds Sandler reining in his usual shouty goof ball persona. Naturally for the first part we get the comedy set ups, at times hilarious and at others a little crass, but it's never sledgehammer comedy of the like that Sandler has previously served up in spades. The reason for the restraint becomes evident when the films second half arrives, full of emotional fortitude it's something of a shock at first to grasp the switch in tone, but it works real well, and it's testament to Sandler's straight acting ability that he manages to sway the viewer into this fantastical realm.Click is no genius piece of work, and for the genre it tackles it's probably some way short of being up with the best. It does however punch the right buttons. From Sandler and a highly accomplished supporting cast {Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, Sean Astin and Henry Winkler}, to its delightful and rewarding finale, this most definitely is one that is worth punching play on your remote control for. Whilst the credit sequences and soundtrack hit the spot as well, give it a go if you get the chance. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

the film idea maybe not that much but it's so true; our life is some clicks, sometimes we want to skip some bad or minor events to avoid pain or to reach our goals quickly okay that's all fine; but where is the fun in that; Life is worth living even it's hard times we should live it to know from it what is the important things and decide our priorities but always the family, friends comes always at first place; I like the end so much; it could be ended sadly but the writer was very good; I think this will be one of my top comedy films ever.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Clean would have made this a family classic,"The story was interesting, even if the ending was predictable. This film couldn't seem to decide whether it was realistic or a big, live-action cartoon. The real disappointment for me was all the needless profanity, especially from the kids. The crude bathroom humor was unnecessary and only detracted from what could have been one of those deeply moving ""It's a Wonderful Life"" movies. If one can overlook all the stinking bits of garbage that are constantly flung at the audience throughout this film, then one can still appreciate the positive, ""do the right thing"" message.Christopher Walken's character Morty was perfectly quirky, and was not comically over the top, as many of the supporting roles were played.

"You know the saying ""Time flies by fast when you're having fun""? Well, that's not working for Adam Sandler.","I was really excited to see Click, it got so many great reviews, including some from my friends who just loved this movie. So, I was looking forward to the rental, because let's be honest, this movie was one of those you'd save your money for. But still, even though I wasn't expecting too much, this turned into a wonderful movie that we all can relate too. It kind of reminded me of the story ""A Christmas Carol"", except no Christmas, and updated into a remote, I'm sure most would agree.See, Adam is having a hard time spending time with his family because of his hectic work schedule, but when he bumps into a man who sells him a universal remote, he discovers that this remote controls EVERYTHING in his life, including his family and friends. He just plays at first by fast forwarding fights with his wife or chores, not to mention having fun at work making fun of his boss. But it gets serious when he doesn't want to deal with time and decides to fast forward to a promotion at work that takes him a year past his life, not to mention, the remote breaks and keeps fast forwarding him to the future unintentionally.Life moves by pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.-Ferris Bueller. It's so true when it comes to this movie and how precious our time is with our friends and family. Sometimes we do need to slow down and make sure we truly appreciate what little time we have.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly touching,"This movie surprised us. We cried. Yes, we cried. The trailer barely tells you what the movie is about. There were some unfunny dumb things having to do with dogs, etc. (no one in the theater laughed much) and some cheeseball stuff, but the emotional core of the movie delivers a wallop that is unexpected. Along the lines of a sort of combination of ""Family Man"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" -- more ""Family Man"" -- this movie didn't just bring tears to eyes, it makes you cry. Because of that, I liked it and give it a thumbs up. The annoying stuff is a relatively small price to pay for the lessons the core stuff teaches. Lastly, Kate Beckinsdale (the epitome of domestic beauty in this movie) is absolutely a dream and the actress that played her grown daughter had eyes that matched -- well done. Enough said.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Horrid.,"This movie is the worst Adam Sandler movie yet. Like most movies in this generation (which is hard for me to say since I am part of this new generation) this movie was crammed full with inappropriate jokes.Take your pick. Sex,farts,groin kicks,boobs, man-boobs and bowel movements. Its all in there. The writing is so predictable at times you can almost say the line before they do. Sandler's over the top acting is alright when it comes to comedy but he is sorely lacking when it comes to drama.The only positive aspect is Kate Beckinsale who do any part well. You can see the ending coming before you even start the beginning. Utterly predictable, this Christmas carol-esquire story leaves much to be desired.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't be fooled by the high IMDb user rating,"This is a poor film. I never write in but it was such a bad film I felt I had to write and warn people, especially after seeing the high rating. I always thought users here were a tough audience, but then taste is subjective. Kate Beckinsale looked very uncomfortable and Adam Sandler gave a very lazy performance for most of it. I don't know why, but to me, it seemed that they didn't get on very well. Christopher Walken, as usual, delivers, but he should have know better than to be involved with this. One to watch was the young Ben played by Jake Hoffman, yes, son of Dustin. He looked promising with a nothing part.

"Great, Must See!","Michael is an average day guy that finds life unfair but then asks someone at a store for a universal remote control. Morty then gives Michael a average looking control. Michael, obvously thinking this is just a remote for the television goes back home and then discovers it can change colour of people, turn their volume up or down, fast forward/rewind, pause, make them speak different languages, etc.. Not long into the story he begins to fast forward things he doesn't like such as work, traffic, fights with his wife, backrub (but he discovers backrubs always lead to sex with his wife which causes him to miss sex). Then every time one of those things comes up it automatically fastfowards through that event, leading Michael through years and years of his life and he is doomed unless he does something about it...First of all let me say this film was brilliant.

Click could use its own remote to fast forward some parts.,"There comes a time in every comedian's career, where they say to themself, ""Self, how will I be remembered? Have I made a difference? Am I just a big, life long fart joke?"" This film is Adam Sandler's atonement, for a career filled with body gags and yelling sprees, temper tantrums and booby jokes.""Click"" is Sandler's attempt at ""It's a Wonderful Life"", a Scrooge tale of life's past, present and future. He has created a story meant to make movie goers feel like they must live their lives in the present, enjoy their kids, take care of their health and relationships, and not let work run/ruin your life. And if you don't mind the telegraphed plot line, you might enjoy watching it unfold.i've always been a passive Sandler fan. i enjoy his two second sight gags and cameo appearances by friends Rob Schneider and John Turtorro. i also enjoy his angry rants and screaming insults. This film, though definitely trying to be more grown up and appeal to a wider audience, still offers those tidbits of Sandler past. (i especially liked the young Asian boy at the start of the film--talk about getting comedic mileage from such an insignificant role).However, as the film progresses, Sandler does what cinematic history has seen from the likes of Robin Williams and Jim Carrey, and tries to put some dramatic weight into the film. Unfortunately, the plot is so predictable and obvious, that it would have been nice if he had put an ironic spin on the age old morality tale.Don't get me wrong. i have complete trust and faith in Sandler's ability to take an everyman role and run with it. His brilliant turn in ""Punch Drunk Love"" is proof of that. Yet, as Sandler's star slowly turns towards the funny drama, as opposed to a dramatic comedy, his off-beat schtick loses its lustre.What normally makes a film like this work, is a supporting cast that is just as willing to provide an impact in glimpses of the lead's past, present and future, and unfortunately Kate Beckinsale, Sean Astin, and Henry Winkler are mere charactatures for Sandler to act upon. Only Christopher Walken manages to steal scenes, though this should surprise no one.I applaud Sandler for not resting on his past formula, while still giving fans a little of what they've come to appreciate from him. It's too bad that he wasn't able to give us a glimpse as to the future of the Scrooge fairy tale, settling instead for another rehash of the present story arc of second chances. This film is, in the end, easily forgettable, and like all things in the present, they quickly become history. Enjoy it while it lasts.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Adam Sandler's best movie,"Click is by far Adam Sandler's best movie.. and that ISN'T a cheap shot at his previous films.Sandler has done a ton of comedy movies with terrible jokes and corny plots, and until Anger Management really he didn't have much to his characters other than his goofiness.He reminds me of Jim Carey before The Truman Show - just comedy, no substance.The trailers for Click feature some of the comedic scenes of the movie, but don't worry there are a ton more that aren't spoiled. That being said, this movie isn't all that the trailers portray it to be.If you're going to see Click solely for a good laugh, you'll love the first 45 minutes and hate the rest of it. The script takes a swerve closer to the end and, unlike any of Sandler's previous movies, the ""down"" part of the movie (where the main character goes through rough times) is actually very well done. Click goes from being a comedy to a drama - just for a little while.The dramatic portion of the movie allows Sandler to act as a regular human being; a man who faces the real life consequences of putting his work ahead of his family. It's something a lot of people can relate to, and all of the characters in the movie contribute to the storyline very well.Click provides great comedy and Sandler's best dramatic performance in a movie. It's clean enough for the kids (okay, the early teenagers), a good laugh with the guys or girls, and turns out to be a surprisingly good date movie.Thumbs up",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Click's sad scene.,"I will admit I teared up in the sad scene in Click.It really got to me. I think Adam Sandler is improving with age.Click is the first Adam Sandler film I 've ever seen on the big screen. All his other films I've only seen on TV years after they were made. I will admit I wasn't a Sandler fan, but lately the films he's made are making me take a second look. I only watched the water-boy because Rob Schneider has cameo's in it & I found myself thinking that this isn't to bad.(same with big daddy & 50 first dates.) I have yet to watch anger management & may someday watch happy Gilmore & The longest yard.A good effort, great soundtrack !!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Amazing movie, top to bottom...","What a pleasant surprise ""Click"" turned out to be! Based on the trailer, one can assume that Adam Sandler, playing Michael Newman in his latest movie, has made a movie that is just like Adam Sandler's last movie... and Adam Sandler's movie before that... and the one before that... i.e., the comedy at which you groan, shake your head, say ""what the..."", and yet can't help from laughing out loud. That's what you get in the first hour of this film. That hour is also as much as the trailer shows, and for good reason.Director Frank Coraci, who also worked with Adam Sandler in directing The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer, makes excellent use of a technique that should be taken advantage of more often by more directors. He sets us up in the aforementioned first hour of the movie for laughs, and manages to do this quite a few times, and not just with the moments seen in the trailer like other comedies. And, based on one's presupposed knowledge of the typical Adam Sandler movie, one expects there to be a spiral out of control for Michael, a realization of the ""right thing to do"" and everything to end happily with a monologue and one final punchline, all while remaining light-hearted and humorous. However, having this expectation makes the power and the drama of the movie's second hour so much more heartfelt and emotional. This drama never comes off as forced or unnecessary, because the pacing of the transition between the two utterly different tempos is perfect. Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, the co-writers of this movie, used a similar technique in ""Bruce Almighty"", and it worked very effectively there, as well.There's not much to be said about the ending without the possibility of spoiling it for someone, but suffice to say it accomplishes what it needs to accomplish without making you feel like you've just been cheated.Far and away the best movie I've seen all year; likely one of the best I have or will seen for many, many years. There's so much more to see in this movie than what the trailer offers. See it... you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Very Touching and Emotional Comedy,"Click (2006, Dir. Frank Coraci)Michael Newman is a hard working family man, who must please his boss, in order to get promoted. Problem is he gets less time with his family, and wishes for a remote in which he can control his life. This soon comes true for Newman, when he meets Morty, a crazy sales clerk, who has the ultimate remote. A remote in which he can do anything, including muting, skipping and dubbing his life. He finds this to be the opportunity in which he can not only skip every argument, but also skip to his promotion. He sees this as a good idea, until the remote goes horribly wrong.The trailer for 'Click' doesn't really show you what the film really is. You might think it's just a normal 'soon to be forgotten' comedy with some moments now and then. It's much different. There are some good moments featured in the film which does make you chuckle, but there are also some moments which fills odd in a comedy. All the actors are a joy to watch, especially stars like Henry Winkler and Christopher Walken, and the make up effects are incredible in it. But the true joy of the story is the emotional tale it brings. It can become really upsetting, and i really did feel full of emotion during the final scenes. I really did feel like crying, as you could feel what he felt. I definitely recommend you watch this.""You're not supposed to lay in the beds, but i do sometimes."" - Bed, Bath & Beyond Guy (Nick Swardson)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This is a 2006 version of The Girl, the Gold Watch & Everything!","OK, it's not a Gus Vant Sant style shot for shot remake, but it's the same premise. Yes, I know the Twlight Zone had an episode like this as well. But I just find it amazing that for as talented as Sandler is, Click boils down to TGTGW&E. I'm not a huge Sandler fan, but he has made some funny stuff. Happy Gilmore usually gets me in front of the TV when it's re-run, for instance. And I am a big fan of Walken, great, talented actor. BUT, like this if you want, I'm not knocking ANYONE who wants to see or enjoys Click, I'm just pointing out that Hollywood is doing some bad bottom barrel scraping here. Sandler can act, of course Punch Drunk Love is case #1 for that. After catching a screening this past weekend, I gotta say, this just doesn't do it for me. Some funny stuff in the cruelty dept, Hasselhoff continues to be a funny Icon of weirdness, but nah, not my cup of tea. Better effects than TGTGW&W, though.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good film that looses its way..,"Click is one of those films the ads promote as one thing, and you end up getting another. Not that there is anything wrong with that, and in some cases, can be quite refreshing, but in this case it works agents it.Click was promoted as a comedy about a man who gets a universal remote control that controls his own universe, and it begins to go out of control. This indeed does happen within the film, but, it leaps beyond comedy and turns into a sud sci fie drama before reverting to a Christmas carol like ending, which is to much of a leap for the film to take at its pace.Thats not to say it ruins the film. Far from it, you do end up feeling lost in the life of Michael Newman (Adam Sander), but, it so quick, so random, and changing pace from Sanders style comedy to a drama, its to much of a quick transaction. We aren't given enough time to adjust and except the change, and when the drama begins to take place, we're zipped right back into comedy mode.That said, the film works best as a comedy, only to loose its flow during the heavy drama scenes, almost as if the film itself is trying to be one, then changing its mind to another. When we are in comedy mode, it works so well with a lot of laughs. Even the fat jokes, to which i, being heavyset myself, took some offense to, managed to laugh it off because they were funny, only to have my laughter turn into sadness too quickly.I guess i could say the old promo tag line of ""I laughed, i cried..."" but, to quickly. Also, there were some resolutions i felt were a bit rushed and left unsolved, like, who was Morty? Was he really who he calmed he was towards the end of the film? Also, were and why does this remote exist? Its minor details, but important ones, that gives a film a bit more texture and insight, but, sadly, the solutions given by the film didn't feel all that well thought out and very rush, as if to say 'dont worry about it.."" Overall, its a good, yet flawed film. Its has elements of your classical Adam Sander movie with the wacky jokes, the sometimes crude humor, and of course, his shouting, but, compared to some of his other films, like 50 first dates, anger management, water boy, billy Madison and happy Gilmore, and yes, even little Nicky, it seems to try a bit to much to mix it up, and doesn't quite manage to pull it off.But, its worth a rental at least.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic in so many ways...,"This is a movie that is unlike any other Adam Sandler movie you will ever see. Not only is it funny, but it is something to learn from. This movie, unlike many of Sandler's, delivers a powerful message about loving the simpler things in life. The movie starts off a bit slow, but quickly picks up once you get into it. The movie is very funny, most of the situations and jokes you can very easily laugh at. Towards the end you start to see what skipping the bad things in life can really make you miss. The movie will make people realize that the bad times are worth living through because good times lie ahead. If you don't pay attention to the little things you love in life, like a daughter, or a son, or a beautiful wife, things some people take for granted, you may lose them. It makes you understand that so many people don't realize what they have until it's gone and ""Click"" drove this message into your head with it's almost tragic ending.As for performances, as always, Beckensale is stunning, and delivers a good performance for the given character. Every age of son/daughter of Sandler's character Newman gives a good performance (especially his son at an older age). Walken is a little bit creepy, I've never found him to be too good of an actor, but I suppose he plays the part well. As for Sandler, surprisingly, his performance was the best in the movie, along with the Fonz...This is Sandler's best performance (along with Punch Drunk Love). He comes at the audience surprisingly, delivering the goods in his comedic, and stunningly heart-wrenching performance in ""Click"".See this movie, you will be changed.9.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very good movie, Adam Sandler can actually act?!","Lately it has been getting ever more difficult to catch a nice comedy, that would really make you laugh and have something more than the trivial non contextual superficial jokes that have been so much in vogue for the past 10 years starting with Naked gun, American Pie, Sacrie movie and the like...Don't get me wrong, they were good, but scary movie 5, American pie 4...duuh...give me a break. Anyway back to the movie - it is a very nice comedy, has great jokes and yet a very good plot, makes you think about what really matters in life and although the end is somewhat expected, hey it is a comedy and what is a comedy without a happyend. Last, but not least I want to comment on Adam Sandler's acting - I am not sure if it is just the good script, but I think this is the first ever movie that I see that guy actually acting!

Funny & Touching - A Good Combination,"This was a funny and - near the end - a touching movie. That's a nice combination to have. My only complaint is that it certainly isn't ""family fare"" for a nice story and should have been rated ""R,"" not PG-13. There's simply too much sexual material (and and f-word) for PG-13. With some editing, this could have been a great story for everyone.However, for us adults who like to laugh, there is plenty in here to do that. The jokes come pretty fast, right from the get-go. The premise would good: with a (television-like) remote control, you could control your life. You could fast-forward through all the unpleasant scenes in your life, or freeze frame something that is happening now, or you could go back into time with your life. It all sounds good, but as our main character ""Michael Newman"" (Adam Sandler) found out, it's not so cool. That's a key message here, too, that avoiding the bad things is not necessarily what's best for us. The major message, however, was that spending time with your family is more important than putting your job ahead of them, as far as priorities go. That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy. As funny as this film is, you would be hard-pressed not to have some tears in your eyes at some point near the end of this film.Sandler plays a typical role for him, and utters some great lines and uses sight gags as well for plenty of his laughs. Kate Bekinsale, who plays his wife ""Donna,"" looks absolutely beautiful, the prettiest I've seen her since ""Pearl Harbor."" She plays a nice lady in here, too. Their little kids - especially the girl (Tatum McCann) - are cute and funny at times. I won't mention the dog. I can't without being crude. Christopher Walken is here, and that usually means good news as he tends to play fun-and-interesting characters.Unfortunately - just a warning - this comedy, as so many modern-day ones are, has its share of crude moments, some language and the above-mentioned sexual material. Overall, it was extremely, entertaining, however.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Sandler comedy?,"Not quite, this movie aims higher.

They don't feel right and don't quite mix with the rest of the movie (which is more light hearted).If you can overlook those moments, you will enjoy the funny moments in it (the premise alone is a hoot and they almost make the very best of it), because there are many laugh-out loud moments to be found here!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Uncomfortable,"I think we all know that every movie, whether it's comedy, drama or otherwise puts our main character through some challenges and awkward messes. It's basic storytelling. So it's no spoiler to note that this film does just that. My problem is, it just goes to far with it and spends waaay to much time there, over a third of the film, about 40 minutes and then cleans it all up in less than 10. Maybe it wasn't so much the length of ACT2 to place the blame as it is the fact that it has zero elements of comedy. It is way to serious, uncomfortable, scary and sad. This film should have never been made with this script. Act 2 needed serious work and any college kid would have certainly received a poor grade with it in a scriptwriting class. It really annoys me when big stars get away with making junk just because of the weight their name carries.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And I'm not saying I don't like other Sandler movies, but this one seemed more thought out and I think adults will enjoy this one more since it doesn't contain as much childish jokes.

Tracking through a well worn 'its a wonderful life' formula this movie just reminded me why America will never recover any real human sensitivity. Lost in its restrospective gee shucks morality and its it will always work out in the end mythology This film just simply bombed for me. Filling a movie with recognisable 80's TV and film stars doesn't boost production values.What interests me mostly about this film is why Kate Beckinsale played the unempowered housewife forced to suffer this man after such wonderful empowering roles she has played in the past. When my wife pointed out it was her I was firstly astounded then had to nod my head in shame. Then Sean Astin turns up and plays another SAP. Is Adam Sandler boosting there careers or are they desperate for limelight?.

He just does not fit this role. Not Adam as a person as such, but his acting is just too juvenile and takes away from the type of behaviour of these kinds of people. He doesn't even look like a good match for his wife. So if not him, then who? This movie has Charlie Sheen written all over it (except for the bathroom jokes), or even Ben Stiller who can come across as an adult working male striving for the top.The story is good, and the supporting cast and cameos are quite good.I really like the realism and authenticity displayed when they go into the future.By no means a waste of your viewing money, but could easily have been a better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Sandler Doesn't Click, Only Stumbles","Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is a workaholic architect who lately has been putting his career before his family. While at a Bed Bath & Beyond one night shopping for a universal remote he meets a man by the name of Morty. (Christopher Walken) It's Morty that ends up changing Michael's life with the gift of a remote that not only controls the TV and other household appliances, but his own universe. Upon discovering the abilities the remote has Michael begins to use it to fast-forward through what he considers unpleasant and annoying. Such as fights with his wife and foreplay. As he does this the remote begins creating it's own memory and eventually starts to automatically choose what to fast-forward through. Michael unremittingly goes further and further through his life as the remote continues to fast-forward. In turn, he realizes the importance of spending time with his family.'Click' seemingly starts out will with it's cutesy family wisecracks. And the first couple instances where Michael uses the remote for his own personal kicks is somewhat funny. After that, there really are no laughs to be had. It's just the same joke exhibited over and over again with different alterations. Even the dog Sundance's incessant humping of a stuffed duck gets old real quick as the film advances. This is tragic because 'Click' is being passed off as a comedy but unmistakably isn't funny.Another fault the film bears is the main character Micheal is nowhere as entertaining as Morty. Not only did Walken do a better job of acting, he is overall more enjoyable to watch. Truth be told, Morty is actually the only thing that holds this mess together. And only slightly better than average direction by Frank Caraci who also did two of Sandler's other films ('The Waterboy' and 'The Wedding Singer') only contributes dullness to this already colorless movie.There are however a few heartfelt moments displayed throughout the extent of the film. But in the final scenes there's supposed to be a big profound moment when Michael desperately tries to tell his son how family comes first with his last breaths but Sandler just doesn't deliver. Who honestly expected splendid acting from him though? But despite all the downsides 'Click' presents, many people will still enjoy it. What can I say, fart and sex jokes sell.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit weird,"Picked this up expecting a pretty average, zany Adam Sandler comedy. It was for about 30 minutes, then went really dark.The movie is built around the premise that Adam Sandler gets a remote control that lets him pause, fats forward and rewind etc his life. I'm sure you're thinking of hilarious situations he could get into already. After about half an hour though his remote automatically goes into auto search and he skips ""chapeters"" of his life and witnesses the fall of himself. Won't go into detail but the movie turns from a wacky comedy into food for thought about our lives and how we live them.Thought provoking a times, with some OK gags, but probably not what Sandler fans would hope for.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Average Sandler movie.,"This movie is just pretty much an average Sandler movie if you are looking for comedy. This is really sort of a drama that I thought was sad at the end. I will not tell what you happens. It has a good story with surprisingly good acting by Adam Sandler. The script was okay though. I am glad that it was not just a comedy because it would not have been a good movie then because it is not that funny. It is funny in parts, but not funny throughout like ""Billy Madison"" or ""Happy Gilmore"". I thought that this was a good movie. It is a sad movie to me. I liked it. 7/10. Just ignore the couple of lines because I have to do 10 lines. Oh, I just did. Ignore that line.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I'd tell you what it was, since you can't spoil something that's already rotten, but no one over the age of five would ever believe me.(But I did wish I had that fancy remote as I was leaving the theater.

Surprisingly poor movie,"The trailers looked really interesting, but they were the only interesting parts of the movie, unfortunately. There are some great comedians like Bill Murrey and Jim Carey that when you take them out of the stupid, slapstick American-style comedies and put them in something where their manic impulses are controlled, they just shine. This doesn't happen with Adam Sandler. He demonstrates that without the constant, violent hysteria that is his mainstay and seems to pass for comedy in the US, he is really just an empty shell.This film is sort of a rip-off on ""Liar Liar,"" ""Bruce Almighty,"" with a touch of a badly done ""Meet Joe Black."" Even the presence of the usually brilliant Christopher Walken is a wasted performance",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Can anyone identify the jogger?,"After a slow start, this movie really packs a wallop! I just wish the first half hour could be compressed by some yet-to-be-invented magical device.Shortly after our mild mannered hero comes into possession of the title object, he is driving down the street near his home.Suddenly, out of nowhere, when we least expect it, Adam's character encounters a female jogger... Justifiably, and most memorably, Adam sends her into slow motion with a deft flick of his wrist. This may be the most memorable slow motion scene since Raging Bull... or maybe 10.I'm calling upon all IMDb readers and posters to answer this call to action. Can anyone out there identify the actress who so amply fulfills this role?Is there an academy award for this type of part? Shouldn't there be?I'm also wondering who the poor folks might have been who auditioned for the part but failed to make the grade. A documentary capturing the casting of this role would be nothing short of riveting. I see a bright future for the actress, assuming it's not Rachel Dratch in yet another disguise.Should there be a Click sequel, I'm hoping the part can be expanded and dialog provided. The whole back story of the mystery jogger just calls out for cinematic discovery and sports bra product placement.In fact, I'll be working on such a spec script all night tonight in case folks have any suggestions.Just a name, that's all I'm asking, but if you happen to know if she's been in anything else, well I won't ignore that 411.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's trite but the movie just does not ""click""","Michael (Adam Sandler) has a gorgeous wife and the proverbial two kids. He is an architect employed by a tedious boss and Micheal must work extra hours to bring home enough bacon. One day when his own children tease him for mixing up the remote controls, he decides to take action. He will run out and get a universal remote, like the snotty rich neighbors. However, it is rather late at night and the only store open is Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Nevertheless, in the Beyond section of the store, an unusual clerk sells him the ultimate universal remote, one that is free and non-returnable, too. Michael happily returns home. But, wait. Michael soon finds out THIS remote can also stop the dog from barking loudly and fast forward him through a shower or an argument with his wife. Great, is it not? All too soon, Michael learns that the remote has a down side, including missing important moments in his life. And, although he tries, the remote can not be discarded. Help! This is movie that has some funny moments and some good ideas but it's not enough. Sandler has never tried harder to make things work and to keep laughs coming but he ultimately fails. Perhaps this is because of some very tasteless humor when things go awry. Beckingsale is quite wonderful, however, as the much put-upon wife. Walken is always topnotch and it is wonderful to see Winkler and Kavner. With such a cast, one would guess the movie can't miss, but is does. The culprits are probably the so-so script and the uneven direction. In any case, even if you are a Sandler die-hard, you will be left out in the cold by this film. You may even want to click your own remote and fast forward to the end of the film long before the movie's ending.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Totally Unexpected.,"This movie totally caught me off guard. Like everybody else I also was fool by its trailer thinking this might me another of Adam Sandler fun comical comedy that he is famous for. But this is a serious movie like his previous Spanlish and I must say he did a pretty good job in both of them.Synopsis: A mysterious scientist gave a workaholic architect a chance of a lifetime. A universal remote, that allowed him to fast-forward and rewind to any part of his life. A big problem come when it start to take control over his life choices.What I really like about this movie is total unexpected story, though quite predictable but the sad story was totally surprising. This film is quite meaningful but almost every movie of his do have hidden message like Water Boy - to stand and believe in one self, Billy Madison - to grow up and take responsible. So it is not surprise that this movie also has one - don't take family for granted. Nice.The cast of this movie quite awesome especially David Hasselhoff and his ultra ego womanizer is funny. One thing I don't really buy that much was Kate Beckinsale as an Adam Sandler wife, lol. And though in real life she is a mother I don't really feel mother wives from her on screen. And Christopher was great as creepy looking scientist.This movie has been Oscar nominated for best make up for fat suit that Adams Sandler wear and it is one of the best fat suit I have ever seen, specially that movement of his fat and stomach.This movie consists of many time changes that I find it quite surprisingly interesting. I did quite expect to see the 80s' but not the long future ahead. The change of the set and location make the make more exciting. Though as the film gone by everything seem so abrupt but consider the pace it was all right. If you gone for 2 min bathroom break you'll be missing quite a lot.I feel they should added more humor and I feel the movie was a bit too long but overall it is a very satisfying experience and worth every penny.Recommendation: Do Expected Sad Movie. Worth Rental If You Don't Like Sad Movie; If You Like Then Worth DVD.Reason To Watch: Nice Overall Movie. David and Adam Were Great. Kate Looks Really Gorgeous.Reason Not To: Really Sad Story.Rating: 7.5 (Grade: B-).Please Rate Y/N after Read.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
First Sandler movie I cried during,I didn't have much expectations for this movie. I went to my friends house for her party and we decided watching it. I was wrong about it. I judged it before I had even seen anything remotely close to it. Michaels world changes when he gets this remote. It's basically a 'What If' kind of movie. What if I did this. What if I didn't do this. We have all experienced days like where we want to change the past. His experience just shows never expect more than what you have. Always be happy with what you got because someday it will be gone. This has got to be the only Adam Sandler movie that I have ever cried during. I felt so awkward crying after I found out the ending.BUT I'm not going to spoil it for you.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Family Comes First,"The architect Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) has a typical middle-class family with his lovely and gorgeous wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) and their son Ben and daughter Samantha, and a constant visit of his parents. However, Michael is workaholic and under stress, trying to satisfy his boss with overwork and get a partnership in his company, giving priority to his work and neglecting the family issues. When the tired Michael goes to a department store to buy an universal remote control, he rests on a bed and he meets the weird salesman Morty (Christopher Walken) that offers him a remote control capable of controlling his own universe. Michael uses too much and loses the control of the device, having his own life controlled by the remote control. Then Michael sees the worthwhile parts of his personal life he missed while working, and in the end of his life he lately concludes that the family comes first.""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. Adam Sandler performs the role of a liberal professional that does not give priority to his family trying to be successful in his own career, and having the chance to see how his procedure would affect his beloved family. There are some low level jokes, like the ""entertainment"" of his dog, but they are also hilarious. Kate Beckinsale is extremely beautiful, as usual, even when she is aged, and shows a great chemistry with Adam Sandler. Christopher Walken is very funny in the role of a quite crazy angel. In the end, this highly recommended ""Click"" is a big surprise, leaving the important message that family comes first and many entertaining moments.

Why not see this?,"""Click,"" starring Adam Sandler, is a charming blend of humor and heart that captivates lovers of comedic and heartwarming films. As someone who enjoys comedic movies and series like ""Friends,"" I found ""Click"" to be a delightful addition to Adam Sandler's body of work.The film cleverly weaves humor into a touching storyline, exploring the consequences of fast-forwarding through life's precious moments. Sandler's performance is a key highlight, bringing his signature wit and comedic timing to the character of Michael Newman. His portrayal strikes a balance between the hilarious and the poignant, making the character endearing and easy to connect with.What sets ""Click"" apart is its ability to seamlessly transition between laugh-out-loud moments and more reflective, emotional scenes. The concept of a magical remote control adds a fantastical element to the narrative, allowing for both comedic situations and insightful reflections on the importance of family and time.The supporting cast, including Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken, adds depth to the film, complementing Sandler's comedic style with their own unique contributions. The chemistry between the characters enhances the overall enjoyment of the movie, creating a sense of connection with the audience.As a fan of comedy, I appreciate how ""Click"" doesn't shy away from addressing deeper themes while maintaining a lighthearted and humorous tone. It manages to strike a chord with viewers who enjoy a good laugh but also value movies that leave a lasting emotional impact.While some critics might argue that the film relies on familiar comedic tropes, I believe that its ability to blend humor with genuine emotion makes it a standout in the genre. The film's pacing keeps the audience engaged, and the unexpected twists in the storyline add an element of surprise.In conclusion, I would give ""Click"" a solid 7, acknowledging its success in delivering laughter and heartwarming moments. For fans of Adam Sandler's comedic style and those who enjoy a mix of humor and heartfelt storytelling, ""Click"" is a worthwhile watch that combines the best elements of comedy and relatable, human experiences. I loved the movie's moral lesson.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Click""","Adam Sandler has made a career out of doing dumb heroes that eventually reach their goal at the end of the movie. For Example, take The Wedding Singer, funny tasteless and clocked about 90 minutes long (actully, it's 95 minutes long) and made good comedy out of it. But, he can also make heartbreaking stories. Take Spanglish for example, he was having wife problems but he got them resolved and made a heartbreaking story out of them. In Click, he combine his hilarity and his heart to create a character named Michael Newman, a family man who has a gorgeous wife named Donna (Kate Beckinsale, stunning as ever) and is a struggling architect trying to get up in the ranks. One night he gets so upset that he goes to BED, BATH AND BEYOND to find a Universal Remote Control to control his universe and through a door labeled BEYOND and meets Morty (Christopher Walken), a man who takes him through a door labeled WAY BEYOND and finds him a Universal Remote that is hot off the market and he gives it to Michael free. But once Michael starts skipping around his universe to make his business life his top priority and in the essence, losing sight of his family, the remote creates a mind of it's own and Michael can't stop it with very heartbreaking results. The cast works very well together in their roles and their were some side characters that were hilarious in their roles: David Hasslehouf as Michael's Boss, Sean Astin as their Son's swimming instructor, Julie Kavner and Henry Winkler as Michael's parents all make for satisfying cameos and the story is amazing and heartbreakingly real. So go and see this amazing and funny film and feel good about your life.3 out of 4 stars",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Propably the only good Adam Sandler movie,All I can remember is that this movie was one of the best from Adam Sandler. He did a good job portraying the character and the supporting actors/actresses did also a pretty good job. The comedy was gold at certain points and even the ending was oddly satisfying. The major plot-twist was in my opinion a really important aspect of the movie and made it really work. There were also some very good moments of actual drama which is a bit of a rarity in a this sort of film. Like the title says it's one of the best ones from Adam Sandler and this just proves that the guy can act. All in all a great movie to watch if you are looking for a comedy with a little mix of drama.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An average addition to the Happy Madison list,"Adam Sandler and his crew have been known over the years as the masters of the toilet humour genre. Whilst most of the films have been quite original (except for Mr. Deeds, which is based on Frank Capra's 1936 film Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), they have always been filled with ""fart jokes"" and visual gags. Whilst most films who go down this path end up looking stupid, there is a hidden intelligence in some of the jokes that allow these films to become successful. Recently, however, Happy Madison films like 50 First Dates and The Benchwarmers have not been able to recreate the successful formula of their past films. This newest film by Happy Madison Productions continues with the disappointing trend. Click is about Michael Newman (Sandler), an architect who spends more time on his career than his family. An important partnership is in the air and if he can do well on the project, he'll be in for the promotion he's been waiting for. This means that he spends even less time with his perfect wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale), his children and his parents (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner). When a frustrating bout with the television remote leads Michael to a Bed, Bath & Beyond in search of a universal remote, his curiosity takes him into the Beyond section of the store. This is where he meets a crazy and eccentric inventor named Morty (Christopher Walken). It seems that Morty has created a device that will not only allow Michael complete control over his television and stereo, but his entire life as well. Michael discovers that the remote has the power to fast forward past a quarrel with his wife, and even allow him to travel back and forth through time to different points in his life. This ability to skip straight to the good parts in life soon leaves him feeling as if he's missing out on the total experience. Michael begins to realise that he has lost control of his life, especially when the remote is now programming him. Now Michael must find a way to stop the remote before it skips his entire life. It's amusing to see that Click's themes and its structure echo the ever-wonderful film It's a Wonderful Life (anyone who has seen the 1947 film will realise that there's an exact point in Click which mirrors a scene from the James Stewart classic). The themes of family values and friendship are always apparent in Click. The problem is that the film never truly kicks off and spends too much time focusing on the remote so that it is easy to stop being entertained. Too many fart jokes also don't help. One stand-out part of this film is the acting. Adam Sandler is still incredibly funny and he does a credible job in the dramatic moments of the film. Every character in this film was believable, with Christopher Walken just being in stand-out form. He was incredibly funny. Henry Winkler also isn't just a cameo and there is a heart-felt scene between him and Adam Sandler which is a real tear-jerker. Whilst this film is funny at times, it really never engages the audience to the level it should. The formulaic plot and structure also detracts from the film. Despite the over-abundance of fart gags, this film is funny, with serious tones; and the acting is very credible. Click is not one of the better Happy Madison films, yet not the worst.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An emotional experience,"Early in this fantasy, Chris Walken as a mysterious benefactor with very bad hair warns overworked architect Adam Sandler that the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is in reality a bowl of corn flakes. Only Sandler has to find this out for himself, and does so. In CLICK, a unique remote control allows Sandler to fast-forward, pause and even reverse his life. But things quickly go awry. CLICK goes from being a laugh-out-loud comedy to a tissue box-required melodrama as Sandler makes mistake after mistake with his newfound accessory. And so that you don't make a mistake: This is no dream, regardless of what you may have heard. Sandler is fine, if no Jim Carrey, and Brit thesp Kate ""Underworld"" Beckinsale does a passable American accent as Sandler's wife. As always, SNL pal Rob Schneider has a small role. See if you can spot him. CLICK is quite reminiscent of Bill Murray's SCROOGED.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A good movie, but quite sad","i went to this movie thinking that i would see great comedy. i hoped that the trailers would give away the funny parts such as in Along Came Polly. the movie for the first hour or so was very funny. he had a lot of character and many good jokes.

It is a classic adam sandler and has a funny, sad structure similar to many of his previous movies such as 50 first dates.

This film is horrible,"This is the first movie review I have ever written in my life. I feel compelled to warn anyone who may be reading this to not see this film. I love the IMDb website, and by some weird mistake, I trusted the seven stars this film somehow received as a reason to go see it. I left after 60 minutes and got a refund. In 30 years I have walked out of two films, this film and Dirty Work. This film is uncomfortably not funny, disjointed and pointless. As I read the numerous reviews of people who love this film I am blown away by the emotional and touching comments - ""I cried"" ""I really cried"" The single theme in all of these comments is the reviewer's statement that the film taught them about life and how they need to slow down and appreciate their family. I honestly have to feel sorry for someone who needs a horrible Adam Sandler film to teach them this. The US government should give Adam Sandler a license to print money. If this film can do over 100 million dollars I can understand how George Bush is a two term president.Sandler's secretary is played by an average looking middle aged woman who is very uptight about her job. The movie does not take a second to explain anything about this woman, or why I might want to get to know her. When Sandler, a laid back guy arrives at work, she gives him his messages and says ""can I go to the bathroom now."" Sandler sighs and says, Mary, you don't need my permission to go to the bathroom. Is this supposed to be funny? Why doesn't she just go the bathroom? What is she afraid of missing? Later in the movie, Sandler is in a meeting with some new clients, and his secretary interrupts this very important meeting saying she has an emergency. She hands Adam a note as every in in the room turns and focuses on Sandler and his assistant. The note says, ""can I go to the bathroom?"" Wow, I am laughing just typing this.

It's not an original premise but they handle it in a cool way. The first act is devoted to gags based on the numerous functions of the thing.But later it becomes what my dad called a sort of reverse ""it's a wonderful life"" where he is shown the direction of where his life is going and how he doesn't have good prioritise.

Incredibly entertaining, with some very funny moments...and some touching ones as well. I only wish they had extended and/or fleshed out the ending a little bit...especially since everyone in the theatre probably saw it coming a mile away.

Click review,"Click is a 2005 Comedy film starring Adam Sandler as Michael Newman. Michael lives a very average life, and is not very much respected by his family. He's frustrated with everything thats going on around him, and one thing that starts off the movie. The TV remote. He can never manage to find the right TV remote to turn on and watch TV. Until one day he finally had enough, and goes to a store named 'Bed, Bath & Beyond' to which he finds a secret compartment to which Christopher Walken in working. He receives this special remote, which doesn't only control the TV, but controls everything that goes on around him. This is a very funny, and well remembered comedy by Adam Sandler, and is one i have scene many times and don't ever get bored of it. Stars the usual Cast of Sandler films, and included Sean Astin who starred in Sandler's last movie '50 First Dates' (2004) I would highly recommend this film to anyone to watch, it is highly enjoyable and one of the most funniest films i've seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Loooooooong, predictable, tiring.","I liked Christopher Walken. He is always a great actor and I enjoy watching him perform just to see the interesting inflections he uses in his roles.Adam Sandler... well he is not an actor and never will be. He barely gets by on boyish charm and sophomoric behavior. I got tired of him in SNL after his first season. And it was clear he was carried by the other crew members.This movie started out OK. Despite the simple plot it was more interesting than I expected, initially. I have no doubt that the word used most when both filming an editing this flick was 'Stretch'. They could have cut a full hour off of this movie and still have conveyed its full message. Each subplot after he is fast forwarded left me thinking ""OK, I got it.. That's enough.. Move on"" But no, it never moved on until after it mercilessly beat each topic to death. My wife and I had rented the DVD and neither of us recall ever before having to fast forward through parts again and again just to get to the elusive ending which, as it turns out, was not worth the effort of finding.What had started out having some good potential ended up being the same cheap Hollywood money making garbage.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Interesting movie, bad ending","At first, this movie might seem like a lighthearted comedy, but after 20-30 minutes, it transforms into an interesting and somewhat serious drama. However, the ending is truly horrible - instead of finishing with a sad but deep and dramatic ending, this movie chooses to spoil this effect with a happy, badly-written ending. Without the ending I would of surely given this a 9/10 - but with this horrible ending I'd say it's more of a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The usual Sandler.....just like we love him,"This is not for the serious thespians out there. It is for the summertime crowd looking for a break from work and the mundane.Loved the concept of your life basically being turned into a DVD, with commentaries and special features. Sandler is putting work before family (the ""lesson"" of the film). To get past all the fights and uncomfortable things, he procures this universal remote from Walken so that he can fast forward, pause or slow down his life as he chooses to. The remote allows him to access ""special features"" of his life such as a commentary track by James Earl Jones, as well as deleted scenes and such.Walken again puts in a supporting character performance that steals every scene that he is in. The guy has perfected being Walken and it was great to see him in action. The other supporting actors also help to pull this film up. David Hasselof(sp) does his best, well, Hasselof. He is as self indulgent as one would imagine the real guy is. All of his staff is filled out by Bay Watch beauties.It is the supporting characters that help this film rise above the 6 I would normally give a film like this and made it a solid 7.Sandler is Sandler. He isn't stretching the acting muscles here. But that is OK. Those who enjoy Sandler will get his full arsenal.I thought Kate Beckensale was great. She is one of the hottest stay at home moms in recent cinema history. What I thought was smart of the script was to acknowledge the fact that she was/is hot and that Sandler is a lucky schmuck to have her.All in all, a good way to get out of the heat and have some fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Surprisingly good...a little uneven,"I loved the funny parts of this movie and actually laughed out loud a few times, but I was taken for a gigantic loop when it got extremely sad and dramatic a la ""It's A Wonderful Life."" Maybe it didn't need the dog humping scenes...I still didn't quite believe Adam when he cried sometimes, but other than that he did a wonderful job, especially the Dad scene and his own scene near the end.My main problem with the film is that the segueway from comedy to drama could have been better. Perhaps they could have shown trailers that reflected the fact that it was a comedy-drama and not a full fledged comedy or drama. That said I thought the aging makeup by Rick Baker was superb.Bottom line everyone did a fine job all the way round.

Not one of Adam Sandler's best movies.,"OK the first time i saw this movie i loved it, i laughed so hard but when the movie got to the ending it got really sad and i thought that it was gonna be a comedy the whole way through... but i guess not.

not bad but predictable,"When going in to this movie I definitely expected it to be one of those comedies where the protagonist finds something that seems to improve his life, but turns out that it makes it worse. In the end the hero learns a valuable life lesson and is a better person for it. Surprise surprise that is what the movie was. The idea of the universal remote was a decent one, but it seemed to be just another gimmick for an overdone concept. Sandler does a good job as usual playing the funny goof, but I found his comedy was unnecessary for the overall concept of the movie. Basically you could have used any actor to fill the hero roll and the movie would have still felt the same.Overall some funny parts with a predictable ending, 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

He could rewind himself back to a time when he made good movies.Whoever has been green-lighting his movies, needs to be replaced. I will always love Happy and Madison, wedding singer, and 50 first dates wasn't bad, but since the glory days, it seems like he has a '1 out of 5 ain't bad' mentality when it comes to doing decent movies.But hey, hes done quite a few movies with his 4 different voices, and a few albums.I would recommend Click if you just wanna see a career coasting downhill.

Click (2006) **1/2,"It was another rental evening at Blockbuster and since my wife was dying to see this I gave it a look too. It was actually a pretty good Adam Sandler comedy where he plays a very busy architect always on the go with no time for his family. He burns himself out and receives a super-duper universal remote control from a strange angel (Christopher Walken). Once he has possession of this toy he's able to fast forward through life's boring moments, turn the volume down on people he doesn't want to hear, pause the good times, and so on. But most importantly to me, CLICK actually ultimately had something to say about not rushing through life and taking people you love for granted. I thought I'd be in for 2 hours of nonstop zany toilet shenanigans with Sandler playing with his super-remote and ""clicking"" his way through daily life as he forwards, rewinds, pauses, etc... And of course, that's largely what I got (and some of it was pretty funny); but I was taken by surprise by the serious and emotional tone it took later on. It became more of a drama in the later stages, much to its credit. For those of us who grew up watching HAPPY DAYS on TV, I was somewhat shocked to see Henry Winkler (""the Fonz"" himself) now playing the role of Adam Sandler's dad - and also a grandfather!!!! Where does the time go? If only I had a slow motion button. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Almost good (the Faust myth revisited),"For a Sandler movie, this is surprisingly good, and it has a rather interesting script and some good acting moments (including Sandler!). Of course, you couldn't get along without the humping dogs, fart jokes and some other trivial stuff which have been Sandler's kind of trademark. But it's refreshing how they mixed drama, aging and death in a comedy. Walken was very good, probably the best, as the rest of the cast were almost as sketchy as their characters. There are some twists (some surprising, other corny), Sandler has a few moments, but I couldn't escape the feeling that all was treated too superficially. I laughed a couple of times or so, felt emotion at the dad and death scenes (more because of the situation itself), still something was missing. A reworking of the script, or a better cast, at least.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's Humorous, It's Somber, It's Click.","I must admit, I'm not usually fond of Adam Sandler. His movies seem to involve the same character over and over with similar jokes, and for these reasons are why I was so surprised by Click.The premise is that a workaholic, Michael Newman,(Sandler) is constantly doing projects for his boss and neglecting his family in the process. His actions are leaving him feeling dissatisfied with his life, but everything changes when he meets Morty (Walken), a mysterious employee of Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Morty bestows upon Michael a universal remote which can literally control the universe, whether it be speeding things up, slowing them down, skipping ""chapters"" through life, you name it. Michael begins to use this remote to get through life's ""little"" troubles, be it traffic, showers, sickness, unwanted sex, etc. It backfires on him later down the line when the remote programs itself to skip all these things automatically, forcing Michael to reevaluate just what is important in life.The first thing that must be addressed about this movie is it is NOT a comedy all the way through. The first half is where most of the jokes are, but the film takes a serious turn towards the middle. If you're expecting a laugh riot, look elsewhere, or turn off the movie at the halfway mark. If I had known Sandler was doing drama, I probably would have skipped the movie entirely, but he surprisingly pulls it off quite well.The humor is definitely typical Sandler stuff, and this might be enough to dissuade those that don't like his other movies. However, I would implore you to sit through the humor and see how you like the more dramatic parts. I actually teared up a few times, and that says a lot for me considering I didn't let loose a single tear for a lot of other famous ""cry your eyes out"" movies like Titanic.There are many themes and morals being addressed here, the main one being ""don't let the little things in life fly by"" and ""family comes first."" By the films conclusion, I was looking at my own life through a critical lens, trying to figure out if I was guilty of similar crimes. It's a bit reminiscent of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in many ways.Overall, I'd say if you want a different kind of Sandler movie, this might be it. You could appreciate the dramatic parts in hand with the funny ones too. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sandler is a hit,"LOVE this movie, watched 11 X's, it was time to add my review.
CLICK isn't an Oscar winner, hence the deserved 9⭐ rating.
HOWEVER, CLICK is a feel good, funny, somewhat typical Adam Sandler movie that doesn't disappoint.
I disagree with one reviewer; I think def a kid friendly movie, some catchphrases kids won't understand, nevertheless, I allowed my g-son to see it.
SANDLER sits very comfortable in the family role he plays; the kids genuinely love Sandler. The cast is wonderful and bounce well off each others characters.
Its a fun, down to earth movie, telling the hardships, dreams and pitfalls of life and what can happen when u cheat your way thru it.
Certainly a huge distraction from todays woes and a real, feel good movie!

Egregiously Unfunny,"If there's one thing about movies that I cannot stand, it's when a movie rips off other ideas, movies, or stories. If there's another thing about movies I cannot stand, it's Adam Sandler. This movie is what I like to call a ""Double Whammy."" Now, to be fair, I feel like Adam Sandler himself was not as bad here as I have seen him in the past. Is he good? Well, I can't go that far. But, he does put in an inkling of effort, which really shows in the last few scenes of the movie. Throughout the rest of the movie, though, he is egregiously unfunny. He tries at the jokes, but he fails, miserably. This movie is basically the plot of It's a Wonderful Life, mixed with a little Christmas Carol, and topped off with a little Back to the Future for good luck. It insults me that so much unoriginality could go into what starts off as a halfway decent premise. Not a great premise, but halfway decent. It's a fairly good idea—a remote that can control every part of your life, like brightness or languages. Except, wouldn't it have been nice for someone to turn this baby into a universal translator instead of playing to Adam Sandler's needs? Other than that, the characters aren't all that interesting. We've seen all of these characters before, and even most of these lines before. The only part of this film that was any good was at the very end. I won't give it away, but it wasn't played out all that badly. As for the rest of the film... Well, simply put, there's a reason why George Bailey was such a nice guy in It's a Wonderful Life; it's kind of hard to feel sorry for a douche bag.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mixed feelings,"The problem with ""Click"" is it doesn't quite work as a comedy. Most of the comedy is composed of cheap gags of either a crude or sexual nature. I chuckled a few times, but I don't think I ever laughed during the course of the film. I enjoy most of Sandler's work and have grown accustomed to his low-brow brand of humor, but this time the jokes were way too lame and predictable for me. Now, onto what I did like about the movie. I enjoyed the second half of the film, when it takes a serious turn and many touching moments occur. One of those moments involves Sandler's relationship with his father, played by Henry Winkler. I didn't find myself laughing during ""Click,"" but I definitely found myself crying during certain parts. So altogether, I found it to be a surprisingly moving film. Sandler may not be ""completely"" suited for the more adult roles yet, but he's getting there. For example, he expresses sadness pretty well, but whenever he gets angry, his voice always raises to that same goofy comic pitch. But if you compare his performance in this movie to his horrible excuse for a performance in the forgettable action-comedy ""Bulletproof,"" you can notice significant improvements in his acting. ""Click"" is not a movie I'd list as a must-see, but is worthy of a rental.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Guy takes control of his life via universal remote,"Could be a hit, could be a miss I thought. Lots of not funny humour here, some laughable fart jokes and an original, (I'd never seen it before!) if a bit stupid, plot. Worth watching for Chris Walken's and the Hoffmeister's appearances alone. Wow! Sandler 'buys' a remote control that can control his life: skip arguments, foreplay during sex, boring dinners, waiting for promotion etc.Sounds great, no-one gets hurt, but it all starts to go wrong. The film shifts from happy go lucky, daft Rom-com, to quite a dark tale, revealing the selfishness of his (Sandler's) acts, and the neglect of his family and the depressing outcome.Go and see it. This was rated about 6.9/10 - and that seems fair enough. Probably many worse films out there and many worse Sandler films on DVD.

another Adam sandler movie,"i guess it was time for Adam sandler to try a heart-warming family comedy. i really didn't want to see this, because i end up hating almost anything Adam sandler does. he always seems to be doing the ""waterboy"" voice, even when he isn't trying to. i gave him some slack because i enjoyed ""punch-drunk love"", a movie where he actually seemed to stretch a bit as an actor and try to make you forget for a few moments that it's him on screen. well, back to the same old garbage here. he surrounds himself with an excellent supporting cast (including Christopher walken, Kate beckinsale and even Jennifer Connelly), but to no avail. it's a story about a busy family man given a ""universal"" remote that allows him to access all parts of his life, including fast-forwarding through the parts he doesn't like (and accessing the commentary track, done by James earl Jones). of course, it spirals out of control. It's an interesting premise. with a different actor, one more capable of pulling the audience in, it would have been spot-on. instead, with him, it came off as syrupy, trite and heavy-handed, eliciting no audience empathy at all. to me, sandler seems to have a smirking, sleepwalking quality to his performances, like we're both in on some joke. i never bought him as a father, a husband or an architect. boo!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A dumbed-down Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"Imagine you are a family-father trying to juggle a demanding career as an architect, a vile boss and your needy wife and kids at the same time. Then imagine a brainy scientist presents you with a universal remote control that can not only control all the apparatus in your home, but in your life. When the chance is given to be able to fast-forward, skip chapters, pause and alter the volume of passages of your life  would you take it? Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is faced with this choice, and he takes it.While the concept is highly intriguing  and the reason I set out to see ""Click""  its execution makes me want to weep. Happy Madison Production has not carved out a good comedy since Happy Gilmore (1996) and this film cements the down-spiral of Adam Sandler's career. It seems as though it purposely fast-forwards and skips all moments with comedic potential and then tips over into an endless charade of fart-jokes and misplaced slap-stick to make up for it. Most of the jokes only managed a raised eyebrow from me, like the dog humping the stuffed animal (ha ha, 0/10 for originality). With performers such as the Hoff, Henry Winkler and Christopher Walken gracing the film's cast list in quirky supporting roles you'd think it would be difficult to disappoint on a comic level. But they do, because their characters are all one-dimensional  it is apparent that ""Click"" expects us to find their mere presence funny, which is plain lazy.Less than halfway through, the film realizes how unfunny it is. It then shifts onto a drama path, navigating family values, morals and endless clichés. As Michael's life is spinning out of his control, he recognizes that happiness is in the moment  right here, right now with his family  and not in fast-forwarded promotions. Man, that's a smart movie. At this point it is so marred by formulaic elements that it becomes a Hallmark movie, desperately pulling at the collective heartstrings of the audience. But Michael is an unlikable hero and we do no sympathize with him, not even when he has fast-forwarded his life to when he is all grey-haired, lonely and broken.Click's fatal flaw is that it cannot decide what it is. Is it a drama, is it a comedy? It melts both these genres together, but not in a believable way because it is neither touching nor funny  just a mish-mash of a a great concept, unfunny jokes and sentimentality. Had it put its heart into one of the genres and stuck with one approach, it would probably have been a good film. What's more is that its clumsy flat and shaky story does not hold up for two hours. The only highlights are its soundtrack and a hilarious small character by Sean Astin.3 out of 10",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Well, it's up to you to believe this.After half the movie you start to think you know the end - and yes, you do know. The only question remaining is whether our hero Michael with the remote will turn around in the end or not.This comedy is quite a fantasy/science-fiction comedy with a morale.The special effects are not very new and we get the old joke what it would like if we got older - and fatter.Because of a running gag about a dog and what he does to a giant cuddly toy, I would keep my children out of the movie until they know intend to do with one's leg.But, again, for an evening with light entertainment, grab the remote and enjoy!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Predictable Film That Pulls The Heartstrings,"Adam Sandler is given a universal remote by Morty, the Angel of Death (played by Chris Walken). Sandler begins to fast-forward his life and before long he begins to skip all the day to day aspects of life.The previews leave you with the impression this is a comedy, and there are some parts I found a little funny. But overall this is a drama, and you might cry once the sad music begins playing. Just a fair warning. It happened to me and my brother, it could happen to you.Sandler is not particularly funny in this film, though it has been pointed out to me he rarely is ever funny. His strength is in playing off his co-stars, and he wasn't really given good co-stars to play with here. His best moment, I thought, was with Rob Schneider, who is by no means a great actor.Chris Walken, who is an expert comedian, was not really give much to work with here. His character is neither humorous nor as serious as an angel of death should be. As much as I love Walken ,anyone could have played his role.Hasselhoff was great and this really showcased his potential as a film actor. He has a great presence, and the subtle joke of being around beautiful women (assuming that was a joke) was very nice.Henry Winkler? For some reason he seems to be in this movie just to be in it... he was not properly utilized, being even less interesting here than in ""Scream"".Click is alright, even though you can guess every second of the movie. It is one of those films you might want to watch once a year to keep life in perspective, like ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Bambi"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"moves a bit too quickly to care, a step backwards for Sander","I have to confess at the start of this review that I'm not really an Adam Sandler fan. In fact, I might have been the only person in my 6th grade class who didn't see what was so great about Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. It's not that I like appreciation for crude low-brow humor from SNL alumni. I happen to like Will Ferrell, Norm McDonald, and the David Spade/Chris Farley buddy comedies, but Adam Sandler is just a guy who I don't get. There might be times where I laugh during his movies but I see that as a result of so many random bizarre jokes being thrown out at me, that by sheer luck a couple of them actually work. What I think we like about Sandler, isn't necessarily the comedy but it's the warmth behind his movies. I think it's because he's such a lovable character that we love to cheer for Billy Madison to win his high school diploma or for Bobby Bouche to save the day for his coach in The Waterboy.For me, Sandler movies have gotten better as he's seemed to refine his humor and grounded it more in those uplifting story elements with 50 First Dates, Mr. Deeds, and Big Daddy. Unfortunately, Click is a giant step backwards for Sandler. It's disjointed and feels like it's moving too quickly for us to care much, despite a touching scene near the end. By detaching us from any sense of caring what happens to the characters, the film hits rocky ground, because that leaves us with nothing but Sandler's sense of humor to entice us. What's even odder, the laughs are noticeably fewer and farther in between than most Adam Sandler movies. Then again, that might have been a good thing, considering how bizarre Sandler's jokes can be. And don't think ""bizarre"" is funny because anyone can access the most random corners of their mind and come up with bizarre stuff. The most random corner of Adam Sandler's mind is filled with things like a dog repeatedly humping a stuffed animal and parents who mock the size of their son's ""schmiekel"" (don't ask). The funny moments that actually worked well in the movie are things you can catch in the 30-second trailer anyway.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great lesson overshadowed by silly comedy,"As silly as Adam Sandler movies can be, Click has a more moral tone to it. Given that Sandler can overshadow his movies with tiresome corky-ness it does emotionally level out with some family desperations. Time is linier and it eventually runs out for all, if you drone yourself away from the people that love you it can bite you later in life. Aside from using the power of the ""Universal Remote Control"" for shallow jokes it becomes a realisation that we do want to skip certain things in life. The problem with that is we eventually have to lose that potential we had for greater choices. I liked the movie, it's one of Sandlers best, but sometimes his jokes can be a little distracting. Definitely worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Almost completely worthwhile,"This is an Adam Sandler movie, so naturally it has the sexual stuff in it, but in this modern-day ""It's a Wonderful Life"" type story, a fabulous lesson is taught. It's just too bad that it couldn't be more appropriate for younger viewers. I laughed... I cried... It ended, and I had learned a lesson. The acting was great. The story was fabulous. Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken did a magnificent job. Their performance almost-ALMOST was better than Adam Sandler's. It was definitely a very close tie. One thing I found amazing was that Rob Schneider played Prince Habeeboo, but without knowing it, it's IMPOSSIBLE to tell! See this movie if you're over the age of thirteen!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Happy Gilmore... with his universal remote.,"My Take: Derivative yet funny.Almost all of Adam Sandler comedies sum up similarly. HAPPY GILMORE, THE WATERBOY, THE LONGEST YARD, and now, CLICK. CLICK isn't any different from other of Sandler's movies, but it's perhaps the most relevant and, perhaps, the smartest, even if it isn't the least brilliant. It's pure Sandler formula, but it works well with a better script, derived from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and BRUCE ALMIGHTY, and its mildly amusing with a touch.I hardly bought Sandler as a father in his movies (BIG DADDY mainly), but he did better this time around. He plays Michael Newman, a workaholic who chooses work, aiming to be his boss's new partner, over spending time with his family, much to the disappointment of his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and kids. When life gets too tough for him, or basically getting a difficult time to turn on the television, he decides to buy a universal remote to ""make his life less complicated"". Christopher Walken plays the eccentric ""store clerk"" named Morty who gives him a Universal Remote Control (""the remote that controls your universe.""), who also pops up unexpectedly to give him advices on how to use it. This gives Michael, of course, the opportunity to do things he'd been dying to do. This includes messing with his boss (David Hasselhoff) who refuses to promote him, shutting up his wife's nagging best friend , and mess with the little annoying kid next door. All this is quite funny and they deliver, even if some jokes are mean-spirited and some, fall short off the mark.Although it doesn't always work, CLICK delivers the promise. It's quite funny enough, especially during the scenes with Sandler and Walken. When both of these guys are on the screen, the comedy sparks fly. Sandler's acting hasn't yet improved over the years and the morality is simply spoiled by the fact that Michael has been to mean all his life, but I didn't mind, it delivers exactly what I wanted.CLICK is far from its inspirations (said above), but all in all, its worth the effort. I had fun enough to give it a ***1/2.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Control Freak film is remotely entertaining,"Adam Sandler is an established comedy superstar who is a four-leaf clover for producers & directors who cast him in their films. Most of the films Sandler stars in are box office hits including his latest remote- control nutty narrative ""Click"". Sandler stars as Michael Newman, a yuppie architect who is dissatisfied with some aspects of his life. Newman becomes a ""newman"" when he meets Morty. He is the quirky Bed Bath & Beyond technician, played by Christopher Walken, who hands Michael a special remote control that gives Michael the enchanted power to control his life. The concept is alluring & witty, but unfortunately ""Click"" did not entirely click with me. I will let the remote control features elaborate: ""Play""- I did want to ""play"" with the luscious Kate Beckinsale who plays Newman's wife Donna. Not her supreme acting effort but who cares. Hey! You can't have your Kate and act it good too.""Pause""- The sequence when Michael first discovers the miraculous workings of the control were amusing and worthy of a ""pause"" to digest the laughs.""Rewind""- I was hoping the theatre projectionist would ""rewind"" the film to its first half when I encountered countless unnecessary moral plot elements during the second half of the film. ""Click"" would have clicked efficiently as just a side-splitting show instead of a life-lesson lecture.""Fast Forward""- I was hoping the theatre projectionist would ""fast forward"" the film every time I saw the hackneyed pet jokes that smothers many comedies. I guess it's my pet peeve in comedies.""Tracking""- Director Frank Coraci was on the right ""track"" during the first half of ""Click"" , but somehow got derailed and ended up showing us a fuzzy picture.""Stop""- Do not ""stop"" what you are doing and feverously see ""Click"" but at the same time let me not stop you from a watching a moderately entertaining film.

Somehow this movie fails to click...,"Lets be frank anyone going in to see an Adam Sandler movie is going to pretty much see the following in the movie 1)A PG-13 rated comedy with jokes that will border on crude but will never ever cross the line.2)A movie where there is only one star (take a guess) and pretty much the whole world will revolve around him, hell even if you have a child in the film we will have him act like a bigger child, BASICALLY HE WILL PERFORM THE FUNCTION OF THE WOMAN, THE MAN, THE CHILD, THE FATHER, THE MOTHER, THE CRIMINAL,THE GOOD GUY ETC ...............IN THE SAME FILM.3)A movie about a social misfit who somehow makes it in life against odds and sooner or later realises the true meaning of his life.Safe to say that nothing different whatsoever can be expected from his films.YET....................There is some pleasure to be derived from watching such FEEL GOOD FORMULA FLICKS and once again I was drawn to this film.The movie started with some promise with David Hasselhof and his hot secretaries and Kate Beckinsale looking as hot as ever.Soon after the the main plot of the movie starts and your still laughing a lot...................Soon predictably things are not going so well for him and you wait for him to learn his lesson and the movie to end on a somewhat emotional, happy BUT lower note.But wait , he has to suffer some more till he learns his lesson, OK............ now its times isn't it?.........no wait there's still some suffering left...........phew finally let the poor man learn his lesson now................WAIT A MINUTE this man can suffer some more...........................................repeat this a few more times and you know how you will feel in this movie.His suffering and the movie does end finally and predictably but instead of the normal feel good factor that his movies end with this ones prolonged climax leaves you with a bad taste.Acting from the entire cast is good with no overacting from anyone.Cristopher Walken played the role of another quirk with panache I'm A COUPLE OF FILMS AWAY FROM BEING FEDUP OF SEEING HIM PLAY ANOTHER QUIRK THOUGH.The star of the show for me was David Hasselhoff who played his role of the Dilbertish Boss perfectly.The special effects and modern artwork of this movie was actually top class and of the level you would expect in a sci-fi movie.Techinically this movie is up there but ONCE AGAIN the fact that a weak plot and storyline can ruin the most technically perfect movie is proved.The movie does have its moments though like a couple of hilarious scenes with David H and some others involving Adam Sandler towards the beginning of the movie when he gets the remote.In all anotherADAM SANDLER FORMULA FLICK .....THAT HAS ITS MOMENTS BUT FAILS TO CLICK.(hehe)Wouldn't recommend you rent it unless you are a big fan of Adam.-s the formula fails, overdrawn and overbearing ending+/s typical Adam Sandler film.+s some moments, David Hasselhoff, great technically (as ever higher budget film is)total 5/10 (factoring in the fact that you know its an Adam Sandler movie)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Oddly heartfelt,"I really liked this one. I've watched a lot of Adam Sandler movies and this one was unexpectedly touching. It made me cry once on first watch.Adam Sandler movies have always had this feel of sheer comedy. Not much emotion, just ""throw this at the wall and see what sticks"" kind of comedy. A lot of them do, even though I liked Anger Management and Bulletproof, they didn't have nearly as powerful of a message as this one.But this movie, this movie especially, was especially emotional. It touched on relationships, and especially on the hard parts. How you feel exhausted.It is a fun and emotional watch. And I like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The message is the film.,"For me Sandler films are normally a bit like playing heads or tails. I like it or really don't. This one makes the former list. I became apparent quite early that the message the film wants to get across is the main plot of the film. The script however deals with it in a novel, interesting and innovative way which other films dealing with the subject don't all do. Sandler is more subdued than usual and proves again he can act other roles with aplomb. Walken is superb, as is Beckinsale. Funny, this afternoon I saw her dad in a rerun of a 'Porridge' episode and he was class too. This film is funny and serious, it allows for balanced viewing of gags and life's more tragic moments. The main thing that stops me from rating it higher is its predictability. Good show though!!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Bathroom humor for the kiddies!,"I walked out of this movie when Adam Sandler jumped up on his boss' desk and farted into his face while he was ""frozen"" with the pause button on the universal remote. This is the type of ""humor"" you will find in this lifeless film (at least the part I was able to sit through.) I don't know how it ends and, quite frankly, don't care. The movie is filled with enough foul language and off color depictions (imagine the family dog ""boinking"" a stuffed yellow duck several times, and you get the feel of the film). I don't know why the director could not make a simple G rated film with the same material, but had to lower the event to something I would never take a child to see. There is not enough verve in the story line to entertain adults, and too much gutter humor for the kids.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This film is highly overhated and a legitimate masterpiece,I've watched many films over the years and rarely ever cry at them. I cried at this film. I sobbed at this film. I laughed so hard at this film. The casting choices are perfect. Christopher Walken. Adam Sandler has his best performance here and the writing is perfect. The twist at the end doesn't feel cheap. It perfectly makes Michael (Adam Sandler) and the audience appreciate the life they've been given. This film is my 4th favourite film. Please watch it. It's beautiful.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Drama aspects overpower the comedy,"I went into Click expecting a solid but simple comedy. It ended up being much more. I didn't get as many laughs as from typical Sandler films, but it touched me much more emotionally. The plot basically involves a job-serious man named Michael Newman that discovers a ""universal remote"" that manipulates time, volume, and other things in real life. When using it, he becomes detached from his family in order to satisfy his personal tastes and lead a successful business life. The message is strong and powerful. By the end, its hard not to feel sympathetic towards Newman.The acting was great and the dialog was decent. Adam Sandler does a great job as Michael Newman, conveying the emotional impact of the remote perfectly. The other acting was great as well. The special effects were good, but a little bit overdone when displaying the interface of the universal remote menu. The first half was basically the comedy part; I got a few laughs but nothing priceless. During the second half, things really come together to create an intriguing story line. It reminded me a lot of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, in which Newman plays the part of Scrooge and Morty (the remote vendor) is the ghost. Newman experiences his past, present, and future and sees the problems of his life. Despite this, the ending is very ""feel-good"".I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and content of Click. It is much different than Sandler's earlier films in a good way. One can't help being absorbed by the plot, despite numerous technical errors regarding the remote (which doesn't damage the story at all). Recommended for all viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Click"" A Life Changing Film","Click was a movie that words cannot even describe how AWESOME it was.From Beginning to the end you'll laugh and you'll cry.I know all of us want to have be financially successful,have that position etc but let me tell you one thing I've learned from this movie FAMILY comes first.No matter how good of a job it sounds or how much it pays off if it takes away from time with your families its NOT worth it because none of us are promised tomorrow and cherish every moment every second you have with them.Parents enjoy the time you have with your kids no matter how young or old they are.Because you won't be able to make up for the times you've missed.Even if you have missed time it's never too late to start.Time is so precious and goes by too fast But I would not recommend this to younger children under 10.It does have some scenes that are not appropriate for them to see.But I do recommend this incredible movie to teens,parents,and grandparents.This is a life-changing movie that will make a difference in your life as well as your families.Don't miss your chance.This film will change your life forever and the way you look at life.Life is too short to miss out on the things that are really important and matter most.Lastly this movie has opened my heart and reminded me of is to tell your family (husbands,wives,kids,brothers,sisters,mom's and dads) you love them everyday and always make time for them.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth a watch but could have been better,"This is a pretty difficult movie to surmise, as it doesn't quite work and it's quite hard to say why.The plot has Adam Sandler as a busy working father who discovers a remote control with the power to bend space and time. The movie fuses elements of comedy, drama, and fantasy, but none of these elements are particularly powerful enough to make this a really good movie.The comedy isn't belly laugh hilarious, but than again it's not totally devoid of laughs. There certainly enough of the fart-gag type humor you would expect from an Adam Sandler film, but some other nice comic touches as well.The elements of fantasy and science fiction have interesting possibilities but the whole premise hasn't been properly thought through. The remote control devise seems to have no rules which ends up being confusing.The drama is probably the films strongest card, and at the center of this is Sandler's time demanding career threatening to cost him his family. The Christmas Carol style out of body journeys through time are pretty insightful and moving, and in the end it's pretty nice redemption story.Fans of the insane acting stylings of Christoper Walken are in for a treat, and it's good to see 'the Hoff' doing nice work in an extended supporting role. I can't confess to seeing all his stuff but looking back at his career this could well be the best thing he has ever done.There are a lot of threads running through this film, and a good film in there somewhere. When put on paper the film is probably less than the sum of it's parts, but when compared to other Adam Sandler vehicles it's actually pretty good. If it had more focus in the story, stronger direction, and dropped about 20 minutes of the weaker comedy I think it would have been a whole lot better, possibly even very good.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this film. It seemed like a bad attempt to replicate the life changing transformations found in films like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" and ""Groundhog Day,"" but failed. The setup was good but the film failed to capitalize fully on the use of the remote control device and went directly into tragedy. The story was missing a middle where the character gets an opportunity to learn rather than just hanging around on autopilot and watching life just pass him by. I wanted to see more comedy and there was certainly the possibility for it with all the capabilities of that remote the movie could have gone in ten different directions.

Sandler Shines,"I went into this movie optimistically. It reminded me of Bruce Almighty, a movie with some dumb jokes but some substance to it. To my surprise Click blew Bruce out of the water. Sandler proves that he is more than just a poop joke actor and can act with some sentiment and emotion. Kate Beckinsale did a good job as the wife and Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff and Jennifer Coolidge played their ridiculous parts very well.The movie has a brilliant storyline and I was engrossed as Sandler lost control of his life and reached his tearjerker epiphany late in the movie. This is not to say however that if you are a fan of Sandler's typical movies that you wont like this one. This movie is hysterical at parts and it has oozes with Sandler's sense of humor.

A bit of profundity mixed in with the typical Sandler formula,"I must confess - right from the get go, I expected ""Click"" to be a terrible, poorly conceived mess, barely worth seeing at all. The premise (a man receives a universal remote control to control all aspects of his life) sounded ridiculous and not even possibly coherent. Nonetheless, I went to see Click anyway, in the hopes that the always dependable Christopher Walken and star Adam Sandler might be able to raise the odd laugh.Needless to say, Click is far better than initial impressions might allude to, and while for the most part it is a comedy and a very successful one, there is a surprising amount of profundity mixed in, touching on themes such as lifestyles and priorities; what is really important for us. While the movie does follow the typical Sandler comedy formula of comedic beginning, sad climax and emotional, life lesson bearing happy ending, it is surprising how well director Frank Coraci manages to handle the differing tones of the movie. Unlike last year's excellent summer comedy Wedding Crashers, the more dramatic upsetting ""life lesson"" segment of the story in Click does not contrast quite as evidently, it blends more seamlessly with the rest of the picture rather than an abrupt change in tone.That being said, there are complaints which come to mind, the most evident being that the more profound themes explored in the movie are only scratched upon, when they could have been developed a bit deeper to make for a more compelling story. It's also true that the movie relies on typical goofball comedy schticks such as fart and dog humping jokes, or Sandler in a fat suit perhaps more than was quite necessary, the child actors get quite annoying at times (though unbelievably cute at others) and the main premise for comedy being Sandler's continuous dumbfounded reactions to his world changing around him as his life is fast forwarded (""Whoa mom, you're REALLY old!"") get quite tiresome and very repetitive after a while, but again, the material is handled much better than would be expected.It's true that in different hands the movie might have crumbled, but with Adam Sandler in the lead, Click becomes a roaring success. Sandler is the pinnacle of both moods of the story, the light comedy and more serious drama, and manages to pull off both with typical aplomb, showing depth and skill rarely demonstrated before. Christopher Walken of course steals the movie with his increasingly unexpected and hilariously oddball appearances as Morty, the mad scientist style proprietor of the universal remote. There are also welcome supporting performances from Kate Beckinsale as Sandler's character's wife, managing to give a strong performance despite a horribly written character with next to no depth whatsoever. It's also wonderful to see former Fonzi actor Henry Winkler, giving a charming performance as Sandler's father, and the voice of TV's Marge Simpson, Julie Kavner as Sandler's mother. Sean Astin also has a small supporting role, being mainly the brunt of jokes directed towards his character wearing a speedo, but a noticeable presence nonetheless.All in all, be prepared to be taken by surprise by Click - it boasts far superior storytelling than one might be lead to expect, and particularly impressive dramatic acting from star Adam Sandler near the end. Click may not be the most entirely mature and insightful film you've ever seen, but it sure manages to do so far better than one would expect. All in all, an ideal summer movie - worth seeing!-7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Funny with an interesting, surprising story.","It's very common to see comedy movies focusing too much on the jokes and forgetting about the story, but in this movie, the jokes make the experience through the story richer and funnier. I had fun watching it, the movie doesn't just made me laugh but it also made me think about my life, about my choices, about how important is to live each day of your life, knowing every moment is part of it, and that we also are responsible for making our moments good.

a man's dream- a remote for everything,"The whole concept of this movie is sometimes you don't always want what you wish for. Adam Sandler plays Michael, a guy who has a great family, but seems to be too preoccupied with his job. He's more concerned about pay raises then spending quality family time. One night he goes to a bed, bath, beyond, which is quite funny while he's in the store. He finds a door that says beyond above it and discovers this wacky guy who has a remote he's been looking for. But this is a special remote. It does what ever you want. Mutes sound, distorts images, fast forwards through what ever you want it too. So Michael uses it skip cold showers, traffic and he can't wait,so uses it to skip to his promotion. Only problem is months go by and he doesn't know what happened in the past. His wife just sees him as a barely conscious work alcoholic and of course this cause marriage problems. He gets fat and so does his son, and his daughter begins to dress like a hooker. And after one fast forward he learns he is divorced and his wife is remarried, but he is a very successful architect.And the wacky guy turns out to be a dark angle. It's like other movies with showing what your life will be like if you don't make changes and put family first. Michael wakes up to find it a dream.This movie is first part comedy, second part drama. David Hasselhoff is funny as the boss as well as the bratty neighbor kid. And Jennifer Coolidge is her usual greatness.FINAL VERDICT: One of Sandlers better films.

"AMAZING story, mediocre acting, and absolutely horrible humor","The only reason this movie got a 5 was because of the story, the idea and plan of the film was beautiful, i teared up at the end, it was really quite unexpected, i loved how it all worked together.However, at the first of the movie, probably the whole first half, i thought this was one of the most absolutely horrible movies i have ever seen. At the first of the movie the acting, story and humor were all awful. I was REALLY disappointed. Its really sad too because i usually can find something to like about movies, i haven't really ever seen a really bad movie until then. Nobody in the theater was really laughing at any of the jokes either, I laughed three times throughout the movie, thats it, i counted. I would have laughed at other things, but the only other funny parts were all in the trailers for the movie, so it was all expected, and I thought those parts were absolutely hilarious and laughed hard when I saw them as a preview, thats the reason that i really wanted to see this movie, i had no idea that the story line was so dramatic.That was the point that i started to love the movie, when the story line became dramatic and stopped with the washed up humor. I REALLY loved this part of the movie. Everything from this point on was good, I adored the acting by everyone, especially from Adam Sandler, he did very nicely the rest of the movie. The jokes were not there really so that was good since they really already blew it in that direction, but the ones that were there I did really like.So there you go, a completely polar movie, half REALLY bad, and half REALLY quite awesome, a completely perfect 5! If you can get past the horrible half I would encourage you to see it.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Basically,"Basically this is a very entertaining movie, its perfect Sandler Comedy.Its a great story, sandler is great, hasselhoff is great, walken is great, and it gets you thinking. And no adam sandler film i remember ever got me thinking. Its so much more meaningful than normal comedies. Its great, it really makes you think about family and what you take for granted.I like story ideas like this, with the remote and things, i do think about regularly what it would be like and this perfectly shows it, and doesn't get complicated. Its pure, meaningful fun from a great comedy actor. Obviously its not the best directing and the comedy does sway once in a while, hence the 7 star, but it is good.A Good film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fine Film,This is a good enough film for all viewers to watch and reflect on their own lives. The crew did an alright job in creating this film. The storyline of this was alright and original. The crew certainly knew what they were doing when they were creating this film. The cast selection was fine enough. They really committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry that was displayed throughout this film between the cast members was fairly strong but could have been better and stronger. This film reveals to viewers what life can be like based on specific decisions. This is a fine film for everyone to watch.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is It Always Good to Click to the Future? **1/2,"Some inane silliness evolves when Adam Sandler, who plays the title role to the hilt, realizes that he can do many things with a remote control that he has purchased. Not only can he fast forward to the future, he can go back and just put things in stop.The movie really takes off near the end when we get the conventional theme of ""It's A Wonderful Life."" Sandler shows that he can be quite dramatic, one he sees what his life has become like due to his constantly working and really ignoring his family.Nice to see Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner as his young and aging parents. Had the second part of the movie been its entire basis, the film would have been much better. The silenced dog, hitting the boss, etc. becomes tiresome at best. Christopher Walken appears as the Angel of Death. He looks more like Marty Allen, or Dr. Zorba from Ben Casey (the late Sam Jaffe).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My HEART STRINGS!,Going into this movie I expected it to be purely comedy and while it was pretty funny I found myself crying most of the movie. A great movie about the importance of family and morals with a lot of laughs.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comedy-drama that doesn't hold together,"In ""Click,"" Adam Sandler plays a put-upon architect too busy trying to become partner in his firm to pay attention to his wife (Kate Beckinsdale) and two adorable kids.Already stretched to the breaking point by the demands of work and family, Sandler is set off by his inability to find, among the many that litter his house, the remote control that turns on his TV.In one of the more blatant corporate tie-ins in recent movie history, Sandler, in a huff, heads to Bed, Bath, & Beyond to buy a universal remote to control all the functions of his TV, DVD, etc. (Nevermind the question of why he would go to to a store that so obviously sells sheets, towels, and housewares for an electronic device. He goes to B,B, & Beyond because Best Buy probably wouldn't pony up the cash for a movie tie-in)At the store, he meets Christopher Walken, playing the one-note goofy-creepy character he's been doing in these kinds of movies for a decade now, who gives him a shiny ""universal"" remote. Sandler gets the remote control home and soon learns the pause, fast forward, mute, and other buttons work on his dog, wife, children, and life.The movie has some fun and gets genuine laughs as Sandler uses the fast forward feature to get through foreplay with his wife, the mute button on his dog, and the pause button to get revenge on his smarmy boss (David Hasselhoff).Unfortunately, Sandler runs out of clever things to do with the remote control, and the movie lurches into its second, darker half. The laughs disappear, and the movie, in its ""A Christmas Carol"" phase, becomes somber and heavy-handed.There is one scene that is actually unsettling and proves Christopher Walken's creepiness hasn't been completely filed down.Still, this is an Adam Sandler movie and the darkness drops like a hammer onto a movie that had Sandler mount his boss's desk and fart in his face for a solid 5 seconds. The funny stuff is mediocre-Adam Sandler and the serious stuff doesn't jell with it. The movie meanders in the second half until finally coming to a weak ending.The actors give the material a go and everybody plays their part. Sandler reprises his jerk-who-has-forgotten-what's-truly-important role, Walken does his schtick, and some of the actors that appear in all of Sandler's films appear to play their one-note roles.In the formula that undergirds nearly all of Sandler's movies, the female love interest plays an important and often under-appreciated role. Though Sandler is front and center and the butt or teller of all jokes, his movies need a strong female presence to provide ballast. Sandler's long past the days of ""The Waterboy"" and ""Happy Gilmore,"" when he could create and inhabit a character so goofy and watchable and walk him through a cliché-ridden story that you could throw any pretty woman next to him. (Julie Bowen, anybody?)There's a reason why ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates"" work and ""Little Nicky"" and ""Mr Deeds"" don't. It's the girl, stupid. (In particular, Drew Barrymore. Why aren't these two married?)Unfortunately, Kate Beckinsdale has no chemistry with Sandler. She seems to have wondered in from another, more glamorous movie. You see her making sandwiches in the kitchen, but you don't believe that she's ever made a sandwich in her life. You learn that she's a stay at home mom with two kids. You see the home and the two kids, but Beckinsdale acts like she can't wait for the director to yell ""Cut!"" so she can get these rugrats away from her.It doesn't help that the movie has her gaze at the camera with lingerie-catalogue eyes and show off her rail-thin body in microscopic tee-shirt-and-boxer combinations. She sports a shag hairdo that's straight out of $1,000-a-hairstyle salon and, in all her scenes, is lit with a heavenly light. No housewife looks this good, no actual woman looks this good, no-body looks this good-- Without an army of wardrobe and makeup people. Such a phony character is out of place alongside the believably slobby Sandler and the everyday-people-looking actors playing the two kids.You can't fault Beckinsdale for the way she looks. But you can for what she does with the material. She plays the role with an earnestness that it doesn't deserve. She's trying to sell the audience the domestic complications that it knows are all part of the formula. She also misplays the few quirks her character is given and is at her most believable when fighting with Sandler.Though Beckinsdale is the most glaring problem, she is not the only one. We never know what to make of Hasselhoff as Sandler's boss. Is he demanding and insensitive? Sometimes. Is he a good-natured schlub like Sandler? Sometimes. In another movie this might be called complexity. In a movie like ""Click,"" populated with types instead of characters, it's uncertainty.Sandler, too, isn't entirely believable as an architect. His character must have gone to the Mike Brady school of architecture. In this age in which computer-aided drafting has become standard, Sandler is shown using ruler and pencil. Maybe 20 years ago. The movie doesn't know enough about architects to portray one. Architect like advertising executive or magazine editor, has become(or maybe always was) one of those all-purpose movie-jobs.Overall, ""Click"" is like the similarly high-concept, hi-jincks-ensue movie as ""50 First Dates"" with fewer laughs and lacking an actress game enough for the material.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hilarious film with a lot of heart,"The film made me genuinely laugh out of loud thoughout. As well as being funny, the idea and story is an interesting one and is actually quite emotional.

I would have liked that remote to turn the screen off...,"""Click"" is Adam Sandler's latest attempt at making us laugh. Last year I saw ""Spanglish"" and said that Sandler's true acting talent emerges when someone else but him has written a screenplay, and when someone other than his usual directors has taken a project. Frank Coraci directed Sandler in ""The Wedding Singer"": good; he directed Sandler in ""The Waterboy"": regular; he has just directed ""Click"": awful. Maybe it's not Coraci's fault, but ""Spanglish"" had inspired me to watch Sandler in a different wayThat illusion has vanished.""Click"" plays with different genres and it aims at different targets, but it ultimately gets confusing and it ends up playing the audienceBadly. I saw this film with a friend of mine who had already seen it: ""It made me cry"", he told me; and I got excited because of the ""Spanglish"" situation. I couldn't cry because it isn't a drama; and I couldn't even laugh because it is not a good comedy (although pay attention at a commentary of Colin Farrell: the best).The story is very similar to things everyone has seen before: it's about a guy who is able to go forth and back in time as he pleases, and his present life changes because of it. This time, the element is a remote control given to Sandler by a very classy Christopher Walken; and I don't know I f the movie could have been bearable without Walken.So Sandler's character has his wife and beautiful kids but doesn't pay much attention to them because of his job and because he wants to become partner of the company he works in. Soon, he meets Morty (Walken) who gives him this remote control; and Sandler starts playing with it, not without Morty telling him that it could be dangerousAnd it is.At first, things go bad for Sandler and we worry about his situation. But you know those films where the screenplay plays so much with the viewer that you just can't believe any more of it? It could have been like that during ""The Butterfly Effect"", but Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber handled it well. Here Steve Koren and Mark O' Keefe take it too far; they wrote ""Bruce Almighty"": what happened to them?The reason why I said Sandler so many times above and didn't say his character's name is because he is playing himself: he's playing Adam Sandler. Where did the nice guy of ""50 first Dates"" get lost? What ever occurred to the quarterback of ""The Longest Yard"" or the charming cook of ""Spanglish"", which I dared to say had been his best portrayal? I don't have the answer.His female lead, Kate Beckinsale, looks so beautiful but appears completely underused as his wife. On the children's side, Joseph Castanon (whom I met in ""Ghost Whisperer"") is always likable to watch; and the adults are a Sean Astin who is prepared for better things than this; and two solid comedic supporting roles in the flesh of David Hasselhoff and Jennifer Coolidge.And how can I forget about Christopher Walken; who without doing much saves the rainiest of days: ""Man on Fire"", ""The Rundown"", ""Gigli"" and most notably ""Joe Dirt""",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love this movie!,I've seen this movie several times and I cry every single time. Its a great movie. Definitely a good lesson to be learned as well.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen,"I used to genuinely enjoy watching Adam Sandler films. He was a funny guy, and his movies showcased this talent of his off rather well. But I would imagine, after hitting a high with Big Daddy, either the quality of the films started to wear off, or Sandler just got too big for his britches. With the exception of Punch Drunk Love (an entirely different kind of role altogether) and to a lesser extent, Spanglish, I have yet to see Sandler actually pull off a massively hilarious or worthwhile comedy ever since. And Click sadly, is not exception.Sandler plays Michael Newman, a family man obsessed with work to the point that he has next to no time to spend with his family. Not quite understanding the remotes in his house, Michael sets out one evening to get a universal remote to help him better function with the electronics in his house. But upon meeting Morty (Christopher Walken) in the 'Way Beyond' section of Bed, Bath and Beyond (that would have been clever about ten years ago), he receives much more than just a universal remote. With just a click of a button, Michael can rewind, fast-forward or skip out on certain moments in his life. But things can only go so good for so long.Simply put, Click is one of the worst excuses for a comedy/drama that I have ever seen. Not once does the film even remotely attempt to bring anything new to the tired and overused idea at work within the film, and never once does it even attempt to revel in the genre that it belongs in. The movie just plays out at break-neck speed, beginning and ending without much in-between. And when moments of comedy come up, they speed by and either hit the mark or miss it entirely (the latter happens a whole lot more often than the former). And when moments of drama come up, they are either eluded to as still being subtly funny, or just come off as plainly amateur. The actors within the film are clearly better trained than the material, but despite this, it still acts as a barrier limiting their every move.And no one is held back more than Sandler himself. He just does not seem to know what he is doing here, or how he should be doing it. Should he be acting like a goof, and just creating laughs for the audience at every turn? Or should he actually be a genuinely affected individual, who is slowly seeing the dramatic consequences of his every action, and is ultimately being destroyed by it? He just does not seem to understand at any point during the film, and of the mere moments where he shows a brief glimpse of the actor that was born in Punch Drunk Love, they still do not seem to cut it. He just comes off as being annoying for the most part, and when he is acting with his puppy dog-style ""Woe is me!"" look, he just comes off as being useless. It is almost as if he does not even bother trying anymore to create something that will genuinely affect people. If he thinks the adolescent attempt at tear-inducing drama that takes place in final act of the film was actually something worthwhile, I think he needs to start getting some better career advice.What is even more sad is the staple of actors the film has at its disposal, who are all criminally underused. Kate Beckinsale plays Sandler's wife, and all she basically gets to do is get naughty with him, or argue with him. She may be credited second only to Sandler, but she gets such a tiny amount of screen time that you wonder why the filmmakers even bothered getting a name actor, and not just some random good looking extra. Henry Winkler and David Hasselhoff, both wonderful character actors (even if a lot of their best stuff is mere parodies of their most famous roles), are basically used as stepping stones for Sandler jokes that do nothing for the movie. The entire scene where he pauses his life and beats up Hasselhoff is not funny. It borders on being delusionally ridiculous. They do get a few funny lines, but are nothing but mere cardboard cut-outs for the most part.Walken is the one who fares the greatest of anyone, but only by mere chance. He plays Morty as the usual kooky/crazy Walken stereotype, and it only works because it is funnier than almost anything Sandler can throw at the audience. I found myself pining for more Walken, just because everything else was so ridiculously unfunny. Even at his worst, Walken still succeeds in being better than everything in the entirety of the movie.The only thing that can even match him is some of the interesting make-up that appears in the last half of the movie. Not so much Sandler dressed up as a fat guy (especially not during the horrendously CGI-friendly ""wake-up"" scene), but the aging done to the likes of Winkler, Beckinsale, Sean Astin and Julie Kavner. I thought it would look silly, but it was actually well done, and clearly was well thought out and applied in its creation. It actually makes these moments seem better than they actually are, just because of how professionally done they look. It was a treat to see the wonders of some of these scenes, and really begged the question of whether the movie could have actually been better if it was as well thought out as the make-up.It pains me to know Sandler actually made people genuinely cry with some of the material in this film. I felt like crying yes, but only because of how atrocious the things going on on-screen were. I can only hope that there are a few more Punch Drunk Loves coming from Sandler, and no more disasters like this.2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The first five to seven minutes of the movie are funny, so are the last five to seven minutes, but in between, the movie is depressing. Not only does this movie try to be sad, it also fails to be funny. Besides being depressing and not funny, the movie has the most clichés that I've seen in a long time. Right before the movie started, I said to myself, ""This movie is going to be awesome since Adam Sandler plays the lead"" but after the same joke was shown in, literally, every other scene, I realized that this movie is boring, depressing, and not funny at all.I had high expectations for this movie, since I have found other Adam Sandler movies to be funny, but this movie was unwatchable. I know this movie had a good moral, but, while trying to prove a point, this movie lost its comedy and became more of a tragedy.2 out of 10",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Poor attempt at comedy,"What an utterly inane, poorly done, and ultimately sappy piece of tripe. At first glance, this appears to be nothing more than another Sandler low-brow comedy, with a high concept and low execution. Using a remote control that controls everything? It's comedic gold! Gold, Jerry, Gold! So much fun could be had with the idea - it's a veritable goal mine. But it squanders it. Instead, the movie tries to hammer home a painfully obvious message, and ultimately fails at both comedy and drama (yes, it was trying to go for drama).From the opening scenes, nothing about this movie really works. The dialogue is corny and forced, the acting is terrible, the plot is utterly pointless, and the characters are completely unbelievable. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but they are few and far between - not really the comedy I was expecting. Instead of exploiting the idea for laughs, the movie decides to grow a heart, and tack on unneeded, cheezy scenes of emotion that just don't fit. The moral of the movie is painfully clear, but I just didn't care. Instead of making me laugh, this movie made me retch.There are a few times that some comedic genius slips through and stands out, but as a whole, this movie was downright silly. The entire last 45 minutes was horribly done, and were not needed at all - it just stretched the movie on and on. If they had stuck to straight comedy, this would have been at least a decent attempt, but as it stands now, it's just a crappy movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Adam Sandler's Best Movie,"For this reviewer ""Click"" is Adam Sandler's best movie. That is not to say I don't like his other work like ""Happy Gilmore"", But love this move. I find it so touching.Plt In A Paragraph: Michael Newman (Sandler) is a family man, but also a workaholic who must please his boss (David Hasselhoff), in order to get promoted. Problem is he gets less and less time with his family. When he meets Morty (the brilliant Christopher Walken), a crazy sales clerk, at Bed, Bath And Beyond who has the ultimate remote. A remote in which he can do anything, including muting, skipping and dubbing his life. He finds this to be the opportunity in which he can not only skip every argument, every illness, every shower or traffic jam but also skip forward to his big promotion. He sees this as a good idea, until the remote goes horribly wrong.This s a surprisingly touching movie and this reviewer is not ashamed to admit that he shed a tear on more than one occasion. The scene with Henry Winkler as his Dad is heartbreaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much tastelessness,"This had several aspects that were of great concern - in particular the exposure of minors to bad language and sexual matters.The first half of the film where minors were involved in such 'funny' scenes as a dog who has intimate relations with a stuffed duck, is particularly bad in this respect. This 'gag' gets played to death. As for that scene where Sandler breaks wind in Hasselhoff's face, there were no minors involved in that scene but it was still utterly tasteless. No warning about this stuff (other than some generic ones about medium coarse language, etc) exists on the video and if anyone picks this off the video or DVD shelf expecting something gentler and more Disneyesque , these scenes will shock the most.The second half gets better when the tastelessness goes away. These scenes will be fast-forwarded over in this review in the interests of avoiding spoilers but they do show what happens when the fast-forward mechanism in the universal remote gets out of control. They almost atone for the ugliness of the first half. Almost.Recommended for anyone who thinks that the repetitive playing of scenes involving a , well, lonely dog and a toy duck is hilarious, and that films like these represent the very pinnacle of freedom.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Capra must be spinning in his grave by now!,"With ""Click"" Adam Sandler taints the great name of classic film director Frank Capra once again. Sandler had previously done havoc upon the 1936 screwball comedy ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" with his 2002 release ""Mr. Deeds"", and now he's set his sights on that perennial Christmas favorite and all-around stellar 1946 film ""It's a Wonderful Life"".Although Sandler portrays sad saps with aplomb, he hardly presents the Everyman in the fashion of a Gary Cooper or a James Stewart. His three degrees of facial changes and seven variations of gesticulating visible in this film, and much of his repertoire, prove that his stand-out work in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" was a false alarm, and solely due to fine writing.""Click"" tells the all too familiar story of a workaholic dad who has become so wrapped up in his work that he has no time for his home life. This set-up is so prevalent that the first fifteen minutes are a major challenge to wade through. So Dad wishes for a cure-all to drop down from the heavens. Wasn't this storyline beaten to death ten years ago with ""Multiplicity""? Well, our hero soon finds himself in the Beyond Section of a Bed, Bath, & Beyond looking straight in the face of the solution to his woes.It comes as no surprise that ""Click"" was written by the scribes behind ""Bruce Almighty"", when the answer comes in the form of a universal remote control that literally controls the universe. It was sort of fun watching traffic separate in ""Bruce"" and it's sort of neat to see our character's life on pause in this flick, but how many times do we see the same basic thing before the remote becomes the most interesting character in the film? How long before the movie's structure becomes little more than two hours of flipping channels?""Click"" is sort of cute, and sort of clever, but it's getting tiresome to watch Adam Sandler continue to age within the midst of an endless slew of potty jokes and other juvenile humor, while the music cues of his films may suggest a more sentimental moment. When will audiences realize his irrelevance?Nonetheless, in amongst the rubble that becomes of the good intentions behind ""Click"" are standout moments by the always dependable Christopher Walken, in a role one might suspect is merely Walken before his morning coffee, and Julie Kavner, taking some time from ""The Simpsons"", brings the goods with a limited but charming performance as the protagonist's mother.These are the exceptions, though. Mostly our cardboard characters are more like the wife Kate Beckinsale plays. Didn't the ""Underworld"" series bring her beyond this crap yet?C'Mon, change the channel.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Like I said I teared up.It's a beautiful movie the comedies good the stories good the plots good if they didn't just steal it off of something. They probably did. But watch this movie. It's so good. I liked it so much more than I thought I would rate it nine out of 10 not perfect but it's really good.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"great idea for a movie, wasted effort","I made the mistake of seeing this with my 12 year old daughter because the trailer was so good. This was a great idea for a movie with some good scenes, but the low life humor was embarrassing for both of us, and it was way overdone. I was surprised that Kavner, Winkler, and JE Jones would lend themselves to this quality of film. Sandler is too talented, but I guess this is where his audience is. This follows the pattern of his movies, but I just wish he would take the high road and let us see what he can do. It's the difference between a quality George Carlin routine and Cheech and Chong. I mean come on, dogs humped stuffed animals all the way through the movie, and farting in someone's face when they can't do anything about it is 3rd grade. The interesting thing about it is that my 12 year old felt exactly the same way, which I now consider her maturity level above Sandler's.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
GOLD,Adam Sandler to me has always been about family yes he has some weird movies but when I think about Adam Sandler this movies comes 2 my head more than any other and so does 50 first date! Since the movie makes you laugh I'm sure it was taken srs but no movie has made me think about the importance of life like click does. I see christoper Walken as a choice devil. It's a heart wrenching film that I've seen many times but the key of this movie is family that's all life is about ur family and what you can do for them and how you can be there for them instead of thinking about work.

Be Careful what you click,"I'm fairly neutral when it comes to Adam Sandler, finding his low humour brand of comedy rather hit or miss. Click, however, really didn't click with me. This feels derivative of A Christmas Carol and Sandler really wants to have his cake and eat it. AND then with some cherries on top. The toilet humour is present, but he also wants us, the audience, to root for him during some fairly dramatic moments. The problem is that not only is this all a mess that never convincingly melds, but Sandler's character isn't particularly endearing, and we can all see what will happen from more than mile away. Throw in a recycling of '90s pop songs which further cements this as overly contrived, tick-box, movie filler.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Twist,"I must say, this was a great movie. Although is premiered 8 years ago, I sat down to watch this movie just a fews days ago and I cannot put into words how eye-opening this movie was. With Adam Sandler in the starting role, of course I prepared myself to laugh at his antics. When the movie was over, I wasn't sure if I needed a Kleenex or what! This movie was awesome and a must see by all who have a family at home. It is so easy to get caught up with life, be selfish and forget those behind. This movie showed that no matter how much you do, you should always take time, not only for yourself but for your family. We often spend so much time fast-forwarding through life, wishing our days away that we miss out on the important things. Great movie! Great, great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unsurprisingly Stupid Humor from the Skid Marks of Comedy,"Imagine Alfred E. Neuman. Now, remove any and all of his goofy, endearing stupidity and replace it with a slick beady eyed hostility. After that, add in the meanness of a New York sewer rat and an unwholesome obsession with farts and crap. The resulting strange, sick, and sad beast is Adam Sandler, who torments us again with another heaping helping of his special brown and gooey filmatic slop. Like Buddy Love without the charm, Sandler is a mean and 'surprisingly' unfunny schmuck.Oi, what a mess. It's all threadbare, formulaic hackwork and (dopey) 'high' concept over substance and inspiration. Don't waste your money unless seeing this sheep-haired putz farting in people's faces turns you on. Seriously, he does that. Flick also features Swindler's usual mean-spirited bullyish beatdowns; clever moves like freezing the moment with his magic remote (really? Genius!) then moving the punk next door's baseball mitt so he misses the ball. It's just that banal and awful, all the way through.You've seen it all done before better (gets magic powers!--backfires!--wants his life back!)in other movies (even the fart jokes). Don't bother. It's a shame such paint-by-the-numbers hacks are successful in the movies, never mind the coarsening of the culture that's been caused by such dreck, but hey, if you can deliver the sausage on time, the deli can keep serving the hot dogs to the suckers.

Am I the only one who thought it was bad?,"Okay, so yes, I can be a little cynical and very critical of movies, especially on important details. But there is no denying that this movie was a mesh of two sandlers, the goofy one (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore) and the serious one (Punch Drunk Love, Spanglish). I'm so mad at myself for thinking that this would be good, I always get suckered into his movies. I thought they should've stuck to a genre. The comedic relief was stale and the drama was just painful to watch, it was too unrealistic, and just pretty much all around bad acting. They took a seemingly good idea for a film and twisted into so many different plot angles that I got confused. Don't get me wrong, I like Adam Sandler. I like Christopher Walken, Kate Beckinsale, etc. But, I just think they could've sprung for a rewrite. Just one opinion.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Click went beyond depressing.,"I know the point of this movie was to illustrate family is more important than work. I agree with this philosophy. However, this movie kept beating a dead horse long after its heart stopped. It was completely obnoxious in its pursuit. I wouldn't recommend it to an enemy and I am rarely negative. I feel this movie could have demonstrated the importance of family, and how workaholics can end up losing so much without going over and over and over the same points. It just made for monotonous viewing how repeated the points and lessons were. Even though everyone in the storyline was aging, the lessons didn't change and the way the lessons were being taught didn't change. It was a very unimaginative and painful movie to watch, in my opinion.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Very good movie. Ignore the critics.,"I'm usually a harsh critic of movies, and I rarely disagree with a 29% on Rottentomatoes and 44 on Metacritic, but I think they totally missed the boat on this movie.This movie had heart, some humor, and good writing. The only objection I might have is a lot of sexual humor that some might find objectionable for the kids they took to it.Sandler is very likable. The movie has an edge, and it's funny.Even has a moral to it that's handled smoothly.On the drama/lifelesson side, I thought it did one of the best jobs at capturing that whole Kapra-alternate reality thing of any modern movie. Usually that sort of thing comes off horribly badly and clumsily (e.g. Scooged, and the horrible Mr. Destiny).Maybe they just didn't know to expect this from Sandler.

Disappointing and corny,"I was expecting a fairly funny and interesting movie as the score of this movie was quite good: 7.7 out of thousands of votes. When I was watching it, boredom got the best of me in the second half of the movie. The story was kind of dumb if you ask me, not very well developed at all and more so, I thought the way Adam Sandler did the part of Michael Newman was downright silly. I honestly can't imagine why this would be suck a good movie, but if I see the score obviously many people disagree. Anyway, in my opinion a silly, shallow and not very well developed story and not worth your time at all. I'd give this one nothing more than a 3/10 for the couple of laughs I had... I can't even remember what they were for, but I know I did laugh once or twice.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I did find it surprising that the same group of actors that usually play a part sandler's films are not in this one, though I don't know who plays the character of Habiboo, it seemed like he had some prosthetics on his face. It was interesting to see David Hasselhoff playing Michael's (Sandler)boss,he also played the part well. Overall a very fine job from the actors and a very enjoyable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Perfect example of how not to make a movie,"This movie had no good points. I won't comment on the acting (apart from leads), since its unfair to judge them by horrible writing and directing. The script is mundane and watery-a very processed looking, you've seen it all before, ho hum affair. Family man who has everything, wants to fast forward through his perfect life (explain that!) He has a gorgeous wife, money, family, health, home, everything in the American dream, and he whines about it! That's Adam Sandler of course. He's not a likable character. Granted, a better actor may have made him somewhat more likable. We do have modern day Cary Grants, but Sandler is unable to take that part. He just comes across as too ""I'm a superior creature to the viewer"". The laughs are struggled for, and quite predicable. Courteous viewers will give some scenes the benefit of the doubt, but they'll be straining hard to actually smile.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"When you start thinking, hey, this isn't funny anymore, TURN IT OFF","For the first half hour or so, Click is a very funny and charming movie. My initial reaction was, hmmm, why did this get bad reviews, it's that rarity; an Adam Sandler movie that is more about charm and fun than lowbrow jokes.Perhaps a third of the way through though, shortly after Sandler gets the remote that is the movie's central gimmick, it just sort of stopped being funny. Jokes became increasingly low brow and mean-spirited, although hints of what was to come came early on, most notably in the mean-spirited delight the movie takes in Sandler's petty cruelties to an obnoxious neighbor kid.By the last third, the movie dropped humor altogether in favor of bathos and treacly sentimentality as it hammered home its moral. The movie clearly wants to be Capraesque, but it fails to have noticed that Capra's films, even at their most serious and sentimental, would always toss in a few light touches.The problem is not the premise, which is pretty good, or even the moral, which is a fair one and which comes naturally out of the premise. The problem is the film is just badly done.Since a third of it is actually pretty funny, it might seem harsh to only give it 3 stars out of ten, but if a movie is going to be this awful I feel it shouldn't fool you into thinking it's good and then falling apart so completely. If I only judged the first third I'd give this a 7, but the second third deserves a 4 and the last third deserves a 2 if I'm feeling generous.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

unlikeable Sandler ruins this,"Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is an angry family man. He has to deal with idiotic clients at his work as an architect. His family led by his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) wants more of his attention. One night, he goes out to buy an universal remote. Only 'Bed, Bath and Beyond' is open, and Morty (Christopher Walken) goes Way Beyond to get him a special remote.Sandler ruins this movie at every turn with his anger and hatefulness. He doesn't like people and the audience can feel that. It doesn't take long before Rob Schneider plays a racially insensitive character. It's got Sandler's brand of childish humor. All of it is salvageable if Sandler's character is played nicer. It would be better for him to be a lovable loser. The story of a man finding his way to reconnect with his family is a compelling and heart-warming one.

And if her husband finds somebody else ... well... he's considered a jerk. (And these Hollywood types can't figure out why so many men avoid marriage today. Are they really this dumb?).

Juvenile and Senseless Absurdities,"Click is a film with great potential that is squandered by juvenile and senseless absurdities. Unsure of whether it wants to make a mindless joke about women in the workplace or help you deeply reflect on the struggles of your own work/life balance, this film is lost from the beginning.The supporting cast is weak, with Walken and Coolidge doing more of an impression of themselves rather than actually acting. The dialogue is painful, especially when it comes to the children. The saddest part about Click is that the concept itself is pretty good. There is a great premise and a strong message of ""Family Comes First"" buried beneath dogs in heat and slowing down the jogging neighbor. Thankfully, the third act was able to bring real emotion and a powerful conclusion to the story. If you can make it through the first hour and 20 minutes, the payoff is actually pretty good.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Comedy Definitely Does Click.,"Before I review Click, let me tell you why I watched it. I'm a busboy, but I was laid off for six months. Today was my first day back, and even though it was just 3 hours of dishwashing, it was stressful for me. Also, I'm used to 4-5 hours, but soon I need to work 7 hours for a while.I've felt a ton of stress today, and I just needed a silly comedy to wind down. I had a few Adam Sandler comedies in my collection that I needed to see, and I decided to see Click. I'm very glad that I did.Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman, a businessman and workaholic. He has a possible promotion coming up, and he works non-stop. He ignores his wife and kids, and plans to work instead of going on a camping trip.At one point, he meets Morty, played by Christopher Walken. He gives him a remote that lets him control his life. He can fast forward boring parts, rewind to pleasant memories, freeze people, and get audio commentary by James Earl Jones. (He regrets pressing ""the making of"" feature, which brings him to his parent's room.)At first, Michael loves this remote, but the more he skips through his life, the more he misses out on it. It's then he realizes that family is most important, and he needs to work less to enjoy his wife and kids.There were many moments that made me laugh, such as the ""making of"" scene and other things Michael does with the remote. (Of course, I'm trying to avoid spoilers here.)The premise is certainly recycled, take for instance It's A Wonderful Life or Bruce Almighty. All 3 of these movies are people seeing how great their lives are after altering it. Not to mention the workaholic father from The Santa Clause, Liar Liar, and the like. (Is Sandler trying to mimic Jim Carrey here?) That said, I did enjoy the ""remote"" aspect to take a spin on it.However, despite it not being fully original, there are many neat spins throughout- particularly with the remote, and what is done with it. Also, there is a departure for Adam Sandler in which the second half of the movie heavily focuses on drama more than the laughs. (There are jokes in the last hour, don't get me wrong, but the more dramatic turn is unexpected.)When it comes to Adam Sandler movies, this is certainly one of his better works. It's funny, touching, and even tear-jerking. While the plot is not exactly fresh and some jokes don't land, this comedy, overall, certainly does indeed Click.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Good Movie is Trying to Break Through,"""Click"" is one of the tales of two different movies. On one end you have the 2006 Adam Sandler comedy full of dumb jokes. Everything from fart jokes, dog humping jokes and other stupid stuff. Then, at around the 70-minute mark of this 107-minute movie the story decides to be very deep, emotional and poignant. The ads will not fully prepare you for how sad this movie is going to be. This is a ""comedy"" where there may not be many laughs but come the third act there will be tears.It is a shame that such a clever premise had to be squandered with so many dumb jokes. When this movie is good, it is really good. It is just buried under so much garbage to get there. Luckily there is a remote that you can use to fast forward to the really go0d stuff in this movie.

Ill advised amalgamation of philosophy with playground humour aimed at those too young to know of basic life lessons.,"If there's one thing that's a little tough to sit through, then it's an Adam Sandler film in which the majority of the comedy is born out of daft, moronic, frat-boy humour linked to bodily functions; but if there's something that's, arguably, a little tougher to sit through, then it's an Adam Sandler film in which the majority of the comedy is born out of daft, moronic, frat-boy humour linked to bodily functions which doubles up as a life lecture. Many have been fooled, it would seem; many have fallen to the spell of Frank Coraci, the directorial Svengali for Click, the American film from 2006 which panders to two sorts of crowds but cons nobody with any sort of real sense. On the surface, an important 'message movie' about life and how to deal with life and that you should find time for those you love and find time to be patient for those you don't but at the core, a hate-filled; sexist and racist piece that aims pretty low and hits there or there-abouts.Sandler is indeed the lead in Click, an architect named Michael Newman who spends his days wallowing in his basement attempting to work on a particular project which will see him garner a sort of ""mother"" of all promotions. He has a family that includes kids whom appear to be interested in a variety of different things; a wife with whom there is a definite connection; a dwelling that is one of 'those' gorgeous, American neighbourhoods and generally seems to be doing pretty well for himself. Despite all this, our Michael is wavering into some sort of depressive state, stating that he really wouldn't mind if his life got a little shorter. One day, sick with all the remote controls in and around the house, systematically getting across a sense of real inability to deal with modernity and those little things that try to make your life a tiny bit easier, he journeys to the local mall in order to find a universal remote; something that can control everything at once. Upon arriving, he meets eccentric technician Morty (Christpher Walken channelling a familiar sort of mad professor act) who gives him a remote that it's eventually revealed can control a lot more than just household electronics.It's a simple enough premise, and it's delivered with a simple enough aplomb in the early stages as sequences that exist purely to fill up the trailers and TV spots are played out to do with colour saturation; volume; freeze framing and language control. You might be forgiven for thinking that Michael didn't, at some point, merely direct the remote up into the air and push 'channel up', thus shifting everything into an alternate universe-come-network-come-broadcast; the reason for this being that the people inhabiting the universe of Click are odd, strange, scary individuals and all of whose problems are exploited for cheap laughs. Examples of these people arrive in the form of Michael's infantilised secretary persistently asking whether she can take toilet breaks; his parents appearing somewhat verbally abusive; his boss, a certain Mr. Ammer (Hasselhoff), a disgusting concoction of nymphomania blended with resentment and Michael himself carries an odd, sadistic streak in which the infliction of pain on others is a release.Click sets its stall out pretty early on when it resorts to dog-humping jokes and, for sake of similar laughs, brings on an eight year old boy and has him say a few dirty words. It's mostly unforgivable and unfolds within a world in which most of the women are jaw-droppingly stunning, as well as Arabic businessmen from the Far East whom exist to be mocked, imitated and have their names pronounced incorrectly for easy laughs. It is very much the sort of film attempting to deal with very real and somewhat necessary ideas under this banner of adolescent, 'kick-back and enjoy', narrow-minded entertainment. When Michael shouts at Morty, upon hearing the universal remote is free of charge, ""why (he would) want to return something (that was) free of charge"", you half expect a little green light to appear in the top corner of the screen exclaiming, for the benefit of those not paying attention, that the film's hypothesis has appeared and everything after this will be a test of the preceding statement.The message, screaming at the audience loud and clear; a drumming into the audience's heads on what's right and what's not, is that one needs to appreciate the finer things in life and we learn this by way of Michael's fast-forwarding through hard work for promotions; through time spent with the family, no matter how much they might annoy you; through 'quality time' with your spouse and through the little things such as traffic jams, which demand patience as you see something through, in spite of how much of a nuisance it is. After all the schlock humour, Click tries to bail itself out by having its lead suffer a series of epiphanies, but it all rings false; the pseudo-philosophical turn it decides to take when Morty arrives on screen and lays out the entire lesson is cringe-inducing, whilst the overall shift in tact is too disruptive and doesn't work. Click is very much the sort of film people such as Jonah Hill or Katie Cassidy, as well as those kids whom played Michael's children at various stages, if indeed they even have acting careers, may very well look back on in years to come and exclaim: ""Yep, the things you've gotta do when you're at the bottom of the chain(!)"". Well, maybe someone like Jonah Hill wont. Meanwhile, for attuned acting veterans such as Walken; there's that sense of 'what else is there that's left to achieve in my long and honourable array of credits?'

"""Click"" Is A Clunker, & Adam Sandler's Most Disappointing Movie","Every time I think about the movie ""Click"", I can't help but get angry, as if I had been cheated into watching it in the first place. I don't know if it's Adam Sandler's worst movie, but it is by far his most disappointing.Basically, when I first went to see the film in June of 2006, I went in expecting a comedy, which is what I got for the first half of the film. The second half, however, was when the film not only became unfunny, but it ventured into such sad, dark, and depressing territory. By the end, I felt as though I had been tricked into seeing a better film.In this movie, Sandler plays Michael Newman, a happily-married architect whose main problem is his boss (David Hasselhoff), who repeatedly puts him on time-sensitive assignments to the point where he doesn't spend the time with his wife and kids that he would like to. His family, particularly his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale), doesn't seem to be the least sympathetic to the fact that he has to work to support the family, which is a theme also prevalent in other forgettable comedies of yesteryear like ""Multiplicity"" and ""Jingle All The Way"" (both 1996).Late one night, Michael goes out the the nearest available store to find a universal remote. In an admittedly creative way to incorporate product placement into a film, he drives by various outlet stores until venturing into Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Finding a door marked ""Beyond"" in the store, he walks through and meets an eccentric electrician named Morty (Christopher Walken, probably the best thing about the film). Morty gives Michael a blue remote control without a box or any instructions, and just tells him to ""Point, and Click"" to make it work.As these movies go, Michael finds that he can control time and other things with this remote. It's pretty creative how the remote works, especially when he can see aspects of his life through DVD special features. I though the ""Making Of"" section of Michael's life was funny particularly. There are also some funny parts where he adjusts the color of himself using the remote.However, the movie really loses its common sense, and its humor, when Sandler's character uses the Fast Forward button for various situations. Admittedly, the movie had a good way of covering up what could be a major plot hole. If you fast forward through time, what would you be doing in the eyes of everyone else around you? Would you just be standing there, moving slowly?So goes the concept of being on ""auto pilot"", where Michael goes through the motions of what he's supposed to be doing in a given place and time, but without any kind of emotion. Being in auto pilot allows him to complete his architectural work, but gradually he loses touch with his wife and kids.With that plot hole covered up, many other holes emerge when Morty reveals that the remote programs itself to automatically fast forward time according to Michael's previous commands. So when Michael fast forwarded through his cold, the remote fast forwards through other times he was sick. When his wife argues with him, ditto.Eventually, in a scene that really made me want to cry out loud, Sandler finds himself accidentally in the year 2017, where he is morbidly obese (in a fat suit that resembles Fat Bastard in the ""Austin Powers"" movies), divorced, living alone, and estranged from his family.From this point, you can tell the film is blatantly ripping off ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"", although you may be too depressed to notice. There are funny parts thrown into these later scenes, but they are blatantly crushed by the weight of the all too heavy drama in which the film finds itself.All I could do was get angry at Sandler, or at least his character, and wonder how you can screw up this royally if you have all the power in the world in one hand. Plus, if I had a magic remote in this situation, you know what I would do: USE THE PAUSE BUTTON. Why it never occurs to this character to pause time and do his architectural work is beyond me.If you're going to make a goofy comedy where David Hasselhoff is your boss, it's best to keep it funny throughout. When you throw in an exhausting cautionary tale about the meaning of life and the importance of family, you just lose credibility. Seeing this movie made me want to use a magic remote to rewind time and stop my past self from paying to see this movie. I would not mind seeing a movie solely about Morty, however, provided Christopher Walken doesn't play Russian Roulette with audience's expectations.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's actually a pretty good movie,I went into this with 0 expectation but I was honestly surprised by how good it actually was. It has a perfect mix of comedy and drama. Also had an amazing ending. Absolutely loved it.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Uneven atrocity of movie-making,"Click is horrible alright, more than most of Adam Sandler films. It is one of the most uneven atrocities I have ever seen. Borrowing elements from Frank Capra and Robert Zemeckis, but combined with Sandler's usual irreverence, it is honestly quite forgettable. A laugh here and there is enough to keep you watching, but Sandler has little cleverness. The film ultimately comes up empty-handed as a yarn of its own. Anyone could have thought of this screenplay and the ending is ridiculous. do yourself a favor and see a comedy with a script, not a comedy that requires a superb actor like Christopher Walken to stand behind a table and show up. Pure tasteless, like most of the Sandler collection of films.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Almost great, but keeps chickening out","Ever wondered what ""It's A Wonderful Life"" would have been like if it contained large amounts of obvious gross-out comedy? Wonder no more, just go rent this one. ""Click"" can be extremely touching and heart-warming at times, but then David Hasselhoff gets farted on and you're back to square one. Sandler's character feels how his life has slipped away, remorsefully thinks about all the things he missed but then screw it, let's randomly throw in three dozen liposuction jokes. The movie's often just way too Hollywood for its own good, it has a lot of potential but the makers never have the guts to be truly unpredictable. I guess the fact that's it's such an uneven film wouldn't bother me if the humor was actually funny, but as I said even that's somewhat of a letdown. The material is all just so uninspired and stale: humping pets, fat jokes, kids getting hit in the face with something, old people talking dirty, some of it even seems like rejected material from Rob Schneider movies (if that even exists). Thank God Christopher Walken drops by for a few scenes, pretty much every laugh I remember came from him. The ending is pretty much the final nail in the coffin, but thankfully it also pretty much sums up the entire movie for me: good story with lots of potential, but Hollywood turns it into a boring, predictable, risk-less snoozefest. What a waste.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
10/10,"I Absolutely LOVE this film!!! I first watched this when I was in my teens , I'm now 34 and I've probably watched it atleast 10 times . This is definitely one of if not my favourite film of all time!! Definitely underrated. Absolutely brilliant!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enticing concept but terribly inconsistent tone and pace,"So, I saw this movie when it came out in 2006. I was 13 years old. I thought the movie was pretty decent back then.However, as time went on, and I began looking at films from a more critical perspective and yeah, there is a lot to say about this movie.First of all, this story is anything but original. The man who was seduced by power? Yeah, I'm pretty sure every variation of that story has been done at this point.Basically, Adam Sandler's character is an overworked architect trying to satisfy both his family and his work colleagues. His boss, David Hasselhoff puts a certain amount of undue pressure on him to get his work done, putting Sandler's family plans to a screeching halt.Trying to make his life a bit easier, he meets Christopher Walken who is a retail salesman, who gives him a universal remote control that ""remote-controls your universe."" Sandler tries to accomplish his work goals thanks to the remote but it starts becoming self aware, skipping through chapters of his life quite literally and it suddenly turns all tragic.This is the main issue with the film: the tone. The first hour of the film is spent establishing the situation of Sandler's character and the humorous occurrences that take place once he receives the remote. Once it is discovered what the negative repercussions of the remote are, the film proceeds to skip ahead a number of years in the last few scenes, where the situation is explained with throwaway lines of expository dialogue, breaking the first rule of filmmaking: SHOW, DON'T TELL!!!! It's also quite jarring that it suddenly shifts in tone from goofy misadventures with a remote control to tragic heartbreak skipping decades of Sandler's life. No natural flow whatsoever and it takes away from the enjoyment of the film.The concept is intriguing, the only problem is that the material was not used to its full potential.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The cast of Click is a Misprint,"Prince Habeeboo is obviously Rob Schneider. Why would you say it was someone else? Marco K looks nothing like Prince Habeeboo. I loved Christopher W. The boss, David H, (am not allowed to put names in because the guidelines of this review page considers them ""junk words"") is funny but over acts this part. Sometimes when you try to be too funny you are not funny at all. I still don't understand why Rob Schneider was not credited in this movie. I have seen Doctor B in anger management. I Do love this movie and I have to keep writing because if it isn't 10 lines I can't submit this. The only reason I wanted to submit any review at all is so I could point out that Rob Schneider (apparently the only name I am allowed to type)is not credited in this movie. I looked up the actor that it says plays the part of the prince and he looks and sounds nothing like the actor that is obviously ROB SCHNEIDER!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A tired formula: Sandler could do so much better,"""Click"" is yet another case of Adam Sandler settling for the cheap gag instead of reaching for any depth of emotion or genuinely clever humor. But while he's often good at making the cheap gags very funny, he misses the target almost every time here. Unlike ""Spanglish"" or ""50 First Dates"" there is little substance here, and unlike ""Happy Gilmore"" the jokes range from recycled to stupid to just plain wrong. (Two different segments using bad stereotypes of Japanese people were very offensive.) The cast, the humor, and the plot resolution are all borrowed from either earlier Sandler flicks or other movies.The only saving grace here is the cast, which collectively made a valiant effort to make something from nothing. Christopher Walken and David Hasslehoff were effective, but were utilized in completely predictable ways, missing opportunities to play off-type for greater effect. Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner provided solidly professional comedic support as Sandler's parents. And Kate Beckinsale was good as the straight foil to Sandler's typically over-the-top characterization.Overall, this was an unoriginal and mostly unfunny effort in which Sandler and his production company have simply dredged up the same formula which has worked for them in the past. It doesn't work this time. A few people walked out of the theater during the matinée I saw: I wish I had joined them.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I Have No Idea What I Just Watched, But I Liked It","This movie isn't sure what it wants to be. There are too many comedic moments for it to be a drama but the drama occupies the second half of the movie, so it can't be a comedy.Whatever this movie is, I'm glad I watched it. All the trailers painted this movie as a big ""What If"" scenario played up for laughs, so I didn't see it when it first came out. It looked a little too stupid and nonsensical. But, there comes a time when your so bored, and no one is around to witness it, that you will give the stupid and nonsensical a try.So I walked in, I saw all the bits from the trailers, and then the movie suddenly became ""It's A Wonderful Life"", only protagonist Michael Newman (it's Adam Sandler; like, the same Adam Sandler we got with every early 2000s Happy Madison movie) is stuck in this brave new world that he sacrificed his entire life for with no hope of ever turning it back.My one complaint about the movie is that the ending is a bit of a cop-out, but they patch it up pretty well thanks to a few heartfelt words from Christopher Walken.Suffice to say, I was pretty surprised when this movie went from being an okay Adam Sandler comedy to a tearful message not to let your life go by; to live in every moment of it; that it's an expression of joy, and that if you take it seriously, you're gonna lose. It's funny, it's well written, it's well paced, it's well acted, it's just a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Funny and emotional,"I loved this movie! This has to be one of the funniest and heart felt movies that Adam Sandler had done because it was very funny! I saw it in theaters and I bought the DVD. Even though it had some explicit lines it goes great with the mood and the dialog of the story. It shows how life would be if you could fast-forward, rewind, play, pause, etcetera.. Very funny, enjoyable for family and suitable for all ages. Love this movie so much and after like 3 years after I still laugh and laugh, it never gets old because it's like the jokes are still new. And I loved the fact that it's emotional too. I almost cried because it was so heart-touching, but I'm not going to say anything because if you haven't seen it, see it now so you can see for yourself...I highly recommend watching it! My rating, 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Half comedy, half not...","Adam Sandler usually makes me laugh. The way he acts/over acts; he seems to act more like a real person than a character.. Most of the time. In Click he is a normal man who works too much and doesn't spend enough time with his family, someone many people can relate too. The first half of this movie is a comedy with some new jokes, some old jokes, and some good timing. The other half is this summer's science fiction thriller with twists, turns, and lessons.Being promoted with the super bowl as an Adam Sandler comedy makes the second half of this movie rather confusing. It's not that it is complicated, it is just that it is misplaced. The comedy portions are unrealistically funny in a good way, then you are expected to take the movie's premise seriously and really care about the main character. It doesn't fail completely, but the sudden switch make this a mediocre movie at best.Adam Sandler is funny and has his moments. Christopher Walken, is well, Christopher Walken.. He's the reason we watch these movies again; all he has to do is be in screen or have his voice heard and we smile. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful and that is really all she is for most of the movie and you can tell they try to focus on this, but I'm a guy so I really don't mind. David Hasselhoff is actually pretty good for David Hasselhoff. He has some good lines and is fairly funny when he's on screen. Finally, I'll mention Henry Winkler who always brings a certain bizarre humor feel, which is good and is another one who makes you smile just being there. Oh, and Sean Astin is in it and he doesn't really have a big enough part to make you really laugh, but then again he will always be ""Sam"" in my mind.To wrap it up, the movie isn't trash. The actors do their thing well and the jokes are mostly there, but the focus isn't. If you were to start this movie, leave part way through and come back in the last half and hour you would think you were seeing a completely different Adam Sandler movie. This would be okay if you didn't think that while actually sitting through the whole movie. Had a good start, but ultimately lost it's way.5 out of 10 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
worst movie i ever saw,"This was no doubt, hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I went into the movie with the expectations of an Adam Sandler movie. Now I understand about his demise from incredibly funny, amazingly caustic comedian to a boring, boring, 'regular actor.' I wasn't expecting a Billy Madison or even a Happy Gilmore but I was at least expecting to laugh once or twice a-la 'Big Daddy' or '50 First Dates.' But sorely disappointed would be the understatement of the century. I laughed once and that was only at the part that was over-played on the previews and commercials. It was predictable and painfully so. Every scene was exactly what you thought it would be, every phrase as 'cliché' as the one before. The entire movie was premised on a giant cliché: you shouldn't work so hard. Well, gee, thats genuine and novel...oh wait! It wasn't even funny. The kids were bad acting, the mother was terrible and Adam Sandler was at his absolute worst. He wasn't funny. He was angry and not in a tolerable manner. It was pretty much terrible. You should see this movie if you have 3 hours to waste and don't have a wall in which you can smash your head against in close range.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Unlikable male lead, bad jokes, and undeveloped characters make ""Click"" a misclick.","I saw this with some friends of mine not expecting much... I knew this wasn't going to be Chinatown or anything... but this was really bad.For the most part, I blame Adam Sandler. Sandler has become periodically less funny every movie starting with Happy Gilmore. He's lost his boyish charm, he looks older, but his personality is essentially the same, so watching him becomes a real chore.They have all the Sandler classics in this - nut kicking, fart jokes, sex jokes, the whole shabang. It falls short because the context is just... weak. His wife (Beckinsale) is one of the hottest women I've ever seen on screen. Which is what made little sense, she was such a lovable soul, his kids were very sweet and cute, he had a good job... What was the problem? His character was such a jerk. There was no REASON for this guy to be such a tightwad, or become one as was suggested in the film. One scene had his wife basically throwing herself at him for sex, but wanted a back rub first... he insisted he go back to his paperwork, so he used the remote to speed up the process. This is what I'm talking about - I don't care how much of a tightwad I am, my lovely loving wife who isn't in the wrong throughout the whole movie asks me for sex, I gladly accept and spend time with her... I mean - not even his unlikable character can be the excuse for this...The other problem is like most comedies, you need that low point to build up the the happy ending... this was trying so hard to be depressing (which I must admit was at some points) that you almost forget you are watching a comedy... Sandler trying to act is a little embarrassing, he's not the worst out there... but he is really unnatural throughout a lot of the teary moments.All that considered, the soundtrack isn't bad, a lot of the time I was happy to hear a tune I hadn't heard in a while, or one that I really love.My advice - seriously, rent Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison for the 100th time and fire up the DVD player, you'll thank me for it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the project could be better moving the project to Troma,"The film is really horrible. The plot is very stupid and the gags are mostly disgusting. Only two reasons to give one point to this film: Kate Beckinsale and IMDb's policy (minimmum=1). The film could have been a better one just reducing the budget to nearly nothing, firing the two boys (Sandler and Hasselhoff) and moving the project to Troma. The Tromaville people can use the silly plot for a new Toxic Avenger episode (the over-sized Sandler was not too far from Toxie) and they probably exploit the most bizarre details (like the planet of the duck-f*cker dogs...). I usually dodge this kind of films, in this case I was framed (expected a romantic comedy). My recommendation is... Please don't go and don't rent it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Charming and funny movie by Adam Sandler,"Most of Adam Sandler's movie has its unique and great charm that always seem to pull me in. The movie seem to include all kinds of genres into it. Comedy, Romance, Drama and a little bit of horror. Well the main genre is of course comedy but when it gets to the scenes which has romance or the sad parts, it truly evokes that emotion in me instead of giving an impression of a comedy movie trying to include love and sad scenes.The story revolves around Michael Newman (Sandler) an average family guy and promising architect who struggles to please both his boss and his family with his family usually the one getting disappointed. Having had enough of this, he ""fast-forwards"" through life with the universal remote given to him by Morty (Walken). Of course things don't usually go according to plan.The story floats along well with more light-heartedness and comedy earlier on in the film but gets darker and there's even a little twist at the latter part which is quite predictable. Every character plays their part well especially the little adorable girl that play as adam sandler's kid daughter. Her reaction to a particular scene was so funny and cute. Its a feel-good movie that will surely entertain everyone from young to old. The only people that could hate this movie are those that don't understand adam sandler's humor.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Typical Adam Sandler bathroom humor,"A movie with a lot of potential and some very funny moments is totally negated by the typical Adam Sandler bathroom humor. Take away all of the unnecessary crudeness and there would be a nice reasonable length movie instead of 2+ hours of sophomoric humor. Gags that were semi-funny the first time lost the humor every time it was repeated. This movie has been hyped as Sandler being a grown-up; unfortunately, I found very little evidence of a more mature Sandler.

Potentially interesting plot ruined by Sandler,"Before renting this movie I had heard from friends, as well as from reading reviews, that feelings about this film were mixed. So, I figured, what the heck, check it out for yourself. Well, I did. My wife and I were hesitant to rent it because we are older than the typical audience that enjoys Sandler's movies. But, since we found ""Punch Drunk Love"" somewhat entertaining, we took a chance on ""Click"".We were turned off by the typical crude humor Sandler is known for delivering. However, we felt that the other main actors (Beckinsale and Walken) did a nice job. Walken, in particular, reminded us of the eccentric, wacky scientist played by Christopher Lloyd in ""Back to the Future"", which we really loved. Winkler and Kavner were just so-so - a bit over the top, especially for ""old folks"" scenes.If the plot had been focused more on the serious rather than the comedic elements, the film would have come across as being less scattered. From our perspective, the serious messages were worth the time and cost of renting this movie. But Sandler is just not a good actor. It was hard to feel real empathy for him - not because the situations he was in weren't tragic, but because he uses very little facial or voice modulation to convince us he is in pain or rueful about mistaken actions he has made in his life. Now, if Robin Williams had taken this role when he was younger (e.g., when he did ""Bicentennial Man""), the film would have been both funnier and sadder.It was interesting to note that Sandler was one of the producers of this film. Too bad he couldn't rein in his ego and look for another lead actor instead of taking the role himself. The film would have been better had he done so.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Most Surprising Movie I've Ever Seen,"In order for me to write a review, there must be a good reason. Im not one of those people that can just pull some huge review out of my @$$ for every movie I see. Click is something special, and I feel obligated to do my part to make people aware of the fact that this is actually a great movie, and not at all what you probably think it is.Let me start by saying, Click is advertised all wrong. It is advertised as just another mindless Adam Sandler comedy. And while it certainly has its typical Adam Sandler moments, it has true heart. Something you hardly see in a Sandler movie.It starts off light-hearted and comical, and remains that way for a while. However, slowly but surely, you watch as the transition between goofy comedy and deeply emotional drama begins. The contrast is stark, and of a magnitude not often seen. The truth is, there are several scenes that are brutally sad. One in particular really threw me for a loop, and is among the most emotional scenes I've ever laid eyes on. In the midst of all the heavy stuff, there are some little reminders that, hey, you are still watching an Adam Sandler movie. Quite frankly, I could have done without them. And it is one of the movie's few true flaws. In my opinion at least.Many people bash the ending. But the reality is, it was written exactly the way it had to be, in order to make the movie as effective as it is. Had it ended differently, the whole message behind it would have been diminished somewhat. That's all I will say.The bottom line is, it is an incredibly overlooked and misrepresented movie. One with some deeply moving moments, and a powerful message to go along with it. I recommend it to everyone, unless you really have a hard time with the sad stuff. In that case, it may be best to avoid it. At the very least, it will surprise you. At best, it will shock you, and really have an impact on you emotionally.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I mean, a remote that controls the universe is something anyone would want to see but that didn't change the fact that this movie lacked all sense of quality humor. It is very irritating to me these days to see a lot of movies with potential go up in smoke because American settle for the casual lame pathetic humor.Adam Sandler, given, is a pretty funny guy in his movies, sucked here. Personally, i hate all Happy Madison movies, except for ""Anger Management"", which was awesome. This movie had all this potential but the director, writer, whoever is mainly responsible, failed because they wanted to appeal to the average Joe's slapstick and loser genre of humor. So you can see why this gets so annoying. The same thing happened with ""40 year old virgin"". To appeal to American stereotype humor, the movie sucked.Getting back to ""Click"". People who say that it is very sad (there are a few sappy scenes, but they are corny and cheesy, not sad)are pathetic and ridiculous. This movie is not sad at all nor is it honestly funny.I give it a four because there were some parts that resembled Simpson/family guy humor that made me laugh.

"great piece of work by Adam Sandler, an eye opener for some!","It's a movie which should be watched by each family and forced to be watched by some who have made work their life. One thing I can guarantee is that after watching this film, your prospective towards family will change for sure! In living the life like a ""rat-race"", we have lost the value of family and love. In order to succeed,we loose the ones which are our true success; our loved ones, they only will be there who will stand by us till the light leave our eyes. The movie has pin-pointed the main issue which needs to be enlighten with some good humor pieces and most of all with a very unique way which keeps you hold throughout the movie.My movie ratings are on following basis each having 2 stars:1. Plot: 2/2 according to me, the story could not have become any better. It was a perfect mix of emotions, humor and fantasy.2. Cast&Crew: 1/2 all the supporting actors were good; not being an insatiable but in the main roles, I would have loved to see Jim Carrey for Adam Sandler and Morgan Freeman for Christopher Walken.3. Imagination: 2/2 as I said, a perfect way to pinpoint a very important issue.4. Cinematography: 2/2 how to bring a perfect blend of drama with fantasy not leaving the humor behind, this movie is a perfect example of it.5.How much it satisfied its genre: 2/2 some will say comedy was less but to me asking for better than this would be demanding too much from the director.So overall rating- 9THANKS",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Movie that becomes a lesson for your life!Remarkable.,"There are few movies that touched my mind like Click,with this story you will see that life is not only work.The director give us a methaphorical lesson with this film,you have to see it,and maybe in a part of the film you will cry :) Plus,with Adam Sandler and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale you just cant miss it. Sandler is both funny and serious at the right moments, Kate Bekinsale is great as Donna his wife, and Christopher Walken is excellent as always as Morty, the Bed, Bath and Beyond Employee. David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, and Jennifer Coolidge are funny in their supporting roles in this film. Australian audiences expecting to see Sophie Monk in a major role will be disappointed as she is honestly a very minor character in the film, in contrast to what the Comedy Chanel is running about her on Foxtel/Austar. 10/10 Enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This remarkable movie saved my bad day,"I have no slightest idea how some people might dislike Adam Sandler. This movie, along with many others from his filmography, shows that you can get a pure gem when you blend funny dumb humor with a very serious and resonating life lesson. I enjoyed every second of the movie, laughed and cried my eyes out, happily smiled and had a lot of thoughts popping up. I've been watching movies and read books quite often for the last 2 years, but I can't remember the last time I had such a mixture of strong emotions.""Click"" reminded me of ""Ferriss Buller's Day Off"" because they play around the same idea, but from different angles.Let me end this review with a great quote to ponder:""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.""",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Sandler Doesn't Click, Only Stumbles","Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is a workaholic architect who lately, has been putting his career before his family. While at a Bed Bath & Beyond one night shopping for a universal remote he meets a man by the name of Morty. (Christopher Walken) It's Morty that ends up changing Michael's life with the gift of a remote that not only controls the TV and other household appliances, but his own universe. Upon discovering the abilities the remote has Michael begins to use it to fast-forward through what he considers unpleasant and annoying. Such as fights with his wife and foreplay. As he does this the remote begins creating its own memory and eventually starts to automatically choose what to fast-forward through. Michael unremittingly goes further and further through his life as the remote continues to fast-forward. In turn, he realizes the importance of spending time with his family.'Click' seemingly starts out will with its cutesy family wisecracks. And the first couple instances where Michael uses the remote for his own personal kicks is somewhat funny. After that, there really are no laughs to be had. It's just the same joke exhibited over and over again with different alterations. Even the dog Sundance's incessant humping of a stuffed duck gets old real quick as the film advances. This is tragic because 'Click' is being passed off as a comedy but unmistakably isn't funny.Another fault the film bears is the main character Micheal is nowhere as entertaining as Morty. Not only did Walken do a better job of acting, he is overall more enjoyable to watch. Truth be told, Morty is actually the only thing that holds this mess together. And only slightly better than average direction by Frank Caraci who also did two of Sandler's other films ('The Waterboy' and 'The Wedding Singer') only contributes dullness to this already colorless movie.There are however a few heartfelt moments displayed throughout the extent of the film. But in the final scenes there's supposed to be a big profound moment when Michael desperately tries to tell his son how family comes first with his last breaths but Sandler just doesn't deliver. Who honestly expected splendid acting from him though? But despite all the downsides 'Click' presents, many people will still enjoy it. What can I say, fart and sex jokes sell.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not Really Funny,"This is one of those movies where if you have seen the previews, you've already seen every funny moment in the film. I can't really figure out why a movie that starts out in such a promising manner takes a U turn in the middle to become so depressing.It seems as though someone once told Adam Sandler that you can't make a movie a comedy from start to finish, so he is always looking to inject some ""drama"" or ""moral"" to his work. Unfortunately in this movie the drama is so over the top, you almost forget this was supposed to be funny in the first place. The premise for ""Click"" was clever, but after the first half hour it is no longer entertaining.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

They didn't get it right with the humor,"The film impresses with its idea of rewinding time, which is the main concept of the film. However, the beginning of the film can seem rather tedious, and interesting events only begin to occur in the last 40 minutes of the film.In addition, the film suffers from some poor attempts at humor, especially toilet humor, which can be frustrating for the audience. Nevertheless, the film's ending is more or less acceptable and is able to brighten the impression of the film.Of particular note is the scene with the father at the end of the film, which is able to elicit an emotional response from the audience and even bring on a tear.Overall, if you value your time, I cannot recommend this film. However, if you are interested in the idea of rewinding time and don't mind some lame attempts at humor, then this movie may be of interest to you.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Adam Sandler can do more than just comedy!,"Heading into this movie, I was expecting the usual Adam Sandler movie offering of lots of laughs at other characters expense, one-liners, inappropriate behaviour and sex jokes. you know, the same kinda stuff in most of his other movies (apart from Punch Drunk Love). I thought it would be a fun and forget about it later movie. Well, it was definitely fun and lots of laughs were had by all. At the same time it was a very moving comedy movie. and I was reminded of ""Punch Drunk Love"" where Sandler did more that just what we expect is his usual comedic acting, he did that here. Just like that, he can play a dramatic role. There was also another side to ""Click"" as I said. It had heart. ""Click"" had a really good moral and life lesson. I actually saw this movie at a preview session and didn't have to buy a ticket, most times I see movies at previews I think ""Cool, glad it was free. Maybe I'll watch it again when it appears on TV"" (which is how I've felt about most of Adam Sandlers other movies). Well, this one is different, I'm definitely going to see it again (bringing my family along) and spend more time appreciating the blessings I didn't think were blessings yesterday. Thanks to the warmth Sandler bought to the screen and role.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable formula flick for Sandler quickly becomes tedious,"Wouldn't it be great if you had a universal remote that you could use to pause, rewind and fast forward your life as you see fit? Skip past all the boring stuff, pause and rewind all the fun stuff. It would be a blast right? Then again, it does kind of sound like the typical ""be careful what you wish for?"" Hollywood movie.Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman. He is your typical ""Hollywood"" middle class, white collar husband and father. Impossibly cute kids, impossibly gorgeous wife, seemingly great job as an architect... not many problems to be found on the surface. Of course, as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that our protagonist needs more time in each day to play the roles of father, husband and successful business man. Through some goofy circumstances Sandler bumps into mad-scientist Morty (played for a paycheck by Christopher Walken) and obtains the ""universal remote"". This remote seemingly answers all of Michael's problems. It gives him all the time he needs to become a bigshot at the office, after which he'll have all the time he wants to spend with his family. Of course, comic and dramatic hijinks ensue, eventually leading Sandler's character to realize what the true meaning of life is all about.Click is highly formulaic and as such, highly predictable. If you don't see every major plot point coming way before it's delivered, then either you weren't paying much attention or you haven't seen that many movies. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with formulaic and nothing wrong with predictable. Movies succeed or fail far more on execution than originality. Hollywood rarely reinvents the wheel, it just churns out different variations. The only real problem with Click is that it gets lost in it's own message and is eventually drowned by the weight of it's dramatic second half.Everything starts out great. The comedy is delivered at a pretty consistent pace without ever diving too far into low-brow areas that Sandler's early movies were known for. There are some great supporting performances from Nick Swardson, Jennifer Coolidge, Henry Winkler and especially David Hasselhoff. This is easily the best performance I ever recall seeing from ol' Dave. He comes so close to going over the top without ever getting there and steals just about every scene he's in. The plot is enjoyable and the characters are funny, but you just know the other foot is going to fall. Things just can't keep going smooth for Michael.Once things turn south for our protagonist, so does the move itself. Michael realizes that the remote is not the silver bullet fix he thought it was and the script does everything it can to make sure we understand that. We end up with a plodding second act that meanders and quickly loses steam. Sandler is allowed to stretch some dramatic muscles and does an admirable job, it's just unfortunate that he is allowed to indulge. The plot is lost with far more views into the future than need be. Eventually the point of the story is beaten into the ground and everything devolves into little more than Rick Baker's makeup effects. By the time the inevitable ""Tug at the heartstrings"" moment arrives, it's impact is dulled by the ponderous journey it took to get there.Overall, I admire Click for what it tried to accomplish. Sandler is really a better talent then he's ever been given credit for and his performance here is really solid. The problem is that Click should have left some of the second act on the cutting room floor instead of going out of it's way to play up Sandler's dramatic side. What could have been a truly enjoyable 90 minutes clocked in at a somewhat lumbering 107.Click won't make you want to change the channel, but it probably won't make you rewind and watch again either.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mixed Feelings,"""Click"" stars Adam Sandler as Michael Newman, a workaholic architect that is putting his job first and family second. Frustrated because he can't turn on the television one night, he storms into Bed, Bath, and Beyond to get a universal remote that can control everything from his ceiling fan to his television. Michael meets Morty (Chrisopher Walken), an strange inventor who gives Michael his ""universal"" remote: a remote to remote control his universe. Fast forwarding, rewinding, and pausing ensue, but the remote soon programs itself to Michael's preferences: fast forwarding through arguments with his wife (Kate Beckinsale), promotions, and sickness.I have mixed feelings about this movie. The first half was like an old Adam Sandler movie. Crude remarks and cursing kids open the first half. The second half is somewhat a comedy about how we miss the little things in life. But in the end, ""Click"" was a fun summer movie that shows us that Adam Sandler can do anything from comedy to drama.8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Apparently Some People Liked It,"They keep letting this guy (Adam Sandler) make movies; most likely because audiences flock to see most of his stuff, as was the case with ""Click"" (2006). I'm not going to go into a rant about the sophistication level of those who patronize their local multi-plexus. Suffice it to say that ""Click"" is as good as at least half the big-budget ($70 Million) stuff that is being released to the mainstream public. It raked in some serious cash last July.Apparently Sadler has a thing for Frank Capra, as this is his second attempt to remake a Capra classic (insert ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town""). ""Click"" is Sandler's take on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). At least I assume the Jimmy Stewart classic was what they were aiming at because the end result seems more of a blend of ""Scrooged"" and ""Being There"". ""Click"" is probably Sandler's all-time best performance; in the style of and equal in quality to a good Tim Allen performance. He is assisted by a supporting cast of recognizable actors; Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, and Sean Astin. There is also a brief appearance by Jack Nicholson's daughter Lorraine, who looks amazingly like Jack back in his ""Easy Rider"" days; this is actually kind of scary.Kate Beckinsale has the same role that Winona Ryder had in Mr. Deeds. While neither of them rank up there with Jean Arthur (the heroine in both Capra classics) they are still two of the best actresses out there today. I'm assuming both were very well paid because the scripts offer little opportunity for either to showcase their considerable acting skills. In fact the mismatch between talent and opportunity produces a strange discordance in both films. This might be one of those cases where a less talented performer would have been a better fit.George Bailey (and Scrooge) had an attitude adjustment after being granted visions of the past and the future by his guardian angel. Michael Newman's (Sandler) angel (Walken), who works in the local Bed, Bath and Beyond store, gives him a television remote control that he can click whenever he wants to fast-forward his life past the parts that are annoying distractions to his workaholic aspirations. At first this seems like a wonderful device as he can dispense with the family interactions that complicate his life. But Michael soon discovers that the device programs itself and shifts him further and further into the future. The remote can also freeze a scene, mute the sound, and select past scenes from his life; but the film mostly concentrates on its fast-forwarding function.""Click"" is technically a comedy and apparently some find a lot to laugh about. There are some funny moments early in the production but I found the humor to be in short supply for most of the story; relying on humping dogs for its only running gag.Ultimately ""Click"" has a ""Groundhog Day"" sort of theme. That in tuning out much of what life has to offer we miss life itself. Since this cold detached way of living is what most of us do (at least to some degree) it tends to undermine any comic quality the film might have. Of course unless your taste in comedy runs to Sandler's usual focus on bodily functions it doesn't take much to do this anyway.Inexplicably, even at his most detached, patient and accepting people surround Michael. His wife (Beckinsale), his parents (Winkler and Kavner), and his children continue to love him despite the absence of any lovable qualities. Similar to those who love this film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great comedy meets a great lesson in life,"I expected this to be a great comedy with one of the best in the business: Adam Sandler.

If you want great entertainment combined with a truly well taught lesson in life, this is for you.Oh yeah, and Walken is fabulous, but I expected nothing less from this great man.

While the concept and ultimate message is clever and good, the way it was gone about was an absolute disappointment.

Great idea eviscerated by jawdroppingly bad 'comedy'.,"Credit where credit's due, this was a really good concept for a movie, and small sections of it played out well, but man the delivery and the worst style of comedy just gutted the flow and feel of the movie.It's a testament to the strength of the core idea that the ending had some emotional weight to it, but did any thinking human actually read the script before they made this travesty?We know Sandler can be a great serious actor, but this was off by even his standards and I make that comment having avoided most of his 'comedy' movies.Unfortunately his shtick under cut the vibe of the core story because we could never connect with his jerk of a character and why his beautiful wife and family would ever love him. He does nothing in this film to deserve it and so crying for his life lost doesn't register as it should.Let's hope someone grabs this script, does a remake and does it right, with out the puerile embarrassing 'jokes'. Did I mention this movie also aged very badly? The sexist stuff lands like someone dropped a case of wine bottles in an echoey room.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Click a Great Pick,"I am an avid film-goer. I go at least twice a week, and most of my paychecks go to renting DVDs and going to the theater. I love movies, and have seen more than my share of great ones, funny ones, terrible ones, sad ones, etc, etc.Last night went to see Click and it was awesome. For those who love classic Adam Sandler-- there's plenty in this movie for you with Sandler's quick wit and fun one-liners. But for those more partial to Spanglish-serious Sandler, then that's here too. This film is quite versatile and it goes from being down-right hysterical to heartbreakingly sad to adorably sweet and funny again. Sandler was great, adorable and hilarious. Kate Beckinsale was her usually hot self and so incredibly charming in her role. Christopher Walken was classic Walken and quite funny and off-the-wall. And there were so many other characters in the movie that make it enjoyable from Henry Winkler's father role to David Hasselhoff's boss role to Rachel Dratch's secretary.I have long been giving personal critiques of movies, and long reading and critiquing the words of movie critics but have never actually posted my own critique on IMDb. But with this film, I feel I must. So many are hammering this film, but you have to remember one thing. This is a Happy Madison, Adam Sandler film. If you don't like him--then this movie isn't for you.

The purchase of the remote starts the coaster ride of fun and laughter, as Sandlar learns how to 'apply"" the remote to his family that will give HIM maximum affects.

A scene making fun of Arab customers was moronic and tasteless. The workaholic dad is totally unbelievable and lacks any depth whatsoever. Who would go out late at night to buy a remote when you have a deadline to meet? This movie also contains some of the most in-your-face product placement in recent memory. The only redeeming feature is an appearance by Christopher Walken, but it's not enough to recommend the movie. Avoid it like the plague.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie blindsides you with how touching it is,"I was initially interested in this movie as a longtime supporter of Adam Sandler (also Kate Beckinsale) and because it seemed good for a few mindless laughs.Instead, ""Click"" is heartwarming, touching and makes you think of how precious life is, all without preaching. I actually cried more than once and not just for the usual reasons. Additionally, Sandler and Beckinsale surprisingly have amazing chemistry together and with their on screen 'children'/Sandler's on screen parents. It wasn't hard to buy them as a modern family who cares very deeply for one another, but is faced with the everyday craziness of living in the 21st century. It does have the funny moments the trailer shows, but it is so much more than that and a movie that I truly enjoyed.Go see 'Click'.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The good and the bad,"I feel the need to give this movie a five just because of the brilliant ending.First, let's start with the beginning.The first hour or more is pretty bad.....poor joke after poor joke. Of course there were some moments but manly you could hear embarrassed chuckles around you throughout the movie. It's somewhat interesting but to me, comedy is the hardest to make. You don't only need to entertain people, you have to also make them laugh and if they don't then not only will not like this movie but they will feel embarrassed for it. Before even seeing Click I had the idea that it was going to flop. And it did.At first.You see, the ending had a much, much more serious tone. While you watch maybe 30 minutes of the ending not only are there emotional scenes but it also really makes you laugh for real at the funny parts. For people who have even experienced anything emotional in their life they seriously might cry. The ending also made you leave with a happy and warm feeling for Adam Sandlers character and, you know, just made you smile.If you watch this movie try watching, just try, watching all of it. The ending is the best part. It's the only reason why I felt the movie wasn't a total and complete flop.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great!!,"Out of the hundreds of movies I have seen, this would be the only movie that make me cry. Firstly, great casting. Kate Beckinsale was amazing, I doubted that she could pull off the part of a stay at home mom, but she was great, her and Adam were perfect for this movie. Adam Sandler showed a side which I had never seen, caring, yes, he has shown the side, but not with such compassion. Henry Winkler portrayed the role of the grandfather who still wants his little boy, perfectly. The children brought so much chemistry to the movie, the little girls connection to her father, and the boy's ""I want to be like Dad"" attitude were played well. The only people I would have recasted were Jennifer Cooligde, because she did not seem to have anthing in common with Kate, and David Hasslehoff, because after his part in Spongebob, it's hard to take him as an intimidating superior. Secondly, awesome script. The comedy mixed with the drama perfectly, . Lastly, this movie lets you feel the pain he feels. Although the commercials showed its comical side, this movie goes so deep in it's emotions, I can only say that it was amazing. Adam Sandler was the father figure that I am use to.

Somewhat deeper than required,"Clearly the movie about the remote control for anything can not be considered a world cinematography heritage in the first place.

So, we thought it was going to be fun and it was, until the problems such as father-son relationships and whatever else started to materialise. Now, I wanted to cry instead of laughing in the end. Under any other circumstances I would consider this a good outcome as the movie touched me deep inside, but in this case I left the cinema confused, which should not have been the outcome for a comedy about magical clicking device. It was entertaining, but I would not strongly recommend it to friends. Just if they need advice for how to kill some time.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you're a mature young adult and driven to be successful, this movie is a must see!","After reading some of the reviews here, I actually registered on IMDb just so I could address some of the crap people are saying bout this movie.Some people are saying it's not funny and they're not American. Not living in our culture every day, my guess is that a lot of the jokes went right over their heads. This is obviously not the movie's fault!Those offended by the unnecessary ""raunchy"" humor need to wake the f--- up. If you were ignorant enough to go see an Adam Sandler movie and expect a wholesome family movie, you deserved to see a stuffed duck's butt-hole get ripped open. To the parents who took their young children to a PG-13 movie with Adam Sandler, you deserve to explain why that duck's butt-hole was ripped open! There are plenty of wholesome family movies already out there...this movie was made for the younger adult crowd and being a younger adult (29) I'm glad they made it exactly the way they did.I think it's ridiculous how anyone could bag on the acting. For one, it's supposed to be a ""cute comedy"", not Oscar material. Secondly, I think the acting was actually quite good for a movie of this genre. For example, it was almost creepy how much the guy playing the grown-up version of Sandler's son reminded me of Sandler...the way he talked, facial expressions, etc. For a second, I almost thought it might be Sandler in makeup.The people saying it's a dumb story or too serious/not realistic are either not human or they're simply not mature enough to get the point, period.In addition to there being tons of humor for everyone, there are lots of little ""inside jokes"" for long-time Sandler fans, which I think is a nice bonus.Bottom line......For the 25 and older crowd who've been out of college long enough to understand what a rat race that life can be, this movie WILL make you think. However, if you're also driven to be successful and have a family you care about, this story hits especially hard...hard enough that it will make you cry and maybe even change the way you live your life.That said, if you also happen to like Adam Sandler and his brand of humor, this movie could be one of your favorite movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Click"" is an Adolescent Flick","""Click"" is truly an adolescent flick. It stars Adam Sandler as Michael Newman. Newman is an architect who is more closely tied up to his job than to his family. His wife, Donna Newman, is a very pretty sight and is aptly played by Kate Beckinsale. Christopher Walken plays Morty, a peculiar electronics salesman at Bed Bath & Beyond. He provides Newman with a universal remote which truly is universal. David Hasselhoff plays John Ammer, Michael's boss who is overbearing, and gives a comical performance. The bits are predictable, and there is much very adolescent language and gestures that appeals to the children in the house, but it is an ephemeral chuckle that one mostly hears in the theater. This film can be missed without much concern.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow what a film,"Do not bother to read the reviews. Do not bother to watch the trailers. Do not even begin to listen to others who say ""Adam Sandler is so funny, Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore are classics"". Adam Sandler has a great run. Click, the feature film, was his plummet after the peak. This is by far the worst movie ever created. Not because of Adam Sandler, but he really didn't help the cause much. Absolutely do not watch.

Cried and loved it!!!,"This movie is just one of those who are so impactful on those watching it!So many important, the most important life lessons, shown through great humor, amazing emotions and beautiful story!They just dont make movies like this anymore, Adam Sandler is by far one of the best actors and producers that brought so much happiness and also great lessons on absolutely lovable way!I watched it first long time ago, but it had much bigger impact on me watching it now in my 30s.Its one of those must see movies for anyone, doesn't matter which genre or actors you prefer, this is a must!Beautiful!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of Sandler's greats!,"I thought it would be a typical comic performance of Sandler; something which would have been fine, but they presented something else! What a story, comedy classic moments throughout the entire film, even in the last few minutes and don't even get me started on the actors! Sandler, of course,was fine, Beckinsale a nice addition, but adding in the grand old actor Henry Winkler, coupled with the comic visage of Hasselhoff.Walken provided the perfect eeriness and instability, as he has in many of his previous films (e.g. Stepford Wives). Finally, the talent of 'Marge Simpson', Julie Kavner and the insanity of Jennifer Coolidge, it proves and will prove to be one of Sandler's greatest films. Only shame could have come from the ending, could have been rounded off better. Aside from that, bring some tissues; crying in this film is inevitable!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Do Not fast forward Your life Too Far Ahead.....,"This is a first for me, as I have been to our local cinema to see this, usually I review a film that is in my collection. Right, now for the film, I really enjoyed it, Imagine you could control things in your lives, smart eh! not really when you start fast forwarding your life, you find things happen that you do not want to happen, I found the film funny, and serious at the same time, The remote control, does have other good uses, such as turning the volume down on screaming children and barking dogs, The pause we saw, can be used for hitting someone and then walking away, later on we release the pause control, and OWWW! That hurt. It is also handy if I had it to stop speeding car drivers and To lock doors downstairs while I am on the internet or trying to watch something on telly. I found the actor that Played Micheal a good actor, and the special effects where I found very clever indeed, But Micheal should of listened to the shop keeper who gave him the remote, Also this film shows us, that we rely on remote controls more than ever now, it was also a surprise to me to see David Hasslehoff, I thought that kit the car would not be far off! but not this time, I also think that i would be frightened if I dreamt that dream, why did Micheal not use the back or rewind button ? also what would of happened if the remote had been fitted with an eject button, you could use that to eject someone off your favourite seat in your lounge, or to put the dog or cat outside! Also do not forget the OFF Button. is fitted to remotes. What would of happened if Micheal used that? that I would of liked to have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Funny and heartwarming,"I have always enjoyed Adam Sandler movies. He has a certain quality about him that makes him funny no matter what he does. However, in ""Click"" he shows a serious side that many of us have never seen. Michael Newman (Sandler) is caught in a problem that nearly every family faces. Work or family? Of course, he also can never manage to turn his television on without setting off some other electronic device in his home. His wife is played by the talented Kate Beckinsale, who is not clad in leather nor defeating evil like in her previous movie. When Newman travels to Bed, Bath, and Beyond to find a universal remote his world is turned upside down. His remote controls everything, not just his television. With his new found device he toys around a little, skipping traffic, arguments, and family dinners. However, when the remote suddenly starts controlling him, Michael is thrown into even more problems than he began with. This is not your average Adam Sandler movie, and I will warn you, bring tissues! The touching moral to the story is likely to bring tears to even the toughest men and women.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
not like any other Adam Sandler movie i've ever seen,"this movie was great, i really did like it. Adam Sandler gives a great performance throughout the film... i never expected to cry while watching this movie, and its not a cry from laughing so hard kind of cry... its a heart felt movie with consequences... id recommend this movie to anyone who likes Adam Sandler... the whole movie was scripted beautifully... i would go and watch this movie 10 more times and i would probably cry every time, it makes me think of my family and how much time i really spend with them... it will make the audience think about their life, and how much time they spend working and with their family.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Nice idea, but torn between being a juvenile comedy  and drama.","This movie seems geared towards families, in fact my 8 year old daughter was bugging me to see this movie. Fortunately I saw it without her and boy was I glad about that!!Sandler goes for the least common denominator here, he peppers the dialog with enough profanity to fill a swimming pool. Even the child actors let the curses fly. For why? I always believed when a movie lacks some serious comedic content the makers decide to reach far into the desperation bag and pull out the ""everybody in this movie swears like a prisoner.""Aside from that, Sandlers mom was distractingly annoying, Henry Winkler was great, and Sandlers wife was stunningly beautiful and believable.The story was okay, but my niece and I called the ending almost from the beginning, the message is one that is probably very much needed to be heard by most of American parents-not just dads.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly Unexpected Movie from Adam,"I'll start off saying I love his films. They are hilarious but usually one notch above parity's in seriousness.This one is a shock as it isn't like his other films. (excluding spanglish) It is hilarious, wonderfully casted, and contains the beautiful Kate Beckinsdale. The surprising part is this movie not only contains tear jerking scenes, it also contains underlying messages that you can really reflect on. This movie is a good family movie, but not a great casual date movie.Don't pass on it because you don't normally like his films, this one has a lot of extra somethings :)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantastic,Click 'directed by Frank Coraci' has been one of the best movies that Adam Sandler has done so far (Besides 'Reign over me') but I really enjoyed how throughout the movie there were emotional moments as well as comedic. The whole movie came together great and never got boring. Adam Sandler show's a lot of talent in his acting and has seemed to have evolved but still has that great sense of humor that we all seem to relate to. This movie really makes you reflect on your life and how you spend your time with your family. I would give this movie an 8/10 and I recommend buying this movie on DVD. It would be money well spent. This movie would have to be in the top 3 comedy movies of 2006 with 'Borat' Starring Sacha Baron Cohen and directed by Larry Charles and the funny 'Thank you for smoking' starring Aaron Eckhart and directed by Jason Reitman. In conclusion I think that Click is one of the best movies of 2006 or if not the best comedy of 2006 and if you haven't already see this movie go buy or rent this movie for a great night in.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thank G-D for fast forward,"Why o why did I waste my time with an Adam Sandler movie. I should know better. There is nothing funny about him. he is such a loser.I only tuned into this to see Kate Beckinsale. I did not expect a cardboard cutout. Anyone could have played her part. it was useless.Do you find farting in David Hasselhoff's face to be funny. I didn't. It was disgusting!Let's face it. If your wife is Kate Beckinsale and you would rather spend your time at work. You've got a problem that some remote won't fix.Of course, Jennifer Coolidge was funny, so it wasn't a total waste.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Shocking movie. Not what I was expected, but surprisingly better!","At the beginning I wanted to see some easy brain movie with Adam Sandler (like all his movies). So I started to watch the movie, and BANG. This movie was surprisingly good. I mean really good. It makes you live your life better and be happy for what you have (if you have).At the beginning the movie starts with Adam Sandler being the guy with a normal family, beautiful wife, 2 children, but he concentrate to much on the work trying to make his way to be an associate with an ""asshole"" boss. Being sick of all the remotes (the remote for the TV, the light, the garage door) he goes to the shop to find the ""universal"" remote that can stop/play/fast forward anything. The remote is so ""new"" that it can automatically learn what Adam Sandler dislikes so the remote automatically ""fast forwards""...if you want more...see the movie! It's totally worth it!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Click (2006),"People who copy their political opinion from stand-up comedians are fucking idiots.
But by God, did George Carlin have a point when he said America is one big shopping mall.
Click embraces this statement with open arms.Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman, an architect who is too busy with his work to spend time with his family.
After some scenes with the typical Happy Madison (the by Sandler founded production company that produces all his films) spiel, Michael goes to a shop where he comes across Christopher Walken, who gives him an universal remote.
The gimmick is that the remote controls the universe instead of his TV.
So Adam Sandler goes on with his life, fast forwards whenever he's bored and changes the brightness on himself so he can get a tan.
The remote is programmed to recognise his personal preferences and fast forwards after a while through his life where Michael has no control over whether it fast forwards or not.The humor is like a lukewarm beer.
People who fall down, get kicked in the crotch, or get ridiculed by their appearance.
It's funny because Adam Sandler has a fat ex.
It's funny because he has a funny name.
It's funny because he is a she.
All in all, humor who mouthbreathers find hilarious.It all culminates with Sandler who has eventually fast forwarded too far in his life.
He dies in the rain while sad violin music plays.
This isn't rare for a Happy Madison film: tricking the audience into thinking the film has a heart.
But no, it appears the entire endeavor was a dream and Sandler does his best ""It's a Wonderful Life"" impersonation.
Or not, because he gets a new remote which he immediately throws away.
Calling it corny and clichematic is an understatement.One of the reasons that I decided to review Click instead of such Adam Sandler classics like ""That's My Boy"", ""Jack & Jill"" or ""Eight Crazy Nights"" is that the public opinion for ""Click"" is relatively high, for a Sandler flick at least.
I have to admit, there are good Sandler films.
""Funny People"" was good, although it's almost a critique of Sandler's work.
""Punch-Drunk Love"" is also worth a watch.
Probably because the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, writer-director of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""There Will Be Blood"", had a vision.
I don't know why, but especially Americans fall for the typical Sandler film.
Click alone won back 230 million dollars.The film itself betrays its message, spending more time with family and less with work, by focusing more on work by stuffing the film with ridiculous ""surreptitious"" advertising.
If the film doesn't follow its own message, what's the point?
The true message behind the film is searching for answers.
Always finding meaning behind everything.
In a scene Sandler doesn't remember what the song was when he and his wife first met for each other.
What he then does is winding back to the exact moment and back to the present to tell his wife what song was playing, and what she wore.
Is there something more American than finding meaning behind everything?
What if Pulp Fiction just told you what was in the briefcase?
What if Das weiße Band just told you who commit the crimes?
What if The Shining had a voice-over at the end which explained to you what happened to Jack?
Click would sell its own message in clean, small packages in stores for $3,99.In George Carlin's vision of America ""Click"" would be constantly played in malls.
That is the only thing it's good for.
No impact on culture, only box office success, to eventually end up in a 2 for 1 DVD sale at a mall.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good - but not why you think,"The premise is great. The movie is great. My husband and I went to see this movie because we're Adam Sandler fans. We like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. We've seen 50 First Dates, WaterBoy, The Longest Yard, and Mr. Deeds. We've also seen Punch Drunk Love, which grew on us after watching it 3 times (had to see it that many times just to figure it out)! This movie doesn't really fit any of these movies. It is more along the lines of Anger Management.We went into the theater expecting funny, because the trailer indicates that. However, Adam Sandler, although acting with a lot of his typical costars, isn't acting as his typical character. He acts as a normal guy who happens to gain control of a remote control that controls his life. The movie focuses on a life lesson and makes a point.The biggest problem with the movie is the child stars who overact their lines and scenes. Christopher Walken, who is always funny just being present, has some memorable scenes...and you won't soon forget Sean Astin either! Funny? Sometimes. It is worth the cost of the movie ticket, YES!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
well done,"I thought that this movie was just going to be about Adam Sandler fast forwarding and rewinding memorable moments in his life. I walked into the theater, thinking ""this is probably going to be some laugh out loud comedy because that's always what Sandler does"". This movie actually made me cry. It made me laugh. And it made me feel angry at myself for taking advantage of life's most precious moments. He fast forwards three minutes of his life and before he knows it he is fast forwarding thirty years. Life goes by so fast even without a universal remote control..and he just had to skip the parts that he didn't like. Well, buddy, life is all about mistakes and not happy moments. I recommend seeing this movie. It's worth it. You'll get a good laugh and a good cry in.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good idea which somehow got lost in translation (pardon the pun!),"I like the premise: you get the opportunity to fast forward through the annoyances in life.I'm certain we'd all like that!I was confused at the uneven plot devices. I got the impression that there was more than one director. A scene would be progressing reasonably with some pretty good laughs, then suddenly - a really stupid gag is introduced.This was unfortunate because it brought it to a rather low humour level which didn't mesh well with the rest of it.So although I liked the general idea, I felt the execution was weak. Shame, because they had a really excellent cast.The cast did their best, and were convincing in their roles, but for me the movie missed the mark.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you liked ""50 First Dates""...Click is better","With its same humor but new jokes Adam Sandler and the gang make a new laughable and lovable comedy about a man learning a valuable life lesson. 50 first dates had a serious toll with adding funny comedy found in Billy Madison to make Click, which does a great job with humor for suited for any sense. When I first saw previews for this film, I thought it was going to be a wall in Sandlers career, but he pulled out yet another good one to get the audience. Christopher Walken makes a great appearance and put the power of the universe in Michaels hands. David Hasselhoff makes a great appearance as Michaels boss and Henry Winkler as Michaels father. All in all i give it an 8 out of 10 for great comedy/story with a great valuable life lesson: Live life as tomorrow was your last day.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great Concept. Sadly, It's An Adam Sandler Movie...","Think of this: A comedy about a workaholic father who's tired of his life and dealing with menial work who finds a time-bending remote that allows him to fast forward through the boring bits of life, but sadly gets out of hand quickly.Are you kidding? That's a great idea! Get Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, or Tim Allen on the phone! We have a comedy that will be the best of the ye- Oh, you picked Adam Sandler... We're doomed.For the three of you who don't know, Adam Sandler is a comedian from Saturday Night Live who has a number of talents, but has somehow managed to make hit after hit by using none of them. The Waterboy, Bedtime Stories, Jack & Jill, Grown-Ups 1&2, Just Go With It, etc., all horrendous pieces of crap that somehow make a killing at the box office... And yes, Click is one of them.The story, like I said earlier, features Adam Sandler playing a workaholic father who's tired of routine and balancing work and a family(even though he's married to the hot Kate Beckinsale...) One night, Christopher Walken gives him a universal remote that controls not only his TV, but his life. He can focus on past events, slow down and pause time, change the color of his skin, and, most importantly in this movie, fast forward through the boring bits of life. This would have been a great movie, but, again, they had to choose Adam Sandler as producer and lead...I hate Adam Sandler. He's a 47-year-old stuck in puberty. He's loud, he's perverted, he's obnoxious and in-your-face, and he thinks that saying ""boobies"" every other sentence is comedic gold. He's the guy responsible for keeping Rob Schneider in business and keeping other promising comedians(Dana Carvey anyone) out of business. And, of course, all his trademark ""hilarity"" shines in this movie.The humor consists of a dog who has a fetish for a giant duck doll that's a prominent running gag, a potty-mouthed little kid who is constantly tortured by Adam Sandler(why do I see this as Adam Sandler trying to let off some childhood rage), and as much toilet humor, sexual content, swearing, and overall anti-jokes as a Friedberg & Seltzer movie. I cringed at every single attempt at a joke, which was about 30 a minute. Hey jackass! You need better humor than this!However, the humor is probably there to poorly attempt to hide that fact that Adam Sandler CAN'T ACT! He's Jim Carrey if he only played Lloyd from Dumb and Dumber throughout his career. No flexibility, no attitude, no personality at all. His only two expressions seem to be rape-smile-with-your-mouth-open, or ""I just wandered on set and can't remember what I'm doing."" Oh, but sometimes he shouts like a guy with Tourettes Syndrome... because, yeah, that's funny, right?!Now, with all that in mind, THIS MOVIE... does have some good stuff. The other actors(Beckinsale, Walken, Hasselhoff, even Winkler) do manage to put in a solid performance. The story, as I said before, is pretty good, as we can see Sandler's character's life as a kid and eventually as an old man, as well as the consequences for his actions. The movie has a great moral at the end that speaks to both adults and children, and you might even find some of the movie charming and heartwarming. ...Sadly, you have to sit through about 100 minutes of painful Sandler ""routine"" in order to see it.In conclusion, and as I've stated repeatedly throughout this review, this movie is an interesting story that would have made a great, even landmark, comedy if in the right hands, but sadly had to be placed in the possession of Jerry Lewis' even less talented younger brother. Get a better lead and a better sense of humor and this movie would have been great. As it stands, I'd suggest skipping it unless you're a huge Sandler fan.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow! Different than I expected! Great Movie!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I thought that it would be another one of Adam Sandler's comedies where Adam talks in that voice, that's kooky and makes you feel like you have gotten a little less intelligent after seeing it, but this movie is different. It is funny, don't get me wrong, I don't think that Adam could be in a movie and not be funny, but it also has a different, more serious side to it. I definitely recommend this movie! It makes you realize that in the middle of all of the hustle and bustle of our busy days, that our life is passing by, before our very eyes, and we're sometimes so consumed with that ""hustle and bustle,"" that we forget to stop and smell the roses, do what's really important in life.

Without reservation this is one of the greatest A.Sandler's movies. Actually I like all movies whit this great actor, it's hard to highlight only one.

If that sort of comedy makes you laugh then you'll probably enjoy the movie. But there's too much yelling and screaming, too much anger, too many sex gags, too many mean things said to children. It's a shame that the writing wasn't more inspiring. It could have been an uplifting movie and maybe by the end it was. But getting there was just too painful for me.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not Adam Sandler Greatest work,"Essentially the ""three ghosts"" story, past, present and future. A comedy about where your life and desires are taking you and what that end journey will look like. The story was very cliche and predictable, but the overall message did strike the heart strings. The match up between Adam Sandler and Kate Beckinsale was a terrible match up, there was no chemistry there whatsoever and it felt like she was far out of his league. Instead of a let loose meaningless comedy, the film was definitely directed for a more mature audience as it had a message to tell about what really matters in life.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yet another awesome Adam Sandler Movie,"Don't listen to what the critics are saying about CLICK! They don't have a clue. If you like Adam Sandler, then you will love this movie. I took my 11 year old daughter and her 11 year old friend to see it and we were all crying and laughing. I don't think there was a dry eye in the audience (men included). Ebert and Roeper gave it 2 thumbs down, but I have to disagree with them. I've noticed that they have given lousy ratings on other good movies too. Basically, don't always believe what you hear....experience it for yourself!

Time lost with family cannot be made up. Family should always come first!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Click is an unfunny and mean-spirited mess of comedy and melodrama,"I seem to completely disagree with the other reviewers of this film. Why? First of all, the concept of remote control that controls your world is used very poorly. Sandler's character makes choices that make little sense seeing all the possibilities offered by his magical zapper.Also, I did not buy his ""change of heart"". The guy was totally mean-spirited, self-obsessed, violent, revenge seeking and infantile before using the remote (for instance shown by his treatment of his wife's friend played by Jennifer Coolidge, which had nothing to do with the remote) and it was pretty clear he didn't deserve to be with Beckinsale's character form the start. This made me totally root for the character played by Sean Astin.The movie is UNfunny! What about that terrible running gag with dogs humping the stuffed duck time and again? That's not funny, just bad taste if you ask me. The movie also becomes overly sentimental and serious towards the end and this is made worse by Sandler's performance. Totally unbelievable!

As I sat there watching it I was reminded that I need to make the most out of my life and that currently the world is so focused on success and has forgotten about the simpler pleasures in life. It was refreshing to watch.The humour was a little darker than usual and some of the script felt like it was taken from Adam Sandler's real life. I could be reading into it too much but I wonder if he was feeling the pressures of work, wife and kids. It was entertaining nonetheless.Overall not too bad.

Sandler's awful acting kills movie; Trailer is all there is to movie. Just see that.,"Click tells a story of a man who works hard for his family but doesn't always get due returns and so he's frustrated. Then a remote control lets him fast forward some of the tough moments or take it out on his jerk boss (David Hasselhoff), etc. Plot is good, supporting cast is EXCELLENT. Adam Sandler is just not good enough of an actor to play his character. For example, there's a scene where Adam Sandler comes home with disappointing news. Sandler's character appears as a jerk and a whiny loser to his family because his angry rants have no other feelings due to poor acting. You're more annoyed than cheering him. This happens through all of Sandler's scenes and this spoils the movie. A skilled actor would have offered more emotions of dedication or care for his family or even humor during the sad scenes if he's real good like Robert Downey Jr. You would have better understood and emphasized for the character.On the positive end - Kate Beckinsale plays her role very well and looks good too. David Hasselhoff plays is great as the boss and his only comic scene is hilarious but you already see that in the trailer. Christopher Walken delivers his lines well and is funny as usual - but he plays a very minor role so we don't see much. This would have been a 7.5 if we had a better actor than the very limited Adam Sandler. Suppose Kevin Spacey, Ben Stiller, or even Jim Carrey. I saw it because the trailer was very promising, plot sounded good. The trailer had all the substance of the movie and the funniest jokes. The rest of the movie wasn't anywhere near the material in the trailer. If you can stand Adam Sandler as an actor - good movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Horrendous,"Okay, I've liked the early films of Sandler--namely, Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, and, even, the Waterboy--so, suffice it to say, I have a streak of sophomoric humor in me. This movie plain sucked the life out of me. It was Bruce Almighty all over, and a modern Christmas Carol thrown in to boot. So, they set up Sandler as this overworked architect (cough, cough) who doesn't spend enough time with his kids and wife. How many times do they need to do this storyline? I don't need to learn a moral--I spend time with my kids and wife. I want to see what this goof-ball is going to do with his remote. They could have done so much more with that.Well, I'm going to end on that note--it's really not worth writing even this much about it.Watch Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore and forget the rest of Sandler's stuff.
