Had It Been Longer,"I loved this movie, it's terrific. Edward Norton is great here, all the acting performances are good. A very important social message.I would have given it a 10 if it were longer. I wish there were more scenes of his thought process of leaving the skinhead movement, and more scenes of him bonding with his little brother (Edward Furlong) and slowly getting him to rework his worldview and frame of reference as well. The ending is also a little abrupt.I just wish for more of the film. Nothing wrong with what we got. It's already a phenomenal work of art that I implore every person of every race to watch. Obviously the subject matter is skinheads, but the theme of de-radicalizing your brain is universal and is much needed in today's world.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Beautiful film about how hatred will never resolve the problem,"The tragedy of evil is that in trying to stop it, you create it. So if you want to stop doing evil actions, you also have to stop seeing evil because to see evil you must project evil... therefore, you create evil. If you genuinely want to be moral, you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving up all morality. All of your moral rules give them all away. Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you're not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it's not a self-image that you adopt, it's not a list of 10 commandments that you follow. When you think you're so righteous and so moral, you will go and kill people in the name of your morality which is precisely what creates evil.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Edward Norton owned this movie,"I give this movie a 10 because1) Edward Norton was the meaning of masterful acting, you could just look at his eyes and understand every little pain he felt and caused. His smile and manner switching before and after was so distinguishing that if you did not speak English you could just follow him.2) cinematography : not only the black and white phase was amazing some other shots was masterful3) the cause , I watched this movie in 2019 and it is as important and as relevant as it was 21 years ago",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is a fantastic movie....,"This is a fantastic movie because no matter what side you're on in life, this movie shows them all, good and bad, right or wrong. I also agree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change for the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right things in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things ""your way"" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterpiece! Truly one of the best film I have ever seen,"I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time, since my English teacher mentioned it in our class in grade ten. Gosh I wished I wouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Most Dangerous Person To Us Is Ourselves,"American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.Who better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head that realizes through cruel yet necessary events in his life that he has gone down the wrong path. When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.Norton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life. Whether it proved to be psychological, social or even political on a certain level. It is a transforming performance revealing something mind blowing and eye opening. That we, and this includes anyone, can take a devastating turn in life no matter how intelligent we are or thoughtful. That the person that determines the outcome of your life is yourself whether it is good or bad. Norton's realizations aren't through teachings such as the ones that got him in jail but they are through the events in the time he spent in jail. He saw the truth for himself realizing then what is false and what is real.The screenplay written by David McKenna is about as versatile as the performance Norton gives. Not only because of the Derek Vinyard character but because of the characters involved in his life. For example the root of his evil did not come from the murder of his father but rather his father himself. Through just a conversation at breakfast did his negative thoughts get really embedded eventually then leading to them dramatically taking over his mind and way of life. Only when his father got killed did these negative thoughts seem justified. The way this screenplay and direction was able to display this message in just a plethora of other underlying tones was spectacular.What makes this movie great though is that you can truly find yourself in the messages delivered. As much as the main character might not seem relevant or connected to many people it his emotions and functioning of his mind that all of us are able to connect with. Yet what makes a movie great is not simply the message or messages sent across but how powerfully they are delivered. American History X delivers its multiple and intertwining messages about as powerfully as I've seen from a film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.,"I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.The movie its story is told 'beautifuly' in black & white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.Also surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for ""The Full Monty"", the year before.This was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An amazing film,"A good friend of mine suggested this film, and I really didnt know what to expect going in, but after this film was over, I sat in stunned silence. I knew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does not come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are. Edward Norton's performance takes the viewer through this journey, and its not a pretty one. He goes from an bright young man, to a vengeful bigot, to a remorseful excon with a brothers life in jeopardy, and you feel as though you are looking in on someones life in the course of 2 hrs. All of the acting in this film is first rate, and the ending wasnt quite as predictable as others might have you believe...it is quite shocking, as is much of the film. It causes quite a debate on the way people view others whos skin color is not the same. As Dr. King said, judge me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. I live with racism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if we educate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around for much longer. Hopefully it wont be too late, as it was for him. Peace and Love, JB33  Rating 5 stars",,Anonymous,Drama
"Highly compelling, but not entirely convincing","The concept of a reformed neo-Nazi is so intriguing that it's a wonder there haven't been more movies on this topic. Once you see ""American History X,"" however, you will understand why. The movie's racial themes are provocative and unsettling, far outside the comfort zone of the average viewer, and the movie additionally has the challenging task of explaining how a violent criminal changed his ways. Does the movie convincingly explain that transition? Not entirely.It's an engrossing movie, nonetheless. It uses a device more common in literature than in the movies: inter-cutting between several story-lines. First we see Derek (Ed Norton) as a free man, newly released from prison, and having developed a conscience. Then we see earlier points in his life when he was a white supremacist, and finally the prison experience that changed him. The non-chronological approach is very effective, making the movie about as engaging as any thriller, even though the plot itself offers few surprises. Had the film followed a more conventional timeline, we'd have quickly grown impatient waiting for plot developments that were inevitable. With the way it's structured, our focus is on the process more than the outcome: How did a bright kid like Derek become a racist? And what turned him around?The movie takes great pains to show how articulate the younger Derek is when he justifies his hatred of blacks by citing the statistics of black crime. (His more personal motive is that blacks murdered his father.) His arguments hit upon common politically conservative themes as he finds fault with affirmative action, glorification of criminals like Rodney King, and liberals who blame (white) society for the problems facing blacks. But Derek takes this reasoning a step further and argues that blacks have a ""racial commitment to crime."" Of course, by taking that step, he undermines his own arguments. For example, how does his harping about ""personal responsibility"" square with his belief in judging people for factors beyond their control, like their race? Responsibility requires choice. If race were the reason for black crime, then black criminals would be morally blameless. But no character points out such contradictions in Derek's views. When he debates a liberal teacher played by Elliot Gould, the gentle Gould character acts like a milquetoast, unable to provide a strong rebuttal. It's a powerful scene, and more than plausible: as in real life, people aren't always prepared with eloquent answers, even when confronted by someone with indefensible views.Still, it's disconcerting that the film never fully addresses the ""intellectual"" side of his bigotry. The main impetus for Derek's change is internal: once he learns to respect himself, he starts respecting others--a nice thought, no doubt, but I'm not sure it would be a strong enough fulcrum for change in this character's racial views. Although some would assume that Derek is too intelligent to remain racist, I would assume he's too intelligent not to come up with yet more rationalizations.There are other factors at work, too, including his treatment by white inmates and his befriending of a charming black inmate (Guy Torry). But all this seems to provide, at most, an emotional response to the earlier scenes. The movie made me realize how much the public attitude toward race has changed since the late 1960s, when optimistic films like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" confronted racism by creating immensely likable African-American characters and ignoring any other social and cultural tensions that might pose a barrier to interracial relationships. In AHX, almost all the black characters are gang members and criminals, and there seems to be an underlying cynicism in the film's reluctance to provide a clear-cut refutation to Derek's right-wing arguments. Implicitly, the movie argues that there's a cycle of hatred going on between white and black gangs, and that the white racists aren't solely to blame for this situation. Aside from his relationship with Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and his prison friend, the basis for Derek's turnaround is largely negative: he realizes that he's no better than the black outlaws he so despises. That isn't exactly the most inspiring message about race relations.My main reason for wanting to watch this movie in the first place was to understand better how an extremist hatemonger could change. But that turns out to be the least convincing aspect of the film. The root of the problem probably lies in the conception. The filmmakers started with the intelligent skinhead character, then they thought, ""What sorts of events will lead this character to transform?"" That's why the conclusion feels just a tad contrived. It's a good film, overall, but ironically where it's weak is in the very area that makes the story the most interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the best films about racism,"One of the reasons I like the film is that the racism isn't shoved down your throat. It's subtle and believable. There's no characters standing around screaming about ""Those goddamn Mexicans, I don't want THEM changing my locks so THEY can rob the place with their little essays!"", right in front of them.The acting is great all around, and Edward Norton gives one of the best performances of all time. I can't believe he didn't win best actor. While I haven't seen Benji's performance, I doubt he was half as good as Norton.

"Controversial, yet very amazing & moving film","When I first heard of ""American History X,"" I thought it was going to be ""just another movie."" Man, was I wrong! The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his own image."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once. This way, more people will get a chance to see the true consequences of racism, and how it can easily tear apart a family.",,Anonymous,Drama
This was probably the best movie I've ever seen,"I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Norton's astounding performance!!!!!!,"American History X is a 1998 American crime drama film directed by Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. It stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, and co-stars Fairuza Balk, Stacy Keach, Elliott Gould, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee and Beverly D'Angelo.In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are inter cut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best movie of 1998,Powerful portrayal of Neo-Nazi movement in America. Told in series of flashbacks. Flawless acting by Edward Norton. Does its best to make the point that no one is ever right aand no one is ever wrong. I have a friend who was a Nazi and a racist. But upon walking out of the theater after this movie he hung his head in shame. This is why the film industry began.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not perfect but still very strong,"Years have past since Danny saw his neo-nazi brother, kill several black males who were robbing his car.  Since he has been in prison, Derek's legacy has grown among the white gangs of the area and Danny has followed in his brother's footsteps.  When he writes a racist paper for school, his teacher makes his write a new paper, focusing on recent history  that of his brother and how he influenced him.  Meanwhile Derek leaves prison a reformed man with only the desire to repair the damage he once did to his family with his beliefs and his hate.I was looking forward to see this film as I missed it at the cinema and am a firm believer that Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is always worth seeing (even if some of his films have given less than he deserves).  It was maybe better that I only saw it recently as I was able to enjoy it without all the hype and fighting over who did what to who, or all the comments from director Kaye as to his opinions of the film.  Having seen the pompous fool interviewed several times, I find it quite self assuring that I don't agree with his opinions of it!The plot is a mix of flashback into Derek's hate filled past (told in b&w) and the present (colour) where he is desperate to save his brother and family from suffering anymore from his `sins'.  As a basic narrative the film struggles at times to make a solid story and seems to be trying too hard to create confrontations to up the drama within the film.  It still works mind you but this is not it's best asset.The main thing the film does well is to be a very true representation of white male disillusionment.  The film avoids painting these people as monsters straightaway (although makes no bones that they are confused, misled and wrong).  The arguments and discussions they have in the film are not so far from reality that the characters seem fiction  the characters and the film's world seem very real.  The film's message that hate is no way to live no matter who it is directed at may be a little simplistic but it is a valid point.  One particular weakness which I felt was a little hamfisted was Derek's `road to Damascus' experience in prison  it was OK but was far too easy given the character we had just seen brutally kill several black men.The other main selling point the film has is a performance by Norton that simply ensures he steals nearly every scene he is in.  In b&w flashback he is at his best  a larger than life character who is never allowed to just be seen as a thug.  Norton acts out the various stages of his life well and makeup ensures that he looks younger when required.  In the present he is less dominant but still is very good giving a different performance. Furlong is also very strong, although he only has a few scenes where he is able to be outside of Norton's shadow.  Support from Balk, Gould, D'Angelo and Brooks is mixed  Gould's Jewish character is only in the film to allow for one scene to occur, while Brooks' righteous teacher is simply a `morally upright teacher' with no meat on his character.Overall this is a good film, which occasionally struggles when it forces the issue in the `present' scenes.  However for the most part it is a powerful film which owes a lot to well captured themes and an excellent performance from Norton.",,Anonymous,Drama
It's a synthesis of American culture and cultural anxieties,"Along with questions of morality, with Greek tragedy blended in. It's the sort of story that you absorb and get the sense that you've seen before, but still very powerful, raw, and moving. Still, it's not without its faults.I really loved Norton's performance here as Derek, but when it comes to the film's exploration of racism, its reasons, and why someone might turn away from it, I felt I wasn't learning anything new. In the scenes that provide background for why Derek is a skinhead, the blacks are portrayed as, overall, not characters I'd define as admirable (the basketball scene, breaking into his car, the general tone and feel of his introduction to prison).When Derek is a skinhead, he is articulate in defense of his views, which are quite detailed. His firefighter father is killed by a black drug dealer in the line of duty - He was putting out a fire at the dealer's house. This does not improve Derek's mood. In spite of his intelligence and leadership qualities he can suddenly lose control, and become violent, and this leads to actions out of all proportion to the situation - killing two black men who were breaking into his car - that put him in prison for three years.In prison is where Derek reverses course, but the reasons seem rather shallow. It boils down to being exposed to and befriending one funny likeable black guy that he works with in the prison laundry and two other very prison specific situations. Given the ardent nature of Derek's racism, it is hard to believe that this alone would turn him around or keep him turned around once he left prison and is out in the world again among his old influences.Its good points? It shows that such virulent racism can happen in normal families, to pretty normal looking people who have met with some tragedies and want to blame the ""other"". It also shows that change can occur through education - Once out of the Aryan brotherhood group in prison, Derek spends his time reading. I'd recommend this one, just understand there is lots of violence, sexual content, and strong language. It will never be on TV - It would only be 20 minutes long!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

I actually had trouble remembering that this really was acting and that had Norton was in fact not really an angry, despicable skinhead. That's one hell of an accomplushment for any actor.Without giving anything away about the ending of the movie, I will simply say two things.I thought I knew what was coming, but I was wrong.The ending brought home the point of the whole movie with a power like to the fall of a giant hammer; and that point was not what one might have expected.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Just Horrible,"Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It reeks from start to finish, which is all the more painful because it was supposed to be good. Edward Norton sounds and looks more like the president of the Yale Republican Club than a white supremacist skinhead - the movies truly fatal flaw considering he's the linchpin of the whole thing. Elliot Gould as a woolly, ineffectual liberal is a stereotype, one of many in the cast.More troubling than the acting, though, is the direction, which could charitably be called confused. How else to explain why we end up rooting for the skinheads to beat the black guys in a basketball game to determine who will stay off the public courts of Venice for good. How else to explain that the skinheads actually win? On the Venice courts, where the level of play is so high that Ron Shelton actually set his own movie there (""White Men Can't Jump"")? This scene is symbolic of how completely out of touch this movie is, how it ignores basic realities to construct its own while purporting to tell the truth, and how confused its storytelling and direction are. If racism is so bad, why are the majority of the black characters so unlikable, and why do the white supremacist characters seem so much more sympathetic and their actions so much more understandable? These concerns would be mere quibbles if the movie didn't claim to be so much more than it actually is. It fails to convey its message, and it fails artistically. Everything about it just sucks.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Not a perfect film, but very good - Norton's performance is the highlight","""American History X"" is a bold and disturbing movie about family, racism and our own self-perceptions. Its main character is Derek (Edward Norton), a neo-Nazi skinhead who is released from jail to find his younger brother (Edward Furlong) descending down the same corrupt path as he once walked.In jail Derek learns a few things about life, and racism, or more appropriately, himself, and after becoming a free man again takes it upon himself to set his brother on the straight and narrow path.""American History X"" is not a pleasant motion picture. It begins in flashback, as Derek murders two black kids trying to break into his car. His brother, who idolizes Derek and later mimics his lifestyle, witnesses this event. It's a good message about negative influences, along with everything else.Much has been made of the film's controversy and lawsuits. Director Tony Kaye disowned the film after Norton (allegedly) re-edited footage to give himself more screen time. Kaye tried to have his name changed on the film credits, but by this time he had already taken out a complaint in several magazines, which are against the rules of the Director's Guild. He was therefore denied the opportunity to credit the work as ""directed by Humpty Dumpty."" Then, musical band Anti-Hero complained to New Line Cinema (the film's international distributor) because one of the Nazi characters featured a tattoo of their band. They later wrote a song, called ""NLC,"" bashing the company.Despite the hard-edged controversy it's still a very good film, above all else extremely well-acted and featuring a gripping storyline  even if the direction isn't always up to par.Edward Norton is simply superb in his role, showing extremely raw talent a mere two years after his film debut (in the Richard Gere thriller ""A Primal Fear""). Norton careens between the role of a raging, vicious supremacist and a kindler, gentler version of the same character; a metamorphosis so convincing it's hard to believe it's just one actor.The rest of the cast is good as well  Furlong gives the best performance of his career and Beverly D'Angelo and Stacy Keach have strong supporting roles. (D'Angelo in particular, who portrays a sleazy alcoholic  a stretch compared to her usual Normal Mom roles in the ""Vacation"" movies.) ""American History X"" isn't exactly rewarding of all the praise it has been lavished since its release (mainly from viewers rather than critics, who were less kind)  it isn't the best movie of its kind or even a flawless one. The black-and-white photography isn't on the same level, visually, as ""Raging Bull"" or ""Schindler's List."" The preaching is a bit heavy-handed at times.But it still manages to convey an important lesson and boasts great acting complimented by an (overall) impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay. A must-see for all who can stomach its content.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Intelligent Drama,"Strong performances by Edward Norton & Edward Furlong really make this 
 film for me. The direction by Tony Kaye with his mixture of black & 
 white history contrasting with colourful reality is magic to absorb and 
 shows this film up to be what it is  a true American Classic, 
 ironically by a British director.
 
 The film itself is about two brothers, Derek the elder and Danny the 
 younger adoring sibling. Derek has been in jail for three years after 
 killing a black youth who tried to rob the family; the nature & 
 brutality of the crime still shocks me to this day. 
 
 AHX tracks Derek's history through the first formation of racist 
 sentiment laid down by the father. These feeling of hate are 
 embedded when later his father is killed in the line of duty. Derek 
 becomes involved in the local Nazi movement, his intellect turned by 
 youthful rage into hate crimes and the rational that comes with Neo 
 Nazi propaganda. 
 
 The Nazi-tattoo sporting, egotistical, philosophical younger Derek is a 
 steam train waiting to crash, his propulsion to stardom is eventually 
 embodied when he takes the life of the young thief, the scene is very 
 apt as he calmly lies down and knows he will be a hero to his friends.
 
 Without wanting to spoil the film Derek encounters change in the 
 prison, he meets a black man whom he works with and faces his own 
 demons inside, I will leave it there for those who want to be moved by 
 his transformation. Anyway, he comes out a new man and only wants to be 
 that new person, which means leaving the old crowd, leaving the 
 Anti-Jewish sepal he's been living with so long. The problem lies with 
 his brother who has become a little Derek, getting drunk and being 
 influenced like he was. Derek's cross to bear is that he can't change 
 his life without his brother coming with him and being on the right 
 side of humanity.
 
 I think that this film is less about race and more about our ability to 
 change as individuals, the fact that we can become what and who we want 
 is a gift. Derek becomes the man he always wanted to be, he only wants 
 the same for his brother. 
 
 Kaye's use of black & white creates an atmospheric drama that builds 
 tension and has you feeling like a stung out piece of drum leather by 
 mid movie. I love the way that Kaye subtly uses quotes and 
 intellectualises the Nazi Stance, only to watch it being broken down by 
 the same man (Derek / Norton).
 
 Norton is a joy to watch as is Gould and Furlong. 
 
 To sum up American History X is a powerful intelligent drama, which 
 provides plenty of discussion after the movie. This film should be on 
 every high school curriculum",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black and white/color for a reason,"This is in my opinion one of the best films in the last 50 years. The story, acting, directing etc are superb. The movie transitions between color and black and white perfectly for the script. There isn't a single scene, minus the end, where what happens is a good thing; however this film gives you what you hate to see while giving you what you expect. There isn't much more I can say about this movie or it's cast other than bravo and thank you for having the guts to do this film. I can't think of more to say about how much I like this film but I have to keep adding words to make the quota to make a review.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Brutally Raw Take on a Sensitive Topic,"What a fantastic raw film that focusses on showing not only the brutal acts that hate groups commit, but also showing the human elements that contributes to the corruption of adolescence. Everything about this movie is incredible from the themes that it tackles to the stylistic choices made by the filmmakers. One in particular is Tony Kaye's choice to use black and white footage to represent the changing of opinions had by Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton), physically showing how black and white everything began. Along with these awesome choices all the actors performances were on point in this film, Edward Norton is at his best giving the audience a look into his characters personal psyche. Another incredible part of this movie that I think is worth mentioning is the use of violence. I think the reality of violence in films is almost glamorized in a lot of films taking away the horror of simple acts, but not in this film. The first sequence of this film is of a brutal depiction of violence which physically makes the audience sick, and with every viewing you find yourself more and more upset with Darek Vinyard.But before I rate this film I would like to say that I was not a fan of the aspect ratio they chose to use, I know that this might not be the largest detail but I still wanted to bring it up. But I digress, so I chose to give this film a 8/10 just because I think there are a couple parts where it gets a little choppy and over narrated.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Outstanding film  with  a sensational performance by Edward Norton as fanatic Nazi,"This is an intelligent story of racial violence and xenophobia with countless violence and broody message . It happens in Venice , California and deals with a young man , a skinhead and leader of a violent white supremacist gang named Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) previously seduced into the fascist bunch by Alexander (Stacy Keach) . The Nazi group follows a racist doctrine about white supremacy , showing the feeling for the male reality of reactionary working class environments . Meanwhile his problematic family torn apart , specially his mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo). He goes to jail after committing a heinous crime , but while in prison Derek's view of mankind is altered, he discovers that there is good and bad in every race . When he is released , the former neo-Nazi skinhead attempts to prevent his younger brother named Danny (Edward Furlong) who idolizes him is on the brink of becoming a Neo Nazi himself as Derek must save him from a similar destination from going down the same wrong path that he did . As his only thought is to steer his brother away from that same violent past and being helped by a reformist headmaster (Avery Brooks).Intense and thought-provoking drama with powerful performances and slick direction , being developed by means of flashbacks filmed in black and white and color . It's an important production about racism and Nazism but with lots of violence and unpleasant images as a frightening rape in the prison and the shocking murder at the beginning . Extraordinary acting by Edward Norton who steals the show as fanatic Nazi that committed acts of racial crime throughout and subsequently become good guy . Very good cinematography -specially the black and white fragments- by the same director Tony Kaye . Emotive and moving musical score by Anne Dudley , including some wonderful song . However , disowned by his director and reportedly reedited by its star . The motion picture is stunningly realized Tony Kaye , an unsuccessful director of a few films and documentaries who here achieved his big and only hit .

American (Heavy) History X,"""American History X"" is not a weak, fluffy, cutely wrapped after school special on racism, life in the 'hood, life in prison, and breaking the cycle. ""American History X"" is powerful and hits like an anvil. Edward Norton does an excellent job as Derek Vinyard, a venomous, hateful leader of a local gang of skinheads.The movie takes a singular look at a young man who is entrenched in the White Supremist movement, then how he emerged from that life, and even how he started down that path to begin with. Of course most people don't like racist bigots and the movie shows the very ugly nature of the skinheads/Arian Brotherhood. But the movie also shows the interaction between the Whites and Blacks in the 'hoods of L.A. There was by no means an angelic depiction of the African-Americans in this film. A few of the blacks shown were thugs who in part helped shape the views that Derek and his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) held as White Supremists, but there were also a couple of key African-American characters that helped to reshape the views of Derek and Danny.""American History X"" made sure to do it right and make it true to life. The life Derek had before prison, the life inside of prison with the segregation and the gangs, and his life after prison as a changed man. This was no ""Mississippi Burning"" or ""Rosewood"" detailing events of the past, rather this was a movie showing the present, the good and bad in both parties, and the different ways people can be reformed.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

So Mind Bending,"Sometimes it's hard, as a viewer, to even watch something like this. It is inundated with scenes of horror and violence. If one simply passes off the idea of doing a movie about the ugliest side of humanity and then put it in our laps. The performances are outstanding and a moral commitment is made. Some would say to the worst of the worst, there is a glorification of the events through flashback that may be seen as sort of cool.

A must see,"The story is about the brothers Derek and Danny who are both smart and trying to questions things like in the society. When their father who's a firefighter goes into a black neighborhood trying to extinguish a fire he's shoot down by a drug dealer who happen to be a black person. Before this happened the father had told Derek about his racial opinions while they were eating one time. After the murder of his father Derek seeks to join a skinhead gang to avenge his father's death. one time later 3 black guys tries to jack his father's car from their front yard one night , Derek catches them and shoots one of them and brutally stomps on one the other guy's head killing him. Derek is convicted of manslaughter and will serve 3 years in prison.After the 3 years in jail Derek is a changed man. He has grown back his hair and become a loving and caring person , tolerating different people. Because of all the horrible things that happened in the prison.When he comes out he discovers that his little brother is going down the same path as him. And he desperately tries to save him.Why I like this movie is because that its shows us that hate only leads to suffering and despair. After his father is murdered, it's like it is his duty to stand up against the blacks in society. He joins up with Cameron and starts a skinhead gang, telling people to join because of the black and Mexican gangs who bully people. He seeks identification, he joins a side.

This DEFINITELY makes this a movie NOT for KIDS, but for adults it makes a strong impact--like a right cross into the jaw! Now I know some adults will also be completely turned off by this as well, but considering how slimy and awful racism is, how can you talk about it other than by exposing it as it really is?!

Watching the lead character go through this process is what makes this movie so interesting.The rest of the movie doesn't quite match the interest level of the lead character, but it is still good.

A Powerful film which will leave you thinking hard,"Shockingly I never came across this film before. I'm glad I finally read about it and watched it soon after. This has to be one of the most powerful films ever made on racism. The story, performances, camera, music all feel so real and thought provocative. It tells the story of Derek, a white supremacist nazi skinhead and how he transforms and now just wants his little brother Danny to not go down the same path. The narrative is non linear where the past is periodically shown in B/W while the present is in color. One of the most haunting aspects of the film is it's background score which is among the best I have heard. The writing is balanced and nuanced and it shows. Because honestly the plot is slim but the screenplay they made out of it is bloody brilliant. The film explores hate and the effect it has on people. The constant struggle is there to see, some scenes are very hard to watch and are extremely violent on the eyes and mind. We have all seen films portraying racism in one form or the another. But there is something in this film which stands out among them. And that is Edward Norton's jaw dropping performance as Derek Vinyard. He lights the screen on fire in the scenes he is delivering dialogues which reek of hate. It was a laudable performance. But I was left wanting for more. I do feel a bit more of Derek's back story on his journey into becoming a white supremacist could have been explored to add another layer. The film has a brutal climax which I didn't expect at all. It kind of comes a full circle in the end. The final moments of the film ends with an Abraham Lincoln's quote written for a paper by Danny he submitted for his AMERICAN HISTORY X class. This is a film you cannot afford to miss. ABSOLUTE MUST WATCH!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I have revisited it for some years, but as time has gone on, I've been keen to see how it's aged.I was quite surprised by the relatively shorter running time, had this film been made today, I guarantee it would be at least three and a half hours long. It's held up very well with time, it painted a pretty bleak picture of society, sadly things don't seem to have changed a great deal.Some inspirational scenes, some shocking scenes, the ending and the shower scene you need to cover your eyes. The scenes between Derek and Danny are terrific, such acting.Ed Norton delivers a first class performance, he is outstanding, his character is mixed up, defiant, brave, angry, he adds a multitude of feelings and emotions into Derek.

Graphic in depiction and no-holds barred in its ugliness, the film succeeds in making even the most sickening characters shockingly human, perhaps the film's greatest testament: giving hatred a face.

Something didn't quite click....,"I'm all over the place in evaluating this movie because the movie is a mess also. It's got a lot of good qualities and just as many bad ones.When you read the reviews of this movie, many people get the feel that it is a technical mess. I agree, that it was a technical mess too. I did enjoy it overall, but I didn't find it as enjoyable as it should have been. I have been thinking about this for a few days now since I have seen it. What was missing? I think it tries to bite off more than it can chew and that is its biggest weakness. It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions. The film is considerably bogged down by trying to solve a lot issues and emotion is lost. The focus of the entire story is shifted. Then we wind up with a complicated mess of answers, which, for me, raised more questions, because I wasn't sure I was satisfied with the answers/solutions I was given.It is a good film with great performances, especially by Norton. This is usually the kind of movie I don't enjoy watching because I'm not usually big on films and filmmakers that have an ax to grind. I like to watch movies for entertainment, not to feel like I'm being taught/lectured to.Do I sound like I am having a hard time making up my mind about this movie?I am!I liked it, but I can't put it on my list of top movies because it was too predictable and not very believable. I predicted the ending in the about 10 minutes before it happened and knew what was going to happen in the flashbacks every step of the way.Another thing I was wondering about was realism....I don't live in CA, and have never been to the bad areas, but is it possible that black gang-members would ever play basketball in Venice (I think it was Venice) with Neo Nazi's? I didn't think that scene was realistic. Also, the movie makes it sound like Neo Nazis are a real threat to society, but how many skinheads are there? I've never met one before, let alone seen one...I think, these days, people think being unbiased and objective means looking at 2 groups of people and being equally harsh in judging both of them. Maybe I've lived a sheltered life, but I think in attempting to try to be ""fair"", the movie makes with people out to be a much bigger threat to society than they are. Is there anyone in the USA that is afraid to go out at night because of Neo-Nazis? I think, in attempting to be be unbiased, the movie discredits itself and becomes unrealistic. This is a shame, but the bottom line is that this is a VERY complicated subject matter. I doubt anyone could really make a film of this nature without making lots of missteps.Rather than trying to find a solution, they should have let the audience decide what to think. I got annoyed when I was spoon fed the ""hate is baggage line."" Let me figure it out on my own!

Good but not destined to be a classic,"I'm a bit bewildered by the praise heaped upon this film. Ed Norton does a good job and was just coming into his own at this point. His acting was not at the level it is today though. Furlong earned his money but did not shine in his role. Balk utterly failed to rise on this cinematic occasion and Keach showed up for the check.The story, the underlying message and personal transformation of Norton's character should be considered the pillars of this film. I however staunchly disagree with its position at number 61 in the top 250 films. Ponder for a moment that Spartacus is over 100 films below American History X, that alone should give you pause.It would be accurate to say that votes from the younger, more internet savvy, could be held accountable for such an imbalance.

Controversy Doesn't Always Equal Great Film-Making,"Controversial subjects usually make for interesting movies, and American History X courts controversy in so many ways by examining neo-Nazis, racism, prison violence, and school violence all in the same movie. So American History X is a very interesting film, but it is executed so haphazardly that it becomes hard to enjoy, and it loses most of its potential and some of its power in the process.The film examines the life and crimes of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) through the eyes of his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), both whom are ""involved"" in the neo-nazi movement. In exactly what ways they are (and were) involved are examined in the film, much of which is told through flashbacks. It is evident that these two boys have forced much hardship upon their families, evident in the performance of Beverly D'Angelo as the boys' mother. However, the performances of both Norton and Furlong, although adequate, are short of spectacular.Much of the action of the film is shot in pain-staking slow motion, making everything so over-dramatic that it's almost laughable. McKenna's screenplay is indeed interesting at points, but some of it too gets caught up on formulaic statements and unneeded dialogue. Many of the scenes seem unneeded and seem to need replacement by scenes that give more insight into Danny's mindset. Instead of these scenes, though, the viewer is left with a character who seems somewhat one-dimensional.Even with the slow motion, Kaye's direction and cinematography are unique enough to grab the viewer's attention, even when it does distract from the rest of the film. Also, the film is thought-provoking in its examination of racial matters, especially as we see through the eyes of characters so prejudiced. Further questioning and thought is provoked by the movie's ending, which is both beautiful and shocking in such an odd way that it almost makes the whole film worthwhile.It is obvious that this film is unashamed to say what it wants to say. Yet it's still a shame that American History X was not caught on film as something more powerful and profound in its display.Final Grade: B-.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

How an ideology can wash out people. A deep and tragic story about racism.,"""American History X"" is not an easy watch, there are many uncomfortable scenes and the plot is very tragic. The director Tony Kaye and the screenwriter David McKenna built a believable story and developed one of the best and most complex characters that I have ever seen in my personal experience as a cinema lover. They completely explored Derek's story, explaining the origin of his hate, why he embraced a certain ideology and showing his redemption path. We get to see what he went through in its rawest and truest possible way. This made me empathize with the protagonist and his brother. Edward Norton is convincing in this role, his dialogues are difficult to be listened to because they go against an evolved society that is still fighting to get equality. Unfortunately what we see here is not too distant from reality as there are still extremist groups that have a dangerous mentality. All things considered, I guess that this was a real challenge for the actor, but he definitely nailed it. I really enjoyed the non-linear storyline, which made the film more intense. I loved the use of black and white during flashbacks, it adds uniqueness to the whole narration. The photography is fantastic and the director managed to capture the characters' emotions perfectly. There were certain face close-ups that surprised me.It is really difficult for me to describe this movie with words. It definitely made me think.

It still seems fairly unobtainable but at least now I understand the devastation that can await one who lets their anger consume them.Were I to have undergone the same chain of events as Derek (Edward Norton is brilliant), I reckon I'd invariably have reacted as he did, which isn't a pretty thought. What separates most antisocial young men from most healthy ones is pure luck, but of course there are also many who suffer that have the sort of perspective this film grants the viewer.Now, the cathartic relief of ruining my life - and the lives of those around me, which I hadn't truly considered before - isn't very tempting.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Decent but overdramatic and overrated,"'American History X' is a decent but flawed drama about Derek, a former neo-Nazi who, after serving time in prison for the murder of a black man, reforms himself and tries to prevent his younger brother, Danny, from following in his footsteps. The film cuts back and forth between the past and present, showing us what Derek used to be like and the path that his younger brother is at risk of going down.It's a solid drama and an interesting enough watch, but with an average rating of 8.5 it's also massively overrated. Several parts of the film feel forced and not at all convincing, especially the ending which was over-the-top and completely unnecessary. The film contains enough drama without the need for an forced and overdramatic ending that contributes very little to the story other than some blood and violence. Overall, 'American History X' is a decent but overrated drama film.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"By votes, the most  overrated film on IMDb","This in my opinion is not a bad movie by any means, but i was just scrolling down the list of the top films by ways of votes on IMDb and saw how highly this movie was rated and how much it has impressed. I do think its quite good and of course its controversial, but i can't help thinking that its getting as much credit as it has for being just that. It has some good moments and the fact that the neo nazi's opinions are put a cross in a well constructed manner, rather than the usual thick headed thug type fashion does make it more uncomfortable and asked more questions of us (perhaps) and of course it has other current flowing under the obvious ones, like the element of prison and what that brings etc etc, but overall this film lacked any subtle moments. Everything is thrown infront of you in an aggressive manner, which i know people will say is the point perhaps, but in my opinion it isn't. We all know racism is a bad thing so to have it spelt out and then have the rather obvious idea of redemption but paying for your sins or for your actions (being accoutable) for your eventual loss is a little obvious",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Worn out pseudo issue of racism, overdone again","For it's appeal this movie relied entirely on dramatics based on pseudo racial tensions -- just like you see in almost all everyday boring media -- and the dramatics take on the same worn out theme of white supremacy aimed at the underprivileged black. Of course classism and other infinitely weightier issues are ignored in this type of black-and-white scenario. This issue is so overdone and so inaccurate that movies portraying it are at once passe and dangerously erroneous from a social standpoint.If you like drama that rams its theme home by beating you over the head with theatrics, and if you are uneducated enough to believe that simple discrimination results from something as superficial as skin color, then you will probably like this movie and even think it's profound. If you appreciate the subtle beauty in life and understand how nearly all issues have depth beyond their specious veneer, this movie will just be another tired rendition added to the multitude of preceding ones that pivot from the same worn and ridiculous theme -- racism.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

*A Powerful Portrait of Redemption*,"""American History X"" is a gripping and thought-provoking film that dives deep into the complexities of hate, racism, and ultimately, redemption. Edward Norton delivers a stunning performance as Derek Vinyard, a reformed neo-Nazi who grapples with the repercussions of his past actions in a moving and deeply emotional narrative.The film's storytelling is raw and unflinching, using a non-linear structure that effectively reveals the backstory and gradual transformation of its characters. The black-and-white flashbacks juxtaposed with the vivid present day create a powerful visual narrative, emphasizing the stark contrasts between Derek's past beliefs and his quest for a better future.The themes explored in ""American History X"" are hauntingly relevant and serve as a critical commentary on the cycle of hate and violence. It challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about prejudice and the environment that fosters it. The film doesn't shy away from showing the devastating impact of hate not only on individuals but on families and communities as well.What truly sets ""American History X"" apart is its focus on redemption and the possibility of change. The emotional climax delivers a gut-wrenching reminder that the fight against hate is a continuous journey, one that requires introspection, courage, and understanding.""American History X"" is a must-see film that resonates on multiple levels. It's a haunting, beautifully crafted piece of cinema that leaves a lasting impact and sparks necessary conversations about forgiveness and the human capacity for change.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Things flow naturally: we get scenes with deep conversation and basic human interaction, but the second something happens, it's sudden and straight in your face.

Cycle of violentia continues,"This is a story that, ahead of its time, predicted struggles of the working class of all races that elected the great Donald in 2016 to the presidency of a failing superpower. In the Cilton years prison racialitst reform was filling prisons with minor offenders of wrong colour, while affirmative action was turning hard working Amuricans into hatte filled monstuers . A growing, ambitious guy of high IQ and later questionable tattoos has an inspiring black teacher that sells his woke agenda, while his policemen racialist father is against it. Black violentia kills the dad and a foster father figure is found in local corrupt republican-leaning manipulator. This causes guy to shave his head and when a gang of melanin rich drifters try to rob his car after losing control of the basketball court due to movie hero being an awesome, if melanin challenged, athlete, he stands his ground and uses some excess force to whack a couple of them here and there. For that he gets some prison sentence but whilst in jail he befriends a dark skinned comedian and rejects his ideology of republican nativism, all while getting some stitches for snitches and books from his ideologically possessed O-bama wannabe former teacher. After being brain-washed he gets out of prison to try to imprint some liberal woke bs into his impressionable younger brother. But, alas, as left wing indoctrination portrayed as sincere repentance for white privilege of being an orphan whose daddy policemen (also white privilege) had a privilege of being shot on duty by some gang members with excess access to drugs and melanin after protesting incompetence of his co-workers that got jobs via affirmative action, was beginning to work, there is a new problem. The violentia wins again as a bullet is shot again from a minority member into his brother, killing him on spot. So, violentia wins the day, and the circle continues, since no matter how many republicans repent for their white privilege, problem is not solved, since the root of the problem is was on the other side all along. This visionary message predicted presidential wins in 2016 in 2024 about 20 years ahead of its time.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the worst films in recent memory,"It's rare that I turn down an opportunity to see a film for free.  It's even more rare that I regret having done so.  American History X was so strikingly bad though that I'm considering an attempt to sue for my wasted time. :-)The Plot:  Give the audience some credit!  American History X was painfully heavy-handed.  The word, ""Duh,"" sprang to mind (and often mouth) every few seconds.  Challenge us...make us thing...leave some loose ends.  Ed Furlong's 18-hour redemption plan?  Please!The Cinematography:  I don't know who's to blame; my guess is Tony Kaye. How could something smack of pretension and look like an MTV show?  Cut, pan, cut, pan, slow-mo, black-and-white.  The camera work is symbolic of the film.  Kaye never visually engages the characters and perhaps that's part of the reason that AHX is so ineffectual.Ed Norton did what he could with a weak script and a poor director. Unfortunately, the most impressive thing about the movie was the way Norton changed his body for the role.  Tony Kaye (understandly) tried to remove his name from this ""opus"" and claimed that Norton was responsible for the editing.  If that's true, let's hope Ed Norton sticks to acting and Tony Kaye goes back to music videos.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

Why didn't anyone challenge Derek when he became a racist?,"My 9/10 rating is because ""American History X"" is very well done in every way, except that it seems that when Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) started spouting out the anti-Semitic diatribe, they should have asked him what became of his humanity. Then again, maybe they wouldn't know what to say in such a situation.But other than that, the movie is quite good. Portraying a reformed Derek trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming a white supremacist, we get to see various issues. For example, when Derek is in jail and gets to know a black man for the first time, his anger starts to ebb. Good support from Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach and Fairuza Balk make this a very good movie, even if they didn't develop it as far as they could.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

As powerful today as it was upon release,"Considering the behind the scenes drama (largely that persisted around its director Tony Kaye walking away from the film with its star Edward Norton taking over editing duties and overseeing the final cut), it's incredible just how powerful and accomplished of a film American History X ended up becoming.A confronting, heartfelt and in many ways life-affirming tale of the detrimental aspects of racism and its destructive powers on humankind, Kaye (and Norton's) film isn't an easy watch but these 20 plus years on since its initial release have done nothing to dampen to the effect the film can have on viewing.Starting out by focusing on a terrifying and horrific home invasion gone wrong, then turning its attention to examining the life of Edward Furlong's confused teenager Danny and his older brother Derek played by an Oscar nominated Ed Norton, who are both dealing with a deep seeded racist view that has shaped their lives, American History X casts a wide net as it morphs and moves between situations and scenarios that showcase the best and worst of what humankind can conjure up.In many ways the story of Danny and Derek, as the two brothers reconnect after Derek's release from prison for the murder of two black youths, seems rather simple but through these two viewpoints, we as an audience get to experience a wide ranging set of situations and emotions that refuses to point the finger, rather unblinkingly ask the hard hitting questions while showing us the audience the true eye-opening nature of the hatred that is prevalent in America and the world.In these two central figures we also get a double dose of outstanding acting performances.It's easy to forget that at one stage the now troubled Furlong was one of the industry's brightest stars while Norton was very much establishing himself as one Hollywood's brightest talents, fresh off a memorable turn in Primal Fear and soon to be seen in the ground-breaking Fight Club, Norton is a commanding force of nature in this tale, with his transformative turn as Derek one of the era's most noteworthy lead turns.From our first few encounters with Derek he appears to be a man of few redeeming qualities, an unashamed racist that sees violence as an answer to problems within his community and within his very soul but as we begin to understand Derek's journey and soulful home truth lessons, the true quality of the construction of Derek the character and Norton's unforgettable turn begin to really take shape.With American History X's high placing in many film fans viewing lists, its unquestionably due largely to the fact that Norton so powerfully brought home the films messages through his turn as a young man's troubled path to understanding.Final Say -As powerful and resonate today as it was upon release, arguably even more so in our current climate, American History X is cinema at its most confronting but also at its most powerful, meaning its place as one of most quintessential pieces of cinema is well and truly deserved.5 bags of laundry out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Overally good but not masterpiece. Had some great scenes,"""American History X"" has some great parts but also boring ones. Derek's character switches from tough to weak, which feels odd. The ending comes too fast and needed more story before it to make sense.The movie should have shown earlier how the hate grew between the young black boy and the young white boy to explain the shooting better.In ""American History X,"" while some scenes captivate, others drag, undermining its pacing. The portrayal of Derek, oscillating between a dominating presence and vulnerability, strikes an odd chord, diluting his character's credibility. Moreover, the abrupt ending, a pivotal moment intended to underscore the cycle of hate, lacks the necessary buildup to fully convey its message. The narrative needed to establish the growing animosity between the young black and white boys earlier, providing a clearer context for the film's tragic conclusion, thus ensuring a more coherent and impactful storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
The best movie ever about racism,"I have rewatched this movie so many times that it's due for a personal review. Edward Norton is nothing short of amazing. His character really portrays the transition of hatred, to finding peace through realisation that his past was leading him and his brother in the wrong direction. Edward Furlongs character shows how we can look up to our elders and get influenced. Whether right or wrong, leadership stems from someone looking at someone's actions.This movie resonates with many because this is actually happening somewhere in the world. Hatred is being fuelled by what is shown on social media and the scary thing is, it's easily accessible on your personal phone.This is a great movie again and I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not entirely believable but Edward Norton steals the show,"Edward Norton has been an underrated actor in my eyes. Delivering great performances in films like Fight Club, Birdman and Moonrise Kingdom, there's no doubt he's an outstanding actor. His performance in American History X is some of his best work.American History X follows Derek Vinyard, a former neo-nazi skinhead that tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same path he did.The widespread love for this film got me interested to watch it. What I admire is how far they went with a subject matter like this. Its portrayal of racism is unflinching throughout with sequences that truly had me on edge and even shocked me. The film doesn't hold back and I found that to be helpful to get into and understand Derek Vinyard's perception of the world. The use of black and white during the flashbacks was an excellent choice as I felt it was very representative of the hatred and violent nature Derek possessed. Not only that, it added a murky feeling to the film that suited the dark and angry tone of the film. My main issue with American History X is how the film depicted Derek's reformation. Witnessing the large amount of hatred and racism built up inside of him, I found to be quite unbelievable how quick he was able to switch against his morals. For me, this weakened the film as this was the entire character development Derek had but it didn't come across as very believable. In addition, the ending is also something I'm not sure how I feel about. The best part of American History X is Edward Norton. He always manages to disappear into the characters he plays and Derek Vinyard is no exception. He lives and breathes this role and does an incredible job playing him. Edward Furlong as Norton's younger brother is also very good.American History X does have a lot of interesting things to say. The filmmaking is very well done and Edward Norton delivers an exceptional performance but I think the story required more subtlety and needed more to happen in Derek's life to make his reformation more believable in my eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Excellent but curiously unmoving,"A white supremacist Derek (Edward Norton) is sent to jail for brutally killing two black men who try to steal his car.  Through some harrowing experiences in jail he realizes his way of thinking and living was wrong. He gets out and tries to prevent his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming the same as him...but is it too late?First off I'm giving the film an 8.  I thought is was excellent but it does have problems--it's overlong (I was bored more than once); there's way too many slow-motion sequences; there's disjointed editing; a finale I saw coming from a mile away and an annoying tendency to cut from b&w to color constantly.  Those issues aside the film is great.The script and imagery is strong and graphic (as it should be) and there's some great acting here.  Norton is just superb (he was Oscar-nominated); Furlong is subdued but good as Danny--a lot of his emotions come through in his eyes; Beverly D'Angelo was just great as their mother and Fairuza Balk is frightening as Norton's girlfriend.  The only bad acting was by Avery Brooks--but he's not really a main character so it doesn't really hurt the film.Some of the sequences in here were very difficult to watch (the attack on the store, the prison sequences and the finale) but they're meant to be that way.  This movie hits you over the head with its message but it does work. It just didn't affect me that strongly.  As I said, I saw the ending coming from a mile away so it didn't shock me at all.  Still, it is a powerful film.  Well worth catching.Also there was a huge amount of controversy when this was released.  It seems the director (Tony Kaye) accused New Line Studios of letting Edward Norton into the editing room and cut the film himself (this is no shock--Norton is known as a control freak).  He requested his name be removed from the credits and replaced with Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck.  He didn't win his request.  If Norton did indeed edit this film--he shouldn't quit his acting job.  The editing here is herky-jerky and the film could easily lose those slomo sequences.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

The film is extremely cliched and, at times, simply formulaic with a stapled on ending which tries to add an ironic nature to the film but only ends up causing the film to suffer from the old Hollywood adage of ""serious films have sad endings"".The most blatant example of the poor story telling is when Derek is in prison and he realizes that black people simply aren't evil. The way in which this comes about is scriptwriting at it's worst. There was much to do about the directing but the film is filled, once again, with poor work. Kaye was said to have done his own camera work on cinematography. It's obvious that professionals should have been used. The only saving grace is Nortons fine acting which is lost among the many flaws of the film. Better films about racism and hate have been made. Skip this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A Powerful, Eye Opening Story About Change","When I first came across the movie American History X it was while I was looking through Edward Nortons films on his profile. Having seen Primal Fear and Fight Club just a few weeks prior to this I was intrigued to see what other roles he could take on. Furthermore, I was a huge fan of Edward Furlong in Terminator 2 and was happily surprised to see him on this cast list as between 1991 and 1998 when this was released, he did not have many major roles.The story is told through switching from present to past and the way it is done is simply outstanding. The flashback scenes are in black and white to firstly make it clear when the time period is and arguably also to show the darkness that was consuming Edward Nortons character when following the neo-nazi way of life that he did for so long. Edward Norton himself also adds to this effect and his performance makes it seem like he is playing two separate characters. His brother in the movie 'Danny' is played by Edward Furlong who gives a very gripping performance as we see his character change his ways completely in front of our eyes. The time period of only one day also adds the severity of this change and in a very powerful way shows the effect of influence that one person can have on another.For people that haven't seen this movie it is without a doubt one of the most powerful movies I have personally seen and one that I believe everyone should watch. Because of this, I have not given away many details of the movie and I believe that words cannot convey the true message that this 'masterpiece' conveys.10/10.

"""American History X"" is the true purpose of film","Let me begin by saying, this was not an easy film to watch. It was highly confronting surrounding aspects of racism in American society, as well as the unspeakable reality of prison. Although this is exactly what made this film great. I have not seen a film be this courageous in tackling issues that occur in society. Issues that people would rather be oblivious to, are completely exposed in this film. A large number of people steer away from films like this, and prefer to watch meaningless, poorly made films, as its an easy watch. And to a certain extent, light hearted movies are perfectly enjoyable. But ""American History X"" is the true purpose of film. As to why it is, can be described through various elements which make up and form this masterpiece.The first element is the cast. 'Edward Norton', as Derek was incredible, to say the least. His character possessed so much depth, which was slowly revealed to the audience as the film went on. He progressed and behaved so realistically, I no longer saw an actor playing a character. Furthermore, the casting of his entire family was perfect, in particular his younger brother Daniel played by 'Edward Furlong'. He portrayed a troubled teenage kid in the most realistic way. At times I was trying to pick flaws with aspects of his character that weren't as refined or polished, only to realise that these imperfections are true characteristics of any average kid. The history teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney, played by 'Avery Brooks, also did a spectacular job, in trying to solve the complicated situation.The second element is the screenplay. This is how a screenplay should be written. Take a simple story-line, and execute it in the most complex way possible. This screenplay takes you on a journey, by firstly showing the situation at hand as a uninformed outsider, but then slowly gives you context and background as the film progresses. This was done so coherently with brilliant flashbacks, which by the end of the film, made you look at each character in an entirely new light. This was what made the film so engaging. The fact that I was curious to see what events shaped these characters, made the flashbacks feel very much anticipated. Also the dialogue between characters was sharp and gripping, especially in scenes where opposing ideas and opinions were battling against each other. It really built the intensity and tension in the film.The final element is the cinematography. The camera movement, and editing was exceptional. The way in which flashbacks were presented in black and white, gave past events much more power and intensity. I particularly liked the way in which there was a constant focus on water. The slow motion shots of dripping water in the shower, made you really feel the exhaustion and fatigue felt by the characters.Overall, the general reason as to why 'American History X' is the purpose of film, is due to the fact that it exposes its audience to confronting aspects of our world. It is able to inform people who may live sheltered lives, much like myself, about the racism and violence, which is a constant reality for many till this day. This film provides its audience with a wider view of the world, contributing to our worldly knowledge and awareness. This is all achieved due to the perfect execution of the elements in the film, discussed above, which all assist in making this film a true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Woah !!! That was disturbing,"Hands down the most disturbing film I have ever seen. American History X is simply outstanding.One of the film's great strengths is the great all round performance by the cast. Empire Magazine claimed that Edward Norton did not win an Oscar for his performance one of the greatest Oscar injustices of all time. And I completely agree. Some of Norton's racist monologues were so convincing they bordered on being scary. The rest of the cast did great as well. I do think, however, that they could have selected a better actor to play the younger brother, Danny, but that is a nit pick, the actor in the film did fine but I just think someone could have given a more compelling dramatic performance.Overall, what I loved most about the film was the fact that it shows racism for what it is, something that is taught, how naïve people can be led to believe anything if their circumstances call for it. The disturbing scenes where very disturbing and encapsulated the sheer lack of humanity that comes with such racist cults, such as, in this case, the Neo-Nazi's. Ultimately, American History X is not for the squeamish but it is one of the best films I have ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""American History X"": A Compelling and Provocative Exploration of Hate and Redemption","""American History X"" is a powerful and intense film that explores the destructive nature of hate and racism in American society. Edward Norton delivers a powerhouse performance as Derek Vinyard, a former neo-Nazi skinhead who tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same violent path that he did. Director Tony Kaye uses striking black-and-white imagery to convey the darkness and brutality of Derek's past, while also highlighting the hope and redemption that are possible for those who choose to reject hate and embrace tolerance.One of the most impressive aspects of ""American History X"" is the way in which it portrays the complex psychological and social factors that contribute to the spread of hate and prejudice. From the legacy of institutionalized racism in America to the economic and social disenfranchisement that fuels feelings of resentment and anger, the film does not shy away from tackling difficult and uncomfortable subjects. At the same time, it also recognizes that change is possible, and that individuals have the power to choose a different path.The performances in ""American History X"" are uniformly excellent, with Norton delivering one of the most memorable performances of his career. He fully embodies Derek's rage, pain, and eventual transformation, making the character both sympathetic and frightening. The supporting cast is also strong, particularly Edward Furlong as Derek's brother Danny, who is drawn into the neo-Nazi movement as a vulnerable and impressionable teenager.Overall, ""American History X"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally powerful film that explores the dangers of hate and the possibility of redemption. It is a must-see for anyone interested in the complexities of American society and the human capacity for change.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

As a woman of color...,"Hate to start a review using the race card with overly used catch phrases as ""As a women of Color"", But I will make an exception here because I feel that my point of view is important here.I saw this in the theater when it was released in NYC, sitting in the back of the theater. There where just a few people; six skinheads in the front, a few professor types and father and son.When the scene where Edward Norton gives the young black intruder a deadly curbie, we all recoiled in shared horror at the brutal ugliness of it all.When the Edward Norton character was violently gang raped in the shower we collectively winced. His friendship and change of heart that happens left us all with a collective sigh of relief.When we all left the theater we smiled at each other and slowly talked, sociology professors, skinheads, a black father and son and me. We all agreed that this movie was very important, broke down a racial barrier that I see as breaking down. If only the mainstream news would see that the racial barriers where dissipating until the media stuck its noise in with all their critical race theory. Yes CRT is real.What I'm saying here is when left alone all races get along. Its a humanity thing. And I'm sure if there was a news camera inside the theater egging the naturally diverse theater goers into a ""Us VS Them"" scenario, then yah that would have been a newsworthy man made situation.

"One of the best movies, Norton is one of the best actors","""American History X"" is an unflinching exploration of hatred, redemption, and the power of change, earning an emphatic 9/10 rating from me. I absolutely loved every aspect of this film. Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard is nothing short of astonishing, conveying the complexity of his character's journey from bigotry to enlightenment. The film editing masterfully weaves together past and present, enhancing the narrative's impact. Its strength lies in its unapologetic message about the destructive nature of racism and the possibility of transformation. The music is hauntingly evocative, underscoring the emotional depth of the story, while the cinematography captures the stark contrast of Venice Beach's sun-soaked streets and the darkness of hatred. ""American History X"" is a brutal but necessary reflection on the enduring scars of racism, and my love for it is as profound as the film's message.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"An uneasy, sometimes uncomfortable film that pulls no punches and is powerful because of it.","'American History X (1998)' is an uneasy, sometimes downright uncomfortable film that pulls none of its punches and refuses to make any judgement on its closed-minded characters, even at the cost of potential audience alienation or possible misinterpretation. Its this very fact that gives it its power because it ultimately allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions, trusting them to understand the separation between the film itself and the contemptible characters contained within. Ultimately, it represents a vehement cry against the racism and bigotry rampant within its first two acts and also holds the belief that someone can unlearn these bizarre beliefs which are usually bored into them by an outside source. If it didn't go the distance it wouldn't have been half as successful, perhaps instead feeling like a weak-chinned exploitation piece, and its tragic conclusion may have lost its impact. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Fairy Tale,"American History X is basically a fairy tale.  It is a film about one man's implausible 3-step transformation from a naive high-school kid to a white-supremist Nazi and leader of a skinhead tribe, to an honest caring upstanding citizen who only wants to do the right thing for his family and society at large.  Like I said, a fairy tale.  I won't  reveal any more of the ending that wasn't already revealed on the preview.  Basically it's a mixed happy/sad ending, where the ""happy"" part is that the main character finally comes to terms with who we was, how evil he was, the way his evilness has negatively influenced the lives of other people, and is able to write a nice cheery new chapter in his life.  And all this happens in a short 4 years.What gets me is how unbelievably intelligent and level-headed the main character (played by Ed Norton) is, and how completely silly his transformation into a skinhead really is.Meanwhile his kid brother (played by Ed Furlong) who is also reasonably smart, follows in his brother's footsteps like a zombie.  Norton's character is clearly free-thinking and is not one to follow in other people's footsteps, while Furlong is just the opposite.  At least Furlong's character gives the impression that he might flip and go completely nuts at any given time, thereby adding some mystery to the film (Furlong is good at looking like a punk). But the reality is much more like a fairy tail.So basically the film doesn't know what it wants to be.  One the one hand, it deals with some incredibly moving race issues, and on the other hand we have a children's movie.I think The Chamber by John Grisham actually did a much better job at portraying a racist who slowly & reluctantly repents and finds the error in his ways, at the last possible moment.  At least in that film, we understand that we're dealing with someone who, at his core, is really not a very nice man.Just the opposite in X.(5 out of 10)",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Great film, One of the greatest.","Where to start ? OK. Firstly it's a straight 10 from me. A definitely one of the greatest film ever made. The film simply just doesn't go out of my mind now. I also don't want to forget about it. It's a true gem of a film that appeals not to American but to all families of the world. I would thank Tony Kaye for depicting the naked character of American society behind all the fancy of western Media. This film taught me how Americans are same as Indians or Africans on ground realities of families.American History X is not about history of America, rather a home assignment of the same name given to danny, the movie's narrator by his school teacher. This assignment makes Danny thoughtful about his elder brother, about his family issues, about society and most importantly about truth of life. The film progresses through a lot of incidents and events in flashbacks with all focusing on present -- Danny's assignment.The film in summary tells the story of Derek, who is now a parole officer and his journey of life--- what's Derek previous life is all about, what's the big change in it and how it all impacted his family and in what ways. American history X is all about an American family with common problems of life trying to live with struggle without the support of a father. The film has message, no doubt about that, perhaps reflecting more stronger message than any other film I've ever seen. It involves family issues, racism, mistakes of young life, the shameless pride, guilt ridden lives, selfish agendas, heartbreak and so much more. American History is really at a different level of storytelling, not attempting to but straightforwardly connects with our hearts and mind. This film really penetrates the soul, makes us thoughful, makes us sad, makes us learn about society, makes us to be aware of our steps in lives. The film delivers a lot of it, and that's too with brutal honesty. I would never mind the R-Certifiation due to the standard of the intention.Tony Kaye directed the film with a modern taste of narratives, with a modern set up of society too. So many flashbacks and jumps from past to present moments without a single spot of flaw or loosening grip. It simply locks up the attention till the climax and displays the emotional wound of Danny's poetic narratives, who finally understood where the real problem was. Nevertheless the film ends in tragedy where the Mother's son was sacrificed to make the father's Son understand deep. Derek's (Edward Norton) words -- 'What have I done' with tears tells a lot about what's not in silver screen and what's depicted.From filmmaking perspective its a top notch teamwork. From story to presentation, from acting to messages, the film deserves a standing applause. My favorite scene is when both brothers after realization unites to clean the room from all hate inciting environment. But American History is not about film making or script but about human lives, how people are in real world, how families struggle in ground level, how things are in modern world today. This film is not for entertainment but for learning the nakedness of increasing decent society. There's so much I could write and also want to but stopping here now, considering the boredom of my readers. Final statement -- Just watch it.A full 100/100, without a second thought.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

An amazing film,"What a fantastic raw film that focusses on showing not only the brutal acts that hate groups commit, but also showing the human elements that contributes to the corruption of adolescence. Everything about this movie is incredible from the themes that it tackles to the stylistic choices made by the filmmakers. One in particular is Tony Kaye's choice to use black and white footage to represent the changing of opinions had by Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton), physically showing how black and white everything began. Along with these awesome choices all the actors performances were on point in this film, Edward Norton is at his best giving the audience a look into his characters personal psyche. Another incredible part of this movie that I think is worth mentioning is the use of violence. I think the reality of violence in films is almost glamorized in a lot of films taking away the horror of simple acts, but not in this film. The first sequence of this film is of a brutal depiction of violence which physically makes the audience sick, and with every viewing you find yourself more and more upset with Darek Vinyard.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
An American Classic: American History X,"This snapshot of Venice, California, a racially tense seaside city, is both accurate and frightening. The irrational response of a repressed middle class white family to the indifference of an overly permissive government that allowed American tax dollars to be spent on undocumented immigrants is highlighted in a speech within the film.Aside from the political aspect, the pure visceral energy of the film's violence and frustration from all races comes directly to the consciousness of the viewer. All forms of extremism are shown to be self-defeating. A bravura performance by both Ed Norton and Ed Furlong. An American classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Nazism from a new angle, but too reliant on its lead performance","Highly regarded and seen as one of Edward Norton's most prominent roles to date, American History X is a dark retelling of racial tensions and Nazism in modern America, highlighting the unending vicious circle of conflict. Personally, Norton is leant heavily on to bring this film to life: the concept is without a doubt interesting, but doesn't go deep enough to really highlight the beliefs and thoughts of those so opposed to other belief systems and races.The story is self-explanatory enough: following a stint in prison, Derek Vinyard (Norton) tries to distance himself from his Nazi past, before realising his younger brother Danny (capably played by Edward Furlong) is already deeply integrated. Flashbacks of Vinyard's past (all shown in black and white) detail parts of his family's history, explaining his journey from one of the most hardened affiliates of the party to a far more self-aware character. Throughout the film he tries his best not to let Danny get sucked in further, but every action has an equally damaging consequence.Infamous for one scene in particular (a failed carjacking upon which a lack portion of the film is based), American History X actually isn't as revolutionary as it has been considered to be. No doubt interesting and somewhat thought provoking, some of the scenes seem gratuitous (both in violence and story-fleshing), fairing to really elevate the film. Norton himself is the gem, but without his stellar outing, it's hard to believe that this controversial film would truly be remembered today.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

masterpiece,"American History X is a perfect movie. It stunned me. As soon as I got the DVD as a gift, I always thought it was a normal movie and that I could do without seeing it. But now that I've seen it, I realize that my bias was completely wrong. There are not many central characters or that are thorough, but the two protagonists, Derek and Danny, are frighteningly beautiful. The costumes are excellent, the actors equal, Edward Norton is spatial. The sound does a great job inside the film, it represents the scene in which it is inserted, and it is one of the things that distinguishes a beautiful sound from a bad one. The cruelty of the topics and the tone used in all the scenes stunned me, I could not take my eyes off the TV. Even if we didn't get to the year 2000, the picture is beautiful. I really enjoyed the narration of the facts through the time shifts and the alternation between color scenes and black and white scenes is a huge plus. The end is emotionally strong, beautiful. This movie is now one of my 5 favorite movies and who knows if it will drop in rank, but at the level of preference, hard to beat it. I think this is one of the 3 best movies about racism and the Nazi era. He didn't just win the Academy Award for competition from ""Life Is Beautiful"" and ""Save Private Ryan,"" otherwise he would have had no rivals. If you want to get angry and strong, watch American History X..

Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role.

Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers. This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry!

It gets under your skin...,"Now, the 1998 movie ""American History X"" from writer David McKenna and director Tony Kaye is a very hard-hitting movie that is a must-watch movie actually. I remember watching the movie back when it was just released and the impact it had on me back then.The storyline in the movie, as written by David McKenna, really is a well-written one. It is a script that is not only story-driven, but most certainly also very much character-driven. And the characters in the movie are well-fleshed out and detailed, adding a lot of layers to the movie.And the cast ensemble in the movie was good. With the likes of Edward Norton in the leading role, and carrying the movie phenomenally, I might add, then you're in capable hands for 119 minutes. The movie also have good performances from the likes of Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, Stacy Keach and most definitely also from Elliott Gould.What makes ""American History X"" such a powerhouse of a movie is the story, and how well it translates into aspects of society even today. But also the great acting performances in bringing the characters to life on the screen.""American History X"" can be a visually tough movie for certain viewers, and thus it is a not a movie that is just for anyone. But I do firmly believe that director Tony Kaye's 1998 movie is one that must and should be watched. If you haven't already seen it, and have the chance to do so, you should and you must watch it.It is also a movie that can be seen more than once with some years in between each viewing. But that is a testimony to the writing of David McKenna and the contents of the script and storyline.My rating of ""American History X"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Amazing Drama!,"First off the most obvious thing about this movie that makes it so great is the acting, and I don't mean just Edward Norton I mean the entire cast. The girl from Charmed (the movie) and The Water Boy is really great though I can never remember her name. The leader of the racists, the fat racist guy (also the friend in My Name is Earl I'm pretty sure), Elliott Gould, the mom and even the little brother (and teen aged and child actors are usually awful to me). The cast of this movie is really great and make it so believable.That said obviously Edward Norton is the heart of this film. He is really awesome in this movie and gets the audience to both loathe how horrible he is but also sympathize and pity him and the life he has led and want him to earn redemption.I don't want to give away the ending but the movie is a great drama with a fantastic climax and Norton deserved the Oscar for his portrayal without a doubt!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Brutal, visceral drama on hateful tribalism and escape","Released in late 1998 and directed by Tony Kaye from David McKenna's script, ""American History X"" is an urban drama about a former neo-Nazi leader, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who tries to prevent his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), from taking the same path of hate he did. Current events are shown in color whereas flashbacks are depicted in B&W. Stacy Keach plays the behind-the-scenes mentor of the neo-Nazis while Avery Brooks appears as Danny's principal. Elliott Gould is on hand as a Jewish history teacher who is interested in Danny's mother (Beverly D'Angelo).During the first half I found some of the dramatics dubious, to be nice; you can tell that kinks needed worked out in the script or the acting. After viewing the movie, I found out that the director felt the same way, insisting that the film needed more work; he also objected to Norton re-editing scenes without his approval and even wanted his name removed from the credits.If you can roll with the palpable flaws, however, you'll likely find yourself immersed in the world of the characters by the second half. While the topic is unpleasant and there are some hard scenes to watch, ""American History X"" shoots for greatness and in some ways grasps it. For instance, there are a few moving, artistically-staged sequences, like the aftermath of the dinner-scene-from-hell and the climax. This is what I look for in great dramas, but rarely get. Norton's powerful performance is another example of the film's greatness.Someone criticized the movie on the grounds that it simplifies complex issues, but how else can you tackle a subject like this and do it justice in a 2-hour movie while keeping it entertaining? Besides, nothing was so simplified to be unbelievable, as far as Derek's character arc goes. Someone else panned the narration, but – aduh – I guess he didn't get that the words are Danny's essay assignment for his new ""class"" with the principal, which explain the movie's title.The overriding theme is that that all races/ethnicities tend to stick together and are in an undeclared war. The skinheads aren't really singled out because the movie plainly shows that their hostilities are mirrored in the other gangs, albeit with different verbiage and accouterments. While antagonistic tribalism is rampant it can't stand in the face of genuine relationship and the corresponding love and respect.ADDITIONAL CAST: Fairuza Balk plays Derek's girlfriend while Jennifer Lien and William Russ appear as his sister and father. Guy Torry is on hand as an inmate Derek slowly befriends while Ethan Suplee plays a hulking neo-Nazi.The film runs 119 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles (Venice, Venice Beach, Fairfax, North Hollywood).GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
American History,"American History X is a movie that really looks inward on America's identity of race and cultural conditioning. The way it was shot was phenomenal. It followed current and passed events and the switching of color to black/white was a really smart touch. The story itself evolved and showed how cultural conditioning can cause you to believe and do things you shouldn't but in time those life lessons bring you more maturity and a greater understanding. It was a really informative movie and one kids growing up should watch to understand. Finally, the acting and Edward Norton specifically was absolutely stellar. Definitely recommend the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Extremely Hard-Hitting, Powerful and Challenging - Norton Exceptional -","American History X is a powerful and challenging film that explores the destructive nature of racism and the possibility of redemption. The film tells the story of a former neo-Nazi named Derek Vinyard played by Edward Norton, who tries to prevent his younger brother Danny played by Edward Furlong from following in his footsteps.The film opens with a brutal scene of violence that sets the tone for the rest of the film. The scene is graphic and disturbing, but it's necessary to establish the context for Derek's journey.The film explores the roots of racism and the ways in which it can destroy individuals and communities. Through Derek's journey, we see how easy it is for people to be swept up in hateful ideologies and how difficult it can be to break free from those beliefs. Derek's transformation is gradual and not without setbacks, but it's ultimately a hopeful and uplifting story that shows the power of personal growth and redemption.One of the major strengths of American History X is its performances. Ed Norton delivers an exceptional performance as Derek, perfectly capturing the character's intelligence, charisma, and anger. He's also able to convey the character's growth and redemption without making it feel forced or contrived. Edward Furlong also gives a strong performance as Danny, a young man who's lost and searching for guidance.The film is beautifully shot, with a mix of black and white and colour footage that adds to the film's sense of realism. The use of slow-motion and close-ups also help to create a sense of tension and drama. The soundtrack is also brilliant, featuring a mix of punk and hip-hop music that complements the film's themes and tone.The themes of the film are heavy and challenging, but they're handled with great sensitivity and nuance. The film shows the almost ever-present possibility of redemption and the importance of confronting our own biases and prejudices. It's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll and will make you think about the nature of hatred and the possibility of change.Overall, American History X is a powerful and moving film that deserves to be seen. While it's not an easy film to watch, it's an important and necessary one that tackles sensitive and complex issues with intelligence and nuance.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Watch it and think about it,"I think racism of any type is simply crazy and stupid, however it just doesn't have the same meaning in different situations. It is not the same whether you have racial views in Africa or in America, whether you belong to the major ethnic group or you are part of the minority. The manifestation of racism might be the same but the substance and the motives are different. In American history x I felt these motives were pretty much unconvincing.To begin with Derek is not a cattle-like asshole, like many of his skinhead friends, who only embrace racism because they are too limited to think any further; neither he becomes a racist solely for the benefits of being part of the gang (like the majority, I suppose). Derek actually does think, he is a leader- at least that's the idea. As a result when he does become a racist he does it because of an internal belief that this is the correct, sane thing to do. He arguments, he has an opinion based on facts, he is becoming convinced because of these facts- the point is not that he misinterprets things, the point is that he is not a racist because of the emotional trauma, not because his father died, but because he thinks things that way.In addition his prison rebirth is very unlikely to me. So what was that about after all? He saw one of his gang's members buying pot from a black guy, or a Mexican, i don't remember- so what, is this thing capable to destroy his whole world-view? What did he think, that all white guys have the same ideas as he has?He met a funny, sympathetic black guy- OK , now don't tell me that Derek, intelligent as he was, thought that all black people were jerks. He was not a racist before his father's death, he actually liked Sweeney!-that part was very artificial, I mean, what is this supposed to mean, that Derek forgot just like that everything he had known about people, just because his father died? It was a trauma, his television interview-outburst might be explained with that, sort of a ""homage"" to the racist dad, but why did he start to hate EVERY black person all of a sudden from then on? Like I said before it wasn't just an emotional thing-it couldn't have been. Derek had his theory of black people being more likely to commit crimes, of taking the jobs of decent white people and so on-there was nothing in the movie that made a counter-argument to these, accepted by Derek; he simply forgot these at the end.All in all, my observation is that the movie is very well acted, well structured, but not very realistic. Derek's-and for that matter Danny's- sudden changes of their view are totally unconvincing, because they do not come from the right place- Derek is a nazi because he believes in the theory, and there's nothing that should change him so radically, because every experience he has is mainly emotional. Danny probably never was very convinced of anything, so he is actually much more credible than his brother.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Powerful & Uncomfortable,"The movie is very well done by all accounts and delivers the most powerful message on racism ever I have ever seen on screen; it's a story of how racist struggles cuts both ways and will not end with violence, vengeance or hatred, but rather love and forgiveness. I have absolutely no intention of watching this movie again nor did I really enjoy watching it, yet it is a movie that everyone should consider, and maybe even needs to see. I put it in the same category of Fight Club for that matter, a movie not intending to have a fun, feel-good message but one intended to deliver and powerful commentary on daily life.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Iconic.,"A masterpiece of how to understand racism in all phases, and how hatred could unleash the worst in humans. Edward Norton is crazy in this movie, his acting is from other level.

A great example of a story with a good moral,"As stated in the title, there are two types movies that exist, those with morals, which attempt to teach you something or reconsider a belief and those which simply attempt to entertain you, and this movie has a moral - to look at what we as human beings have become, to look deeper into ourselves and not become brainwashed by our own inability to see flaws as flaws instead of virtues, like stated in Donnie Darko (2001) ""look through your own mirror reflection,"".American History X best tells this story through the eyes of a late 90's skinhead (Derek Vineyard) who is sent to prison and learnt to face his flawed views after murdering two black men who attempted to steal his car. In prison he befriends an black inmate who practically helps change his perception of the entire concept of race. After leaving prison he discovers that his past reckless behaviour has imprinted onto his younger brother (Daniel Vineyard) who has now fully joined the clan of skinheads which Derek once belonged to, Derek must then disassociate himself and Daniel from this group to save them from continuing down the same, dangerous path which he did. Whilst at the same time Daniel is forced to write a report on his brother's incarceration by his black teacher. I will not spoil the ending for you, Generous reader, but put it this way... It made me cry.And finally back to my point on morals, American History X Displays a man's struggle to analyse himself for what he truly is and fix his problem and save his brother before it's too late, the incredible performance by Edward Norton also adds great emotion to his character too which exacerbates the feeling of struggle which plagues Derek as he attempts to piece his life back together. I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in watching greats of the film world or being thrilled by captivating storytelling, performances or a wonderfully chilling score.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"I'm glad I watched ""American History X"" (1998).","It's a good, smart, enjoyable film. I learned from it.I'd really rather not discuss its social or political messages. One glance at an online discussion of this movie shows that they're divisive and often ugly. (There are even ongoing debates about which gangs or groups should rightly be called ""Skinheads,"" and which are racist.) I'm just not in the mood for controversy this morning. I'd rather just tell you what I thought about AHX as a film.This movie had a lot of great things going for it, but two things stood out in particular. The first was Edward Norton's tour de force performance. I've liked Norton elsewhere, like ""Red Dragon,"" where he was good. Here, he's phenomenal. He's goddam frightening as Neo-nazi Derek. (He reminded me of Bill Moseley's turn as ""Otis Driftwood"" in ""House of 1,000 Corpses."") Then we see him as a redeemed man. Then, through flashbacks, he's made even more human and three-dimensional, as we see a sensitive young teenager traumatized by the death of his father. Norton was so damned good that I still seem to have trouble believing that the same actor played all three roles. I don't pretend to be a film expert; reviews like this are just a hobby. But I think I know great acting when I see it, and this was great acting.The second was a really smart script. Again, I learned from this. I always assumed that Neo-Nazis were poorly educated nuts from the fringes of society. As it turns out, they actually do have an ideology, albeit a horrible and misguided one. This movie makes a very smart move in scripting Derek and his younger brother as ""brilliant"" students, who articulate facts and motivations for doing odious things. Listening to Derek's tirades (including one cringe- inducing scene at a dinner-table) actually sheds light on what motivates the characters' real-life counterparts.Only two small things occurred to me that made this film a little less perfect than so many others have claimed it to be. First, this movie doesn't even know the meaning of subtlety. Its message and delivery were so heavy handed that it was almost an ABC afterschool special. We even have an overly convenient framing device – Derek's adulating brother, Danny (played wonderfully by Edward Furlong), is asked by an African American history teacher to write a report on Derek's life. The superior film, ""Crash"" (2004,) for example, handled racism with a hell of a lot more finesse and surprises.Second, one character arc was way too quick and implausible. After one conversation with his redeemed older brother, Danny also disavows the Neo-nazi movement? After years of propaganda and socialization by the group? I'm not so sure a disturbed, fascist teenager can be deprogrammed so easily. Did anyone else who saw this movie wonder about this as well?Still, this was a great film. I'd give it a 9 out of 10. One final note – the ending quote by Abraham Lincoln was just beautiful. I'd actually heard only snippets of it sampled by films before – once in ""Apocalypse Now"" and once in ""X2: X-Men United."" It's better in its entirety.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Absorbing Lesson,"A high school student idolizes his neo-Nazi older brother who is released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two black men. Norton is excellent in fleshing out a character who is scary because he is intelligent but filled with hate against minorities. Furlong gives a finely understated performance as his quiet younger brother. In fact, the entire cast does a good job, including D'Angelo as Norton's mother and Gould as a Jewish teacher subjected to Norton's venomous rage. A remarkable film debut for director Kaye, although his at-times overly flashy camera-work and use of extreme closeups for no apparent reason is distracting.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Black and White politics,"This title, Black and White politics has two dimensions in its context. The first one simply points out the racist drawings about the Black and white people in America and the second one recalls us that the Black & white period were people who seem to be colorless. American History X is none other than that. The subject is so strong and it has its world appeal. It looks familiar not only in America but also in the entire world. Racism and important topic which was talked, discussed and rectified (up to a mark) all-time ago but it has its significance in these times also. We are unable to eradicate it. And that core element swings through each and everyone which indirectly points to secularism and the shut down of secularist vision. Racism has strong roots nowadays also. When it comes to the film, mainly it revolves around the character of Norton, his subjective consequences, and his mind stage from wrong to right and his relieving part. In the end, there comes another beginning of the circle where he carries his brother's shot dead body. The politics is just between black and white similarly it was the politics in between right and wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the best films I've ever seen.,"IMDb Top 250: 38AHX is, in my young eyes, one of the best films ever created. A dark story, brilliantly acted, shown in all its brutality and vulgarity. A film that speaks to everyone: hate is baggage, and change is possible. And AHX has a great story to express that message with. It is truly a modern classic.The most in-your-face part of American History is Derek, played by Edward Norton. Like De Niro in Taxi Driver, he is iconic, or will be in the future. Norton performs incredibly, showing the cruelty and violence of a Neo Nazi, as well as the hurt and sincerity of a changed man. How he didn't win the Oscar with that shaved head and tattoo is beyond me. It's worth seeing the film for him alone...But almost all the other actors are as great, but don't have the part of Derek Vinyard. Furlong, as Danny, is great as the young, developing Derek, who smokes, writes papers on Mein Kampf, but still sticks up for the white kid who gets beat up and has time to give his sister 'airplane rides'. The rest of the family is well played, you can relate to them, and you can feel for them.Only Seth and Derek's girlfriend are hard to watch. Seth is intentional though: he's an urban redneck, blind in his faith. The girlfriend is out of place. How a one-dimensional, trashy girl like that could end up with the ruthless (yet importantly smart) Derek is a little far fetched.The music is quiet, yet important. It has a very American feel to it, and wouldn't be out of place in Saving Private Ryan. During the opening credits, it gives the viewer a feel for what's to come: an emotionally charged film set in their backyard.And it is emotional. The use of black and white in flashbacks is perfect, and slow-mo in important scenes really adds to their emotional punch. You will feel emotions watching this: not sadness, but that might happen, but shame. That snide joke you made to your buddies behind that person's back, that prejudice you thought in your head, well American History X will remind you of that.The plot is well crafted and well told, the flashbacks are placed perfectly, and the pacing keeps things constantly interesting. If you can stomach the infamous scenes and the ample, but necessary language, American History X might just change you as a person for the better. 9.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Great deep-reaching movie about hate,"American History X hits America and its wide, problematic racism right on its present spot. Many racism-related films make you hate hatred. This film rather wants to get to the bottom of it, making a statement of what need to be done.It doesn't just show racist people, in this case neo-nazis, as frustrated, lonely people reaching out to whomever willingly to accept them. The main character, played convincingly by Edward Norton, is an intelligent orator and charismatic leader, who let his black side explain the problems of society, and act accordingly.Hate is shown from both sides. Good reasons for hate are presented. At the same time the narrowsighted aspect of it carefully comes to light, making you see that hate blinds your good judgement. Making you reject there is a flip side to the matter. If you see beyond the entertaining value of this film (which is great), it might actually grab you, wanting you to help those who hate.This movie also makes a huge point of the effect trusted persons arguments have on others.

good film that could have been great,"Racists in movies usually don't get treated like real characters in films. Usually they're seen as the guys in white masks that nobody ever who never even get to utter more then a few cliche lines. My guess as to why is that in an age of political correctness most filmmakers are afraid to dig deep into the psyche of the average racist. In Happiness, film makers showed a pedophile without judgement. In Silence of the Lambs Anthony Hopkins portrayed a serial killer who is not only treated like a real character but is actually likeable! If they can do that in a film then surely should be able to make a film that portrays racism in a realistic and thought provoking manner. American History X is a good movie for that reason. It is the first film since Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" that deals with racism in a frank and open way and is unafraid of offending it's audience. What keeps ""American History X"" from being a great film (like ""Do the Right Thing"")is that some of the characters' actions seem contrived to fit the plot. Edward Norton's character is awfully wishy washy for a guy with deeply felt convictions. In one scene, he's talking about how much he hates blacks, then joking around with a black is enough to make him the picture of love and acceptance. Also, the film has a shock ending that does not make sense and confuses the message of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
a preachy self-important mess,"I disagree very strongly with most of the people on this board. It seems strange that I despise this movie with such venom while other people hold it up as a perfect piece of work. Maybe my standards are higher. Maybe I've seen so many movies that I can see cliches more clearly than most. Maybe I expected more from a film with an ambition to change the world. Maybe I'm feeling disappointment because it failed so completely.I think ""American History X"" is a complete waste of your time. This is the story of a neo-Nazi named Derek who repents and gets out of prison just in time to save his kid brother Danny, who is going down the same skinhead path. That's the whole story. Everything else is atmosphere and complication, with sermons at every turn. I can understand why the director wanted to remove his name from the picture.Likewise, I can understand why Edward Norton was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Derek, the jailbird brother. Norton is one of our best actors and squeezes lots of blood from this stone of a production. His speech rhythms and body language are wonderful. However, I can't find anything else to recommend apart from Norton's performance. The script is preachy, predictable, simplistic and badly staged. Edward Furlong is useless as Danny the baby skinhead, and the annoying fat guy who blabbers Nazi platitudes is one of the worst actors I have ever seen in a major motion picture. The black-and-white flashback device would be laughable in a film school thesis, and it's embarrassing to see it used here. It took all my strength to stomach the scene at the end where the brothers slowly remove all the Nazi propaganda from Danny's bedroom wall in ultra-dramatic fashion. This is an amateurish production of a bad screenplay that didn't think itself through.I didn't believe anything that happened here. Why are all the neo-Nazi punks dressed so impeccably? Shouldn't they be lower-class kids wearing hand-me-downs and thrift store bargains? Maybe there would be a few trust-fund lads around, but the whole crowd of Nazi youth looks like they shop at the Gap and J. Crew. We find out that Derek experienced a trauma in prison, and are expected to believe not only that this event completely changed him, but also that Danny would make an immediate character switch as soon as he hears about Derek's prison experience. I didn't buy it, and why should I? This movie thinks I am stupid enough to believe anything I see without questioning it. And isn't that why we have neo-Nazis to begin with?Don't believe the hype.

How can you describe better the look on a mans face when he realizes that there is nothing he can say to make these young men understand that they are wrong?The actors and directing just makes me weak. Edvard Norton is one of the very best actors I have ever seen, and this is definitely his best performance so far. There is not even a one bad actor in this film.This is not just about neo-nazism, this is about violence in family, about love, stupidity, ignorance, repent.

American History X is one of the best motion pictures ever produced concerning the prejudice and one of the most marking movies of all times!,"American History X is one example of motion picture that can be called cinematographic art! It is absolutely not a film for those who go to the movies just for fun; it is, in fact, for those who see art as an object of reflection about our world, ourselves and our lives. It is a motion picture in which the image says more than a thousand words, concerning a serious and real drama that affects not only the America but the whole world: the prejudice, one of the most irrational attitudes of human kind; proving that some legacies must end.

"Gripping and intense, and Norton is fabulous enough to rise above the clichés","American History X (1998)Well, Edward Norton is so astonishing, and almost scarily convincing, you can overlook a lot of the well worn themes that guide the plot. In fact, all of the acting is strong, especially the little brother to Norton's skinhead character, an up and coming skinhead played by Edward Furlong.The movie is covers basically a 24-hour period, but a good half of the screen time is flashbacks, presented in black and white to great effect. Not only does this help us keep track of what we are watching (the different lengths of hair help, too), but it adds pure style to what is basically a violent crime and prison film. It's fast, well edited, and filled with powerful social imagery and gut-wrenching interpersonal scenes.Crime and prison life form the backdrop for the two main things that give the movie depth. The first is obvious, maybe--race issues between blacks and skinhead whites in Venice Beach. It gets painfully oversimplified, maybe out of necessity in less than two hours, but it works well enough. The second is more important--the love and mutual admiration between two brothers. They are just kids, really, though Norton's role is very adult by the end. Their interactions are the best thing the movie has, and luckily they permeates everything, beginning to end.Clichés in this kind of world might be inevitable in this kind of mainstream movie, but if the African Americans are especially cardboard in their depictions, Norton's portrayal of justified racism really chilling, and the interactions within his family complex and revealing. The other Hollywood plot elements are things you just have to go along with. The kinds of good guys and bad guys, suffering mother and angry sister, the prison culture and street culture, and even the use of guns everywhere are not far from some Italian-American mobster movie, and I suppose that's partly just the truth of it. But it also seems a little easy, a rewriting of a common set of circumstances.Too common. Which is part of the point. You sometimes wish there wasn't a message to every movie like this--American History X is heavy on the moralizing--but the message is a slam dunk. The movie will leave you reeling.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Shocking, moving, brilliant","American History X will go down in my memory as one of the best dramatic films ever. It pulled no punches, dealing with racism in its most extreme, violent form, illustrating well how destructive bigotry can be to those unwillingly exposed to its venom and hatred. Undoubtedly the star and shining light of this film was Edward Norton, who finally broke through into the elite of Hollywood, where he fully deserves to be. His portrayal of Derek Vineyard was flawless, hardened bigot one moment, reformed and remorseful killer the next. No doubt that in any other year he would have walked off with Best Actor, his performance was breathtaking. Ed Furlong also delivered a really top performance, as the younger impressionable Danny, delivering his best performance since Terminator 2. Gritty and harsh, this film will live in my memory for a long time to come, not only for the shocking nature of it, but for the best dramatic performance by an actor in a long time. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Its performances make this a standout film.,"Utterly outstanding performances from the two Edwards (Norton and Furlong). American History X is a fine blend of drama and thriller, a story behind the leader of a neo-nazi cultist Derek Vinyard (Norton), seen from the eyes of his younger brother Danny (Furlong). AHX flicks from flashbacks of Derek's rise (head of a cult) and fall (murder), and rise again (redemption), to his present day atonement. Derek's crime is one of the most violent off-screen acts in cinema history. Danny looks up to his older brother, slowly but surely following his footsteps. It's down to Derek to put things right. This film sticks to the back of the mind, because the representation of its immoral actions are heavy, powerful and a harsh kick on reality regarding hate-crime.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

You can see the white supremacist in him, and you can see the reformed man in him afterwards; you can see it all in his eyes. Everything about the movie feels great: the cinematography, the black and white shots, the soundtracks, and the acting-omg, that portrayal by Edward Norton!

A Stunner,"I went to see this a couple of weeks ago, and it was one of the better movies that ive seen this year. Even though it came out in USA last year its only just been released where i live. This was an excellent drama, some very brutal scenes in the movie. It was also very scary because Edward Nortons performance as a skinhead, was so utterly convincing. He's definately one of the best actors around.      A few negative things stuck out in the movie though. For example when Derek is telling Danny about his turnaround in prison, Danny accepts he's right straight away, and if Derek was so intelligent and smart, how come he was so easily turned towards hating blacks? I know his father put a few thoughts in his head, and he was killed by a black gang, but please!! I also thought the slow motion scenes were a bit too ""Hollywood"". I shouldn't be too picky though, because although the movie has a few flaws, American History X is still a stunner.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Don't believe the hype,"I was curious to see what other people thought of this movie, and am genuinely surprised to see this ranked so highly in IMDb polls.What are the sins of American History X? First of all, the narrative structure is confused, to no good purpose. By showing Edward Norton's jail-stay in flashback, when we already know he's grew disillusioned with the movement, all dramatic interest is removed from the scenes. And the method of his conversion was so trite as to be laughable. While his prison scenes should have been the most powerful part of the movie, they just felt like a waste of time (and using B&W for the past is such an embarrassingly Hollywood device).Secondly, the script is just terrible. You feel embarrassed for the actors as they're forced to talk entirely in polemic. Characters just didn't talk or relate to each other in a way similar to how people talk or relate to each other. And I felt American History X's take on violence was too cartoonish, where it should have felt genuine. The scenes felt adapted from action movies, whether the scene was sufficiently brutal or not doesn't make it better or worse.You have to review artwork based on what the artist was trying to do, and how well he did it. The movie was trying to provide insight in the neo-Nazi mentality, while providing insight into the real cause of the racial violence. However, the unrealistic characters and the Hollywood-ish take on violence left the movie flat in both regards.",,Anonymous,Drama
Very overrated but not bad,"I finally saw the famous ""American History X"" and while it was a decent movie, I'm reading here that it is one of the greatest films ever made? Maybe the greatest ever made? Wow, those are some accolades. I'm thinking, hey it was decent, but are you kidding me?The film isn't bad, but no matter how one tries to disguise it, preachy is preachy. There are a few things not too evident in the film. One is how many ""typical"" Americans totally concur with the societal views of Norton's character, especially everything he said at the dinner table. Maybe people don't want another Hitler around, but millions do feel the way he did about immigrants and why America has been falling into the toilet. So when they come out the mouth with a guy with a huge swastika tattooed on his body, they appear to be ""extreme."" Considering that even right now, at this second,with racism so high among non-whites towards whites, and many millions of Americans being tired of the advantages illegal immigrants have for instance, those views aren't always so ""extreme"" after all.And the racism in the film - it's predominantly white-on-black, and again, since the whites here are skinheads and Nazis, their views seem ""extreme"" despite the millions that agree (again, short of reviving Hitler). It is rare we see black-on-white racism in the movie, and even when we hear (or see in the deleted scenes) that the leader and the fat guy got attacked by blacks, they don't get too much sympathy from the viewer. The black kid in the final violent scene probably came the closest to showing any black racism, muttering the phrase ""white boy"" earlier in the film and getting in Danny's face.The turnaround of Norton's character in the prison is just too convenient. The film even gets a little sappy here - watch the neo-nazi lighten up to his black cleaning partner, because the black guy does funny things and makes him laugh. It's almost like this black guy was there for Norton's amusement, putting on a minstrel show, even wearing a sheet over his head imitating a klansman and making funny sounds. Look, now they are even talking about basketball together! If you spend one-on-one time with anyone long enough you will lighten up to them, but to change your whole philosophy?Even Norton's reason for his prison stay - gangbangers don't go after revenge anymore? After what happened, they don't even go after the family? Heck, they even knew the address!I think the film may have been much better if the part that was supposed to be tagged on at the end of the film was actually filmed and inserted. ""American History X"" was a decent movie, and the acting was especially good. But it is a very flawed film, too easy, and really doesn't reflect reality as much as so many think it does.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Excellent!,"American History X is a incredible and brilliant view on racism that has become one of the most loved and acclaimed films of all time. The plot shows us the terrible views of racism and how the people who support it are like, it does it incredibly just by showing us what could happen to a man like Derek Vinyard, who is simply just a brilliant character and was amazing to watch, his brother Danny represents how racism spreads through family and how we should teach them not to treat other this way. The cast is great as well, Edward Norton plays his best performance I have ever seen since Fight Club and this may be the best acting of his career. Edward Furlong was also great and was the best child performance of 1998 and he did an amazing job. American History X is one of my favorite films of all time.

Dramatic But Disappointing,"This is really a frustrating Movie. It has a lot worth watching but there are some things that keep this from being a great Movie. There is Edward Norton's versatile performance and some good looking Cinematography and it is all in support of a sociological/psychological problem that is forever haunting the American Dream.It is a confusing and only slightly believable, if powerful, story of racism and hatred. People searching for solutions to complex problems and lashing out with unintelligent behavior. Both the White Supremacist and the Black Gangs are equally ignorant and their actions are stupefying.The Film makes a powerful effort for it all to be meaningful, but it comes across as somewhat stereotypical. It is far less insightful than it pretends to be. It is all carried along by the extreme portrayals and the darkly poetic visuals.The prison middle and heroic transformation has the weakest of explanations and is rather shallow. Add to that the overacting of a fat Neo-Nazi and a stilted educator swallowing his lines as if he really doesn't believe anything he is saying, and the Film is rendered interesting but overrated.

Let's not get carried away over this mediocre film,"This is the story of a white supremacist who changes his ways when someone points out to him that all his campaigning only served to make his life even worse than it had been before.  Well, yes.  He's in prison.  Other people at other times have been put in prison for waging battles they believed to be just; sometimes, the battles WERE just.  We wouldn't have wanted Hitler's opponents, for instance, to give up and go with the flow, just because that would have made their lives easier - would we?Moreover, Danny's racism had intellectual grounds.  When he goes into his rants he offers reasons - honest to goodness reasons - why others should believe what he believes.  Does anyone ever offer him or us opposing reasons?  Not that I noticed; instead, they look at him as they'd look at someone who spoke out of turn in church.  Those who agree with Danny will feel cheated, with reason; those who disagree will (or ought) feel even more cheated, with even greater reason.I haven't given you the full story.  While he's in prison, Danny actually MEETS a black man, for the first time in his life.  He changes his mind partly because he learns something, which is what prevents the film from being infuriating.  As drama, it's distinctly so so.  The characters are worth knowing, listening to, and following - even if the conclusion is an unmotivated cheat.Smack in the middle of Ordinary Road, that's where this film is.

True masterpiece,"American History X is one of the most powerful movies released in years. Not since Schindler's List has the subject of racism been so potently presented. The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.Although the film contains a constant strong theme of violence, it is always justified in portraying a picture of racial tension.

A Powerful History Lesson For Us ALL !!!,"The third best film of 1998 is a tenacious, overwhelming depiction of hate for no reason and stupidity that is learned.  Everybody should see this picture, no matter how old, or what color, race, or creed.  AMERICAN HISTORY X is not profound, is not symbolic, and does not have a hero who lets us know at the end that this is all wrong.  In fact, Ed Norton is quite the anti-hero, even after release from prison.  You see he killed two African-Americans who were robbing his car on his own property.  It was certainly NOT self-defense.AMERICAN HISTORY X is a message movie, no doubt about it.  But the message is not told in words or speeches by the actors.  Experiences tell the story of some very small-minded people who believe they have the temerity to ""rid"" a portion of California of ""unwanted, inferior races.""  A racial basketball game punches what the opening sequence pulled off right home.  Norton is a 'lieutenant' in the D.O.C., a neo-Nazi organization.  He is the leader while a sinister Stacey Keach recruits and brainwashes from a headquarters somewhere in the city (Venice Beach, CA).  If the whites win, the blacks must leave the court, forever.  I can only imagine the cheers or jeers this scene brought about in audiences who saw the picture during its brief theater run.  In fact, it was probably in the public's best interest not to keep it out too long.  This is sad, but a point is presented here.  Smart, open-minded people will see the senselessness of it all and see racism for what it is: sheer stupidity and ignorance.The film is presented in an interesting narrative method, with flashbacks in black and white before Norton's incarceration.  After his release, we see in living, breathing color the scary gangland that is the racial atmosphere in this section of Cali.  The tragedy of it all is Norton's little brother, played by Edward Furlong (TERMINATOR II), who is clearly headed down the same swasticized path Norton went down.  In prison, Norton's status in the neo-Nazi underworld was heightened to God-like and Furlong, young and impressionable, looks to carry the torch.  Throughout, we see scenes of demeaning race relations and brutal dialogue and ideas put forth blatantly by the skinheads.  Ed Norton, one of the best actors of his generation, bulked up considerably to look the part of the sick skinhead, but after some waking up in jail, he has had enough.Rumors spread rampantly that Norton and director Tony Kaye fought while filming and that a disagreement ensued.  Whoever's ""vision"" won out is the correct one, because this film never steps wrong.  It may be headed down a predictable path, but there are multiple ways this picture could end.  Doom and tragedy are in the air and you just know someone is going to die for no other reason than learned racism and philosophy on different creeds.  It's a shame that the ideas come from someone who should've been the most responsible person in these kid's lives.  He was incapable of shielding them from these idiotic thoughts of single-minded bigotry.  Catholics, Jews, Prodestines, African-Americans, and most importantly, skinhead Nazis should see this important work of art and think about the shame of it all.RATING: 10 of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Beautiful and Important film,"I watched 'American History X' at a time in my life when I was thinking deeply about all the facets of racism and how it arises from the environments we are born into. I'm happy to say his film not only confirmed my own thoughts on these subjects but gave me even more insight into this worldwide problem. Being a white female who is probably still quite naive about racism because none of it ever comes my way, I am glad about the things I learned from this film. I find it interesting (and depressing) how so many movies and TV shows out there seem to glorify this idea of 'retribution' or vigilantism; the idea that one is not only righteous in murdering someone who has wronged them/harmed their family, but they gain respect from their peers (or those viewing the film)for doing so. Until I watched American History X I was yet to find a film that glorified forgiveness and change. For most of my life, I myself did not understand the concept of forgiveness, and unquestioningly believed in things like capital punishment, like many others around me (thankfully, I don't anymore!) What I love and relate to in this film is that it illustrates that every person, even those furtherest into their own beliefs, can change, and should be given the chance to do so. Some may say that the ending is cliché, but honestly I think when it comes to films with a message like this one, such observations are irrelevant and mundane. The ending was vital to the overall point of the film because it serves as a warning. At the risk of sounding cliché myself, the end of this film warns us not to carry on the cycle of violence, but to forgive, and let people change. It's called evolution :)",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"One of the Most Important Films of the 1990s, Should Be Required Viewing","""American History X"" was overlooked in 1998, but was probably the best film of the year, with the exception of ""The Thin Red Line"".  The film deals with a young man (Edward Norton in an Oscar-nominated performance) who goes over the edge when his fire-fighting father is killed trying to put out a blaze in a crack-house in an African-American neighborhood.  Now Norton becomes a neo-Nazi skinhead who falls in with an evil businessman (Stacey Keach). After Norton kills two African-Americans who are trying to steal his truck, he gets sentenced to a prison term which is much shorter than it should have been.  On the outside, his younger brother (Edward Furlong) is becoming the same type of evil person that Norton is.  When Norton gets out of prison, he shows that he has had a change of heart and realizes that hate is wrong. After Furlong realizes that Norton has truly changed, he wants to know what happened to Norton during his prison stay.  Norton tells his story in flashbacks which are shown in black-and-white.  We see Norton being cut down to size while he's in prison.  He is betrayed by those same type of people that he thought he supported and befriends a young African-American inmate. When Norton learns that his new friend is in prison for an even longer stretch than him for a somewhat minor crime (trying to steal a television), Norton realizes that the system that he hates so much is really more fair to him than minorities.  Norton's story touches Furlong and they abandon a lifestyle which has almost destroyed their lives.  However, there are enemies lurking in the shadows (Keach's neo-Nazis and local African-Americans) and revenge against Norton and his family may be a real possibility in the end.  ""American History X"" is an unflinching film which is very difficult to sit through, but is well-worth one's time.  The screenplay is excellent and the editing techniques are surprisingly impressive as well (cutting from vivid color to black-and-white sequences). Director and cinematographer Tony Kaye was disgusted at the final-cut of this film and went public beforehand to acknowledge that the final product was not his vision.  This testimonial created controversy and stole much of the film's thunder when it was first released; this was really unfortunate. The greatest thing that makes ""American History X"" work are the players. Edward Norton is excellent, as usual.  Edward Furlong shows amazing range as well.  Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, and Stacey Keach all do the best work of their careers as well.  An amazing accomplishment and one of those films that should be required viewing to all young people.  Probably the most under-rated film of the 1990s.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Drama
Evils of racism exposed by scorching drama,"""American History X""Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS(Color & black and white)An angry young white supremacist (Edward Norton) is reformed whilst in prison for killing two black men, and struggles to prevent his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from travelling down the same desperate path.Scorching drama, elevated by Norton's intense performance as the frustrated rebel whose intelligence is twisted by circumstances into an all-consuming hatred of minorities, until his eyes are finally opened to the realities of such manufactured racism. Commercials/music video director Tony Kaye made his feature debut here, though the project was taken out of his hands by studio bosses and 'completed' by Norton following a lengthy editing process, prompting Kaye to reject the finished product (he was refused permission to credit himself as 'Humpty Dumpty'). David McKenna's script describes the ways in which Nazi ideology is propagated by strong-minded individuals who impose their influence on the young and vulnerable (Stacy Keach plays the head of Norton's local skinhead chapter, who co-ordinates episodes of violent 'activism' from a safe legal distance), and how it manifests itself amongst those without an appropriate outlet for their aggressive tendencies.The film kicks into high gear from the outset, when the full extent of Norton's racism becomes apparent during a horrific confrontation with his widowed mom's new boyfriend (Elliott Gould), followed by a gut-wrenching scene in which Norton commits the sickening crime that will send him to prison and change his life forever. There, his worldview is profoundly challenged not only by his friendship with African-American co-worker Guy Torry (terrific in a pivotal role), but also by the double standards employed amongst the skinhead gangs he encounters within the prison system. For these characters, there can be no happy ending, and the film builds to a shattering finale. Also starring Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, William Russ and an unrecognizable Fairuza Balk.

Trite and Moronic Sensationalism,"Reminiscent of Spike Lee's Malcolm X who's main character had a change of heart and mind in prison that was followed by an epiphany when he saw men and woman of all races alike searching for answers, American History X unfortunately fails to demonstrate the most important element of any cathartic journey: Soul Searching.This is an obvious fiction of a boy who filled the vacuum of his missing father with a figure who would do his father's murder justice. The idea is interesting. However, it attempted to gather sympathy (and successfully) for the boy's plight by taking pot shots at easy targets. Derek is portrayed early in the movie preaching a succinct set of more than half-baked ideals which magically disintegrated with his ""change of heart"" in prison; when all his better angels kindly removed his indignation. The most insulting nugget of sanctimoniousness is Sweeny's comment ""Ask yourself one question...has this made your life better?"". Folks, when fighting for ANY cause, no-one ever expects the quality of one's life to improve. Did Ghandi's life improve by fasting?!Frankly, this is a very tough and serious subject that deserves more than a `change of heart'; it also demands a change of mind. It demands a journey of thought and reason. But in Hollywood who needs reason when you have tears, right? Thus we're left with a serious theme that is trampled by trite and exaggerated sensationalism.I believed at first that the sanctimoniousness was Tony Kaye's. But perhaps this touch is Edward Norton's who apparently monkey-ed around in post-production to the point where Tony Kaye wanted to use a pseudonym (I don't blame him). This wouldn't surprise me after seeing Norton's naive tear-jerker Keeping the Faith. Unfortunately, in Norton I'm ""Losing the Faith"".This movie could've been much better if it was created for grown ups. But then it would have to have been created by grown ups.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
nothing goes unnoticed,"The film shows that nothing goes unnoticed. Even a seemingly ordinary conversation at the dinner table can grow into a violent garden of hatred and malice, destruction and murder. Action generates opposition, those who really deserve it do not always suffer, and often innocent people have to pay for the mistakes of others. And help can come from the one from whom you least expect it. But I want to elaborate not on this, but on Derek's words before the attack on the supermarket. After all, if you think about his words, then he said everything correctly. His fiery speech absolutely correctly formulates the problem of emigrants and forces us to fully agree with it. Emigrants are needed to dilute a highly developed cultural society, to maintain the population. Recent events in England have clearly shown the problem of the non-indigenous population. Yes, they were born and live in the country, more than one generation has changed, but the genetic memory of Africans, Indians, Asians and others has not gone anywhere. Whole generations of families of African descent live on benefits and do not even seek to get an education, find a decent job. What for? After all, you can live by theft, distribution of drugs, weapons, etc. And this genetic memory, like an infection, penetrates the unformed minds of young Englishmen, forcing them to maraud too.

Lesson about racism...,"""American History X"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a former neo-nazi skinhead trying to protect his brother from doing the same mistakes as him. He has to hurry and reveal everything to him in order to prevent him of taking the same path before it's too late.I have to admit that I was left speechless after watching this movie. The plot was simply exceptional with many great scenes and some plot twists that I could not even imagine, and along with the direction which was made by Tony Kaye, this masterpiece was made. The interpretation of Edward Norton who played as Derek Vinyard was simply outstanding and he made the difference in this movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Edward Furlong's who played as Danny Vinyard, Ethan Suplee's who played as Seth Ryan and Guy Torry's who played as Lamont. Finally, I have to say that ""American History X"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch because I am sure that everybody can learn something from it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
An Understanding,"This movie will open your eyes, no matter how shut you had them. The horrors and atrocities this movie will portrays will resonate with a person no matter what his views are. A huge emphasis in the movie is given to the influence an older brother has on his younger kin, Tony Kaye shows how even the seemingly most horrid acts such as murder can be seen in a good light by a person who looks up to the person committing them. Overall the movie is relatively disturbing in the beginning, but by the end of the first hour and then towards the end the movie starts to resemble a coming of age movie.

"American History X is about prejudice, changes and reflections. Full of remarkable scenes, Edward Norton delivers a lifetime performance in this darker portrait of humanity","Considered one of the greatest films of all time, we can easily define that ""Our American History"" does not have an exact time to be based or portrayed, as the criticism it makes is conducive to any generation. We are talking about a production that does not criticize neo-Nazi thoughts, but society in general. The production is about prejudice, changes and reflections, something we thought we had overcome, but which sometimes seems so common in the 21st century.The Other American Story, feature film directed by Tony Kaye that tells the story of a skinhead (Edward Norton) arrested for murdering two black people and who tries to save his brother (Edward Furlong) when he returns home. The film follows two narrative lines: a past in black and white, exposed as a work of his brother for school, and the present, in color, with Derek's return to the house. These color changes are meant to show the conflict of right and wrong. Derek's past is always presented in black and white, as if it were a dark stain on his reality, while the present is given bright colors to make it clear that he is no longer that man. As Dan is the narrator, the story is based on his own point of view about his brother and the reality he lives in (where only white people seem to deserve a place on the planet).Derek Vinyard, lived by an excellent Edward Norton (Brooklyn: Motherless), embodies two people. Not that one is better than the other. The dislike for his character persists after the ice is broken by his fellow prisoner, when he suffers the violence he preaches or even in his moments of despair. It's with him forever, just like the swastika he carries on his chest. The character knows this and the director is keen to expose the feeling in the way he looks in the mirror.While the two brothers Derek and Danny appear to be strong and intelligent, they demonstrate incredible psychological fragility and are easily manipulated. An example: there is a scene in which Derek, still a young man, is talking excitedly about how he felt urged to study by his new teacher. Derek's father (an uneducated and prejudiced man) questions him with a rural speech, but that is enough to change the firstborn's initial opinion. Why, years later, Derek would again be manipulated by Cameron and become an asshole neo-Nazi. And finally, he would change his mind after a new meeting with his old teacher and by his own negative experiences with his lifestyle. Dan is the same. Tired of being just his brother's reflection, he decided to follow in the same footsteps. He was indoctrinated by Cameron, but his fuel to participate in that nonsense was just the love and admiration for his brother. So much so that when Derek recounts his experiences, he changes his mind drastically.The film focuses on supremacist acts that flaunt hatred of black people. Racist and xenophobic speeches are part of Derek and his friends' playbook. The protagonist's actions, more than his speech, show that lives do not matter, they are something irrelevant. And there is an expansion, when he talks about stimulating racism in the country itself, when he compares crimes and penalties. David McKenna's screenplay pays little attention to causes and focuses on hate, even though it establishes the planted seed. His interest is in the misrepresentation of the individual at the moment when dehumanization takes place. Satellite characters confirm degeneration, in punctual disrespect, as in any interaction of Seth, or in Cameron's manipulative cynicism. Art that looks over the top but might not be, exposes every Nazi symbol it can manage. And Kaye does not skimp on the use of objects, highlighting boots, iron crosses and making counterpoints with the American flag.American History X pervades historical situations. There are the attacks on Rodney King, the trial of the police and the uprising in Los Angeles to reach the level of propagandist blindness that affects people who have fascism inside them and decide to assume it. ""The video was manipulated"", ""the prison system is made up mostly of black people"", says Derek without listening to anything his interlocutor tries to say. A hateful blindness that cannot see any other side than the one he wants to believe in. And much of the film's tension is in the efficiency of the script's dialogues, but mainly in the close-ups that the director insists on keeping in practically all the scenes where the conversations are more serious, as in the moment when Dan argues with the school principal. As the camera is right on the actors' faces, which is another demonstration of the trust the director had in his cast (and in their quality, obviously), the spectator feels all the pressure of the scene.The central objective of the film is to show the characters as human, flawed beings, showing that this thinking is not exclusive to monsters, but to people with a weak, fragile and desperate mind, who cling to a dishonest, immoral and opportunistic speech due to lack of of choice, making use of values common and dear to all to establish itself as a dominant behavior. Upon his return from prison, Derek's transformation isn't just physical. He lost 22 kilos, grew his hair and is embarrassed to be shirtless precisely because of his tattoos. Upon returning from prison he really looks different, demanding morality from his relatives. It is only after some time of exhibition that it is elucidated how the scene at the beginning ended, and how violent and serious the action of the central character was. Danny changed and became a skinhead after watching his brother kill a black man in cold blood. That was the moment when both would drastically change, the beginning of the process of redeeming one and deteriorating the other.David McKenna's script is so frank and pragmatic that it does not allow itself to be dreamy or naive, showing that the destinies of people who get involved or get involved with ideas of this nature or with pure and simple intolerance, tend to suffer, even if they repent and live differently. American History X accurately shows how fascism can easily touch ordinary people, helping to evoke the worst possible feelings, dominating hearts and minds with ease, and leaving only a trail of blood and sadness in its wake.This is also the classic example of a feature dominated by its performances and the story it has to tell. Not only is Norton spectacular, but Furlong gives the performance of a lifetime, and Guy Torry, the black prison worker, gives us a wonderful and moving performance, so inevitably other technicalities end up being hidden - which doesn't absolve from not maintaining the very high level of the film. Tony Kaye's assured direction; the cinematography, subtly dark, working with black and white during flashbacks and playing with colors throughout the film, evoking an indescribable feeling of insecurity in moments that have more morbid tones. The soundtrack by the great Anne Dudley, who had already won an Oscar the previous year, is perfect in every moment.The conclusion is that, through Derek's story, is that hate arises primarily from ignorance and a lack of empathy. Being white, born American and having had a minimally good living condition, Derek was unable to understand the socioeconomic inequality between whites and blacks, or the inhumane conditions in many countries that lead people to seek exile in the United States and Europe, until having been arrested and forced to admit all this from experience. But then he had already killed two people and lost 6 years of his life, with the risk that his brother would be next. Due to the blunt script, filled with very well written dialogues, which faithfully illustrate the last paragraph and for one of the best performances by Edward Norton, American History X is highly recommended, especially in the current world context in which we see prejudices as odious as racism and xenophobia being defended again around the world.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
His Father Taught Him To Hate. His Friends Taught Him Rage. His Enemies Gave Him Hope.,"An excellent exemplification of provocative filmmaking, American History X is a brutally honest, hard-hitting, very unsettling, fiercely violent & absolutely devastating but crucial look at the destructive nature of racism & tells the story of a former neo-nazi skinhead who tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same wrong path that he did years ago.Direction & screenplay is mercilessly brutal & uncompromising, cinematography elegantly switches from present timeline to flashbacks, editing adds a smooth transition to its non-linear narration & music fits it perfectly but the most impressive contribution comes from the strong, blistering & career-best performances from Edward Norton & Edward Furlong.Beginning with a shocking opening sequence, remaining very intense throughout its runtime & culminating with an even more dreadful ending, American History X successfully completes its arc of racism & hate and, in a hard-hitting manner, accomplishes its goal of depicting the price one ultimately pays, sooner or later, for following the path of hatred.Powerful Cinema.

Decent movie showing the perils of hate,"American history x is the story of reformed neo-nazi Derek vineyard. The movie is very in your face, almost to the point of shock value. Def not for the faint of heart as some of the scenes and most of the language is rather harsh. The film wants to point out the perils of racism, and it does a ok job of that in the end, but it's obvious society isn't listening. At one point, it was ok for white people to be racist, this movie came out in a transition period as now it's ok for everyone to be racist towards white people. One of the messages in the movie is still as true today as it was on 1998, there is a helluva lot of hate in the world.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Psychoanalysis of extremism,"This one is close to an exploitation movie where violence and foul language are generously used. There are some scenes that are really disturbing and not suitable for those under 18. I think it is a correct movie to depict all the horrid sides of extremism. It has been and will be a problem of all countries in the world. The essence of extremism lies in the lack of self-confidence and proper education which should be partly constructed in the family and partly at school. I also believe some people are more inclined to brainwashing from birth.In this movie, the exremism is demonstrated in the form of racism but it could have also been some sort of faith-based group. The only way to keep away from such groups is to develop yourself and question everything. In this movie, Derek learned it from the hard way. My criticism about the movie is that it is not that easy to quit such an extremist group after all those years. Derek challenges the boss in the middle of a huge skinhead party and throws punches at his face. Normally, he must have got killed right there. Instead, he should have talked the boss personally much before and try to move elsewhere with all his family. Another thing is, his freaky girlfriend turns against him too quickly. He must have guessed that from her toxic personality and terminated his relationship much before the party.On the upside, among the supporting cast, Avery Brooks and Guy Torry perform excellent. Overall, the movie gives good messages.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

I rated this film 9/10, and the only thing keeping it from 10/10 was the script, which occasionally gets a little preachy, and at times I was aware that the characters were functioning as a mechanism to try and educate me, the viewer, not talking to each other.

Parents' hazardous believes propagandize children minds and transform them from good little people to an ""atomical future youthful bomb"". Mainly parents are responsible for theirs children delinquent behaviors and actions and first of all we have to blame them for the tragic incidence and not the children.

A masterpiece that hits hard,"American History X is Edward Norton's showpiece. It is the film that shows the world that Norton is the De Niro of our time. Transforming himself in the intelligent skinhead Derek Vineyard is a textbook example of great acting. His co-stars, even Eddie Furlong, combine to make this movie a great one. The message of the movie is not subtle but hits you right in the face with reality. People hate, and that hate can be turned around to hurt you in the worst way. This film doesn't lag for a second and every frame is loaded with meaning and emotion. This isn't a movie for the faint hearted and if you don't like what you are watching then it will be even harder for you to digest the fact that there are people out there just like every character in the movie. I think that everyone is racist to some degree and this movie has you both agreeing with what Derek has to say but at the same time thinking that you're not in the same boat as he is. You don't hate like he does. Well you may not but you can't help but be moved by his saga. Bottom Line: This movie deserves the place that it has on the top 250 and if you haven't seen it yet then you owe it to yourself to check it out.

"Despite the glaring flaws, American History X still retains its raw power","Watching American History X again 19 years after its release, the sight of Edward Norton's enigmatic frame captured in stark black- and- white quickly reminded me of just why I loved the film so much, and why it was one of the first DVDs I purchased when the transition from VHS was starting to take hold. I was 13 when I first saw the film in 1998, and now I'm 32 with more life experience and many, many more movies under my belt, the cracks and problems with Tony Kaye's tale of brotherly love and neo-Nazism also became apparent. It was something I could never quite put my finger on as a youngster, but the film's main issue is with trying to resolve a lifetime of hate and dysfunction in a single night, and by setting itself such time constraints, over-simplifies an incredibly complex and sensitive subject, although its heart is certainly in the right place.American History X tells the story of two brothers; Derek (Norton), a charismatic and hardened skin-head freshly released from prison following a brutal double-murder, and Danny (Edward Furlong), an intelligent kid following in the doomed footsteps of the older sibling he admires so much. Danny has just written a paper on Adolf Hitler, glorifying the fascist leader as a civil rights hero. His (black) schoolteacher Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) is outraged, but sets Danny the task of penning a paper on his brother, who had walked free that very morning. Hurrying home to reunite with his hero, Danny finds his brother a changed man. Derek has grown his hair, and no longer proudly displays the swastika tattooed on his torso. Something happened in prison that allowed Derek to let go of his misguided hate, and sets about ensuring that Danny doesn't follow the same path by confronting hate teacher and former ally Cameron (Stacy Keach).This impeccably-performed and suitably rough-around-the-edges movie is far more successful with depicting Derek's rise to legend-status amongst his gang than it is with handling his drastic change of heart. Despite a rather silly basketball game, the bulk of the black-and- white flashbacks offer a keen and convincing insight into the mind of a highly-intelligent leader of men who has inherited prejudice and hate. When he enters prison following the shocking murder, Derek becomes torn between the hypocritical Aryan Brotherhood and his laundry-room work mate Lamont (Guy Torry). These moments, which are supposed to convince us that a man of Derek's single-mindedness could learn the error of his ways, are reduced to a handful of clumsily-written conversations and a particularly nasty rape. It ultimately fails to deliver on its initial promise, and whether this uneven narrative was the result of Norton being brought in to help with the final edit, causing Kaye to completely disown the film, I couldn't tell you. Despite the glaring flaws, American History X still retains its raw power, and Norton gives a performance of such staggering intensity that he will likely never best it.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

The scenes depicting his time in the Nazi movement is startling, violent, and frustrating.  It really puts the zap on your head.  Anyway, after Derek is put in jail for double murder, he leaves only wanting to save his brother (played well by Edward Furlong) from the same movement that put him into jail.

One of the most powerful films ever,This is probably one of the deepest films made in years. Edward Norton made an incredible lead performance that drives the movie well. This film can be hard to watch at times and it may not be for everyone with its intense action and violence but the overall message of the movie is well thought out and is quite moving. Even the most violent of people can change as seen by Derek when he becomes friends with a black man when he was in prison. Behind all the violence lies a great message that is pretty motivational. Its plot details how black and white people despise each other and often get in fights and even kill each other. The movie details how brothers Derek and Danny both try to turn themselves around from their harsh life. All of their friends are racist and both of them fear their friends turning on them if they try to leave their gang. The ending is tragic and it's hard to watch. It gets me every time but it's fitting. This is a really amazing film. It has a great story and a great message. All of this combines to make one of the best movies in the 90's.

"flawed execution, but Norton is amazing","By now you probably know the basic plot, so I won't recount it.  The problem is that the overall message of the film - racism is malignant and doesn't provide the solace it promises - is completely undermined by Norton's presentation.  He gives a truly stunning performance, but his character (Danny) is so much more appealing when he's the mesmerizing racist poster boy.  When he returns from prison, after having sorted out all of his prior racist ideology, he's much less interesting to watch.  It was actually disturbing to me how sexy he was, shirtless in the street, after having just killed someone in one of the most violent ways I've ever encountered. It's hard to buy the idea that racism is bad when it comes in such an attractive package, especially when its opposite is presented as feminized and weak.This movie had high ambitions, and almost reached them, but in the end misses its target by letting Norton be TOO good.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

X-cellent.,"As a wise person once said (a long time ago): 'Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.' This proves all too true for Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), whose fear, frustration and rage at the murder of his father by a black gang member twists his soul, taking him not to the dark side, but to the white side—a neo-nazi gang called The Disciples of Christ—where his extremist beliefs and violent ways earn the respect of his peers, but only bring him and his family further pain and torment.Redemption for Derek comes during a stint in prison, his three year sentence for killing two black men giving him plenty of opportunity to realise the flaws in his philosophy and the error of his ways; with help from his African-American high school teacher Mr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks), Derek achieves parole and endeavours to make amends for previous actions, rejecting his right-wing lifestyle and those who endorsed it. But will it be enough to save his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlobg) from making the same mistakes as he did?It's kind of fitting that, for such a film—one so focused on turmoil, struggle and radical beliefs—American History X is the result of an extremely troubled background itself, director Tony Kaye attempting to disown the final film after star Ed Norton saw fit to re-cut the film against his wishes. Amazingly, somehow, the finished film bears no signs of its tumultuous past, being a nigh on perfect study of the cyclical nature of bigotry, one that powerfully drives home the futility of blind hatred.Boasting many a brilliant performance, wonderful cinematography, smart editing throughout (Norton must've known what he was doing), and some almost poetic acts of violence, plus a powerful message at its heart, this is must-see cinema that makes the viewer think long and hard about what they have witnessed long after the shocking climax has faded from the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Shining Example of Hollywood's Arrogance,"What a bunch of self-righteous, self-serving, pretentious psychobabble! I am not sure where to begin attacking this film for the farce it is, but I guess I should start by saying that this has very little if anything to do with white pride or racialism, in this country or elsewhere. Believe me I've seen a load of unbelievable farces in my time, but they all seemed entertaining somehow, except this, I don't know perhaps it's my experience with the real-life racialist movement here.I really did like the way, that Derek got three years for blasting away a couple of thugs who were threatening his life by breaking into his home, and when he's released it tries to make you feel guilty when the cool, righteous, and enlightened negro isn't getting out anytime soon, since he committed crimes that obviously weren't in the name of self-defense.Also, I'm surprised that Derek's incarceration in the joint, led to his ultimate rehabilitation as a racist. In reality, it probably would've affirmed his previous views tenfold.Another thing I liked was the attack on the family. The writers portray Derek's father, for instance, as some workaholic, redneck cop w/ a Marlon Brando attitude towards blacks and the system. The emotion of this scene, is almost enough, to make one feel ashamed for harboring a rational, sound opinion or belief on a critical issue such as that. It's revolting.There are probably a few points I could rag on, but one thing that really caught my eye, which I found disturbing were the others' reviews. Almost no one here spoted the political agenda of this film, as another propaganda film, against White America, and that's truly shocking. When will people wake up around here, and smell the coffee?This review may not be too popular, but I could care less, after all, opinions are only opinions.",,Anonymous,Drama
"weak directorially, strong performances nevertheless","The scandal of Tony Kaye disowning his work and condemning New Line who took it away before he could realize his 90-minute cut is well publicized by now. And it's no surprise why the director became so enraged: American History X is definitely in need of major editing. In it's two hour theatrical version, this study of California skinheads seems haphazard and even amateurish at times. The studio's attempt to improve the film actually made it much worse:the picture looks like an effort by an ambitious, self-indulgent high school student assisted by his far less inspired teacher. Most of the black-and-white sequences (flashbacks of Norton's and Furlong's life as skinhead brothers) are much more powerful and beautifully shot than the trite and cheaply melodramatic color scenes set in the present day. One cannot help but contemplate this film's potential on all levels of production: for one, it should have used a more urgent and appropriate soundtrack of modern hip-hop and hardcore instead of the typical Hollywood solution to all dramas which we've all heard literally hundreds of times; and also cut down on the slow motion, arguably the most gratuitous since The Postman. Still, Norton's extraordinary performance and several thought-provoking scenes make one wonder what the movie could have been if Kaye was allowed to perfect his material without intervention.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good Acting, spotty plot","This movie would have really done better as a miniseries. I really wanted to get to know the characters better. Edwards Norton and Furlong were exceptional in their characters..and so was the rest of the actors. As a Libertarian I agree with much of what Derrik was saying about the state of the country. This movies certainly did not do such a good job of making many of the black characters sympathetic, except Lamont. I mean come on, 3 guys with guns, one standing on your front porch and one in your yard and one breaking into your car...are we supposed to feel sympathy for them? I did not like the girl who played Derriks girlfriend...it would have been better in a miniseries perhaps if they had showed him longing for her but at the same time, wanting to leave the gang..instead the breakup was so abrupt. I would have liked to see more of the family flashbacks. This movie, besides Lamont, actually made me feel more sympathetic to the skinheads than the minorities (except that horrible grocery store scene) I would buy this movie because I really enjoyed the Edwards performances, and Norton was extraordinarily sexy in those white boxers.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
It's All Ridiculous,"This movie is seriously flawed. Like everything about it is flawed. The slow motion is dreadful, the flashback scenes are almost always terrible and the message is ridiculous. A few specific awful pieces of the film include the fact that Danny has a single night to write this paper and does so with the eloquence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the entire basketball game scene and how much blood Danny has in his body. But the worst part of the movie is definitely the idea that Derek needed to meet a nice black person in order for him to change his views. I get it has to do with him being sheltered and closed-minded but it doesn't make sense and gives the viewer a horrible idea of how racial differences can be solved. The film tries to push an agenda on the audience so hard and, at least in my eyes, falls flat on its face with its most important message. It's a major problem when a character's white supremacy rhetoric makes more sense than his reason for being reformed. There are countless cliches and more moments of bad acting. I don't think Norton did anything special and nobody else was good.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
Has Anything You've Done Made Your Life Better?,"American History X is stirringly thought-provoking. It serves as a wake up call for the masses that differentiate on the basis of any particular entity.The movie reels off the story about a Neo-Nazi skinhead who was once against the black progeny, but later figures to prevent his brother from choosing the same path after getting a reality check. The movie is incorporated with peculiarities of anger, violence, compassion and honorable philosophy. It possesses an ideal run time of 2 hours and manages to blow away. Also, an unforeseeable climax diversifies the movie making it even more disparate.They probably couldn't have assembled a better cast. Edward Norton, who played the lead role was undeniably striking, no wonder he got nominated for the 'Best Actor in a Leading Role' category at the Academy awards. Edward Furlong was simply alluring while enacting an integral character of the story line. Greater supporting roles played by Beverly D'Angelo and Avery Brooks were commendable. Accompanying them were Ethan Suplee and Guy Torry, they pulled of a splendid task as well. Minor roles impersonated by Jennifer Lien and Elliot Gould too were above average.Film Direction was brilliantly executed. Consorted by David McKenna's screenplay, Tony Kaye, the director, doubtlessly managed to produce the necessary ambiance. Editing sector was absolutely praiseworthy. Likewise, music by Anne Dudley was pleasing. Cinematography was garden-variety.All things considered, the film is top notch. Controversial yet soothing. Violent yet placid. In a single word, EPIC. Watch it and I'm certain that it will leave you thinking about racial abuse and its intracacies.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Raw, Gritty, and REAL","Like my headline says, this is one of the most gritty and raw movies I have ever seen. I just watch it for the first time tonight and I am completely in awe. The movie almost had me in tears by the end of it. If you aren't moved after watching this movie then you just aren't human.Derek Vinyard (Ed Norton) is one of the most dynamic characters I have ever seen in a movie. I mean he is so impressionable but yet so charismatic at the same time. Very rarely do get that kind of dangerous combination together. He was so gullible and would believe what any strong willed person forced upon him, but the dangerous part is that he take what he learned and influence so many people with it. He had that special something that people were just drawn to. He could make people do whatever he wanted them to do, but in the same turn would do whatever someone else wanted him to do. His transformation by the end of this movie was just so inspiring. This is one of the best characters I have seen in a long long time.If you have not seen this movie yet, you do not know what you are missing. I'm not going to lie to you though; this movie is not for everyone. American History X will show you a side of the real world that no one really wants to know about. So if you want to stay in your perfect little bubble that there is nothing wrong in the world then DO NOT watch this movie. This movie tackles the race issues in our society in a way that most people would be afraid to touch. By the end of this movie you will be almost ready to cry because it shows you everything that is wrong with society today, but there is that silver lining of hope that everyone can change. In conclusion, if you're faint-hearted this movie isn't for you, but if you want an in your face look at the dark side of society that will send a chill down your spine then check this movie out.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A story of redemption and change about a former Neo-Nazi skin head who wants to stop his younger brother from taking the same mistakes he have done,"A powerful politically charged film about the Neo-Nazi ideology in America. Neo-Nazism have the elements of a Nazism ideology which are ultra nationalism, racism, able-ism, xenophobia, homophobia, antiziganism, antisemitism, and initiating the Fourth Reich. The film focuses on racism and xenophobia, the white people fears that foreigners(Asian/Latin) who owned businesses will only hire foreigners and it will lead to a higher number of jobless white people. Racism is also one of the film main theme thinking that white people have supremacy over people of colors. American History X excels in story telling, why? because of its black and white and colored scheme every time there is a flashback, which is in black and white format and wherein its story line evolved. The colored one represents the present time.Edward Norton got nominated for this film and I think he really deserves it one of the flawless acting performance I've ever seen, It's shame that the Academy didn't nominate this gem in the Best Picture category I think the reason is its provoking theme and I think the academy is not ready to recognize a Powerful Politically charged film during the 90's",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Unforgiving story, but at the same a low-blow to the nuts","I thought the movie was fantastic, don't get me wrong but some of the dialogue really made me wanna jump from out of my skin.  I remember after I saw this movie I was not in a good mood at all and I won't get into how I felt because I may offend someone.  As a human being I really understood the message and embraced it with open arms but also I was very offended due to my ethnic background particularly by Ethan Suplee's great perfomance of Seth(someone I would love to cut into a million pieces - believe me), Fairuza Balk plays another character who deserves a kick in the face as well but she does well.  I know it's just a movie and like I said I understood the message and took it for what it was - I enjoyed the movie as a whole, both of the Edwards do a great job as the misguided brothers but it's a disturbing reminder that racism does exist and no matter how good this movie was, it really made me angry",,Anonymous,Drama

Unconvincing portrayal,"Unconvincing portrayal of a struggling family whose two boys are racist skinheads.  One of the sons, after a stint in jail, has a change of heart and decides to save his little brother from the mindless hatred that nearly ruined his life.This film tries so hard to be a gritty, dark, morality tale of modern western life that it ends up parodying itself unintentionally.  I'm afraid a few angst ridden actors smoking and shouting out a lot of swear words does not a great movie make.The movie also has two of the stupidest moments on film.  Why the brothers, one of whom has just escaped death at the hands of his former gang, decide to sit and have a nice chat about life rather than run to the nearest phonebox and warn mom and sis (who are sitting passively at home like women do) is unrealistic.  Perhaps it didn't cross the boys minds.   Dumber still is why any self-respecting, skinhead gang did NOT immediately go to the boy's home and kill and destroy is beyond comprehension.  But perhaps it didn't cross their collective minds.The second stupidest moment on film ever is this film's ending.Do yourself a favour and see ""Romper Stomper"" if you want a truer reflection of the evils of skinhead violence.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama

Brilliant!,"American History X is in my top five all time mind blowing films. The performance alone from Edward Norton was phenomenal, the guy takes you on an emotional roller-coaster like you would not believe until you have seen it for yourself. There are good actors who will portray a character well enough for the audience to understand a role but to make the viewers really get the uncensored underlying emotions and thoughts of the character is a talent to be well respected. This film was able to make me feel disgusted with society and be completely disappointed in humanity, yet it gave me hope all in one fell swoop. Understanding a neo-nazism skinheads lifestyle is not an easy task and this film certainly doesn't make it any easier but it is worth a watch if you can stomach the hard hitting punches of racism and violence.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Thinks it's a lot deeper than it actually is,"I first watched this film a few years ago, but only got about fifty minutes in (after the bit where the hero/antihero crushes the black guy's skull on the kerb) because I had taped it off the TV and the video tape ran out. I thought it looked like a pretty decent movie, but could wait until it was on the TV again.I finally got to borrow the complete video a few weeks back and saw the rest of the movie and, unfortunately, I wasn't impressed.This is a film that's got its head stuck so far up its backside that it completely misses the point. The message I took away was: ""If you're a neo-Nazi then you're either going to be: a) buttf**ked by another, bigger, neo-Nazi, or b) shot by a black guy. So don't be a neo-Nazi.""This is crap! I bet plenty of narrow-minded white supremacist types are having a pretty good time. The real issue is how this kind of behaviour affects ethnics - an aspect of hate crime that this film totally fails to explore, except during the ""sweetener"" parts of the film - latino woman in the shop being physically abused by the Nazi thugs, the mouth-on-the-kerb thing, etc. These despicable scenes - presumably why all the closet racists out there rave about this film - are totally unnecessary, and if you have to have them at all, why not explore the effects of this violence on the victims?The ""revelatory"" bit at the end, with the late father talking about ""n!gger bullsh!t"", didn't make sense to me. The guy makes one comment over the dinner table and so his son - years later - decides to become a Nazi?Or was it supposed to suggest that the family were regularly getting this kind of crap from the head of the household, in which case perhaps it would have been a better film to have shown a racist dad bringing up a family and turning his children into a bunch of f**k-ups!This film does nothing to improve race relations. Its message is clearly ""don't be a racist for your own sake"", which clearly appeals to many self-centred people who were brought up during the look-out-for-yourself Reagan-Thatcher years.Nicely shot, yes. Good acting, yes. But a terrible script delivering the wrong message!",,Anonymous,Drama
Dumb voyeurism meets idiot racism,"This movie surrounds itself with racism and expects everyone to look at it as edgy. Although some scenes are interesting, other ones are boring and dull and just drowning with racism and the problems of modern America. Edward Norton who is often very dull as an actor plays the lead character who is abusive and angry, as well as violent and an overall bad person. The writers were pumped to get him to kill black actors during the script, but the story is bland because it's about ignorant white Americans who fill up the movie with their dumb subplots and side stories. Rather than juxtapose it with anything of value, it allows itself to rest on the idiocy of the masses to find it to be an audacious source of film-watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Powerful movie that makes you think,"It is NOT a typical easy on the viewer movie or a preaching one. I believe the idea is to ask the viewers the questions and to leave up to them to find the answers. I personally asked myself a lot of questions. And related it, to some events in my life. So i got some hidden messages that are well beyond the racism that is simply too obvious and overexploited. It is a shallow explanation for much more deep subjects touched in the movie.People tend to blame someone for their misfortune (polititians,jews, black, gypsies, concrete people) Sometimes they have their justification - a dramatic event in their lives. Especially young people always search for people to look up to, they tend to follow blindly and passionately ideas that gives the ""easy"" explanation of bad things happening around them and with them. And at some point you rational hate , becomes irrational and uncontrollable.Yes ! Life is F***** UP sometimes. BUT the question is not, Who to BLAME but, WHAT did you do, to MAKE it BETTER ?

I can say this - when Norton gets back from jail and his ex-girlfriend is ""all over him""...then 2 minutes later is shouting ""kill him"" (after she learns he is no longer interested in the neo-nazi cause) is absolutely absurd. I don't care how brainwashed she is, noone can swing their feeling like that - from ""I love you"" to I want your head blown off. Come on!Also, it seemed to me that Norton's transformation was more due to thinking that the neo-Nazis/skins were all full of crap and involved in the ""cause"" for alterior motives (power, selling drugs, etc) - as opposed to thinking well, maybe blacks, hispanics, Jews, etc aren't so bad.

And the story goes by. Personally, I admired the movie very much and I guess it is one of the best movies of all times. Our story-line here is the present and we move forward to see in the process flashbacks to previous events in the past and here was a thoughtful great touch to represent these events in black and white. Our Actors here were the best with flawless and unforgettable performance. The plot however is the one element you can doubt as I thought that it wasn't enough to build the twist on it and it needed a little convincing time and reason but I guess the movie here wasn't trying to lecturer those who are in the same path that Derek took So in a complete evaluation I give this movie 9 out of 10 and I encourage you to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Deeply flawed, but still resonant.","""American History X"" deserves credit for having an absorbing story to support its penchant for controversy. In all honesty, I approached this movie ready and willing to hate it (hey, I'll admit bias here; when a movie's eye-widening appeal is a curb-stomp scene, what could it possibly have to offer on racism?), but I also remained involved til the very end. This is primarily because Edward Norton's performance is magnet; and even before his post-prison reformation , he still owns the screen, vile diatribes notwithstanding. He is this movie.That said, it's far from perfect, and it's still reactionary to a great extent. That famous scene aside, there are a few pieces of viciousness strewn throughout. Some of it simply didn't work (that scene with the Nazi posters being pulled down from the wall feels very contrived, as well as Furlong's narration), and I can do without the choral singing on the score. The ending feels heap, but could've worked had they not gone overboard with the melodrama.As long as you're not looking for subtlety, this is definitely worth a watch.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Also the more violent scenes are done in black and white, except the ending is done in colour, and its definitely more impactful.The cast is excellent, although Norton is the star, and for me it is his best film next to 'Primal Fear'.After the terrible murders committed by Derek (Edward Norton) I was surprised by the low sentence, even knowing that his brother Danny, which idolizes him, helps him with his statement it still seems like a few years in prison to me, this proves that there is even more racism than we imagine in general, and not only from extreme Nazis.The story is quite well put together, fast and with a good image, it keeps you on the edge of your couch with tension, entertainment, and unjustified violence. It is very rough and difficult to see at times,but also it is a very interesting topic that will not let you stop until the end.To be honest, I found the complete opposite behavior of Derek after his release from prison, somewhat exaggerated, although it didn't bother me too much, since it is well narrated, especially after what happens inside the prison.

Words cannot begin to describe those feelings.Still, this film is not perfect. It felt too short yet too long at the same time. Too short, in the sense that there were too many subplots occurring that neither gets enough screen time, making some parts grossly unrealistic.

It was as if the director, Tony Kaye, had no way to tie the film up in an orderly fashion (I can sympathize:  I wouldn't know either, given that story), and decided, ""Okay, we'll do Greek tragedy.""Apart from these flaws, the film comes through, due to a strong performance by Edward Norton in the lead.  His Academy Award nomination was much-deserved, and I'm certain he has the potential to give us many years of powerful, memorable performances.  Also, the black and white photography (also by the director) was a real treat, given how rarely we see it these days.",,Anonymous,Drama
Pioneering neo-nazi film,"This classic film tries to get to the root of the issue of Neo-Nazism. Norton does a great job in this epic drama.

"Great story, mediocre film","This film is highly overrated.That having been said, I'd recommend anyone to see American History X. It packs a punch like an after-school special does. It has a valuable message and it delivers it with no ambiguity.Unfortunately, the story is like a goat bashing the viewer and the acting by much of the cast is wooden like a 1st year college student delivering on presentation on MacBeth without having read it deeply.

Everyone Should Watch This.,"The movie follows the story of two brothers involved in neo nazi and white supremacist movements. After serving 3 years in jail for ,the older brother tries to prevent his younger brother from following the same road and continuing the cycle of hate.A pretty dark,depressing and disturbing at times film that is pretty different from most 1990s films about racism and prejudice. It is way more nuanced,its deeper and way more powerful. It is uncomfortable and hard to watch and simultaneously intriguing enough to make you want to watch more. Edward Norton also provides an oscar worthy performance in an overall very well acted and directed film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A topic that is difficult at any time,"""American History X"" is quite a heavy film for me. This is not a movie that you will be happy to watch again. But it's very good. I was impressed for a long time after watching.The topic that is touched upon in the film is sensitive and dangerous. It is for all times, relevant in any society. This is the theme of Nazism. It seems to me that any adult once thought how he felt about the fact that some consider themselves superior to others on racial grounds. This is a dangerous path leading to endless debates. This can be seen in this film directed by Tony Kaye.The film traces several ideas at once. One of them is an example of an older brother. For me, it was relevant because I am an older brother myself, and after watching the film as a teenager, I made conclusions for myself that it is necessary to think and analyze my actions a few steps ahead, because you can set an example to the younger ones. The main character seems to be thinking about similar things on the screen, but in a different way. He believes that by acting as he does, he will set an example to his brother how to be strong, self-confident, correct and authoritative in society. But only after a while he realizes that not everything is so clear and simple.The cast is excellent. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong do a great job with images. Norton demonstrates his hero very skillfully. He is adamant, unpredictable, believes in his ideals, believes that all representatives of his movement are as selfless as he is. In the scene of the attack on his house, Norton frankly scared me. I even believed for a minute that it wasn't an actor playing, he was actually so cruel. His look just amazed me. I still remember that heartbreaking scene. I think this is the true professionalism of the actor.Furlong smartly shows a growing up boy who is about to enter adulthood and is ready to imitate his older brother in everything. The hero begins to copy the one, accept his thoughts, pass them off as his own, sinking deeper into the abyss of hatred. Great game.The characters are well-developed, you understand their motives, you see the cause-and-effect relationships that lead to the finale of the film. The situation is heating up by the minute. It is felt, it is alarming, it makes you closely monitor what is happening on the screen.Especially noticeable are the changes in the older brother, Derek. In prison, he realized, realized that all his ideals, which he had so fiercely defended, suddenly turned out to be not what was needed. His zeal, foundations, goals, steadfastness eventually lead to the collapse of those whom he considered close in spirit. An important role was played by a comrade, a black comrade, who showed that there is no difference between people, even if they are different in skin color. And after a while, Derek sees his younger brother and is horrified. He became his young copy, but what will this metamorphosis lead to? Derek is sure that to what happened to himself. And this cannot be allowed. And this exposed nerve literally cuts the viewer in each subsequent scene. The finale makes you watch the subsequent credits with your mouth open.The movie is beautiful. He touches on an uncomfortable topic, makes every viewer think about what his vision of this topic is, what he feels when it comes to the topic of Nazism. And what conclusions can be drawn for yourself. A beautiful picture, worthy of attention for all thinking people.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
I was reminded of the sheer power of this movie by watching it years later with my teenager.,"I originally watched this movie so many years ago and was floored by it. I had forgotten how many emotions it wrangles out of you that you may not even ever suspect. It was an eye opening movie for me as a younger person and when I found out my 19 year old boy hadn't seen it, I pulled out my DVD of it and said, ""That's what we're doing tonight."" He at first had no interest in it after checking out the synopsis on the case and I almost had to force him to watch it with me. However, as I began to get immersed in this movie that I had forgotten its powers, it got quiet and I never heard another word from him. At the end of the movie, I was sniffling and I look over and he is sitting on the edge of the couch with tears, unspilled, but sitting in his eyes, mouth open, slack-jawed, and still staring at the blank screen. It was definitely a defining period in his young adulthood and a moment for me that helped define our relationship and that I'll always cherish. It's a classic that even now sometimes I talk to people who haven't seen it, and I recommend it. I'm glad I bought the DVD so long ago. It had the same reaction for me as it did the first time years ago.I don't want to let out spoilers and it's so hard with this movie. So that's why I haven't gone into detail. But if you want to see real, emotional, life changing in certain situations, movies that make you question things and/or really force you to put yourself into someone else's shoes whether you want to or not, watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

There is so much cr*p out there that people want to talk about as if it were important, but this film is so much more interesting and edifying.

Be sure to watch with intellectually awake friends to discuss those issues and your new insights with them.But be ready for violence and cussing. Seeing that makes you wonder how anyone from such a home could possibly leave his or her family as a psychologically and emotionally intact human being.

This movie is blatantly racist.,"It can be compared with a pick-pocket who after stealing a wallet starts yelling: Catch that thief, catch that thief!If I were a member of Arian Nation I'd screen this movie as a powerful recruiting tool. All the Nazis wannabes would join with tears in their eyes.A few examples: 1)ALL the fights and trouble are started by African-Americans. 2) Koreans play dirty and get stores from real Americans (please tell me what on earth is a real American) just to fire white employees and hire only illegal immigrants. 3) Hispanics are depicted as bunch of wet-backs who enter the US illegally just to be exploited by greedy Koreans.I have only read twenty comments about this still-born and nobody seems to realize that Nazis are equaled to African-Americans. That is, there are two matching sides, two gangs: on the one hand a bunch of obnoxious nazi skinheads, on the other African-Americans. Not to mention that every relevant African-American character on this movie (by relevant I mean a character who can be seen during ten seconds or more) is a punk, an out-law or a member of gang, -or like Dr. Sweeney, a former member of a gang. Also it should be noted that the director of this thing, underhandedly but also coarsely, drops the idea that the nazi violence is some sort of a reaction against a preceding insult: Nazis are bad, but nazi violence is what you get when African-Americans, Koreans and Mexicans move to your neighborhood, get the all the jobs, win the basket-ball plays and date attractive white women.Intentions behind this libel remind me of the Nazis from the movie Bullet Proof Monk who set a Human Right organization in order to hide their actual intentions.And last but not least, have you counted all those shower slow motion takes.

The prodigal brother returns from prison to find out that his brother is following on his footsteps,Edward Norton is a Hollywood gem. I've always admire him as an actor and this movie is no exception. He plays the brother who returning from prison he finds that his little brother is following on his footsteps by joining a Neo-Nazi organization. The movie goes back and forth between the older brother's life before going to prison and his life after he gets out. The acting is impeccable and the story very good and the message timeless(especially with the current situation all over Europe). No doubt one of the highlights of the 90s' movie era and one of the best movies of Edward Norton (along with Fight Club and Primal Fear).Intense scenes but very realistic considering the issues it circles while the finale is one of the best I have seen.,9.0,Anonymous,Drama
X out of 10,"Everything about this movie is just perfect, except for maybe its length, and that is definitely not because the movie did not have enough time to wrap the story up properly, but rather because everybody would love to keep on watching this masterpiece for a little longer.The cinematography of this movie is definitely worth to be studied. The powerful and beautiful close up shots of Edward Furlong's character Danny that we see every once in a while allow for the viewer to subconsciously analyze how Derek and his ideologies progressively shape who Danny is as a person. There are some scenes in this movie that are so immersive that they are unlike any other seen in other movies, such as the opening scene and the school bathroom scenes. Edward Norton's performance is just so real, and it really is like you're viewing the life and regrets of THE Derek Vinyard as respected by his fellow skinheads, rather than just any other ordinary character played by Edward Norton.Definitely up there with the greats.

"Silly, didactic fairy tale - propaganda by you know who","Where to begin? This film is a bold piece of propaganda. The goal is to build a narrative so emotionally gripping that your rational faculties are disarmed - and you are inclined to believe and identify with the moral lesson it is trying to preach, without actually questioning any of its underlying assumptions. Edward Norton's character, as well as his father, and his older mentor, make several points in their dialogue that are rational and well-founded in decades of crime, immigration, and intelligence testing data about the nature of minorities in this country. None of these points are refuted rationally but rather pilloried emotionally, to make them seem so disgusting and abhorrent that you will be dissuaded from even considering them rationally yourself. A bold and aggressive piece of propaganda by you-know-who to try to stop the wave of consciousness of the truth (about race issues) that has been taking hold in America since the inception of the internet in the 90s. Admittedly, the propaganda strategy is brilliant and bold, and worked exactly as intended, at least when this film was released.",,Anonymous,Drama

American History X tries too hard to be right-on, by telling us what we already know, in a stylish black-and-white (did you see what i did there?) film where a rather scary Ed norton tootles about not really having a clue about anything.

American History X A Powerful Film,"American History X is a powerful film with equally impressive performances by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong as the two leads. Director Tony Kaye is admirable in making this movie thats definitely hard to watch at times about a former brutal neo-nazi skinhead recently released from prison who tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same wrong path he did. Edward Norton gives a great performance as Derek Vineyard the former neo-nazi released from prison who has changed forever and Edward Furlong is just as good as his trouble younger brother Danny. The rest of the cast including Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Stacey Keach, Fairuza Balk, and Elliot Guild are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie has brutal violence, pervasive strong language, a graphic sex scene early on and then a rape, and nudity so parents should be warned to watch this first before allowing their children to see it. American History x is a powerful film and as mentioned before it's hard to watch at times but this is one movie that shouldn't be missed.

Overall American History X has character development, drama, some brutal violence, and powerful performances by it's lead actors who make this movie worth the time to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Unbelievable,"I think a lot more could have been done with this movie.  The scenes were very realistic and really got the audience to experience what was happening. Edward Norton is brilliant as he moves from one segment of his life to another.  The use of b&w and colour was effective, albeit not very original.My major disappointment is the total unrealistic change of heart of the Vinyard brothers.  In a matter of four months (from the rape to the parole), Norton's character goes from full-blown Neo-Nazi racist to mild-mannered boy next door.  The same goes for the ""daddy breakfast"" scene.  Norton goes from one opinion to a totally contradictory opinion in a matter of minutes. How are we supposed to believe this?Maybe the story should have been played out over a longer period of time and the events swaying the characters opinions more dramatic.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Wow,"When the credits started rolling after the film ""American History X,"" the one word, the one feeling that I felt was: Wow. This is an amazing, powerful film.One could quickly classify this as a film that deals with racism, but that is a misconception. ""American History X"" is about hate, and one man's journey from having it rule his life to realizing how pointless it is.Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) was the poster-boy for a white supremacist gang in California. Things changed after he was sent to prison for murder, and now he's trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path.""American History X"" is like the ultimate persuasive speech, both in what it achieves and how it's constructed. This powerful film tackles a complex and relevant subject head-on. But its construction as a piece of skilled rhetoric is genius. There's the set-up, addressing of both sides of the issue, then finally the explanation of the point that it wants to make. Director Tony Kaye deftly handles the material so that the subject matter, rather than directorial flair, is what hammers in the point. And he uses enough subtlety to make ""American History X"" seem more like a film than a piece of rhetoric.What makes this film work so well is that it seeks to UNDERSTAND both sides of the issue. It doesn't humanize people who hate, and it certainly doesn't expect the audience to sympathize with them, but it explains why they hate. This makes for a more compelling argument because it allows for a more finely-tuned rebuttal. The fact that the skinheads, at least Derek Vinyard, are allowed to sound intelligent, gives a fresh look on an argument that if done any other way would give this film a ""been there, done that"" kind of feel.Additionally, it gives insight into the sources of hate and how people like the skinheads become the frontrunners of such feelings. It offers a number of origins and introduces them in a number of ways.This film wouldn't be as compelling and powerful had it not been for a cast filled with superior performances. Edward Norton received an Oscar nod for this role, and he earned it. This is easily his best performance. His character has a wide, dramatic arc and Norton never loses sight of the character. Edward Furlong is impressive as Danny. Furlong has been almost off the map since his star-making debut opposite Arnold Schwartzenegger and Linda Hamilton in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Here he makes it clear that he hasn't grown out of his acting ability. Beverly D'Angelo shows that she can act off of someone other than Chevy Chase (and in a hard-hitting drama, no less). Stacy Keach is suitably creepy and vile as Cameron, the man who helped Derek with his rise to ""god"" status amongst the skinheads, but Keach wisely never goes over the top. Elliot Gould, Fairuza Balk and Ethan Suplee (in an unexpectedly fine performance) are all in good form here.The one person who gets no praise but deserves much is Avery Brooks. He's brilliant and at times equal to Norton. He fills the mentor role, but he knows this is not supposed to be a gentle performance a la Robin Williams in ""Dead Poet's Society"" (no ill-will towards Williams' role in that film); he's gritty and forceful and he fits right in. It's a shame that he didn't get an Oscar nod for his performance.According to IMDb, director Tony Kaye claimed that Edward Norton altered the film so much to give himself an Oscar nod for his performance that Kaye wanted his name to be replaced by ""Humpty Dumpty."" He filed a $275 million lawsuit against the Director's Guild and New Line Cinema when he wasn't allowed to remove his name. Be that as it may, at least the result was not the disaster that usually happens to a film that suffers from too much interference from someone OTHER than the director. It's hard to imagine this film being any better. Still, it would be interesting to see the director's cut of the film (the deleted scenes aren't much help in guessing what Kaye's original vision was, as they're mostly the sort of throwaway scenes that had a reason for being left on the cutting room floor).While I respect Kaye's decision for wanting his name removed, having been left with his name on the film is not exactly a bad thing. In fact, his work is amazing. The scenes from Derek's past are shown in black and white (no hint of film noir-style from the oldie films), and the scenes from the present are shown in color. Kaye acted as his own cinematographer, and his skill in both positions is evident.Insightful, provocative, and undeniably powerful, ""American History X"" is a brilliant film, and one that needs to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

awe,"""American History X"" is a poignant story of family, redemption and retribution. It revolves around the life of Derek Vinyard, a Neo- Nazi who, after doing three years of prison and self-reflection, changes his ways, and when he is released from prison, tries to do the same for his younger brother; Danny Vinyard.Edward Norton does a fantastic job of portraying Derek, both before and after his transformation from his skinhead lifestyle. Norton accurately displays the opinions and thoughts of his character, without making him come across as your typical neo-nazi; Derek is an angry and frustrated man who blames blacks for his father's murder - yet he is intelligent and has his own opinions and thoughts regarding modern society; he is not narrow-minded, despite his strongly racist mindset. After his trasformation, Norton still plays Derek in a practically flaw- less manner, portraying him as the older brother filled with regret and remorse, but also someone who has not let this get the better of him. He portrays him as someone who now has responsibilities in his life, and also someone who is determined to turn both his and Danny's life ar- ound.Edward Norton is not the only actor in this film who does an outstanding job of portraying their character. Edward Furlong plays Danny, Derek's younger, confused brother. Furlong plays this character almost immaculately; he accurately portrays the frustration and rebellious nature that resides in this character. Danny was, for me, the most interesting character in the film; although I have no doubt others will disagree entirely. However, Danny is a high school student who has spent his whole life looking up to his brother Derek, idolizing him throughout his childhood and young adulthood, meaning that Dereks actions have reflected heavily onto his younger brother. In one scene, Derek has a dispute with his family about Derek's views. Danny rarely speaks in this act, but when he does, he is defending his brohter.The film is visually powerful. When the film is going through a flashback, the screen is changed to black and white, which helps to add to the overall dark tone of the film.One of the most notable aspects of the film are the prison scenes; During his jail time, Derek's only real friends turn out to be those who he thought he hated the most; the blacks. Derek befriends a black man named Lamont (played by Guy Torry) , who is essentially the biggest reason for Derek's transformation; He teaches Derek that, basically, not all black people are bad. When they first meet, Lamont knows that Derek is a skinhead; he knows that Derek most probably resents him just because of his skin colour. Despite this, Lamont still shows respect for Derek, showing him the ropes and being his only real friend in the prison. Derek's other black associate is a man named Sweeney, who is Danny's high school teacher. During the course of the film, Sweeney and Derek become closer friends, mainly through Danny. But here is the most important part: when Derek is assaulted in jail, Sweeney is literally the only one who is there for him. Lamont and Sweeney are possibly the two most important characters in the entire story; they prove to Derek that even whites can be bad, and that even blacks can be good. Without these two characters, when Derek left jail he probably would've just gone straight back to his old ways.In conclusion, ""American History X"" is a film that is not afraid to deal with common issues in American society head on. The film does not hold back, and hits the audience with cold, hard truth combined with it's gritty realism that leaves viewers in magnificent awe. AHX has one message, and it delivers it beautfully; and it is that if you follow the path of hatred, sooner or later you will pay the price.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Directing and acting brilliance - hard hitting.,"I have watched this film so many times over the years and I just cannot fault it. Beautiful and tragic.

Norton and Kayne a deadly combination....,"Perhaps the highest compliment you can pay to Edward Norton is that his Oscar-nominated performance in American History X nearly convinces you that there is a shred of logic in the tenets of white supremacy. If that statement doesn't horrify you, it should; Norton is so fully immersed in his role as a neo-Nazi skinhead that his character's eloquent defense of racism is disturbingly persuasive--at least on the surface. Looking lean and mean with a swastika tattoo and a mind full of hate, Derek Vinyard (Norton)has inherited racism from his father, and that learning has been intensified through his service to Cameron (Stacy Keach), a grown-up thug playing tyrant and teacher to a growing band of disenfranchised teens from Venice Beach, California, all hungry for an ideology that fuels their brooding alienation.The film's basic message--that hate is learned and can be unlearned--is expressed through Derek's kid brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), whose sibling hero-worship increases after Derek is imprisoned (or, in Danny's mind, martyred) for the killing of two black men. Lacking Derek's gift of rebel rhetoric,Danny is easily swayed into the violent, hateful lifestyle that Derek disowns during his thoughtful time in prison. Once released,Derek struggles to save his brother from a violent fate, and American History X partially suffers from a mix of intense emotions, awkward sentiment, and predictably inevitable plotting.And yet British director Tony Kaye (who would later protest against Norton's creative intervention during post-production) manages to juggle these qualities--and a compelling clash of visual styles--to considerable effect. No matter how strained their collaboration may have been, both Kaye and Norton can be proud to have created a film that addresses the issue of racism with dramatically forceful impact.",,Anonymous,Drama
Too superficial,"Nazism, fascism or neo-Nazism and neo-fascism got multiple causes. Besides the individual personal psychological ones that turn a human being into a Nazi or a Fascist there are the collective social, economic and political ones which give birth to the movements where the individuals integrate themselves. Without the latter causes the former will be socially ineffective. Therefore the racial problem in USA cannot be treated with this simplicity because it's much more complex than what is shown in this movie. This movie is more about personal motives that make one to become a neo-Nazi even if they assume a form of a certain interpretation of social and economic realities usually a wrong one. It doesn't say practically anything about what is most important i. e. the roots of racism as a global social phenomenon. Without it you cannot understand this question. Of course you can tell me now that the movie doesn't intend to be a sociological treatise and just only to tell us a certain story. Well that may be true but then the movie is worth what it's worth regarding the theme of racism that is subjacent to it. This is undoubtedly an honest movie that tells us the credible story of a young neo-Nazi who repents himself of that, after having been in jail convicted for racial homicide and then tries to prevent his younger brother to follow the same path. But the story is told in a too superficial and not very deep way. It doesn't touch the core of the racial question. In respect to that we have only the discussion at the family table in the first part of the movie among the family members including the Jewish boyfriend of the young man's mother, which discussion ends in a bad way. The rest of the movie loses itself, besides the inevitable violent scenes, in some somewhat ingenuous sentimental ones, lacking intensity. In sum this is a sincere and just movie but not particularly remarkable.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Harrowing and Unforgettable,"American History X is a profoundly powerful film that explores hatred, redemption, and the cycle of violence. Directed by Tony Kaye, this unflinching narrative continues to be as impactful today as it was upon its release in 1998. With stellar performances and a brutally honest storyline, it stands as one of the most important films of modern cinema.The story centres on Derek Vinyard, a former neo-Nazi leader portrayed with raw intensity by Edward Norton. After serving time in prison, Derek begins to question his beliefs. Norton's performance is extraordinary, capturing both the charisma and vulnerability of a man torn apart by ideology and guilt. His transformation from a vengeful supremacist to someone seeking redemption is depicted with incredible nuance and depth.Equally compelling is Edward Furlong as Danny, Derek's younger brother, who idolises him and starts down the same destructive path. Furlong's performance is heartbreaking, embodying the vulnerability of youth manipulated by hatred and the devastating impact of family influence. The dynamic between the brothers forms the emotional core of the film, offering both hope and tragedy.The film's structure is striking, using black-and-white flashbacks to depict Derek's past while the present unfolds in colour. This visual technique not only separates the timelines but also emphasises Derek's journey from ideological blindness to clarity. Tony Kaye's direction is bold and uncompromising, with scenes of violence and racism portrayed with brutal honesty, forcing viewers to confront uncomfortable truths.The infamous curb-stomping scene, while horrifying, is a testament to the film's commitment to showing the visceral consequences of hatred. Amidst the brutality, the film offers moments of hope, particularly through Derek's reflections and his relationships with those who challenge his views, such as a fellow inmate and his former teacher.The script, written by David McKenna, delves deeply into the roots of racism, exploring how prejudice is perpetuated by personal pain, societal pressures, and generational trauma. It serves as a sobering reminder of how easily hate can spread and the monumental effort required to break free from its grip.American History X does not offer easy answers but provides a crucial exploration of humanity's capacity for both destruction and redemption. Its tragic ending serves as a stark warning about the lingering consequences of hatred, leaving viewers with much to reflect upon.In conclusion, American History X is a masterpiece of storytelling and character study, anchored by Edward Norton's career-defining performance. It is a difficult but essential film that challenges, educates, and stays with you long after the credits roll. A brutal and unforgettable portrayal of racism and redemption, it remains as relevant and powerful as ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Skinny on the Skin-heads,"I have heard people laud this film for it's writing, it's directing, and it's casting. It's directing was fair at best, and it's writing was poor. Only the decisions to cast Norton and Furlong for the two leading roles were good. This movie suffers from organizational problems i.e. jumping from year to year like hopscotch, spending an extremely short amount of time on important scenes and vice versa, etc. Aside from the fact that it was interesting, the film was overdone and sophomoric. Only Norton's performance deserves any praise.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Good idea, sadly gone wrong","I wanted this film to be good.  I wanted it to be what it looked like--a stirring, difficult to watch, challenging portrayal of racism in modern America.  It just missed too many boats to do that. But in fairness, I'll talk about it's good points first.  The basic premise is great, a truly remarkable way to address American racism.  Focus on one town and more specifically one family...really good (I'd like to refer you to the TNT movie ""Freedom Song"" as a film that more successfully deals with racism by looking at one town deeply rather than the whole country shallowly).  Some really good acting from Norton and Furlong, also D'Angelo. Also succeeds in being, if nothing else, shocking.  The EVENTS of the film, in a synopsis, are genuinely moving, and I think a really good film could have been made out of such a premise.Unfortunately, the quality of a movie is not just based on subject matter.The flaws are far more numerous and deadly. The script was really dull, only one good line, and lots of really hollow scenes.  The exposition towards the beginning is artless--police reports and news footage to give us character backgrounds?  That may not sound so terrible, but it really stood out to me as insultingly trite. Also takes too long at the beginning to get started.  We spend over an hour wondering what it was that finally converted Norton and the answer is underwhelming.  I was trying to decide if it would be sudden epiphany or gradual coming to understand.  The answer?  It's neither.  The black guy he works with in the prison cracks some jokes, Norton finds himself laughing, and bang, all his racism gone.  Right.  Ditto Furlong's character.  The movie takes less than 24 hours (not counting flashbacks), and in that time Furlong goes from being a Hitler-in-training to the most understanding fellow around.  How?  His brother (Norton) tells the story of how the black guy he worked with in prison, etc., etc.  Sorry, I needed more of a struggle there, then I'd see his newfound tolerant convictions as being stronger. Many of the characters, as other people note, are one-dimensional, most unfortunately the main secondary character, Furlong's teacher who talks Norton through his conversion.  This fault ties in with a much bigger one. It seems like everyone in the town is concerned primarily with racism. Obviously, it's a movie about racism, but when the only two cliques in the prison were black guys and neo-Nazis, it felt too contrived.Sorry, like I said, good idea, poor execution.  A shame, it could have been good.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
A must see for everyone!,"I think racism will forever be an issue amongst us human beings, one that won't stop until every last one of us is dead. It is such a big world we live in, that I just don't understand how there could possibly be so much hatred between us. Why do we have to fight like this? Why does color of skin or the look of eyes matter so much? Why can't we all just frickin get along? I know things will never change amongst the living, which is something that pains me because I want to have kids some day...but what sort of world will I be bringing them into?

Good film,"Good film. The story, the underlying message and personal transformation of Norton's character should be considered the pillars of this film.

A gripping performance from Norton leads American History X to glory.,"American History X tells the story of a neo-Nazi and his overcoming of hate, and his attempts to prevent his brother from following in his footsteps. The film shows how blame only leads to hate, and hate creates nothing positive, only suffering and regret.
Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard, the former neo-Nazi, is enthralling and showcases his exceptional ability. Norton bosses every scene he is in, whether he is portraying a neo-Nazi or one that has overcome that path; it almost seems as if he is portraying two different characters. Some extremely powerful speeches - whether for good or bad causes - are excellently written, showcasing the ability of screenwriter, David McKenna, and Norton delivers them exceptionally.
Supporting performances from many of the cast, including Edward Furlong, who plays younger brother Danny, are well done. Danny in many ways portrays the shadow of his older brother; he is on a very similar path, and this is clearly shown when comparing the Derek seen as a neo-Nazi in clever flashbacks to Danny now, and the gap in mentality and attitude there is between the brothers after Derek is released from prison. We get a more precise view of Danny's thoughts in small sections we see in his essay, American History X; he writes the words 'It doesn't bother me anymore' on his computer screen, and this in some ways explains his demise and how he has been desensitised to violence and hate.
The use of different characters to represent levels of extremes and how people influence one another is profound. The headteacher of Danny's school, Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), is the first person in the film we see try to discourage Danny from falling into a hateful path, he represents a sort of hope that one can be better than full of views of hatred and division. The new partner of the brother's mother, Doris (Beverly D'Angelo), represents how people with decent views can be pushed aside by hatred. And characters on the other end of the spectrum, such as the brother's friend, Seth (Ethan Suplee), who embodies blind thuggery. How these characters influence both Derek and Danny show how important it is to listen to the right people and is also a showcase of the intelligent writing on show.
Director Tony Kaye utilises every minute of this film to full effect; no scene is wasted. The film has a good pacing and is done very well with flashbacks and current events. The cinematography is quite brilliant, the use of the noir effect on all flashback scenes is crucial. The black/white contrast is a theme ever-present in this film and the noir effect captures this perfectly. The fact that present scenes are in colour also shows a contrast and change in attitude of Derek; as in the flashback scenes he is a neo-Nazi skinhead, full of hate, and in present scenes he is a changed man, a neo-Nazi no more, and a man who has lost his hate.
The film shares some similarities with Shawshank Redemption: they both involve crime and prisons, but more importantly can give the viewer a slightly different outlook on life. Shawshank has been known to give many viewers a different outlook on life in general - how to view life and how to be more positive. American History X can give a viewer a slightly more nuanced look on life; it shows how hate gets you nowhere, it only causes evil, and that losing that hate can make your outlook on life much more positive.
American History X has a cleverly intertwined story that is still relevant today. Edward Norton's performance is outstanding along with the screenplay, and although the main character may not be relatable on face-value, the way his mind works, is manipulated, and the mental experiences he goes through can be compared with those of an everyday person. This makes for a captivating experience and is well worth the watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Powerful Character Study & Must Watch!,"American History X is a character study that examines what makes an American Nazi and how to overcome such thinking.The film also examines the secondary effects that racism and racist ideology can have on others around you.

How to make a movie on social aspects?,"We often see movies on social issues, inequalities, crimes etc. Generally, the first rule crafted by most films is to pick a side. For whom should the support go to? Which side does the protagonist fight for? How well do they achieve ""equality"" in the end?This is not most films. It's almost impossible to not take a stand while portraying a social issue. But that's where brilliance lies. This film taken a journalistic view on the subject. And it goes deep in it's research on why the protagonist picks his side in a visibly unequal society. We travel with the protagonist, what logic does he apply to his actions? Where did it all start for him? What took for his views to change?And it isn't like a documentary.. it never gets boring. You walk into the lives of black gangs, white gangs, jews, mexicans.. each group with their own story to tell.It's a film that requires an extraordinary performance for it to be subtle and convincing.

Perhaps the most powerful film of the 20th Century.,"I won't recommend this movie to the faint at heart. I won't recommend it to anyone who is easily swayed by propaganda. I will, however, recommend this move to anyone who is open minded enough to understand that the material portrayed in this movie is real.Perhaps the most disturbing part about this movie is the fact that the actions and events contained within are the actions and events in every day America. Filled with powerful imagery and outstanding acting, American History X conveys emotion so vivid and so powerful, the meek will have a hard time stomaching it.Norton's character is so powerful, he could sway even the most devote civil right's leaders with his rhetoric. That is what makes modern day leaders in this regard so scary. When a person such as Norton can spew forth such crap with such conviction, he is a person to be feared. I do not know of another actor who could portray Derek Vinyard as effectively as Norton did.While Furlong's performance isn't quite as convincing as Norton's, he does portray a corrupted innocence that made me actually care for him. By then end of the movie, I felt like he was my little brother.This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever watched.

But what makes it even more flaws is the grand finale, which was disappointing, rushed and forced. It was as if the writers had once again said ""we need to inject academy award winning ending."" And how unfortunate that it just was entirely ridiculous after all that time.

Worst film of the year.,"Yeah, it's stunning, all right -- in the way a cattleprod up the old wazoo is stunning. Alleged director Tony Kaye should be grateful to New Line for taking away this ad-hoc piece o' crud, which he admits he winged from a script he never even liked. (Gods of videotape and DVD, please spare us his cut, which he never completed, by the way.) From the very first frames, it's clear that Kaye has no rapport with his actors, and has zero idea how to get decent, let alone consistent, performances out of them. As the buffed-up skinhead leader, Norton tries hard, but he has three different personalities in the film, with the transitions between them either patently phony or (mostly) non-existent. A worthy subject, but this ""X""ecrable effort proves why some people are cut out to do 30-second commercials and not grandiose ""masterpieces"". In short, this guy makes Oliver Stone look the subtlest man on the planet. For all you message- seekers, here's the flick's big payoff: ""Hate is baggage"".

Very Strong and amazing Film,"I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.The movie its story is told 'beautifuly' in black & white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.Also surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for ""The Full Monty"", the year before.This was a movie that surprisingly impressed me.

"Derek is a charismatic, intelligent, articulate young man who has just got out off prison and finds out that his younger brother is following in his footsteps.","American History X pokes at the belief of white supremacists and political correctness in America. Tony Kaye punches you in the face with his fierce dialogue and cinematography, supported by a masterful performance by Edward Norton, the reformed and remorseful Neo-Nazi protégé. It reinforces the current standing that clever racists can profoundly exploit those that have no direction in life and nowhere to channel their anger. Even with its verbal and physical brutality, it is a film that should be watched to see these extreme issues and how things could end up if we let poverty, racism and political correctness feed of each other. It is shame that Tony Kaye has not directed many other films.Edward Norton is a talented actor as he possesses an ability to morph into many different characters (The Narrator, Fight Club) (Monty Brogan, 25th Hour) (Eisenheim, The Illusionist), providing he has the artistic room to breathe. Tony Kaye utilisation of Norton's flexibility has made this one of 1998's poignant yet underrated films.There were a few scenes in the film that gave the impression of the unnecessary purity of racist violence. Triumphant music scores as the white supremacist battle with their darker counterparts and almost 'Jesus-like' holiness during Derek's revengeful murders were overcooked. Although the sole piece of the film revolves around Derek, his actions and consequences, it doesn't explain his family's staunch views against Racism. With all the family difficulties, financially and spiritually, the film does not explain their moral convictions and the importance of education as shown by Derek's sister's devotion to education. There was also the over simplification of why Derek was going to be dormant racist in the making due to his father views. It would have nice to see a little bit more of Murray (Elliot Gould) and Sweeney (Avery Brooks) interact with Derek and how there lives were affected by his persona. Finally, the deleted scenes should have been added to the film as I felt added weight and understanding.Even though this film is several year old as I write this, it is still provoking today as it was in 1998.

"Clear message, but not a very innovative movie","I'd heard great stories about how brilliant this film would be, and got a little disappointed after watching it. Sure, it's a nice story  with a very clear and unavoidable message  but it did not really disturb me. I like a film to disturb me, to make me doubt my opinions. And I can get disturbed by strange and obsessive people, not by a single swastika now and then. In this movie everything was so obvious, clear cut and outspoken: the dialogs seemed to be taken from high school plays: our thesis on racism'. The filming was smooth, there even were some background violins if I'm not mistaken. But there was nothing raw, nothing hidden, nothing seductive, nothing strangely energetic in this piece. The whole story got told'. And I really disliked the black&white of the flashbacks, that did not add anything worthwhile. Conclusion: Of coarse' I can agree with the message  but the filming was a little cheap. I'm curious about the movie Tony Kaye wanted to make.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
American History X is A Harrowing Morality Tale!,"Make no mistake; American History X is not pretty. It's not fun. It made me squirm and cringe. Not because it was bad, but because it's powerful stuff - a refreshing change from the usual saccharine attempts by Hollywood to address racism, giving us a brilliant tale told without restraint or bias.The movie begins on the day former leader of a neo-Nazi skinhead gang Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) gets out of prison after serving a 3- year sentence for the vicious manslaughter of black thieves who were trying to steal his truck. The incident in question was the culmination of Derek's indoctrination as a white supremacist, begun in the lessons of his father who was slain at the hands of black men, and picked up by Venice Beach's white-power kingpin Cameron. Derek's high-flying stardom within the latter's organization crashes in prison, where Derek slowly learns the error of his ways and builds a resolve to keep his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps. He comes home to find that his brother has succumbed to the rancorous influence of the same hate- group who turned him into a skinhead thug.Meanwhile, at school, Danny must rewrite a paper for his history class because the glowing essay he wrote on Mein Kampf - at Cameron's urging - was rejected. He is ordered by his high school principal Dr. Sweeney to instead write a report on his brother and his own journey into the twisted skinhead world titled 'American History X'. Derek is the star of Danny's account, and Derek's transformation is revealed in black and white flashbacks when he recounts to Danny about his prison ordeal - his disillusionment with other skinhead inmates, their revenge on him and his unexpected friendship with a black convict. Danny slowly comes to realize the truth - the venom spewed by Cameron and his ilk creates nothing but misery. In the end, though, there is no escaping the price for Derek's sins.American History X is deceptively simple in its story telling, but first-time director Tony Kaye directs it like an auteur, giving us a harrowing morality tale that is both rich and gripping at all times. But it is Edward Norton's riveting performance as a smart kid seduced by horrible ideas that makes the story real. He plays the raging neo-Nazi with unsettling conviction, spitting hateful propaganda and brutally letting his feelings out. Edward Furlong's performance as Danny shows an impressive range for a young actor, making Danny a believable teenager.When Edward Norton's brilliant, fully rounded performance rubs up against the film's grainy toughness - complimented by an impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay - American History X becomes an exhilarating experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Overdone realism,"American History X is a good movie, not a great one. Neither does it make this year's best films, in my opinion. The story is about a former skinhead (played superbly by Edward Norton, who is going to hit it big) who is sent to jail for an intolerable crime. He then ""changes"" (I don't know how, but I can tell you that the film didn't show that, and if it did, then not enough) and comes out of jail, only to come home to his younger brother who seems to have been influenced by him and the story moves on about how the character tries to change his brother's views. As realistic and frightening as the film is, it goes overboard with torture and suffering. There are many scenes which could have been trimmed, including the brutal food market invasion of the skinheads, and an unwatchable prison rape scene. The camera angles are poor, with too many closeups at times. It is a beginning achievment, but I felt discouraged because the topic and story should have been given to a masterful director, like Scorsese, and all the brutality would have been shown in a more absorbing and watchable way. Nevertheless, there are great moments, and great performances. Edward Norton deserved a nomination, but not the oscar.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

It delves into the consequences of such ideology, not only for the victims but also for those who perpetuate it. The film does not shy away from the brutality and ugliness of racism, presenting it in a stark and unapologetic manner.While the film's subject matter is undoubtedly heavy and disturbing, it serves as a call for introspection and encourages viewers to confront their own prejudices and biases. It challenges the audience to consider the destructive power of hate and the potential for growth and change.One of the film's strengths is its exploration of the themes of redemption and personal transformation. As Derek's journey unfolds, the narrative raises important questions about the capacity for individuals to overcome their past and break free from the cycle of hatred.

I thought the skin heads were very well portrayed to the point that their line of thinking could be agreed with by young people who are looking for an answer to there problems. The problem is, the counter points were mainly shown in violent cinematic splendor. The type of stuff we have become conditioned to see with a disclaimer going off in our head saying ""it's only a movie"".I kept waiting for a moment to pop up when our hero(?) would come through with a truly compelling reason to show his change of heart, but it didn't happen for me. The homosexual prison sequence is the kind of stuff people (who this film was meant to reach) might find funny. And the death at the end bit has been done so many times; it has become convenient to simply off a principle player as a solution.I felt it was coming close when we were shown how Derek was made to realize that it would take more than a change of heart on his part to make things right; he would have to address his past actions to make things right.Then the movie ended.Now one could argue that the death of his brother would have a greater impact than anything else they could have shown, but, as said earlier, it's been done so many times that it seemed like more of a cop-out.There can be no arguing that Ed Norton was brilliant. Maybe his performance was too good. The look in his eyes after he'd killed the man with his foot was chilling. I saw this look of pride and accomplishment on his face that made me wonder if some young and impressionable sort watching this movie might get the idea that it might be cool to do similar. And that scared me more than anything the movie could have shown.It's easy to counter this argument with the statement ""It's only a movie"", but this was a ""message movie"" and I feel there is more danger in the right people getting the wrong message.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Haunting albeit Unrealistic,"Tony Kaye offers a dramatic film in the form of American History X, on the topic of racism, presented through the marginalized perspectives of Neo-Nazi nationalists. The story centers upon a bright, intelligent man Derek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton, who unyieldingly displays his hate and disgust for other races. He and his group of friends repeatedly make life difficult for other races living in the area. Their actions finally climax when Derek goes too far and has to serve time in prison, leaving his younger brother, Danny Vinyard, played by Edward Furlong, to the will of the Neo-Nazi group. The story is powerful and features ups and downs in the characters that add an air of humanity to these otherwise inhumane Neo-Nazi racists. The characters, for the most part, are grotesque and in certain cases, utmost embodiments of our own insecurities towards different cultures and lifestyles, initiating inner turmoil sometimes. The film sometimes plays off these fears a little too much and does not offer them in a more objective and subtle way.The film takes place in a surreal setting where there is constant conflict between differing races. The focus here is on tensions between the Neo-Nazis and African-Americans living in the same neighborhood, and at times the film tends to become a little one-sided. It feels like some of the targets of Derek's horrific actions are simply victims, when in the grand scheme of things, they likely harbor similar feelings towards Derek's group and commit similar actions in retribution. Moreover, Derek's transformation in prison is brushed over rather quickly and uses one or two powerful scenes to imply a lifetime of change. It doesn't really work honestly and the film loses a lot of its credibility there.The acting here is decent with Edward Norton standing head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. Danny Vinyard, despite arguably being the main character, seems like he's missing in certain scenes when Norton simply takes over. Edward Furlong does look the part but he doesn't act the part extremely well. Having said that, he does a decent enough job to propel the film forward, even with his annoying monologues that lack any spirit. The rest of the cast does well with what its given with Ethan Suplee playing Derek's leach-like and terrifying friend. Even William Russ makes a strong guest appearance in a flashback sequence that explains many of the present scenarios.The visual style is interesting here with color scenes meant to represent Derek's changed lifestyle in the present, and stark black-and-white shots used in flashback sequences to juxtapose the two races against one another. The idea, while pretty good on paper, ends up coming on a little too strong in the film, and does end up hurting the film, even though it tries to add depth. There are several haunting scenes here that the camera crew has taken from the script and captured well in film. The score is mostly two-sided, using dark and low notes for the past, and higher pitched notes to indicate a possible, brighter future. It works pretty well but like the difference in color and black-and-white, it sometimes goes for too much, especially towards the end of the film.American History X is a film about racism that is meant to inspire disgust for those portrayed on screen but also perhaps in ourselves when we sometimes shelter similar feelings. The film is literally a little too black and white, offering little gray space between, on the topic of racism. Unfortunately, certain things aren't always as simple as the film makes them out to be and Derek's transformation is both too unrealistic and short. Edward Norton does an incredible job here but the rest of the cast members, with a few exceptions, suffer greatly, and consequently, so does the film. Overall, the film sends out a powerful message, using powerful camera shots and characters to deliver it to the audience. It is grisly and gritty at times, giving us an extreme and bitter taste of Neo-Nazi racism. However, the film has too many flaws in its execution for it to be considered a classic of 90's cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
American History X,"American History X acted as my introduction to Tony Kaye and didn't leave me thirsting for any more of his work. The 1998 film, was his directorial debut, and that fact showed. The film stars Edward Norton as a former white supremacist reformed after a jail sentence who now wants to help his brother, played by Edward Furlong, avoid traveling the same path. What the film lacks in character depth it makes up for in its overarching moral message. American History X is devoid of all real human complexity in favor of the easy and overly simple message against racism without ever actually showing much in the way of race relations. Everything about American History X is safe, and safe films are rarely remembered years after their release.Edward Norton's Derek Vinyard, an easily mentally manipulated young man living in the increasingly diverse Venice Beach area of Los Angelis, California. Early one morning, Derek's brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) alerts his brother that his car is being broken into by ""some black guy"". Derek answers by loading a gun then heading outside in his underwear firing as soon as the door is open. Derek is arrested and sentenced to serve three years in prison. He bars his family and friends from visiting him while he is in prison, leaving everyone shocked when a completely transformed Derek emerges. When the white supremacist group that he used to head throws a party for his release, Derek wants no part of it and only attends the party to warn his former mentor to stay away from his brother and sever ties with everyone there. Derek's time is now spent trying to get his life back on track, find a job, and keep himself out of jail. His purpose, however, is to keep his brother, who idolizes Derek and watched his every move for years, out of the racism-fueled group that he fostered. He must impart his new-found enlightenment on his brother before it is too late.Aside from the glaring plot deficiencies, American History X is shot in a painful way. The heavy reliance on extreme close-up and often off-centered shots miss the grittiness the director may have been going for and is instead nauseating. The memories shot in black & white came off incredibly gimmicky and really didn't serve the advancement of the narrative in any way. The transition from black & white memories to present-day color shots was far from smooth and was rather distracting. American History X is not the type of film that requires a voice- over, yet, it was voiced-over throughout the entire film. Even if a film doesn't need a voice-over, it's easier to forgive if there is a succulent voice providing the narration; American History X does not have this either. There is a heavy reliance on the shots of this film to provide a shock factor, rather than the narrative itself which is indicative of poor directing when you're working with a plot as explosive as race relations. Back to the plot, the audience is told all throughout the film that Derek is smart, but we are never shown that. Twice through the movie, the audience is shown just how little it takes to emotionally and mentally manipulate Derek, leaving one to wonder if his ""transformation"" will even be permanent. The betrayal in the final scene may be just another manipulation to push Derek back to his old ways of vitriol hate. There's just not much to take away from Tony Kaye's feature film debut, which is disappointing considering that it could have been a masterclass in cinema, given its premise.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
"This is real life, people","AMAZING PERFORMANCE BY EDWARD NORTON.................. I was so into his propaganda that I suddenly realized that I am racist.And I believe that there are a lot of people out there, just like me, that would do exactly what Danny and the other skinheads were doing if they had someone like Derek in front of them. That's what I loved about the movie: it provided us with an accurate insight on racism and its effects. Unfortunately it didn't focus enough on the reasons for the changes in Derek's attitude and didn't help me reach the other side, leaving me in the racists's side. They should have worked more on the script, shown more of Derek's life in prison.I was kinda disappointed... but, overall, a great movie",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

However, we cannot say that it has lost any of its shock.Movies about racism have always attracted my attention and I have watched many of them. This is a great movie made on this subject.

Could watch over and over...,"I want to start this review off by addressing a common point that negative reviews about this movie TRIED to make. Many say ""why are the black characters so unlikeable""...and ""why are the white characters actions so forgivable, etc etc."" Did you people even WATCH the movie? Seriously, did we go to the fridge for refreshments during all the parts containing the black guy Norton does laundry with in prison? Or how about all the parts containing the ""Doctor"" (the principal of the high school)? Did we ignore those parts? Maybe i'm mistaken, but they seemed like pretty likable characters to me. The rest of the black characters SERVE THEIR PURPOSE. Most of them are gang-members, you're not SUPPOSED to like them. And how about half of the ""skinheads""? Seemed like pretty UNlikeable characters to me. A lot of them also seemed to perform some actions that weren't all that forgivable to me.Anyway, GREAT movie. Story line is endlessly intriguing.

For most people they have to learn the hard way to figure out that you must learn from peoples mistakes and not always fallow other people in their foot steps but your own. For example like Derek, by his ways he was taught to be a nazi. So he killed a African American and went to prison. He learned later on that being white doesn't make you have power in a place like prison. He got taught a lesson and changed his ways. When he got out he had a different mind set and tried to get his brother Danny out of the bad road that he was once down.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
American History X,"The name of the Matrix film, if translated literally, should be ""American History - X"", but the name ""Beast of Good People"" seems closer to the essence of the film.

And the superego is our rationality, the thing we use to restrain our desires. Under the control of the id, we are all beasts, while the superego makes us suppress ourselves and become good citizens. Of course, it is not only the subjective id that suppresses our desires, but also objective powers, laws, morals, and so on. Essentially, we are all beasts and good people.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A daring subject, with fine acting, but ultimately botched.","In the early 1980's it was regarded as a great novelty when the man behind the Hovis commercial directed a hit film. At the time the two worlds were still regarded as miles apart; once one took the soup from Kleenex or Curly Wurly, one was cursed to walk their earth for eternity, with no hope of escape. Ridley Scott broke that mould, with the help of Hugh Hudson, Alan Parker and his brother Tony. More recently, they have been joined by video directors like David Fincher. All share a common visual vocabulary; whilst many have made effective films, there is a cold polish to their work, a discipline of image over content which has often been counterproductive.American History X, whilst in many ways an admirable film, is a case in point. Tony Kaye is a highly respected director of both commercials and videos - the British Rail advertisement with the snoozing sepia people is his - and it shows. Fish eye lenses, tasteful monochrome, slow motion, faces in deep shadow, all are used and often used effectively. However one is constantly waiting for a silky voice to try and sell us perfume. Since Kaye is his own director of photography, all responsibility for this lies with him.The film tells the story of two brothers involved with Neo-Nazi skinheads in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles. Derek (Edward Norton), has just been released from prison after serving time for killing a black man. Danny (Edward Furlong), idolises his elder brother and has followed in his footsteps, his room bedecked with Nazi regalia. This is a very sensitive theme and it is extremely well played by the two Edwards. Norton's Oscar nomination is well deserved, but Furlong is no less impressive, he manages to convey the avalanche of confusion that engulfs a teenager. His racism is part of a pack mentality, one sees clearly that freed from the malign forces around him, he could escape and the humanity in him could blossom.The film dares to make both brothers attractive personalities, it dares to allow us to root for them. Elsewhere, the filmmakers are not so brave. On the side of righteousness there is Sweeney, a black school principal with ""two PhD's"", who goes out of his way to assist both Derek and Danny. This really is far too schematic, that the Nazis see the error of their ways because of a saint is much too easy. If there were a Sweeney in every high school, then the problem could  be solved over night. Similarly if all right wing leaders were as transparently evil as Stacy Keach's Cameron, then the Dannys of the world would be fairly safe from their grasp. Keach plays him as a cackling maniac, complete with scary scar; he belongs in an underwater base, cradling a white cat. As the electoral success of people like former KKK member David Dukes has shown, white supremacists are capable of appearing just as suburban and normal as Tony Blair. It is there that the real danger lies for America, not with demagogic caricatures.The process of Derek's political development is also rather cheesy. His dad warned him about affirmative action so he became suspicious of Sweeney's liberalism, his dad gets murdered by a drug dealer so he becomes a Nazi, he goes to prison and meets a nice black bloke, sees the error of his ways and changes his mind. This is the sort of clunky emotional exposition that used to define the character arcs of guest stars in Little House on the Prairie. Similarly, the many intriguing moral and political issues are not demonstrated dramatically, but are explicitly discussed in a series of set pieces over dinner. This is a shame since most of the time writer David McKenna delivers a very controlled and well structured piece of work. He avoids a neat narrative line and moves comfortably backwards and forwards through time.There is also a very sure sense of place, the Venice Beach locations lend the film an enigmatic feel. This is an environment which straddles race and class. Unlike the urban jungles of the industrial cities of the East, Venice has great natural beauty, the Pacific opens and closes the film. Yet man makes his own ugliness, the meanness of the human spirit is everywhere. There are very few American films which have so convincingly created such a dark nether world, otherwise ignored by mainstream media.And yet, Hollywood sensibilities do permeate the picture. In the end all it takes for Derek to convince Danny of the error of his ways is for him to tell him about the nice black bloke in prison; a sequence that is both schematic and dramatically moribund. This sums up so much of what is frustrating about the film, it is skilfully made but has little flavour of original talent, it is brave but not brave enough to matter.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Powerful and Unflinching Look at Hate and Redemption,"American History X is a raw, unflinching exploration of race, redemption, and the devastating impact of hate. Directed by Tony Kaye and anchored by powerful performances, especially from Edward Norton, this film delivers a poignant message about the consequences of violence and the possibility of transformation. It's an uncomfortably honest look at the allure of hate and the struggle to break free from its grip, making it a film that resonates deeply long after it ends.Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard, a former neo-Nazi skinhead trying to leave his past behind, is nothing short of phenomenal. His portrayal of a man torn between his violent past and his desire for redemption is compelling and heartbreaking. Norton fully embodies Derek's internal struggle, making his journey from hatred to hope feel both believable and deeply emotional. The supporting cast, including Edward Furlong as Derek's younger brother, Danny, also deliver strong performances, with Furlong effectively capturing the vulnerability and confusion of a teenager influenced by his older brother's beliefs.The film's storytelling is masterfully executed, with its non-linear structure weaving between past and present to reveal the tragic evolution of Derek's worldview. Through these flashbacks, the audience gains a deep understanding of how Derek became engulfed in hate, while the present-day storyline shows his desperate attempt to break free from that cycle. The juxtaposition of these timelines helps highlight the film's central theme: that redemption is possible, but it comes with immense personal and emotional cost.The film doesn't offer easy answers or simplistic portrayals of good and evil; instead, it challenges the viewer to confront uncomfortable truths about racism, prejudice, and the impact of societal influences. American History X doesn't shy away from showing the destructive power of hate, but it also highlights the possibility of change, growth, and healing, making it a compelling narrative of personal transformation.Visually, the film makes powerful use of contrast and symbolism, particularly in the iconic black-and-white flashback sequences that represent Derek's mindset at different points in his life. The direction is purposeful and thoughtful, supporting the film's themes without being heavy-handed.Ultimately, American History X is a deeply impactful film that doesn't just entertain-it challenges, provokes, and educates. It's a thought-provoking exploration of the destructive nature of hatred and the potential for personal growth and redemption. Edward Norton's tour de force performance, combined with a thought-provoking script and powerful direction, makes this a film that is not only unforgettable but essential viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Hate is baggage.Life's too short to be pissed off all the time. It's just not worth it.""","""American History X"" is a classic. This movie is amazingly well done. I am a huge fan of the film, ""FIght Club"" so I knew I liked Edward Norton. Seeing him in this redefined my image of him.

The movie does a great job of highlighting the consequences of a hateful lifestyle, and drawing attention to the negative impacts it can have on the people you love as well as the groups you target. This movie evokes a lot of different emotions, and that is exactly what I look for in movies. To feel the magic, the pulse from what I am seeing on screen.This movie was really good.

"No, we can't all get along","American History X tells the story of Derek Vinyard, a vile, racist, murderous neo-Nazi skinhead who decides he doesn't want to be that guy anymore. But he will find that once you are living that life it is not at all easy to get out. And much to Derek's chagrin he sees his brother Danny going down the same path which nearly destroyed him. Derek knows he has to reach Danny, change him, open his eyes. Before it's too late.The film's story unfolds in an unconventional manner. We see the present-day Derek, a man determined to do good, to change himself and save his brother. This is intercut with flashbacks which show us the monster Derek was. When the film opens Derek is about to be released from prison. When we go back in time to see how he ended up in jail it is shocking and disturbing to say the least. We see a man consumed by hatred and anger. He tears his family apart. He destroys his own life. And he does it all with a sinister smirk on his face. The saddest thing is that Danny idolizes his older brother. Danny is a skinhead too, proud of it. There was a time Derek would have been proud of what Danny had become. That time has gone. Prison changed Derek. How exactly it changed him is told in quite vivid, brutal detail. And when it becomes clear who it was who eventually reached Derek, changed his way of thinking, it all begins to make sense. The path to Danny's salvation appears. There is only one person who was ever really going to be able to change Danny and that was his brother. But Derek had someone very important on his side to help things along. That help had better come quickly. Danny may be too far gone, time is running out.It's a captivating film with an undeniably powerful story. But it's not a film without flaws. While Edward Norton is magnificent as Derek there's the sense Edward Furlong, playing Danny, struggles to keep pace. When Norton and Furlong share the screen, and they share the film's most important moments, there's the sense that Furlong just doesn't measure up. There's a certain level of maturity required to handle the very challenging role and Furlong seems to lack it. There are times it's hard to take his character seriously and that's a problem in a film as deadly serious as this one. The film also has a bit of a disjointed feel to it. The nonlinear structure works but not all of the pieces really end up fitting properly. This probably has something to do with the fact the film was taken out of director Tony Kaye's hands and reassembled by others, most notably Norton. There are places where the narrative just doesn't flow freely, the film bogs down. Kaye has said he wanted to make a tighter, shorter film. It probably would have been better if he had gotten that opportunity. The film also does a rather poor job of establishing the roots of Derek's hatred. One flashback dinner conversation with his father is all we really get and that sequence doesn't really work. It's as if it had to be tossed in because there had to be something there at the root of all this. But it's not enough. And then Derek's prison transformation, again not entirely convincing. You don't let go of that much hatred that quickly.In one of his earlier racial diatribes Derek had invoked Rodney King, the man who famously asked, ""Can we all get along?"" The old Derek thought Rodney King was some kind of subhuman, the scum of the earth. The new Derek wants us all to get along. But we can't. Some of us have gone too far down the path of hatred and bigotry. You may want to change yourself. But it's hard to change the world. Derek wants to leave his old life behind. More importantly, he wants his brother to leave that world of hate behind. The clock ticks. Time is not on Derek's side.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Beautifully Told Tale,"A passionate tale of transition and rehabilitation holds American History X in such high regard for its take on topical societal subjects, enlightening and educating in order to shape an equal, diverse community in America.Derek, who has served three years in prison for a hate crime, tries to change the thoughts of his brother, Danny, who is following the same path.The '1998' picture stands out for its violent scenes of brutality, emphasising the true rage and horrors of Neo-Nazism in the country. In depicting these troubles, the detail and camerawork in angling every shot and conveying every emotion is a credit to the work of director Tony Kaye, who ensures every moment has a lasting memory in the mind of its audience.Edward Norton, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his acting performance, entered the spotlight of film following 1996's Primal Fear, and only cemented his name at the upper echelons of cinema for his lead role in 'American History X'. Ultimately, the actor is tasked with portraying two characters, the pre and post incarcerated Derek. Even at his worst, Norton encapsulates the mere sensitivity and love that the character has towards his family, assuming safety and responsibility after his father's passing. When released from prison, we see the rational thinking and reserved personality of the protagonist. The then 27-year-old masters the complete change in character, expressing care and concern, not being afraid to fight back against the hostility and protests.The beauty of the film is its order of events, emphasising the contrast in the tone of the movie. Intertwining between in and out of prison highlights the power of the catalyst of the spectacle: young Lamont who befriends Derek inside jail nurtures the character to become a better man.The shift of black-and-white to colour is symbolic throughout. Once again in foreshadowing the transition of perspective, though also to signal the sign of the times in reflecting a foreword-moving, cosmopolitan new America.A movie which confronted societal divide in a moving and poignant manner. It's moral message still translates today.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Hollywood's Hollow 'x' is mush,"Forget all the hype surrounding Tony Kaye and the suits from New Line preventing him from having say on final cut. Kaye's pic is a dud, even if he had managed to edit those trite images of falling water, and sunset beaches, etc (not forgetting a one legged teddy bear - gee honey, see what I told you, it's a movie about skinheads for the whole family!) Word is Norton had final cut and it shows. The film adores him, but it's all too much. When Norton grimaces after slo-mo action sequence (action b pic 101), his eyes seem to say 'look into my face and see the horror!' I looked hard and found nothing. This film is playschool meets Nazis and it just does not gel. Interested in movies about skinheads, without conventional plot lines supported by cookie cutter players and timeworn twists? See Tim Roth in 'Made in Britain' and Russell Crowe in 'Romper Stomper.' No bs films that tell it like it is. Violent they may be, but violence can't be gratuitous when it is central to the plot.

Slick and didactical,"A good movie with good acting and neat, appropriate lessons or message(s) about how easily influenced kids, even smart ones, can be; how confused, insecure people find in group hatred a natural way to vent their anger; how all it takes to realize one's mistake is to once catch a glimpse of ""the Enemy"" as a _human being_; how, in more ways than one, hate invariably breeds hate. If, however, you already know most or all of the above, you might get bored, or marvel at what a remarkably ""clean"" movie was made out of such an inherently ugly subject. Sure, the two strayed heroes have their dark sides but both of them, when they're not doing their white-supremacist gang thing, are mostly mild-mannered, well-behaved, polite kids you'd love to have baby-sit your daughter. It's no wonder then, that this dark side is so easily dropped by both at once - it didn't stick in the first place. This movie probably deserves a good place in a history, sociology or philosophy class, but not in a movie collection - somehow lacks subtlety, although in that respect it sure could have been a lot worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"The movie tries to transmit a message, this message is...STOP BEING RACIST!","If you are expecting a movie with testosterone and gang fights just for pure fun and entertainment, you chose the wrong movie. If you came to see a drama with a powerful story with a deep and powerful message that will leave anyone who watch wet in tears by the end, then you chose the right film.""American History X"" is a drama with a story full of violence and a deep message against society. Everything starts with Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) who after the death of his father by a black man, forms a Nazi-Racist gang called ""skinhead"" and with it the attempt to exterminate and expel all blacks and immigrants in their neighborhood by invading properties and get in conflict with other gangs. One day his house is assaulted by a member of a rival gang, which ends up in a double murder and with the arrest of Derek. 3 years pass and now Derek totally changed, is trying to clear his family name and try to ward off his brother Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) from the life of crime and racism that himself led into.The film has a very interesting direction by Tony Kaye, filmed in a dramatic and disturbing way. The film is divided into two parts; one in present with Derek coming out of prison and Danny getting closer to the gang; the other part telling Derek's past and how he came from a violent racist to the repentant man haunted by his past. Both parties superbly filmed with shades of different colors. In the present with normal and colorful shot, in the past with black-and-white shots.Not only the direction is superb as well as the writing of David McKenna delivering to the film disturbing and racist dialogs. At first it may seem that the film is in favor of racism and extermination of races. But throughout the film we noticed that they all try to show how stupid and inappropriate is racism and the prejudice that it can bring to those who practice it. All events on file show that more and more, and also the characters that built up the movie, mainly the professor Bob Sweeney (the old professor of Derek and the new from David) and Derek's ""friend"" in prison. Both of them through the movie show to Derek that all of us are equals.But the message to be delivered perfectly it needed superb performances to complete everything and leave everything fantastic. Thanks to both Edwards this is not missed: Furlog proves to be a great dramatic actor, and Norton proves to be one of the best actors of his generation with a FANTASTIC performance that improves with every passing minute.A film with a deep story; superbly written and with a final message that can make the toughest of men shed a tear thanks to fantastic performances and flawless direction. ""American History X"" is a film to be seen and be remembered by many.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Edward Norton gives Oscar-worthy performance in moving drama,"American History X is an intense, moving film dealing with racial tension in contemporary American society. Edward Norton, in a performance that should have won an Oscar, plays Derek Vinyard over the course of several years. As the film opens we see him as the leader of a group of skinheads in LA. Later he goes to prison for murder and emerges as a changed man. We also see him as a sixteen year old (thru flashbacks), and he is amazing and memorable throughout the entire film.We find out that Derek was always intelligent and a natural leader, this is why local longtime racist and militant Cameron (Stacy Keach) has been grooming him to lead a young band of racist punks. Cameron is using Derek to fulfill some warped agenda of his, but Derek doesn't see through Cameron until its too late. After some black punks attempt to break into a car outside Dereks house, he murders one of them in a shocking and graphic scene that shows the depth of Dereks hatred and brutality.Dereks family has also been effected by racism...when Derek was 16, his firefighter father was murdered by a black junkie while on duty and he has become the man of the family and father figure to younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong). Danny is a lot like Derek, and we can just tell that he could go either way in life, but currently seems to be following Dereks lead.This is an emotionally and physically scarred family, the mother (Beverly Deangelo) smokes too much and is constantly coughing, yet still is desperately trying to hold her family together. She is seeking a man to be a father figure to Derek and starts dating a Jewish teacher (Elliot Gould). In possibly the best scene in the film (at least the most thought provoking), Goulds' character and Derek get into a political debate at the dinner table that soon gets out of control. Its an amazing scene and brilliantly acted, this is a scene every American should watch as topics are discussed that most films just don't have the courage to explore. In a way It's like the quintessential left vs right debate over racial issues, but we are also left thinking that Derek, while making some real points, can not discuss these points without ultimately showing his racial hatred and turning violent....he's been programmed by his hatred.The film moves on to Dereks prison years, I wont divulge details here, but this is the period that changes Derek immensely. He eventually opens up to a black fellow inmate with whom he becomes friends, and as events play out we see the ultimate irony occur which results in a changed Derek.The final act of the film gives us a reformed Derek (with a full head of hair) released from prison and trying to start over. When he gets home he finds his brother Danny has been in contact with Cameron and tries to intervene. Danny is a becoming a mirror image of what Derek once was and Derek must act to stop him. Any more at this point would be a spoiler but I will add a few more thoughts...In the flashbacks to Derek at age 16 we see that despite all the outside influences that developed his hatred....originally it may have came right from his own home. Nobody is born a racist, racism is taught...I think that is one of the points the film-makers wanted to make.This a shattering, heartbreaking film....a true masterpiece in the realm of social drama. The quote at the end from a speech by Abe Lincon is very fitting. This is an American classic that every American should see at least once.Also, I really was pleasantly surprised to see this film rated so highly at IMDb, not that it doesn't deserve it because it does. This is rated higher here than many very very good films....but I wanted to add my 2 cents worth anyway...",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
American History X,"In my opinion, the visual was quite disappointing because the cinematography, camera angles/shots, production and costume designing was not outside the box. As a viewer the close ups became very erratic. It ignored decent portraits and landscapes. Tony Kaye's cinematography looked flat instead of mind blowing. Tony Kaye's directing did not look professional.In addition, the plot was down the drain for me because it only explored a very tiny piece of the racial subject matter. David Mckenna's screenplay was absolutely preachy. It did not let the audience have access to their perspectives. In my thoughts, it made the characters behave like puppets instead of organic. Derek Vinyard behaved more like a puppet being pulled by its master than any other normal human being. I hardly felt anything from the storyline because of the lack of depth. I could not empathize with the plot at all.To add, Ann Dudley written down beautiful notes for his orchestra to perform. His composed tunes trapped my ears from beginning to end.I am pushed to give the title a 3/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Disappointing...,"""American History X"" was a good, entertaining movie.  That's what's so disappointing about it.  It could have been a *great* movie, but it turned out to be merely a decent one.  I wouldn't be saying this if I hadn't really liked the picture.  There was some real potential in this film, and the potential was never realized.  Roger Ebert sums up my views very well in his review.  It's always rather painful to see a movie that ""wants to take off and soar"" end up sitting on the ground (albeit sitting very well).  I also agree with Ebert that the fault was mainly in the direction.  If the movie had a great director, it would have been a great film.

Excellent Movie,"American History X is one of the best films that I have seen in my lifetime. If I could, I would make it a mandatory viewing for every single individual. The moral lesson alone makes it a must see for everyone, especially those who are conflicted and caving to peer pressure; regardless of age. Throughout each of our lives we come to a cross roads at least once or twice where we have the opportunity to make a choice to let hatred consume us or to fight the urge for hatred to enter our hearts and our souls. This movie shows us how misdirected hatred can ruin lives, directly and indirectly. The film crew did a fantastic job collaborating to create a film that not only entertains, but one that makes the viewer think twice about the life they have lived and the impact they have had on the ones they love. I feel that all of the actors played their parts perfectly, but extra kudos goes to the core actors/characters: Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard and Edward Furlong as Danny Vinyard. These characters are played so well that you almost don't have a choice but to be pulled into the intensity of their lives. My favorite effects used in the movie, to my surprise, are the transitions from color images to black and white images. These transitions, in addition to the random and perfectly placed slow motion effects, enhance the emotional aspect of the film. As the story bounces around from present day/post incarceration and past/pre incarceration, it is easy to keep up with the storyline with the transition from color to black and white. I was surprised that I would like this aspect of the film, since I am not normally a big fan of black and white footage. The black and white images help the viewer to focus more on the emotions that need to be felt by the characters and the setting. On the surface, the film is about a reformed neo-nazi skinhead who, after being released from prison, tries to reverse the destruction he has created within his family – only to realize he is too late. Below the surface; however, is a much needed lesson that hatred of any kind will only destroy you and the people close to you. Regardless of what you believe when you allow anger to consume you, there is no good found in hatred. If you are looking for a fluffy film, this is definitely not the film for you. If you are looking to learn a much needed lesson about our culture and the world we live in, this is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the most important films ever,"American History X is not only an immaculately made tale of redemption and loss, excellently anchored by an Oscar worthy performance from Edward Norton, it is also vitally important to understanding the problems that still lie in America today. This film deals with the naivety of racism in America, and how young kids, like Edward Furlong's character Danny Vinyard, can be drawn into a life of hate without even realising what they're hating in the first place. Contrasting two periods of Derek Vinyard's (Norton) life, American History X shows the despair and anger that are bred from ignorant hate but also the enlightenment that is found when the hate is lost and the anger drains away. The pulsating rage of Vinyard's character as he lashes out at his mother's partner is painstakingly juxtaposed against his feelings of sorrowful regret, as he attempts to save his brother from making the same mistakes he did. The film's climax is almost Shakespearian in its poignancy, and it will leave you thinking for days. A masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The decades most dangerous movie!,"Very few films have the ability and bravery to leave a gut full of mixed emotions like 'American History X'. 1998's infamous neo nazi tale stars Edward Norton as hate mongering skinhead Derek Vinyard, a man so engulfed with hatred towards the black community of L.A. that its driven himself and his family toward a world of violent and jaded savagery. 'American History X' creates its characters through a series of black and white flashbacks that are narrated by Derek's impressionable younger brother Daniel, played by Edward Furlong. Daniel, who has witnessed his brothers violent threshold reach its fiery peak, has also decided to brand African Americans as enemy no.1. but hasn't suffered the consequences of his sibling idol as Derek's reign as racist leader lands him in jail for murder. Unlike Derek, Daniel has the opportunity to exit the world of white supremacy before it's too late as he sees Derek surprisingly turn his back on the nazi cult he helped create and ride a road to reform and regret. Director Tony Kaye has made a movie of relentless force and brutal vulnerability, a bold, aggressive and confronting vision that few young film makers fail to achieve. 'American History X' is not only a film, but a lasting legacy in fundamental and human values we all need to seek and adopt.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Painstakingly important film provides a shattering look at violence and hatred.,"It was very easy to realize in the beginning that I, too, would've found AMERICAN HISTORY X a minor coincidence in the making. Well, I was wrong. Again! Even with the influential direction of Tony Kaye and solid acting of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, the movie still could have squeezed more juice. It could have been simply more or less. More on its details and less of the slow pace, to be exact. You won't keep anybody down for not liking this picture because of its explicit nature. This one took the more provocative route, and it suddenly runs as smooth as premium unleaded gasoline. The disturbing racial hatred that has changed America's societal infrastructure forever is how this picture is portrayed. With its correct state of mind, the movie is nonetheless disturbing as well as horrifyingly true, and shows itself on a very high pinpoint of accuracy. It walks a large step further in giving out a dramatic study of what can actually be a truthful account of the life of a racial hate crime syndicate, and how the lives of two adjusting individuals are shared. The violence is what makes this movie fully express the way society is being mistreated. Certainly speaking, it does go off the deep end and is not for the faint of heart, so that's all there is to know. One nice touch is the use of photography and its expression of colors, which is a good move for having the story tell itself with proper understanding. I really wanted more out of AMERICAN HISTORY X, but it's got rock-solid potential to keep its open-mindedness with a variety of moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Wildly variable quality, but fascinating and gripping","Suggests the devil has the best tunes: the portrayal of Norton's immersion in the movement is scintillating, conveying both the visceral excitement and his fearsome articulacy and the sexy physicality it gives him - the scene where the dinner-table discussion of Rodney King grows into a brutal attack on Gould is painful to watch. At such times the sleek, visually punchy style draws you right in and is all the more mesmerizing for the repulsive nature of the identification.  But the movie has way more problems with the other side of the argument. The prison scenes are reasonable enough, if too reliant on a single amiable black guy as a positive influence on Norton, but Furlong's personal journey makes far less sense - the performance is blank and he doesn't have half the space to explain or demonstrate himself. The closing stretches are messy and disappointing. The social fabric of racism is barely touched on (easily the worst scene is the clunky flashback to the racist dad) and the movie's ""anti"" argument consists mainly of assertions about  racists being sad, time-wasting assholes. Despite this wildly variable quality, it was one of the more fascinating and gripping movies of its year.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

The Best Movie of the Last 10 years,"If you see one film this year that you haven't seen before, make it this one - as far as films go there are very few films that are better than American History X, and none of them were from the past 10 years.Although its content of neo-Nazi, skin head violence and seemingly bad-taste for a film obviously may put people off, but don't let that fool you. This film is a roller-coaster of emotion, and an epic drama at its finest. In my opinion, the most important point of American History X is not white supremacy, but the compelling and gripping portrayal of A family unit without a father. Most notably between younger and older brothers (Derek and Daniel), but also between a mother and her two sons. The racist and Nazi tones are simply very strong devices to show these bonds during extreme times.The story is told through current events (filmed in colour) and past events (filmed in black and white), which provide a great contrast in the film. With some very hot direction from Tony Kaye, a good script and a great casting, allows Edward Norton shines. It is one of the greatest performance by a leading actor in a modern film. He Pumps emotion and a real belief into his words, with much conviction that you, the viewer are sucked in and start to believe what he is saying is the truth.For Edward Nortons performance alone (although there is so much more to love about this film) American History X is firmly in my Top 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"After two days, I didn't think I would last a week","This is the only thing by Kaye I've seen(and the only I'd really heard of), but everything else by him looks compelling. When dealing with something controversial and brutal, you can water it down and appease censors, or you can match it in how relentless it is. In the case of a flawed ideology, the battle can be fought mainly by letting the followers and their actions speak for themselves(this is not propaganda; what we see in this could have happened). That is what we have here. I've read that this was based on a true story; while I don't know for sure, I can imagine that it is. The editing is sharp and vicious, not playing down what we're seeing in the least. Cinematography is dynamic and it keeps the pace(and intensity) high throughout, without reaching the point where we are overwhelmed or something didn't properly register with us. It is a 110-minute dirty, bumpy ride down a bad road, with the result that we can only seek to avoid the path, and deter others from following it, as well. The acting is spellbinding, every single performance. I found myself realizing that I knew these people from other stuff(then again, why haven't I seen Guy Torry in anything else good(steer clear of The Animal)? He's great!); however, they are so convincing here that they disappear into their well-written, credible and well-developed characters. Furlong is amazing. Norton ignites the screen as the furious and charismatic Derek. Apparently, he recut this to get himself more time... I don't know, maybe he did; I have to admit, I am rather happy with the released version. The ending is perfectly underplayed, a brilliant pay-off to a subtle setup and an undeniable fact of the problem of racism and hatred(as a sort of spot-on period to a film about those subjects). All of the script is impeccable. The dialog is natural, and the unrestrained feel of it helps paint a clearer image of the types we're following. This is funny at times, and it isn't without uplifting moments(not to be confused with sap or sentimentality); there is light at the end of the tunnel, it's merely dim. The author of this does not have anything other than this to his credit(well, S.W.A.T. was decent)... don't let that fool you. There is a ton of strong language, graphic, bloody and terrifying violence and disturbing content, a little sexuality(and a rape) and male nudity, including full frontal in this, and none of it is gratuitous. The DVD comes with three deleted scenes coming to a total of six and a half minutes and a theatrical trailer.

Powerful film,"This is a very effective movie, which for me is gauged by how many times my stomach turned during this film. Edward Norton gives the performance of a lifetime, and was deservedly nominated for an Oscar.The topic of race relations in America is a touchy subject, and this film thankfully didn't portray one side--i.e. the whites--as being the problem. There are many black ""leaders"" who fallaciously allege that blacks cannot be racist because they haven't any power. This allegation is ridiculous: the fact that Tawana Brawley was never prosecuted for her fiasco is an excellent example of which side has the power. The worst thing that you can be labeled these days? A Communist--no. A Fascist--no. The worst thing you can be labeled these days is a ""racist."" That's why many whites are reluctant to speak on race relations, it's the 3rd rail of politics.No one probably wants to admit it, but Norton's character makes a lot of sense when discussing the illegal immigration problem and the Rodney King debacle. I had heard a stat from the FBI not too long ago that was eye-opening: that black men, who are 6% of the American population, commit 45% of the violent crimes in this country--that's unbelievable!! Further, you have people that practically swim to this country from Asia, learn the language, and still outperform blacks in school, and yet all we hear are excuses from the black ""leaders."" The vision of a Southern governor of the 50's standing outside a school to prevent black children from entering is a distant memory. Now you have schools practically begging black students to apply to college, despite their poor qualifications, in order to promote ""diversity"" while Asian kids, for example, work their butts off and get cheated as colleges admit the less qualified applicants. So much for fairness and the American dream. And yet, these policies by liberal do-gooders promote more friction among ethnic groups. Unfortunately, however, a white man like myself is not supposed to brooch these issues--for only someone like Bill Cosby can, and he has, to his credit.Despite my rants above, I don't believe in the radicalism of these white supremacist groups. This nation would undoubtedly be more harmonious if there were no more ""protected minorities"" and that all quota systems would cease. People should advance based on merit, not by skin color.

Wow... just... wow.,"If you decide to watch this movie, be prepared to be struck to the very core of your soul. Very few movies I have seen manage to dig so deep into my heart as this one has, and I am a critical, skeptical, analytical kind of guy---I am about the furthest thing there is from a sappy, ready-to-cry-at-any-time moviegoer!Set in Los Angeles, the story of the movie is that Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton) is sent to prison after a double murder that is motivated by racial hatred. During his three year stay, he undergoes changes and realizes the error of his ways, only to find out that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is headed down the same path that Derek once was. After getting out on parole, Derek is determined to make sure that Danny does not wind up making the same mistakes as him.Although the movie jumps back and forth from the present (shot in color) to the past (shot in black and white), it is not confusing in the least.This movie grinds and twists your emotions like very few other movies can, because it pulls absolutely no punches as it exposes you to some of the darkest facets of human beings. You'll gasp, you'll cringe and you may even cry as the movie demonstrates to you how warped and vicious human beings can become when they are consumed by anger and hatred---and ultimately, the destruction and horrible endings that that anger and hatred leads to if we cling to them long enough.One last thing---the acting in this movie was phenomenal. Every actor did an astounding job with their character, but I have to mention how off the scales Edward Norton's acting was in this movie. I mean, he has NEVER failed to impress me, but wow... to see him go from a man who is so filled with such high octane rage and hatred, to a man who is consumed by remorse and sorrow as he at last realizes his mistakes, to amuch more soft-spoken, reasonable man who is filled with compassion and concern for his younger brother, and at last to a man who is torn apart by agony and grief as he fully realizes what his mistakes have truly cost him... and to play all of it flawlessly... well, I just can't say enough how good of a performance he gave.To see the true consequences of one man's hate, and at the same time, seeing that one man's hate tear apart his family---it's something that is not easily forgotten.

However, when I went on the internet and saw how good people said it was, I had to see it. I was memorized the entire movie.I have seen my share of Edward Norton movies, but not only was this one the best, but I have never seen one actor put so much emotion and care into one film. Edward Furlong also showed the best change in a performance that I have ever seen. This movie is fantastic, but I will admit, it is hard to watch at some times. How nobody won an Oscar for this film is beyond me. See this movie, you will not be disappointed, I guarantee it. I guarantee if you see this film, which is the greatest movie ever in my opinion, you'll say the same things I am saying. It doesn't matter if you are young or old, black or white, male or female, this is the best drama you will ever see.

Inspiring Story about Racism,"There is no need to remind you of the dark nature of this story. It's intense and violent throughout; the profanity is perpetually spread. But for those who admire the film, they admire in another angle. This is an interesting film that makes me reflect and inspires the way we think about this society.American History X is a story depicting a profound relationship between two brothers, and the family as a whole. It is a story about racism, a story of bravery and redemption. It shows the truth: sometimes it takes experiences to see the light, and sometimes it takes time and strength to overcome your past and mistakes. But it is also cruel in a sense, though it is the ultimate truth: even if you try so hard, your mistakes can still haunt you and the ones around you.Edward Norton shines like a diamond for his performance as the big brother with a dark past who strives to prevent his little brother from walking down the same path. Frankly it's easily one of the most outstanding performances I've ever seen in movies.This film has depth which one must explore and experience by himself. For those who can stand the intensity of the movie, it is definitely a gem to catch and remember.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Don't believe the HYPE read this....,"Much of the greatest pieces of art in the history if cinema rated lower than this, which tells me the moral message pulled on heart strings.It deserved a 6, why can't people be objective?Americans obviously have a more sensitive approach to race relations but there is a big world outside of the USA and we for the most part have come a long way.The transition from an evil ideology seems to have happened simply after watching a fellow NeoNazi do business with other races in prison, this quickly followed by a rape caused a humbling of the protagonist. The genre of this film is meant to be uber realism and this was not a likely path to redemption. Sorry if this was enough for you.There was no where near enough build up of hate between the younger kids which resulted in a high school slaying.The warmth between the prisoners on laundry duty was a missed opportunity, nothing of substance passed between the 2 of them to merit the benevolence.The score was great and the graphic violence was done very well, triggering raw emotions.Finally, affirmative action is mocked by many good people, politicians and social commentators all around the world without a racist bone in their body.

The two brothers having to fight the background that they come from and for Derek to realize,during his jail time that a human being is not judged by his color but by his soul which is colorless.

One Word 'Superb',"There are few movies that can bring tears to a man's heart and this is one of them. He doesn't cry because it's a love story, or because it's an utter tragedy, he cries because he sees the world for a moment and perhaps for the rest of his life through different eyes after watching this movie. I didn't even want to watch this movie because of the title. At first I thought a movie with an 'X', hhmm it might be about some twisted tale about Malcom X or people like him (ie. Nation of Islam before he left them). Then I read its about Neo-Nazis, and I felt like its now a racist movie on the other side of the spectrum. Either way I decided, watch it, learn what is really out there, no matter how much you may disagree with it. That was one of the best decisions I ever made.Not only is this movie based on a true story, but it makes us question ourselves. Are what we believe to be right and wrong so clear? Where do we draw the line? Where is it written that being white or black should automatically makes us enemies? This movie is deep. I fell in love with the cast, all of them, black and white, but most notably the main character 'Derek' and his little brother. Those two are an inspiration and all of us need to take examples from them.Whatever it takes, everyone in America, no, everyone in the World should see this movie. Absolutely Superb!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A uncompromised masterpiece.,"This movie is a masterpiece. From the beginning of the movie to the end you are always at the end of your seat changing your opinion of what is right and it shows both views and the danger that both can have on a society and the repercussions their are to hate. Unfortunately I can't think of a movie that relates to this one of the top of my head but even if I could none could stand up to this movie, it shows the brutality of what can happen when you let hate get a hold of your life and because I don't want to ruin the movie for you I won't tell you the end but I can tell you that if you let hate get a hold of you the angrier you get the worse your life will become if I may quote Edward Furlong, ""Hate is package and life is to short to be p***ed off all the time."" Also it shows you that there will always be people out there that will not listen to you no matter what you say or do. I personally think that this movie tells you that you should try to reach as many people as you can and to not compromise your views to try and reach someone that won't listen to you, that's there choice and there the ones that are going to have to deal with it not you. And if you know someone like that there is always time for them to redeem themselves, its never too late.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Powerful,"Edward Norton gives a powerhouse of a perfomance in this tense drama about race. Norton is a top member of a nazi gang who is sent to jail for three years for killing two black men tring to break into his house (one of the most powerfull moments shown in gripping black and white flashbacks). While in jail he befriends a black man, is raped in the shower and has his life comptly turned around by the time he is realeased. But upon arrival back home he sees that his little brother, played by Edward Furlong is going down that very same path and must save him before it is to late. Norton ignites the screen in his best performance to date. He gives ever line with power and emotion and Furlong is not far behind him. This film also contains one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen. It left me totally speechless. Although there sexual content is high and the profanity is never ending this movie will make you think twice about the society we live in. This movie is not for entertainment purposes and should be watched seriously so for anyone looking for a good thinkers movie this one is not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Waiting for Kaye's counter-punch...,"For a film that was clearly intended to be a jolting social commentary about the serious state of racial tension in contemporary America, I found it to be oddly lacking in any real dramatic `kick'. To be sure, it does have all the elements that should have added up to a classic tale of an `American Tragedy'---skinheads, guns, betrayal, and the final price of redemption---but somehow the end result seems all too neat and clear-cut (`black-and-white,' if you will) to be totally convincing.The acting, as advertised, was very, very good. Edward Norton did a fine job of rendering a believable (despite the shortcomings of the script) portrait of a troubled, yet bright and sensitive young man, and does deserve all the credit he has received. Having said that, I must say that it was the other Edward who really gave me a pleasant surprise. Furlong's role as Danny is by no means as showy as Norton's, but his performance was every bit as impressive. By bringing a rich mixture of quiet intensity and genuine sense of innocence to the role, Furlong has made Danny into someone very `real', someone you would actually care for---the sweet boy next door who's going through a rough, confusing period.Stacy Keach is one veteran who is always dependable, and in this film, he is chilling, dangerous, and oddly hilarious all at once. Good show for him! In fact, I liked everyone's performance with the exception of one: Avery Brooks as Dr. Sweeney. I do acknowledge the fact that he's supposed to be the strict-but-fair `guardian angel', and must therefore carry a certain measure of `weight of authority' in playing this role, but boy, there is such a thing called `overdoing it'. Frankly, he looked so stiff and uncomfortable that I began to suspect that maybe his suit was too heavily starched. It's a shame because Brooks is actually a good actor who hasn't been too lucky in getting meaningful roles such as this one.All in all, the film is a solid one, the superb acting compensating for the lack of depth in terms of story development. It is a well-known fact that director Tony Kaye tried to get his name off the whole project due to `creative differences'. I have no way of telling, but I vaguely suspect that he was aiming for a direction that would have been more in line with what I had expected to see in this film. It would be interesting if he decides to tell his version by releasing a `director's cut' at some point.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
This Film Is All About Edward Norton's Performance,"Edward Norton came out of nowhere in 1996 to deliver a trio of performances (in ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" and ""Primal Fear,"" for which he received an Oscar nomination) that left everyone amazed at his versatility. Then came 1998 and his beefed-up performance in ""American History X,"" that no one believed he could pull off and then won him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination. I think it's his performance, rather than the movie itself, that people have since reacted so strongly to. He's great, but the movie is a bit of a hot mess.Norton plays a skinhead who goes to prison for a vile crime and comes out a reformed man, determined to see that his little brother (Edward Furlong) doesn't go down the same path he did. But director Tony Kaye doesn't have a disciplined bone in his body, and the film has too much stuff constantly going on to give the story or its actors their due. It also doesn't help that Furlong, whose character we're supposed to be rooting for, is a vaguely unlikable actor who it's hard to warm to.If an actor who on paper looked to be more suited to the role than Norton had played the lead, I wonder if this film would have the cult following it does.Grade: C+",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Racism is a nonsense, all people are equal, like the teeth of a comb.","It is a very solid movie in terms of the message it gives and the processing of this message. They explained very well how terrible racism is. The script, acting and music were very good. Only Edward Norton did not manage to cry in acting only in the last scene. A type of movie you need to add to your list of movies to watch.But there are no disadvantages in the movie. Can't a movie be made without putting a sex scene in the movies? As soon as the movie starts, it begins with a distinctly erotic scene. There should not be such scenes in a beautiful film criticizing racism. In fact, not all films should have erotic scenes. It imposes bad things on people's subconscious. It could also be another scene instead of the disgusting bathroom scene that caused Derek's racist thoughts to change.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
An somehow overlooked subject breached by McKenna in a one hit wonder for himself.,"Originality must receive a ten on this film, cinema had barely scraped the surface of this subject when an exceedingly exceptional film came along and was mandated to forever hold the title of best Neo-Nazi film. Conceptual direction, writing, and directing are all superb, with effective and original use of black-and-white filming to rival that of Raging Bull. Cinematography was excellent, along with sound. Emotional build up ingeniously misdirected, to add for a real shocker. This is what a real depiction of deep familial turmoil and affection looks like, along with blind racism and prison life. Emotional themes are blind hatred, family love (especially brotherly), rebellion, with underlying tones of atonement, and a hint of depression. Acting is good overall with very good depictions from both Norton and previously unknown Brooks. Overall one of my favorite films of all time, and a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Brutal History X!,"American History X has one of the most compelling stories I've seen in movies in a while. It's a gut-wrenching, and heartbreaking story. But Tony Kaye's powerful and challenging direction is what made the movie so provocative.The movie also proves that Edward Norton has a huge talent that, unfortunately, has been wasted. Norton delivered the performance of his career in this movie. A performance that elevated the entire movie. While Derek Vinyard, Norton's character, has the most powerful lines in the movie, they wouldn't have been as powerful as they are without Edward Norton's staggering delivering.Also, Edward Norton's performance may be the only thing that remained sharp and solid throughout the whole movie. Because aside from Norton's riveting and smart monologues, the dialogue in this movie, especially at the first two acts, is so weak and often cheesy! The things got better at the last act but at that time I was wondering why the dialogue wasn't that good most of the movie. It's really baffling because the movie needed badly to have a decent and strong dialogue from its beginning, considering its subject matter. The dialogue often was too on the nose and preachy while it should have served its already gripping story. That also made some scenes in the movie feel so awkward and heavy-handed.The dialogue isn't the only, or the biggest issue I've with American History X. As I think that everything related to the Neo Nazi gang is completely underdeveloped. All the characters of the members of this gang are one-dimensional characters. They are totally undeveloped and bland, and almost have no depth. Which is a shame because they play a pivotal part in the story. They are part of the main plot, so to speak.Besides that balancing between two contradictory aspects of the story, Tony Kaye with his mixture of black & white history contrasting with colorful reality is magic to absorb and shows this film up to be what it is. Smoothly moving camera in the scenes in Black and White that are set in the past to convey an unsettling feeling, and bleak and restrained colored scenes to match the dystopian-like present.American History X also has one of the most shocking endings ever. But its ambiguity is what makes it more dreadful. It's an ending that can make you question the protagonist's fate, and that's more than horrifying!(8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Heavy-Handed Film that Fails to Convey Its Message,"The plot revolves around Derek, a former neo-nazi skinhead, who tries to prevent his younger brother, Danny, from going down the same wrong path that he did. Derek's journey is shown through flashbacks and present-day events, where we see how his life takes a drastic turn after his father's death.The movie's message is crystal clear: violence begets violence, and hate only breeds more hate. It's a poignant message, especially in today's world, where we see a rise in hate crimes and intolerance. The movie also highlights the impact of racism and how it affects not only the individual but also their loved ones.However there are some flaws in the story. For instance, the transformations of the characters are somewhat implausible. It's hard to believe that Derek could become a skinhead after one conversation with his father, and then suddenly renounce his beliefs after a conversation with a prison inmate. The storyline would require a monumental power of forgiveness, which stretches credibility.Moreover, the movie lacks subtlety and is heavy-handed in its delivery. The on-the-nose dialogue can be cringe-worthy at times, and the use of music is melodramatic. The basketball scene, in particular, seems like something straight out of a propaganda film. Also, the camera accentuates Derek's physique in some scenes, which seems unnecessary and distracting from the film's message.Despite its flaws, you could watch it one time as the movie does try to deliver a message.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

American History X is a great film,"Title: American History X Rating: R Director: Tony Kaye New Line CinemaRating: 8/10American History X is the tale of a Skinhead member, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton.)  Vinyard progresses to the top a local skinhead movement in their city, Venice Beach, California.  One night three black men try to break into Vinyard's car.  When Vinyard finds out that there are three black men outside trying to break into his car, he finds his gun and runs outside killing two of the three men.

I have never seen Edward Norton in a role like this.  It is fantastic!  He does an excellent job at portraying his character.  The film starts in black and white, a flashback.  The film then progresses to color, the present, and flips back and forth between the two.  The flashback sequences are done really well, and placed at appropriate spots.  The directing of this film was also done really well.  American History X surfaces racial issues and does a great job at portraying their reality. When the movie was finished I didn't feel too happy, but that was not the film's purpose.  Kaye did a fantastic job at pushing through the emotion that he wanted the viewers to get.

Well, he finds it with the help of Stacy Keach's character and it would have been interesting to see their initial encounter. This movie succeeds where lesser attempts (like Higher Learning) fail, probably because the film treats all of its characters, racists and non-racists alike as people (not an easy thing to do) and not just cardboard racial or social stereotypes. The dialogue is tremendous. I don't know why people here seem to have trouble with Derek's laundry co-worker, his dialogue is really so much more than simple jokes.

Genius,"This is by far the best movie ever made on racism and controversy. The reasons are pretty simple. The essentials are met - i.e. great cast, great acting, great directing etc. but more importantly, is the way the film dealt with the issue it explores and its opinions of it. At first it disects all the dynamic and sensitive emotions and reactions of a typical western/white race who's population is becoming increasingly racially integrated. This in itself is something people have wanted to put into film without it becoming more of a documentary. This film does that brilliantly. By the end, we have a very clever appreciation of why this happens and why racism is a failure of society. It is something that we deal with every day and that we all have an opinion on. This compromises most of those and seems to conclude with something every one can sympathize with - that it is a virtually uncontrollable situation, and that fear and confusion is the driving force behind it from all corners of the globe.It is certainly a film that I could watch over and over, and enjoy it more every time. It is leagues ahead of all films in its area and is certainly one of the best i have personally ever seen.

Not doing that would have been fine but since they did it, it really added a sense of darkness. It's the way he wants his life and his country, colorless, and it feels more depressing. All the acting was great, Edward Furlong, Ethan Suplee, Elliot Gould, everyone really gave believable and some of their best performances.I didn't add Edward Norton in that group because he deserves extra attention for his role. Its amazing. The way he gives his lines, his body language, his facial expressions, everything is remarkable. The scene in which he kills the man for breaking into his car for instance, the look on his face is terrifying, so much pride and anger and accomplishment all shown in that one look as the cops show up. There are scenes with him as a skinhead talking about how bad immigrants, jews and blacks are and you just believe that's how Edward Norton feels, cause he just sells it so well its hard to believe hes acting. Then, he gets out of prison and his thoughts have changed and again you believe everything he says. Personally I think the scene that he shines the most in is when he's yelling at his old friend Cameron at his party, telling him to stay away from him and his brother, that scene alone makes me wonder how he didn't win the Oscar that year.American History X is such an important film. In a time when many feel racism isn't as much of an issue anymore this film shows that it is still real and shows the terror that it can bring. Although I doubt any extreme racists have seen this film and changed their way, it seems like it should. Derek learns the errors of his way, and we see it happen. We see how terrible white people and black people can be, but we see how good they can be too. It shows how racism is just ignorance and stubbornness, not knowing about other races and not wanting to. Derek never really knew any black people, he just thought he did, when he finally starts talking to Lamont (the black man he works with in prison) he sees he's his only friend in that prison, not the other Nazis but a man who, before then, he would have wanted dead.American History X is one of my all time favorite films and I think most people would agree that its one of the best. Its drama at its best; moving, sad, gritty, powerful and beautiful. A must see by everyone10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The most powerful movie you will ever see,"A while back, my roommate and myself decided to see a movie with a mutual friend of ours; as we couldn't come up with an idea by ourselves that sounded interesting (Clerks and L.A. Confidential came up, but we had both seen those), we asked our friend if she could bring a movie that none of us had seen but that was supposed to be well-made.  Though a tall order to fill, I have to say she more than delivered when she brought American History X over.  It was powerful, brutal, beautiful, and compelling; the last type of movie most of us college freshman typically see with friends on a friday night. American History X follows the story of a young, brilliant, and very charismatic leader (stunningly played by Edward Norton) of a gang of Neo-Nazis in California, as well as his younger brother's (played by Edward Furlong) involvement in the same group.  I'm not going to tell you any more than that; one of the things I enjoyed most about it was that I knew nothing more than that, so the plot was truly captivating.  Not that it cannot stand on it's own; far from it!  To tell the truth, I had absolutely no interest in what I thought would be yet another p.c. movie hollywood decides to throw at its consumers of ""Racism is the ultimate evil""; it's one of those subjects that has been beat to death, which makes Tony Kaye's (the director) job that much more difficult. However, Mr. Kaye does so in breathtaking fashion.  Much like Memento (which, of course, came after X), a great deal of the film is told via flashback in black and white.  Many of the movie's most violent and compelling scenes are set to a powerfully dramatic, classical score that would simply come off as cheesy in any other film I can think of.  What all this does is sober you up, grab your attention by the throat and make you seriously consider what this movie has to say. And what it has to say is both easily comprehensible, and brilliantly correct.  Instead of portraying all Neo-Nazis as stupid rednecks, demonic villains or unknowing pawns, Kaye creates characters with real dimensions to them.  Most people would find it hard to believe, but it isn't long after the movie starts that you actually care about two young racists, and even understand where these young men come from.  Another brilliant move by Kaye and X's writer, David McKenna, was to present the logical, intelligent arguments that Neo-Nazis use, and precisely show where exactly those arguments are flawed.  Unlike most movies, Kaye actually has the balls to show Ed Norton arguing with a teacher from school against integration, and shows him winning the argument! Another important element of this film is the reason it is rated R: horrific violence.  What is so unfortunate is that many, many people will not see this film simply because of its graphic content, yet that is what makes it so horrifying, so gripping, and so mentally lasting.  It, along with Schindler's List, is a movie that everyone should see at some point in their life; after that, you probably won't ever want to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

speechless,"I wanted to see this movie from the moment I set eyes on the trailer. Regrettably I didn't get a chance to until now.  This movie was absolutely fabulous.  Ed Norton was completely amazing and Furlong was not far behind. Furlong has grown a lot as an actor and Norton continues to amaze me since the first time I saw him in Primal Fear.  The message here is an obvious one, but it is played out so well.  Some movies just entertain you, and others make you think as well.  American History X is certainly the ladder of the two.  The brutality of the film might be a little tough for some viewers to handle but, if you can get past it, it is well worth it.  Some of these scenes are the most powerful ones I have ever seen.

American History X,"Well,i believe that's how one should make a movie...No doubt , this is the best film i watched last month and probably one of the best i've seen so far.Edward Norton's remarkable play,( as we are all already accustomed, since many know his Fight Club,25th Hour roles ), as well as the script and the direction make it a great movie which makes one seriously meditate upon the racial problems. It is just one of those movies , which , after you've seen them , make you feel you're a new man:trying to think and question the inertia of social behavior and the cruel attitude people have towards some of their somehow different peers, let's say of different race or religion. Trying to be myself more open , twice thinking of the facts i hear about and the real value of the man next to me - this is the effect this good film had upon me. The story is sad and it makes me hate the way people cause terrible losses with their selfish and ignorant attitude. The Soundtrack is very good. Enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
live and let others live..,"This movie is being very meticulously made, and it is about the little vendetta of American white people vis a vis American black people. Movie tells that whites are really concerned about the violence, and bad things in every sector by the blacks. They sincerely think that it is the American black people which are deteriorating the American exchequer. Govt. is doing every single thing for them. And thus in the rebuke they carry on the skin head tradition. And thus equally participating with the blacks to make America.... not a good place to live. This movie rotates about one family and tells their story when protagonist moves to jail(before and after), the changes that term brought into the protagonist. This picture is a sort of preaching for the American audience and class for the non American ones. All the sequences in this movie are very realistic(although there aren't many). The story as I felt was not completed, as the protagonist had made a lot of enemies and deal with those enemies wasn't completed. so i give it 8/10. you can watch this movie, its good...",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
good movie,"""american history x"" shows us a young boy belonging to americas neo-nazis. the film shows us episodes of the past of this boy, how he got into all this. his brother was jailed for three years for shooting two blacks. now he comes out as a different man and tries to help his little brother out of the scene.the movie has excellent actors (edward norton is brilliant as the older brother). it is beatiful shot. the flashbacks are in black&white and very impressive. the music is very good - well they did everything well here and created a very good movie.I'm not from LA (where american history x takes place), and I can not say for sure how realistic the movie is. but I think they tried to make it as realistic as possible, and i suppose they did quite well.there are some violent scenes in there (but not many), so if you cannot handle violence in movies, this is perhaps nothing for you.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is a masterpiece,"This is the most intense film I have ever seen. My favourite actor is, and always has been Marlon Brando. After him, it's Kevin Spacey and Edward Norton, and a large void between them and any other actor today. This is the first movie I ever saw with Norton and I was blown away. Unfortunately, I only saw it on video, but I did not take my eyes off the screen for a moment. The movie is brilliantly made, but even so, Norton adds something to it, which I now know he adds to all his films, which makes it stick in your memory. And I am so glad that he did not sell himself out, by doing worthless movies- he is now about thirty and done only a handful of films. I am very much anticipating the film he is set to do with Brando in the future, THE SCORE, and if Norton, Brando and Spacey ever appear in a film together I guarantee it will be a masterpiece. Anyone giving this film any less than 8 out of 10 has cannot see brilliance when it presents itself so intensely.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Truly superb,"This is a brilliant film, but very disturbing.  Norton as the skinhead who sees the error of his ways is excellent in the role, notably his internal strife and his trying to guide his brother away from following him.The rest of the cast support him well in what is a truly frightening insight into a section of society that people don't talk about, but is there and needs addressing.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Suffering and Love,"Despite its many flaws, this is the most moving and challenging film I have seen in years.  It deals intelligently with a wide range of issues affecting society and the individual.  Racism being the most obvious, but also the need to take responsibility for our actions and do whatever is in our power to improve the world.  If this sounds trite, don't worry, the film avoids sentimentality well (mainly due to the fine performances) and shows that the weapons that change the world are suffering and love.  It is not afraid to raise questions that it leaves the viewer to answer, which can be frustrating, but ultimately more worthwhile.  Somehow it also manages to be highly entertaining, with a rich vein of humour running through it. Director Tony Kaye shows his advertising roots too much but that can be forgiven.  Not a perfect film, but certainly one that shows that cinema can deal with far more than car chases, bad sex and fart jokes.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Average, although grossly over-rated","I have seen this twice now, the first time was shortly after it's release. I thought highly of it when first released, Edward Norton was convincing in his role and the gritty violence portrayed in the film left an impression with me.Having seen it again and cast a far more critical eye upon it I would find it difficult to give it much more than a 6/10. The acting is above par but the story seems poor paced and the characters shallow.The basketball scene was one that I really didn't appreciate. Norton is elbowed early on by a black player (can you really blame him after Norton proudly displays his swastika tattoo), this is supposedly to make him the victim/hero of the scene. The crass triumphal music is supposed to raise us up with him as he and his white supremacist stooges triumph over the local 'monkeys'. Awful.Some proclaim Norton to be one of the finest contemporary film actors, personally I think they need to expand their frame of reference....",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A very good depiction of the lure and danger associated with hate groups.,"I thought that this movie did an excellent job of showing both the allure and the danger associated with hate groups.The director did an excellent job of showing how Cameron used Derek's anger at the loss of his father to gain influence over him.As bad as it sounds, you experienced the high when Derek won the court from the black youths.  In that instant, you can almost feel the pride that he had in gaining a ""safe"" place where white youths can play basketball.From there however, it is a quick ride back to reality as the events in Derek's life force him to see the flaws in his ideology and the bigger flaws in the other ""believers"".I thought that all of the characters were believable and the movie was edited very well.  I definitely recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Produces A Good Message,"I am a big fan of Edward Norton and something of a gangland researcher. I expected something of a ""gangster"" film as well as drama. Instead I got a drama, an anti-racism drama, that produces a well tailored argument.Racism is seen as one of the greatest United States problems. The issue dates back thousands of years. I think it is wrong, but that opinion is unable to be proved. Many people have fought for civil rights, such as President Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..Derick Vineyard (Edward Norton) was seduced into the world of Neo-Nazi skinheads as a teenager. His father was shot down in a black neighborhood while fighting a fire on a drug den. This tragic incident thrown him into a large amount of anger and also created a grudge with other races. Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) recruits him and uses his charisma and intelligence to brainwash other frustrated kids into the group. At the end of Derick's career as a skinhead, he brutally killed two African-Americans that try to steal his car and is imprisoned for three years. When he comes out, he is completely rehabilitated but his brother, Daniel (Edward Furlong) is going down the same path. Derick decides that he must stop his brother from going down that path before it is too late.Norton deserved his Oscar nomination for this film. There is no question about it. I have probably never seen a movie that produces such a good argument about the topic. It really shows the effects that racism has on a family.All of the acting is good. The supporting cast was solid. Avery Brooks and Beverly D'Angelo both did a great job.This movie made me see how bad racism is. I am not or was not a racist to start with but still shows you what the problems and causes are. I hope you, the viewer, see it the same way.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Terrifying film about American Neo-Nazis, full of violence, followed by redemption, but nauseating","It is doubtful whether this disturbing and horrifying film should ever have been made. It is nauseatingly violent, but then so are the kind of people it is based upon. No sensitive person should try to see this, as it is far, far too horrible. The violence is so sickening that it is intolerable. The entire project is of questionable integrity, even though in the latter half, some justification is offered when there is a major change of heart and mind by the lead character. Edward Norton, one of the world's most versatile film actors, gives another staggering performance, as does Edward Furlong as his younger brother. It is all very well done, but should it have been done, that is the question. This film portrays in a way no mainstream film has ever done the extremes and depths of racist hate cults, and we are left with nothing to speculate about as far as American Neo-Nazis are concerned. By the time you have sat through this, you have seen more swastikas than you could find in 'Triumph of the Will', but these are up close and personal, like Norton's tattooed on his chest. The scenes in prison are so far beyond appalling that we run out of shocked adjectives. If you ever wanted to know how Neo-Nazis think, because you just couldn't wait, here it all is. But have plenty of vomit bags handy. I am inclined to think that this is a piece of exploitation masquerading as a serious social and psychological study. Why not make a film about suicide bombers and decapitating people next? But why stop there? There is always bayoneting babies to move onto after that. Can this sort of thing be justified? The fact that it is a well-made film makes it worse. I think our 'need to know' is spurious, and that the people who made this film are all deeply, deeply sick, and should be ashamed of themselves. This film will only stimulate crazies to emulate the insane racists, and I bet tattoo artists get a lot more business after this. Also, the racist attitudes portrayed and statements made in the film are so disgustingly offensive that no one has ever plumbed such depths in a film, and I believe that such unspeakable evil should not be given publicity, and that such maggot-ridden and rotten things should not be brought out into the light. It is a fallacy to think that by showing them anything constructive can be achieved. Elliott Gould in the film looked shell-shocked at the horror of it all. I know how he feels. He should have walked out of the film, not just out of the house. What was he doing, lending his name to this?",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Must See,"Whether others tell you it's cliché or not, whether others tell you it's good or bad, this film is a must see.

Edward Furlong plays the part of Norton's brother, and with a strong supporting cast, this film will, WILL make an impression on you. Make your own decision on this film. Others have expressed that this movie is too cliché, too predictable, etc. Others say it is one of the most influential films of the 90's. Once seen, you will lean one way or the other, but my guess is that you'll lean towards influence. In my opinion, this film discusses race issues we still deal with today from a fresh perspective of a higher class of white supremacy, and does a spectacular job of offering life lessons without preaching about normal diversity and race related issues we often hear today in our schools, businesses, and media. Regardless of what people say, especially on this website, this film is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A provocative, intelligent, well-made film","It is always easy to poke holes in the the efforts of others. The more sincere and earnest those efforts are, the easier cynical critics find it to denigrate them.Nothing succeeds entirely and AHX certainly has a number of (minor) weaknesses that others have pointed out - primarily problems with the script. But where it fails it mostly fails because it tries to do something very difficult.There is a sincere attempt here to add a thoughtful and provocative comment to the important dialogue on bigotry and hate that is essential to human survival in an increasingly inter-racial, intercultural world. That Kaye and McKenna choose to end with a truism: ""hate is baggage"" - is not a cop-out, but a painful truth - hate is in us and only by dealing with our own hate can we deal with that around us.What is perceived as Norton's ""vanity"" is completely in keeping with the character - stemming from the same insecurity as his need to control and his racist self-aggrandisement. What else is the swastika tattoo, for instance, but a piece of vanity: primitive body-jewelry? His performance is daring, frightening and compelling if one is able to drop the defenses of cynicism and be moved by it. Ditto Edward Furlong's work.This is one of the best realised films by a first-time director and first-time screenwriter I can ever remember. Although imperfect, it is damn good.

American History X is a film about the negativity and worthlessness of hatred and racism.,"American History X is a film about the negativity and worthlessness of hatred and racism.Edward Norton who plays Derek, the proclaimed leader of a Neo-Nazi Skinhead gang in Los Angeles during the racially fueled time period of the Rodney King Trail, attempts to free himself and his family from the empire he has helped to create, after his release from prison. Derek's imprisonment which was caused by his role in the murder of two African Americans who were attempting to steal his vehicle yields him three years behind bars on manslaughter charges.Danny played by Edward Furlong, is Derek's younger brother who idolizes Derek after the death of their father. Caught in the same racist thinking traps, the film captures his racially fueled dialog and dramatic scenes to highlight the uncomfortable interactions he has with other races. Naturally Danny starts to grow closer to Derek's friends while he is in prison and begins to get noticed by the watchful eye of Cameron played Stacy Keach. Cameron, whose original vision helped Derek to organize and form the gang he led, is trying to recruit Danny through verbal manipulation in an effort to continue growing the organization.In the film the director uses a technique of switching from black and white to color as a way to delineate between past and present, while dramatizing the scene. As the film progresses, we notice Derek experience a great transformation away from racism, through the unlikely pairing of an African American prisoner (Lamont) played by Guy Torry, when they are both assigned to the same work detail. During the course of Derek's transformation he starts to understand that his chosen path only leads to destruction and the demise of his family. Faced with these new challenges upon release, Derek has to figure out how best to get his life back together along with his family. Derek comes home to less than optimal living conditions while mother, Doris played by Beverly D'Angelo is ill and can't afford to care for the family. Derek notices the toll his choices have taken on his family, more enlightened, Derek want nothing but a better life for his family to include his younger brother who is dangerously close to following wrong crowd, which leads to Derek's attempt to convince Cameron to leave him and his family alone.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Most powerful film of all time,"Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan were amazingly powerful movies, but neither of them equal up to the power of American History X.  This film made me really think hard about the racism in America.  Some people deny that there is still racism in this country, those people haven't seen American History X.  Edward Norton is a powerhouse in this movie, nobody could have close to pulling this off as well as he did.  Un forunately, he was up against Roberto Benigni for Life Is Beautiful, for the best actor award at the Oscars.  Edward Furlong comes out of nowhere and gives a brilliant performance playing his Norton's confused brother who is caught up in the whole Nazi mess that his brother used to be part of.  In my opinion, this was the best film of the year.  It deserved nominations for sound, score, editing, cinematography, original screenplay, supporting actor (Furlong), director, and the coveted best picture award, which it should have won.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

one of the best movies out there!,"this movie is really brain damaging! it will keep blocking your mind the entire day after you've seen it! it is so powerful and abundant in contradictory conceptions on very delicate things that it will put you both in the pro and in the con category. it says things that are extremely true and it tries to show in the end that, no matter how revolted and enraged you are, you just can't do much and things are not so simple. it's in a way an analysis of the system and the discrimination and crimes of the so called 'democracy' and 'human rights' characteristics of our world. it really shows you how humans think under good leadership and how easily our minds change after personal experience and how our mistakes are always payed back in full. it shows the bad parts of being and thinking extreme, like the Nazism conception, and also the bad things of supporting a democratic society. it is a true masterpiece, a movie that makes you think a lot about things that you considered or taught that they are horribly wrong and makes you realize that things are not as simple as you thought!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

YET ANOTHER HIGHLY OVERRATED FILM,"After seeing this, I could understand why the director wanted his name off the credits.  Ed Norton is way over the top, and hardly worthy of award consideration for his performance.  In fact the best work (as usual) is by veterans Stacey Keach and Beverly D'Angelo.  The best scene in the film is the usual prison shower rape, which is very funny, especially Norton's reaction to it.  In fact this whole film is more inadvertantly campy than I expected.

"If the dog is dangerous, it must be put to sleep.","I've read other comments and I think most people don't get the idea. Everybody writes ""This movie shows us that violence is not the way to deal with..."". In my opinion that's the mildest version of what this movie shows us, because American History X is about reality and in real life , if a dog bites you, you have to react. Nobody can sit and watch while their brothers, sisters, sons or daughters get wasted in the street. I think that every man would react violently to that. It's just that it doesn't happen to everyone.In other words, this movie shows us that it doesn't matter if you run, hide, or even if you try being nice to it, the rabid dog will try to bite you. So the only option is to fight for your life and for your family.I think this is Ed Norton's best role since Primal Fear. He is truly a Neo-Nazi and he leaves the impression that he believes in his preachings. The only part I couldn't get was Norton's 180 degree turn in prison. I mean, a man of his beliefs wouldn't just start crying in front of his sworn enemy and then give up all his life's ideas just because of a rape.All that said, I still rated this movie 10, because it's a true story of men and dogs.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Absolutely brutal,"Any film that engages with issues as sensitive as neo-Nazism and racism have to either go hard or go home. American History X definitely goes hard. It is absolutely relentless in its depictions of violence. It forces the viewer to confront the harsh realities of experiencing racial abuse as a black person. There's no hiding from it in this film.Edward Norton was great in the lead role. Whilst his character is initially a disgusting man, his transformation and story arc were believable. That being said, I don't think that Edward Furlong was anything special.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/6AJGpx",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Almost flawless,"This film is a gem and a rather intelligent and poignant story. Extremely gripping and almost has educational value: I would not object to schools showing this to kids in the mid-teens.But I have three complaints (the last two cost it one star).First, Ed Norton being overlooked for the Oscar for his performance in this film simply goes to show you what a ""wank"" the Oscars really is. I'm sure that Roberto Benigni's performance in ""life is beautiful"" would have been terrific, but I'm prepared to hand the Oscar to Norton without even seeing Life is Beautiful for one simple reason: transformation. Acting a character who's personality and eccentricities are constant (eg.. Forrest Gump) is not nearly as difficult as playing a character who starts out as one type of person and transforms gradually to another throughout the film. Norton performs this to a tee and is, to date, the most under-rated actor to grace Hollywood - (did anyone else see his top-notch performance in the People vs Larry Flynt?) Second, there is an unnecessary addition to the story. At the end of the film, Norton walks his brother, Danny, to school and they stop off at a diner. Then the school principle and another guy rolls in and tells Norton that some of his old neo-Nazis mates were beaten up last night and he needs to re-infiltrate the group. Norton was protesting saying that his old ""friends"" are probably looking to do him in. I didn't really understand how this fitted into the story. What exactly were they trying to achieve with this extra piece of story that seemed somewhat out of place or superfluous to the film? All I can think is that they were re-iterating the fact that Norton won't so easily walk away from his old life, but this still seems unnecessary to me.Third, I think the film was just a bit too peachy pie in some respects. From the moment that he starts folding sheets in jail with the likable and funny black guy, you know that somehow these two are going to strike up a friendship and this will play a pivotol roll in helping Norton to ""see the light"" and turn his life around. But the problem is that everything just happened too perfectly. First, he is raped by his neo-nazi friends for dissin' them and playing basketball with black guys. Just didn't seem to be credible in a way, but then again, i've never been in prison and shared a cell with Ben Dover and Bob Downe. Nonetheless, the fact that the neo-nazi's raped him instead of another ""group"" of inmates makes his ultimate rejection of neo-nazi ideology all the more.... ""perfect."" I'm not a neo-nazi advocate by the way. But what about this: after he diss's the neo-Nazis, they no longer protect him and in turn, he is beaten and raped by some random guy. See that is credible! But the writers desperately wanted him to be raped ""by his own"" so that his rejection of them and his transition to being a ""good and accepting"" person is peachy pie perfect.I also found that the shooting of Danny at the end of the film was partly an attempt to ensure that the film doesn't have too much of a peachy pie perfect ending. As a result, I felt like there was something too deliberate about it and come to think of it, I think that the scene in the diner with Norton (as I mentioned above) was probably a distraction, so that we were more surprised by the fact that Danny was shot only a few minutes later. Even if I'm wrong, it seemed a bit too contrived and cost it a star.Otherwise, brilliant film",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
An earthquakes of thoughts,"American History X is a literal ""punch in the stomach"" against racism and in-tolerances. I saw it twice to ""correct"" the impressions I had the first time I watched it, but still make me consider this movie good but not convincing.The perfect script makes the dialogs fluid and entertaining, but also rich in the contents. Political debates seem real, as the director would deliver to us the ""gross weight"" of the words, confiding we'd make the right ""tare"" with our conscience. The boy Danny had a role I loved. He's probably the best actor in the movie, showing a teen-ager under the influences of a brother and mother with opposite minds, but (thanks to his age) both equally beloved, beyond political visions.Derek's redemption is badly portrayed. There is not a single reason because he should change his life INSIDE the fascist club, unchaining brawls and wounding the boss. The ""conversion"" of his brother on the stands is too quick and widely unrealistic. Also, performances by Brooks and Suplee are really really bad.The 2 hours go away rapidly when you like meaningful stories, but the shocking ending doesn't get a gram of relief. Probably it's a movie crafted for an American audience and something was lost in translation. Anyway, a minute after you've entirely watched it, an earthquake of thoughts invades your mind, with a unusual yearning to share and measure your own points of view with the others'. That's the best quality of American History X, inviting to take courage and sides on an argument, immigration and tolerance, concerning every single First World nation.Vote: 23/30",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Edward Norton is astounding, and just when you thought Edward Furlong had disappeared into obscurity, here he is, a fine young actor. The film is flawed, however.  I find some parts a little hard to swallow, but these are minor gripes when there is so much here which is amazing.

"Watchable, but heavy-handed","There's a strong performance from Edward Norton in 'American History X', a film about racial tensions; but also some heavy-handedness. The personal development of the characters is depicted in a rather deterministic fashion; Norton's Nazi is far more eloquent than any real-life fascist, while Avery Brooks' teacher is blessed (in a clichéd and patronising gift so often granted to black characters) with unsurmountable gravitas. The direction is also rather obvious, with solemn voice-overs, an over-the-top score, and the needless use of black-and-white photography to differentiate the recent past from the present. While the underlying squalor, and drug abuse, that promotes gang violence, is hardly shown at all. Norton makes it watchable; but it's all rather obvious.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Weak Movie............About A Strong Subject,"This is a movie....full of meaning ....that, in the final analysis is meaningless. It often tastes like sugar candy, and yet again, like Scotch Whisky. There are periods of sick....racism....but that never appears to be real. The key scenes when the Edward Norton character faces up to the Stacey Keach big boss Nazi horror....are under-developed. If your going to make a movie about black / white neo racism you need to come up with something better than this. This was made in 1998 and it feels like 1962. This is a film that means well...to expose the nastiness of colored hatred, yet it never comes near explaining the reasons, why blacks and whites....just do not get along.

"Heart wrenching, the least","Down here in Asia, Cinematic Artforms are regularly being diluted and I regret saying that I had the opportunity to watch this film from an ""illegal"" source. I am still wondering whether this modern day introspect of human violence and neo-Nazism will ever make it to Local cinemas, just like the many-a-great films that were banned and/or suffered under the unkind treatment dished out by the Board of Censors.Ed Norton was very believable in the portrayal of a ultra-violent Neo-Nazi - turned savior of his family but how many of these characters in real (and not reel) life can we actually claim are successful after going through numerous correctional/penitentiary facilities? Edward Furlong on the other hand reprises his brooding nature (a young James Dean?) and can very well beat the other ex-child star (Leo in ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"").In all, a tragic ending that leaves audience brooding.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
great movie,"One of my top 3 movies if not my favorite. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong give flawless performances and are very believable. I like how they portrayed Norton as a white supremacist. Not as a redneck but as a normal guy whose life is changed by a dramatic event, which leads him to join a skinhead group and later challenges his beliefs. Although the movie is brutal and very graphic, It goes along with the plot unlike some slasher movie just about gore. There is a reason to the violence and it shows during the course of the movie. This movie is not for the easily offended but I would recommend it to anyone that appreciates good cinema and enjoys films that make you think.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

What I also like about this film is that the film-makers rely on the audience, that they understand the film (wich is quite easy, but still).

Disappointed,"I have to say that for all the hype I heard before seeing this movie, I was greatly disappointed in it. Although Edward Furlong, and Edward Norton play strong roles in this film, there was just something missing in the story to explain the sudden life affirming changes in Norton's character. I don't buy that his little bit of jail time could change his apparently strong hatred and negative emotions to his rival race. There just wasn't enough character involvement, or educational development in his character to believe that he could make such a wise decision. We are led to believe that he is a very smart, and charismatic leader, in forming and running his own ""white supremecy"" group, yet it all comes to a grinding realization when he spends some time in jail with a few black people, and sees how his own ""supremist"" group deals on an even keel with all of the other races in prison. I think this movie had so much more to offer, and started off on the right track, but just went flying along on that track too fast, and missed out on some issues that should have been dealt with on the characters level. I give it a 5 out of 10...but could have been easily an 8 or 9 if only character development wasn't rushed along so fast.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Academy should be ashamed of itself.,"The Academy should be ashamed of itself because it no longer awards the best movies and the best actors, and ""American History X"" couldn't more obviously illustrate that point. The Academy was afraid to accolade American History X because it dealt HONESTLY with the issue of racism.There is one feeling that addicts us to movies, and the theater for that matter; it is that poignance that places us in an almost euphoric trance where we appreciate the and feel the movie more after we have seen it than during seeing it.

Highly symbolic and relevant film,"American History X adds dozens of symbols to a very controversial topic, and the result is a surprisingly good flick.

On the outside, his brother, played by the young Edward Furlong, is following the same tracks.Edward Norton is deserving of all of the credit and Oscar nominations he has received.

Anything starring Edward Norton is bound to be a very emotional and superbly acted film.American History X is filled with many very small symbols that help the transition of the story.

"Moving and Thought Provoking, Harshly Realistic","I saw American History X last night, and I enjoyed it very much.  The story is compelling, and the characters are mostly real.The subject matter is both disturbing and thought provoking as we confront the real world struggles of a working class white family and their frustrations as they view their quiet safe neighborhood being overrun by ethnically-based gangs, while the same racial groups are given preference through federally mandated affirmative action programs.  There's a grain of truth in the hate-based movements, which is part of what makes them so dangerous; and angry invective in response does not diffuse it.Edward Norton is vivid and complex in his role of a confused and conflicted teen who expresses his inner turmoil through the vehicle of a neo-nazi white supremist movement.  He succeeds brilliantly in being at once revolting in his rhetoric, frightening in his actions, yet real and reachable and still human.Edward Furlong does an adequate job of portraying Norton's adoring younger brother, through whose eyes the story is told.  But his adoration is so complete that he seems uninvested in his beliefs, and the character falls short of being a real person in the movie, and seems fairly uninteresting. I think Edward Furlong has a lot of potential -- he has a vulnerability that reaches out and makes me want to care about him; but too often he comes off as unemotional, too much like a stereotypical slacking teenager.It was a pleasure to see Avery Brooks (Benjamin Cisco of ST:DS9) in the role of Dr. Bob Sweeney, principal of the high school and the champion of civil rights in the film, who takes a personal interest in the boys and acts as their counselor.Elliot Gould was also outstanding in his role as a liberal teacher at the high school, who has a romantic entanglement with the boys' mother, played by Beverly D'Angelo.Beverly D'Angelo played the role of the mother probably as well as could be expected, but I was disappointed with the depth of character exploration they afforded her.I won't spoil the end for you, but I found it to be a little dissatisfying: ironic and realistic, perhaps, but not particularly helpful to the discussion.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's like that in schools, countries and even prisons where you are told what to believe, what to think and what to feel (Famous words of Tony Montana) and it makes you realize that you have to be a free spirit to get along in this world.
