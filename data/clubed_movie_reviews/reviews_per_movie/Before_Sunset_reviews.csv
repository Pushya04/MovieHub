"Linklater, Delpy & Hawke make an impossible sequel work (including minor SPOILERS)","""Before Sunrise"" was one of the most beautiful independent love stories of the 90's. Part of its appeal came from the open ending. We didn't know how the lives of these two young people would continue and what would become of them. The whole movie was like a snapshot that left the rest to our imagination. A sequel to such a story seemed to be unnecessary, but apparently director Richard Linklater himself couldn't stop thinking about these two intriguing characters and had to envision their lives after this one fateful day in Vienna.Here it is now, the most unlikely sequel I have ever seen, ""Before Sunset"" - made not for money but for pure artistic purpose only. Much of the magic of part one could have been destroyed, but somehow Linklater and his two main actors managed to pull it off. ""Before Sunset"" takes place nine years after Jesse and Celine first met and as soon as the movie starts you feel like you meet old friends you haven't seen in a long time. You know these people and immediately feel at home with them. I was afraid that ""Before Sunset"" might give answers to questions that shouldn't be answered in the first place. If ""Before Sunrise"" was a dream that two young people had, then this movie could only be the rude awakening, the confrontation with reality. And somehow it is just that. It's a bit disillusioning to hear that all did not turn out as well as one might have imagined. We learn that Jesse and Celine are not particularly happy in their lives and that they are not really the romantic persons they used to be nine years ago. The soothing thing to see, however, is that they are still here. They both have passed their 30th birthday, they have jobs and their future is more or less decided, but they're still longing for passion in their lives and as soon as they meet each other, it's there again. They might have given up a lot of their dreams and beliefs but one thing remains true: their feelings for each other. While they're talking it's like they turn back time and become the young, hopeful people they once were again. I'm getting a bit carried away, but that's the beauty of these two movies, ""Sunrise"" and ""Sunset"". The story sucks you in and you're not able to stop thinking about it for a long while.Another thing ""Before Sunset"" did, it made me reflect on my own life. How have I changed in the past nine years? What has become of my dreams? Obviously, I have gotten more cynical, because at times I was irritated by Celine's talk about environmental problems and her emotional outbursts. It took me way longer than last time to ""bond"" with her character this time around.Anyway, the performances by Hawke and Delpy are wonderful once again. Their acting is as natural as can be, and thinking of Hawke's recent divorce in real life you wonder how much of his character in the movie is based on his own personal experiences.Unfortunately, the movie is over way too soon. After about an hour you have already arrived at the final scene - a scene that is just amazing. It makes you hope that somehow everything will work out for Jesse and Celine and that maybe they will stay together this time. As part one, ""Before Sunset"" doesn't have a definite ending, though.It's sure nice to see that apparently Linklater cares about Jesse and Celine as much as I do and made such a good sequel. He could probably even make a third part. ""Before Sunset"" has convinced me that it could work.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Life as few know it,"I'm a movie lover. That first thing said, i have to recognize that i'm really hard on movies, and i usually discard many of them for being under-prepared, for so many errors and things like that. But with ""Before Sunset"" i felt different. We all know movies are just fakes: what happens, what we see is not the real life. It's just a construction. It's just somebody imagination becoming a visual media. But when i was watching this movie, i didn't felt that. I was seeing real people, with real problems and having thoughts, and fears and hopes. It's the most real acting i ever saw. All about it is just perfect: the ambiance, the set, the city, even the apartment we can see at the near end. Every piece of the movie was connected, and you can tell a whole story about the characters just for hear them, or seeing the way they talk, the things they said, the music they chooses or the things they have. In that way of thinking, i found this movie inspirational, a well-made piece of life, and incredibly deep and wide film. I think this is a portrait of life as only a few can know, of all the shadows and lights we all share.So, i really recommend it, even if you didn't saw the first one.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The only problem...,"...is that it ends. This is a fantastic film. It joins the handful of movies where I think I liked the sequel even more than the original, although I liked 'Before Sunrise' as well. Where Sunrise captured the immediacy and urgency of perfect youthful love, Sunset reflects beautifully on the aftermath of that perfection. I remember a line that says ""nothing that is complete breathes"", and I think that is what we see in this film. A perfect connection with another human is a blessing and a curse; having experienced perfection a part of us stops breathing, unable or unwilling to mar the perfection of that memory.The dialogue is amazing, the acting is spot-on; this is a great film. In some ways it felt more like reading a great novel than watching a movie, in that I really felt like I knew the characters and was sad the movie had to end. Kind of like saying goodbye to an old friend. If you are an action movie kind of person, skip this flick because it will bore you to tears. If, on the other hand, you like good dialogue, well formed characters, and aren't quite jaded enough to have given up completely on the idea of true love, don't miss this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"How do you make a sequel to ""Before Sunrise""?  This is how.","I'd been longing to see this one as I'd always thought 'Before Sunrise' was one of the most honest, most real films I'd ever seen, but at the same time I held off seeing the sequel from fear of disappointment. For all of you in the same position, fear not ; Linklater, Hawke and Delphy (for it has surely been a joint effort and labour of love for all three) have done us and themselves proud. I've just seen the film and despite being male and 38 I feel like Roberta Flack must have felt when she penned 'Killing me Softly' after hearing Don McLean sing 'Vincent' in concert; this is - once again - just so close to what it's all about. You want technicalities? The acting, superb; Hawke and Delphy slip right back into their characters, their mannerisms, their sometimes gauche repartee, the way they seem to fence around each other, seeming to go in for the kill then feigning, drawing backExquisite. And then the details, the echoes of the first film in the settings but now with a world-weariness, an autumnal note and yet with still that fundamental freshness and optimism that revives the memories of Sunrise's youthfulness and reminds us, as our heroes discuss, that though time changes people, there remains an unchanging core. Just see it; this is about as good as it gets, folks.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"So Little Time, So Much Love.","Before Sunset is one of those movies, you either love, or you hate.Personally, I loved it.Now, I recommend watching ""Before Sunrise"" first, however it isn't necessary. Before Sunset does a good job of reviewing what had happened, therefore if you decide to watch it Before watching ""Sunrise"" you have nothing to worry about.Some scenes are extremely well done. The characters are picture perfect, and the movie itself, is breathtaking. The aura of the movie is so spectacular, that it will inspire young directors out there, to pick up their video cameras are start filming.An 80 minute movie, about two lovable characters and what they have to say, may sound boring. But the way it's done in Before Sunset, will sweep this impression right off your feet.Julie and Ethan play two of the most honest and true characters I have ever seen, they are known as Jesse and Celine. And while much of the credit must go to the characters themselves, you musn't forget the actor and actress who played them.Julie is perfect as Celine. The young french actress is so natural in front of the camera. Definitely, has potential.Ethan is also very very honest, he seems so comfortable character that that you forget your watching a movie, and not a home-made video.Both play with such honest expression, and such trueness, that they are so natural, Before Sunset becomes no longer a movie. It feels as if you are eavesdropping on two extremely developed people. It's such an intimate environment, that you never want to leave.Before Sunset... 9.901/10*****",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Objectively good,"I appreciate the craft of this movie, especially the continuity. It's an objectively good movie. But.. I can't say I enjoyed it that much. The characters seemed written to be realistic - but too much realism made them unrealistic. This was a mentally bumpy ride for me.Like, did people actually talk like this in 2004, in prose with several random sexual plugs? Their dynamic has tension and chemistry, but what do they see in each other? Jesse is terribly cringy and un-charming, while both self-absorbed and self-deprecating. He had the grace of youth as the excuse in Before Sunrise. I was expecting he would mature in the 9 years before reencountering Celine, but nope! Celine is no saint either, lying directly to Jesse on occasion, but she has more likabilities. But maybe thats what this is all about: two flawed humans fall in lust. An imperfect love forms through space, time, and imagination.How imagined or pure is the connection with someone you've spent about 24 hours in 10 years with? I guess we'll see in Before Midnight..",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow! Satisfying at so many levels,"I had not seen the prequel to this although my date had and she filled me in on many details. While the experience of this film would be enriched by having seen the preceding film first, it certainly stands satisfactorily alone.In many ways, this reminded me very much of one of my most favorite movies of all time, ""My Dinner with André,"" in which just 2 characters talking comprised the whole movie. In that movie, the friends had been close, drifted apart, and then had a brief reunion at a dinner at which they caught up with what the other had been doing. The two principals, André Gregory and Wallace Shawn, played themselves and each represented one side of a dialectic, say the side of romanticism vs. a conventional reality. ""Before Sunset"" is parallel in many ways.At one level we have a romantic story -- two people who'd briefly been lovers nine years before and lost touch meet again. They spend an afternoon together. Will they try to fulfill what they'd started?At another level, we have the charm of conversation and exploration, of reminiscing, of gradually feeling out and discovery of how much do I have in common with this person now? -- where has this person been? -- what are they capable of now? -- how much freedom of choice do I have, does this other person have -- to make decisions? Etc.While Celine and Jesse have a capacity for relating and talking, they also have somewhat opposite ways of viewing the world and relationships -- Celine is more cynical and reserved; Jesse is more open to settling for the ""not-perfect-but-good-enough.""There are possibly a few people who have not had the personal experiences that at least somewhat relate to the premise in this film -- a relationship in which one wonders, ""what would have happened if I'd pursued that relation?"" but probably most people have. And the other dilemma, of meeting again that someone but by now being involved in relationships of responsibility -- my family, my children, my present life. What would it do to them if I were to pursue my own happiness at the expense of them? Can I do that? Can I value the chance of my own happiness above theirs? Etc.The film, fortunately, gives us no answers to these essential questions but it does pose them in a way that makes us consider them.Delpy and Hawke are given screenwriter credits and I feel sure that they must've contributed a great deal to the feeling of seamless, natural dialogue.GREAT movie. No movie satisfies everyone, of course, but at the time I wrote this, slightly over 50% of the voters gave it a 10/10. For those of us in that group, it's a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably one of the best sequels I have ever seen.,"The dialog is considerably more believable, the characters are deeper, the emotions are stronger and the viewer's connection with the characters is more intense. Ethan Hawke is better, Julie Delpy is better, Richard Linklater is at his best.It is outstanding to watch both Jesse and Ethan Hawke grow as a normal guy on a quest for happiness and an actor who has improved a lot since the first part, respectively. Julie Delpy's performance left me in awe in scenes where she describes her frustration with her sub-par love life, whereas 10 years ago her lines seemed emotionless and routine. Richard Linklater takes themes he would only touch superficially in the first part, and dives into them in the second part, much like how the characters are more callous and realize they have nothing to lose anymore.I must admit the first part did not impress me. I was enthralled by the excitement of the young adults' spontaneous romance in Vienna, but it all seemed so dreamy and stereotypical of how love should be. Well, I realize now that this is exactly what it was supposed to be. It was love in every meaning of the word: heightening, inspiring, and painful. It wasn't until I saw Before Sunset that all this dawned on me. The way Jesse and Celine look back at the time they shared 9 years ago, how beautiful their one night was together, how their lives have changed, and they contemplate what could have been, Linklater portrays not only a story of true love, but life in itself and it's never-ending series of ups and downs.I couldn't help but try to walk in Jesse's shoes in my own life 9 years down the road and wonder if I will make the same decisions. Is it inevitable that you wish you would have done things differently? Will ever I connect with someone the way Jesse and Celine do? Is it fair to measure happiness circumstantially? All these are questions Linklater makes us think about while witnessing a love that just doesn't ""fizzle out"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I appreciate it, but I don't like it.","I appreciate Before Sunset for what it is -- a sequel made nine years after the original, set nine years after the original, starring the same two actors and following up on the events of the original -- but that does not mean I liked it. The conversations in this film were not as interesting as the first movie, and I did not want the two romantic leads to get together anymore. Yes, it feels very realistic, but who wants to listen to people complain about their life and their marriage for over an hour?",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A great movie, and a nice break from most Hollywood trash.","This is simply one of the best movies I've seen, with very few qualifications. Maybe I should say that this is one of the best ""simple"" movies I've seen. Perhaps it is a bit like cooking, use fresh and quality ingredients and you can make something great without a lot of unnecessary stuff. Unfortunately, Hollywood just doesn't seem to have the ambition to make these type of movies anymore.In any event, this is one of the few sequels that matches the intensity and integrity of the original. First, it has many simple, yet stylish and honest shots. Perhaps the Scorcese shot is used too much (i.e. following the actors on a long walk without cutting a la Goodfellas kitchen scene), but I don't think so because it makes sense in the context of the movie. Second, many of the shots have interesting emotive effect. For instance, towards the end of the movie, after these ""lovers"" are fighting the clock (because Ethan Hawke's character needs to catch a flight) and are cruising down the river, they are so engrossed in their conversation and the fact that they are trying to get so much out of the last few minutes they don't notice their ride is coming to an end. However, we the viewer can see what the characters either don't see or don't want to see, that the boat is crossing over the river to its destination and the departure no one wants to deal with. The viewer is given a wonderful sense of dread as the bank approaches in the background, because we know what is going to happen when the ride ends, and like the characters, we don't want it to end either. Even if the film borrows heavily from other great movies (e.g. My Dinner with Andre) it is independent of those influences.Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke were great per usual. Making the dialogue ring true is difficult, but they pull it off. As before, they completely capture the nature of the intimate and friendly conversational style of friends or lovers that is normally edited out of most movies. When people talk, things are not always sequential or rationale, and unlike most movies this movie doesn't try and correct that. Not for a moment does the audience find themselves thinking that this is some sort of charade and no one would ever talk like that. The dialogue is intelligent and insightful, but that is because the characters are intelligent and have a knack for being brutally honest with their thoughts and feelings.This is movie excellence, and I'm glad some film makers are still trying to make art. Despite the romantic themes this isn't a date flick, so be prepare to deal with the difficult and often unresolved issues of love and relationships that arise.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pure Delight,"Nine years on Celine and Jessie meet in Paris not entirely by destiny or sheer force of circumstance... Nine years ago I loved Before Sunrise so much! And identified with it even though I was far from home not out of choice - and a war of the kind that bothered Celine in Bosnia was going on in my own country... But I was young. I was 24, actually, very romantic and innocent. Now I Know how things work a little better. The world, relationships. But I'm still plunging into causes for their own sake. And I'm still a reasonably normal person. Just like the characters in this film. Paris has never looked simpler in its casual elegance. Dialogue has never seemed more natural. A script never touched real life like this one so effortlessly. I'm in love with these characters - and with the ending... This is how European Cinema used to be - and Hollywood, too for that matter. Naturally real and magical in the details.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just great,"A sequel to the 1995 film ""Before Sunrise"". Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and  Celine (Julie Delpy) meet 9 years after their initial meeting. They've  changed--originally they were in their 20s and full of idealism. Now  they're in their 30s--and their lives have changed in ways they didn't  predict. Like the first movie they walk around Paris this time and talk about love, life, reality, what  might have been--and it's all fascinating. Like the first film this is  basically a character study and (like the first) just incredible. It's  like catching up with old friends after 9 years apart! They've aged a  lot--Hawke looks TERRIBLE but Delpy looks OK--and life has thrown both  a few hard knocks but hearing how they survived and what they went  through is just incredible.   This is NOT for everybody (four people walked out when I went to see  it) but, for people who can deal with nonstop talk for 80 minutes it is  just great. Every single line rings true and is delivered full force by  Hawke and Delpy. The acting varies--Hawke is good (but he smiles WAY  too much)--Delpy is just superb all the way through.  This is easily one of the best films of 2004. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lovely romantic story,"I saw this movie with my husband. He is usually a die-hard fan of action thrillers, special effects and horror movies but he allows me to coax him into seeing a really thoughtful movie every once in a while. So this was my choice for the evening. Neither one of us had seen the first movie, ""Before Sunrise"", although I knew of it by reputation. Well, my husband absolutely loved the movie! He sat up and became totally engrossed in the story, frequently patting my hand at intervals as he identified with the the characters in the story. He forgot about the dreadful uncomfortable movie seat. He let up a big sigh of disappointment when the credits came up... Personally, I grew up in Paris, France, I came to the US for graduate studies and I had an environmental protection career for 20 years. So I could strongly identify with Celine, a young woman of French origin with a patina of US graduate schooling and a career in environmental protection work. Her vulnerability shines through her modern chatterbox exterior. The acting is absolutely superb, with the intimate extended conversations drawing us into the characters' lives. Certainly, this movie can stand on its own. For Jesse and Celine, the opportunity to pick up once more their romantic relationship is here! A smart couple would not let the moment pass. I doubt that they would just have a quick passionate affair... I think that the characters already know how lonely their souls can be without true love and commitment and they are emotionally ready to grasp this chance of a lifetime. They have been around long enough to know how rare their type of romantic feeling and connection can be. They will cherish their unique relationship and nurture it forever. My husband and I agreed that the movie could only be watched by couples of ""a certain age"", rather than young couples still searching for life's meaning. Only people who have lived through the throes of searching for a lifelong mate, then living through the disappointments and joys of struggling relationships, can recognize and appreciate what true love is and how important it is to go with one's heart and seize the moment.I am 48 years old and have a wonderful romantic relationship with my husband. We are each other's first and only love. Even so, we have worked very hard to keep our marriage alive and mutually passionate. Over the past 25-30 years, both of us have noticed that satisfying relationships are very difficult once people hit their thirties and forties. We have noticed that many older couples never work out their differences and end up bitter and disappointed with life. Many acquaintances of our generation are divorced or still single, never having experienced the sweetness and stability of a true romantic and committed relationship. Romance can be found all the time, from fleeting moments to short-term relationships. One sees it all over the place nowadays, in TV shows and movies, as well as in most modern relationships. However, I would like to emphasize the lasting contentment that a loving commitment brings to one's soul. This is a rare and unique blessing that is missing from too many relationships nowadays, and I find this immeasurably sad. This is a classic movie (excellent story line and top of the line acting) which goes into my list of top romantic movies of all times.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rich Dialogue and Romance: Better With Its Backstory,"Decided to watch this on a whim, not realizing it was the second act of a larger story I hadn't started yet. The film itself is beautifully shot, capturing the essence of Paris in a way that's both romantic and utterly realistic. The dialogue between Jesse and Celine is intense, filled with the kind of conversations you'd have with someone you deeply connect with, but not having seen 'Before Sunrise' first, I felt like I was missing a piece of the puzzle. Their chemistry is undeniable, and the way they talk about life, love, and what could have been is captivating, making me wish I knew what led them here.Giving 'Before Sunset' a 7/10 because, even out of context, it was a compelling watch. The natural flow of the conversation and the real-time unfolding of their afternoon together creates a unique cinematic experience. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that the emotional depth and nuances of their relationship were somewhat lost on me. It's clear this reunion is charged with history and unresolved feelings, hinted at through their dialogue and shared glances, but without the foundation of their first encounter in 'Before Sunrise,' it felt like watching the middle of a movie. Still, it's made me curious enough to go back and watch the first film, to fully appreciate the depth of their connection.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A magnificent follow up to a beautiful picture,"This follow-up to the cult hit 'Before Sunrise' takes place nine years after the original masterpiece. The wisdom of making a sequel nine years later to a film that doesn't really need a sequel is questionable. Or at least it would be, if this film was anything less than brilliant. While the first film depicted an energetic and youthful romance between two young people; this sequel is a more mature tale, all about reflection. Before Sunset plays out almost as a tribute to the one night that the characters spent together in the first film, and analyses what happened to them after those events. The film takes in themes of missed opportunity and the effect that time has on character. Just like the first film, time is of the essence again and we follow Jesse, now the writer of an international best seller who meets up with Celine again, this time in Paris. The two take to the streets and begin discussing their relationship with each other, with their respective partners and how life has been treating them in the last nine years.The tone of this film is very different to 'Before Sunrise' as the characters are now older and wiser and have lost some of that reckless stupidity that made the first film such a delight to observe. The anecdotes that the characters profess to one another takes a worldlier stance, and this allows the characters to revel in their newfound maturity and also develop even further than they did in the original film. In my opinion, this sequel is not as great as the first film. It comes down to personal preference in the end, but I preferred the higher energy exchanges of Before Sunrise to the more mature reflections in this film. That's not to say that Celine and Jesse have completely matured into well-rounded adults, on the contrary in fact; the immature irresponsibility that the characters once revelled in still remains, and this comes to a head at the film's conclusion.Amazingly enough, in spite of the fact that it's nine years since their first outing as Celine and Jesse; both Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply have managed to step back into their characters, and have once again achieved a glove-like fit. Julie Deply in particular is incredible this time round. There's a scene in the back of a car when she explodes into a mass of insecurity that is one of the most heartfelt showings of releasing pent-up emotions that I've ever seen on screen. Paris provides a new setting for the characters to walk around, and it makes for one that is even better than Vienna was in Before Sunrise. The city is beautiful, that's elementary, but it's the way that Linklater captures the life going on around our characters that really makes it special. While the two talk, people chat away on mobile phones, walk their dogs and drive their cars and the life around the two characters creates a wonderful atmosphere.You really need to see Before Sunrise before seeing this follow up in order to appreciate the tones and the beauty of this picture. Of course, you need to see both films anyway as they're essential viewing; so what are you waiting for?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The longest half hour I've spent in months......,"A truly gag-worthy inside look at the juvenile, self-serving world view which motivates Hollywood writers and producers. Ethan Hawke was physically unappealing (can't he get his teeth fixed?!), his character narcissistic beyond belief. Julie Delpy is so busy trying to be charming as her character tells Jesse about all the wonderfully righteous things she has been doing to save the planet from all the bad actors in the world who are polluting everything, while she and Jesse puff away on their ciggies. Hello? The first few minutes of interviewing Ethan Hawke's character were laughable. I simply couldn't buy the idea that any person this inarticulate could have written a novel considered a worthwhile piece of literature. Jesse (Hawke) sounds like a bumbling 19 year old college sophomore. After 30 minutes of this disgusting drivel, I decided to preserve my stomach and eject the disc.What really sickens me is the distorted view of reality depicted by these characters, who are obviously well thought of by the author and movie-makers. The way in which Celine and Jesse view the world is the view of spoiled Westerners who have no actual clue of reality, and criticize everyone else from their safe bubbles. Aside from the token concern for polluters, aren't they essentially mainly concerned with their own gratification?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"what fascinates and interests almost works to annoy the viewer, but Linklater does come closest to Bergman here","Before Sunset provides us not so much a sequel as a continuing development in the lives of these characters, who are starting to embody the neuroses and deeply-held desires that neither want to admit to until it's at the most crucial and tragic of times. Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who first met on a train in Vienna in 1994, meet again nine years later as Jessie has published a book which is based on that night they had together. He's in Paris, they meet again, and before he has his plane back to the states they talk, and talk, and talk, and unlike in the first film there are no asides. It's just two people who at first talk about concerns that came up for them the first time, if a bit more pragmatic: what it is to have concern over the environment, to live in the USA, to be involved enough in a relationship. There's even a moment of deja-vu where they talk about reincarnation and a respect for faith if not an embracing of it. But then we also get to see something much deeper in each side that Jessie's book and mere re-appearance for Celine brings out a memory that has become hyper-realized, and vice-versa.Like Bergman's films, in particular Scenes From a Marriage (if not as wholly successful because of its short running time here), Linklater provides us with characters who have no problem saying what's on their mind, in the immediate sense anyway. Jessie is even more digging-in with his cynicism and wit, and Celine with her opinions on the world at large, family and on past relationships. But when it comes to getting at their connection, it's very fragile and even unattainable because of each side's own flaws. If the two of them were happy, to be certain, there would be no movie, but it's the characters' connection to that one night in Vienna, and the second meeting that was supposed to take place six months later and never happened, and how it cripples their own romantic lives that becomes very interesting yet shallow at the same time. Perhaps this is the best way to show how smart, functional people become dysfunctional in their respective social stratospheres- Jessie is married and with a kid, but not very happy in it, and Celine is in bad relationship after bad relationship- but the singular, glossy night of years past has become a bitter shrine of sorts amid their respective neuroses.Linklater shares that incredible Bergman quality of cutting past the already sharp intellect to the emotional matter of the parties, even if it doesn't feel totally complete; I want to see how their story might end, however obvious it should and probably would be. One knows this could never work in real life, aside from the practical-side of it all, yet it's this that makes it all the more watchable. This, plus the incredibly natural repore of the actors, as Hawke and Delpy, as to be expected, seem like they aren't even on a script but are being filmed by Linklater on the fly as his camera captures the given-luscious scapes of Paris in afternoon, and the dialog is still as fresh and inviting as ever. If it lacks anything from the first it's an greater sense of the possibility for romance, since this time the sense of romance is entangled in loss and questions that Celine and Jessie want answered, however conscious they want them answered or not. But as with the first one, I still loved being around these two, who can expound a mouthful on a subject that we all might talk about, almost shockingly similar (one bit I liked a lot was Celine's story of going to Poland), and then in a slight cloud of romanticism.It ends ambiguous, maybe too ambiguous, as I found myself saying 'huh, what', but it ties into what Jessie tells the reporters at the press conference early in the film: one may take away something from this tale, or someone else another, but there it is, clear as day. Before Sunset is a straightforward romance, and proud of it, being both straightforward in romantic connection and as sharp as anything you'd never find in your local cineplex. One of Linklater's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

the most honest and beautiful film i've ever seen,"There are almost no words to describe this film.Almost.I saw Before Sunrise last spring, and I remember being taken with the characters and the way the movie was filmed--almost entirely in real time, line after line of amazing and honest dialogue. I really liked it, and made a resolution to see Before Sunset as soon as I could. It came on TV one day a few weeks later, and soon after became one of my favorite movies.To start, these are two of the best, most human characters ever portrayed in a film. However, it doesn't hurt that they have all the dialogue they do to develop. For anyone wishing to see a movie that breaks outside Hollywood stereotypes (as well as crosses international borders), this is the best film for you to see. Every sentence Celine and Jesse speak makes you laugh or think. Also, the lack of music is very interesting. The only musical tidbits in the movie are Celine singing Jesse her song and the two of them listening to Nina Simone in Celine's apartment at the end.Ah, the end. Just one more reason to love this movie. Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke (who collaboratively wrote the screenplay) left on an ambiguous note (just like the end of Jesse's book), a true test of whether the audience is a cynic, romantic or just not sure. After revealing their characters' naked beliefs, hopes and fears, they turn to the audience in the end for a beautiful twist.Unfortunately there are so many people who will think this film is boring, but all I ask is that you open your mind and just listen to the two of them speak. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming but sophomoric,"In Richard Linklater's charming Before Sunset, the highly praised sequel to his 1995 film Before Sunrise, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), now married with a four-year old son, is in Paris on the last leg of a book tour. Celine (Julie Delpy), his partner from a short-lived romance nine years ago, shows up at a roundtable for his book signing and they pick up almost immediately where they left off. Jesse has eighty minutes before he has to leave to catch his plane and that is how long the movie lasts. They go for coffee and take a walk through Paris. They talk and talk, then talk some more. Without pausing to take a breath, as if fearful of a moment of silence, they engage in non-stop conversation about the world situation, the element of chance in their lives, the environment, relationships between men and women, and their memories of what actually occurred in Vienna.Celine talks about how unfulfilling her life has been and there is a sad undertone of remorse and regret for the things that might have been. Jesse complains about his unrewarding marriage but does not take responsibility for his lack of satisfaction or consider the commitments he made to his wife and son. In a strange sequence in a restaurant, they both light up cigarettes and blow smoke in each other's faces, a scene that is incongruous in light of Celine's passion for the environment. Does Linklater want to send a message to young viewers that smoking is romantic? One would have thought that in the intervening years, Mr. Linklater's characters would have acquired a reasonable degree of emotional maturity but such is not the case and all the sexual banter and philosophical posturing feels sophomoric.Comparisons have been made to another film that consisted mainly of conversation, My Dinner with André. That film was not only intellectually stimulating but emotionally satisfying, an experience that allowed us in the space of two hours to re-explore our own lives and rethink the way we see the universe. Before Sunset is not in the same league. Some are calling it ""breathless"", ""sweet"", ""smart"", and ""one of the supreme movie romances of the post-'80s era"", but to me it falls far short of those accolades. It is a well directed and well acted film with great picture-postcard shots of Paris (that carefully avoids the congestion and urban blight), some witty dialogue, and a very clever ending. What it lacks is an ability to communicate the unfathomable grace of love in a way that transcends banality.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful Sequel of One of the Most Beautiful Romances I Have Ever Seen,"In Paris, the American writer Jesse Howard (Ethan Hawk) is in the end of an European tour, promoting his novel about the one night stand he had with a young French woman nine years ago. In the end of the debates in a bookstore, he finds Celine (Julie Delpy) in the audience, who works in an environmental organization, and they leave the place to drink coffee and talk to each other before Jesse goes to the airport. Along the moments together, they realize that they are still in love for each other.""Before Sunset"" is a delightful sequel of ""Before Sunrise"", which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful romances I have ever seen. The screenplay was written by Ethan Hawk, Julie Delpy and Richard Linklater and it is fantastic, with wonderful dialogs. It is also amazing the natural performances of Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpy, who intensively live the characters of Jesse and Celine. It is impossible not liking this movie! The simple song sang by Julie Delpy is a great complement to this lovely fairy tale. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Antes do Pôr-do-Sol"" (""Before Sunset"")",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"'Baby, you are gonna miss that plane...I know'","Very few films can match up to the original first movies. 'Before Sunset' is one such. This time Linklater has co-written the screenplay with Hawke and Delpy. Jesse and Celine reunite after nine years. Things haven't turned out the way they had expected but here's a chance. 'Before Sunset' follows pretty much the same style as 'Before Sunrise'. This one too is very much a conversational piece. Here the score is used to a minimal. During the end we hear some songs including Julie Delpy's beautiful 'My Waltz'. The cinematography consists of more long shots than in the first movie. The film has a very mature feel to it. Of course Jesse and Celine are a lot more mature today and less idealistic than they were nine years ago. Linklater beautifully captures the love between these two characters as he walks us through the streets of Paris. Here too the dialogues are just as magical as in the first movie except that this time there's a melancholy about the things that could have been, the years that they could have been together. Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are terrific as ever and they deserve additional praise for the writing and Ms. Delpy for her singing. Overall, 'Before Sunset' has everything that made 'Before Sunrise' a phenomenal movie experience.",,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful in its simplicity,"I saw both movies, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, at home as DVD's and was amazed at the effect these movies had on me. I was mesmerized and entranced by the utter simplicity and beauty of the love story. The Sunrise movie takes us through a magical night in Vienna where two young (23 year old) adults fall in love. The sequel Sunset movie re-unites them nine years later in Paris. During the nine year interval, much of the idealism they had as young adults has been been overtaken by the realism that comes with life disappointments experienced in the intervening years. The dialog in both movies is so compellingly real and so natural it borders on surreal. Its like being a fly on the wall. It doesn't seem like they're acting at all. The script was written by Director Linklater, and actors Delpy and Hawke. Any guy will fall in love with Celine. Thank you, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke for creating these two small movie masterpieces. Its a must see for all romantic souls. Best movie I've seen in years. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect sequel to my most favorite movie,"(Just mild spoiler at the end) At first I thought ""Before Sunrise"" is best to never have a sequel and left the ending open to audience's imagination. However, the director, his cast, and his team prove that they can do it. ""Before Sunset"" is simply the perfect sequel to one of the most beautiful film I've ever seen.The characters that I love so much are still themselves. They've grown, gone through good and bad times in life, but they are still the same two people we saw in Before Sunrise. The acting and the dialog is so real. It even makes you think of your own life, think of the love that has come and gone, the opportunities you've blown. However, love is still there. This film shows very well that no matter how you've blown your chances, the love in your heart doesn't go anywhere. It's just there.I like the heartbreak moment in this film. It makes you feel sadder than watching the first one, when the two were just young, honest, and romantic people that fell in love. I think Before Sunset makes it more real to life that the two people become more bitter by age and life experience.The ending is a bit too abrupt, but I like it anyway. I like the way it doesn't give you a conclusion. You can think for yourself about how this two will turn out.Now I will go and buy the DVD. This is definitely something to treasure.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
sweet return,It's 9 years after the events of 'Before Sunrise'. American Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke) is in Paris on a book tour after writing about that night with Céline (Julie Delpy) in Vienna. He's coy to the reporters about that night. Céline shows up and they restart the conversation while he waits for his flight later that night. She reveals that she didn't make their planned meeting due to her grandmother's funeral. He reveals that he did return for the meeting. He's married with a son. She has a photojournalist boyfriend who is away. The conversation fluctuates between breezy and deeper material until personal truths start to be spilled.Richard Linklater has hit on something compelling by returning to the same characters years later. It's casual and improvisational-like. Hawke and Delpy still have the same chemistry but more adult. It's deeper. There is an addition to the material by being a sequel. It's more than repetition. It's a sweet return of old friends.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
everyone has grown up or become a better being,"Of course I saw Before Sunrise first. If I didn't see Sunrise and jumped to this one, Before Sunset, would I still love Sunset? Maybe not. So please, if you haven't seen Before Sunrise, do not watch Before Sunset.The atmosphere is so powerful, in the movie, and between the movie and me. Sometimes I felt like I knew Jesse and Celine in person, but more often I felt I was one of them. It's not about whether I am a guy or a gal or a European or an American or any identity. The characters somehow caught a part of me, a deep part. I could almost feel what they felt. This is the most successful component of this movie.They were young and less experienced. They, I mean all of them, on the screen, behind the screen. Now, after 9 years, they came back together and produced a much richer film. Before Sunrise was a bit like a traveling movie for me. They walked from place to place. It was like that the director wanted to introduce Vienna to viewers. Jesse and Celine talked about their values of life and love on the basis of their ideals. In Before Sunset, they talked about similar issues again but on the basis of their own personal histories. It was so touching! This time, they didn't walk as many places as 9 years ago. They were not tourists anymore. They were much more certain about their journey.The performances of both actors were excellent! I mean, it was like they were talking to me. They acted with their eyes and body. It was so attractive that I didn't care where they walked. I was really into their conversation and their reaction to each other. The story went along with the words they said. Because of their great acting, I did not feel any dryness of this movie.""Everyone is independent. Nothing is forever.""----This is what I got out of Before Sunrise. And I think it also is the ideal of the young Jesse and Celine.---- They went on their own life without each other and realized something could be forever and they were not as independent as they thought they were. People can live by themselves, feeding themselves and entertaining themselves. However, people cannot just live like that. People depend on others in terms of caring and love, even though the person who loves you is physically far away from you. Jesse and Celine were independent of each other during the past 9 years but also dependent on each other mentally. Apparently, memory is the most reliable thing you can hold on to and deeply dwell in. Beautiful, isn't it?I also love the endings of both movies. The story still goes on in my head. There is no ""the end"". I wish them happy as a way to wish myself happy.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hits right in the feels,"If Before Sunrise is about the dreamy kind of love, this movie deals with the practical kind of love. The conversations and cinematography is beautiful as expected. This movie makes you feel sad in a way that can otherwise only be felt after a heartbreak or regret over life's decisions. Because you want this movie to end on a happy note, It gets painful to watch towards the end because you are afraid it might not.

Paris walks,"I have seen the Before trilogy in the wrong order. Before Sunrise saw Jesse and Celine as two young travellers who meet on a train during a trip to Vienna and bond. They exchange little details about themselves and agree to meet up at the same place on a particular date.Before Midnight released in 2013 is set almost 20 years after they have first met. They are now married, vacationing in Greece and have entered middle life and their relationships now show some cracks.Before Sunset is therefore the filling of the sandwich. After 9 years, Jesse is travelling in Europe as part of a book tour. He again encounters Celine who has come looking for him in a Paris bookshop.We find out that Jesse did turn up in Vienna but Celine could not has it was her grandmother's funeral. That event has somehow thrown both their fate in a different direction.Older, wiser, with both having a career established. They still have much to look forward to but there is also now past regrets. Celine has had relationship failures and Jesse is married with a child but its not a happy marriage. Its clear that both carry a torch for each other and their initial encounter left deep marks.The rest of the film is the couple walking in Paris or on a boat on the River Seine. We get to know a bit more about these characters as they fill the gap in between the years we last saw them.Its clear that Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke have a nice chemistry and comfortable with each other. They look like long lost lovers and of course they co-wrote the screenplay. Just look at Jesse's face when he finds out that Celine had lived in New York and worse he was also there at the same time.I do think that director Richard Linklater could had done more to show the beauty of Paris and to be honest the touristic element of Paris apart from Notre Dame. I have walked a similar route and taken a boat ride on the River Seine and the film could had done with the picture postcard scenes to break up the monotony of these two people walking and talking. Its kind of natural for Jesse who is after all a visitor to the city.The conversation is interesting but not riveting. Its natural but does not flow again because the screenplay wants to unwrap its layers slowly and methodically.Jesse is on a tight schedule as he has a plane to catch but its clear he does not want to leave her. We now know that there is more to their story and shall re-visit them again.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boring...,"Alright, so I saw the film. The version I saw was about one hour and 17 minutes but it seemed like 2 hours and 17 minutes. I felt a nearly a sleep during this one of the most boring films I ever saw. I also found the acting not so good as it should be. The quality of the acting was simply not good enough. The idea of making this film this way is alright but it lost it in the perfection of the making. So i do not understand that the rating is so high. I think it should be 6/10 instead of 8.5/10.

Acting by Hawke and Delpy is so artificial, these people couldn't have been lovers in a million years. you can feel 0 chemistry between them and the whole movie you just have a feeling of 2 bad actors pretending they once meant something to each other, with an attempt to cover it with a series of really, really boring stories and ""oh were having so much fun together laughing to our silly jokes"" type of talk.i again, do not know how is it possible for a movie so shitty to get so many good reviews. something ain't right here.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Manages to Improve on a Very Good First Film,"Before Sunset (2004)**** (out of 4)Nine years after the events in BEFORE SUNRISE, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) returns to Paris to do a Q&A for his book, which just happens to talk about that night in Vienna. Celine (Julie Delpy) winds up coming to the event and afterwards they've got a little over a hour to catch up on what's been going on in their lives. BEFORE SUNSET is clearly an improvement over the already very good first film but what makes this one here even more special is that it captures the magic of the first picture while at the same time taking a look at the darker issues in their lives. As with the first film, it's really amazing how director Richard Linklater managed to make this feel like a documentary that you're watching and not once do you see Hawke and Delpy as actors but instead you see them as real people that are simply being filmed by an invisible camera. The film manages to really make you believe that the story is picking up nine years after the previous film and I must say that the explanation for the ending of the first movie is extremely well handled. I'm not going to spoil what happened six months later but it's perfectly handled here. Even the first appearance of Celine is extremely beautiful and perfectly done. I really liked the dialogue here but I also like the fact that it once again comes across so real. I say this because I viewed this at the same age of the characters and I thought their feelings on growing older are so true. Hearing Hawke talk about his son and relationships is just something one can connect with and like the previous film the situations make you feel as if you could be the one doing the talking or at least you know someone like these characters. Once again both Hawke and Delpy are terrific together and really fit back well in their characters. There are more emotional or dramatic moments here and both handle them well. Linklater, who wrote the script with the two stars, keeps the film moving at a great pace and really manages to make one fall for the situation that these two are in.",,Anonymous,Romance

There are so many little hints, implicit and explicit, about what's going to happen to these two after the movie is over that it's really fascinating.

A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Before Sunset (2004),"Thanks goodness I'm watching this on DVD (though missing out on the chance of experiencing this on the big screen) and can almost watch it immediately after watching the original. Well I could have, but I'd like to let Before Sunrise sink it a bit, before finding out how my favourite lovebirds continue with their next encounter in this sequel, filmed some nine years later, which is a very, very long time to wait for a sequel to be made.I guess the length of time in between the making of the movies helped to bring about certain gravitas to the characters played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, in that they truly age physically, no two ways about that, and along with the physical age, come the emotional baggage and history they have built over the years. You can see it in their eyes, no longer the optimistic young adults, full of enthusiasm and hope, and all those replaced by a weary sense of worldliness, with chiseled looks and skinnier frames. I think Celine was more beautiful nine years ago, and am ruing the loss of baby fat, haha!Anyway I digress. For those who are left at the cliffhanger from Before Sunrise, you'll be pleased that what happened after, and what specifically happened that night, will be revealed in this movie, though the story teases you in not having it revealed in its entirety, toying with you with coy and playfulness, just as how the characters interact then and now. In Before Sunset, we are nine years from the last meeting of Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke, with a last name to his character) and Celine (Julie Delpy), and he's now a published writer making his whirlwind book promotion in Europe. They meet in a bookstore in Paris, which takes over Vienna, and now have to spend, in almost real time, a very limited late afternoon evening together reminiscing and catching up, before Jesse's scheduled flight home to the USofA.The narrative style has also matured together with the ease with which the actors play their respective characters. You''ll notice the increase in the number of long, uninterrupted takes and dialogues, and sometimes wonder, it'll be a pain to flub your lines. Perhaps it's also because having Hawke and Delpy co-write the screenplay, they were able to inject material drawn from personal experiences to breathe life into their roles. Therefore their lines come across so naturally, you can't help but to start casting this voyeuristic look upon Jesse and Celine as you eagerly await their sharing of their lives from that moment in time, until now - their careers, their families, and the perennial what ifs, and there are many.I don't have a particular moment which I loved, unlike the previous movie, but there are certain dialogue discussed, especially during the limo ride, which struck a chord in me. Perhaps even made me understand my past relationships a little more, though regretting certain things I sure have. It made me wonder, if that was exactly how another felt, and if so, how stupid I was to have not understood, Then again, if I had, then things would be different now, wouldn't it?I'd say it again, that the movie was made enjoyable by the two main leads portrayal of lovers who can be exactly you or me, and of the fantastic conversational pieces that they have, be it flirting with each other, or discussion of serious issues. Wonderful, wonderful chemistry between them, and for fans of Delpy, you'll be glad to know that she composed and contributed 3 songs to the movie, one of which is worked into the plot, and performed on screen. I like.I liked the way it started, as if what happened in Before Sunrise was something from memory, from imagination, from the past retold in a novel. And depending on your mood, I'd like the way it ended - in a manner which could swing either way, depending on your personality, and the degree of romanticism which you have at that point. In the end, I too was made to reminisce about the one who got away, and regretting it big time. And it does make me wonder, what will happen if I chance upon her some years down the road too (I think it has now been 5?), how exactly we would react, and how we would have a conversation, if ever, during that chance meeting.To truly appreciate this movie, watch Before Sunrise first. Better yet, watch both movies back to back, it'll clock in about 181 minutes, which should breeze by given the compelling dialogue and excellent chemistry. I know I will, sometime soon!There's a slight improvement in the WB Code 3 DVD in that it contains a making-of feature called On The Set of Before Sunset. There are interviews with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, as well as director Richard Linklater. You can see how many crew were needed to film the seemingly simplest of scenes, and listen to how they collaborated across continents before finally getting together to shoot the movie. One gripe though, is that this segment lasts only 9 minutes and 40 secs long, and ends so abruptly, you'll not believe that it had finished.As usual, the audio and visual transfers are great, and you have a choice of languages in English Dolby Surround 5.1, or Portugese Dolby Surround Stereo. Another extra is the theatrical trailer, and a host of subtitles available in many languages.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a perfect sequel should be like,"I loved this film, as I loved the first one, possibly more. More because the characters are much more 'real' here. They grew up like we all did, they went through sorrow, disappointment, they learnt a lot, and still, for many things, they are the same people they were 9 years ago, because they still dream and they're still looking for their perfect love, that love they let go 9 years before. It's what Jesse says at some point - nobody really ever change. Being of the same age group of the characters, I could identify a lot with what they say and feel. Which means that Hawke and Delpy did a great job, both acting and writing this film. It's subtle, delicate, and it needs to be listened to very attentively, not to miss one word of the great, deep dialogue. Well done to all of them. And, it's so true, the only problem with this film is that it ends...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Yak yak yak...,"First of all, I'm just a little bit amazed that this movie is in the top 250 movies of IMDb.'Before Sunset' continues the gabfest that Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke had in 'Before Sunrise'.

Soon, they're walking around talking about Important Things and all of that yadda yadda yadda.In all honestly, I had to stop this film because I was falling asleep.

The most realistic dialogue I have heard in years,"Some movies take us far away from our lives, showing exciting action scenes and building up characters with dramatic violence. This is not one of those movies.This is a movie for people who want to watch real life unfold on the screen. What makes this movie great is not the subject, reclaiming lost love/connection (I haven't seen Before Sunrise, I have to admit), but the honest and real way that the dialogue unfolds. Once you have seen the movie you want to go back and watch it again because it is like talking to an old girlfriend you have known more then half your life. You can tell when she is hiding something, tell when she is trying to block herself off emotionally, know that there are more feelings underneath her quiet charm then she will ever reveal. I haven't even seen the first movie but I feel as though I truly know these characters.This is a highly intellectually, emotionally involved plot made for (and seemingly by) persons who know what its like to have lingering thoughts, doubts and fears about a person that could have been ""the one"".

Linklater Sharpens His Pencil,"Nine years after Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) first met, they encounter each other again on the French leg of Jesse's book tour.Years before the critical acclaim of ""Boyhood"" or the cult status of ""Dazed and Confused"", Richard Linklater caught our attention with ""Slacker"", essentially a film of nothing more than a series of folks discussing a series of bizarre theories (and Madonna's pap smear).Then, Linklater took that concept and matured it. By replacing cranks with philosophizing adults, he was able to create ""Before Sunrise"". A brilliant film that relies almost entirely on a single conversation. He then gave us this film, again utilizing that dense, brilliant script... but giving us the twist of the same two people meeting nine years later, without any contact in between.

Celine appears to shrug it off but, no matter how hard she tries, it comes out that her life has also been affected. The entire film is a conversation between the two that says so much. I know the century is young, but this is definitely one of the best films so far.Director Richard Linklater (screenplay/story) , Julie Delpy(screenplay) , Ethan Hawke (screenplay) , and Kim Krizan (story) have written a wonderful film that will stand the test of time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"pleasant, but not as good as ""Before Sunrise""","This film has a lot of things going for it: the acting feels realistic, especially at the beginning, when the characters meet and feel awkward after so many years apart. The conversations they have are interesting and character-revealing, and you wish you could join in. Some of the transitions between topics are clumsy--I heard that the director and actors improvised the script, so I guess they weren't able to connect some of the ideas they had on different days. But the dialogue still has more depth than most, and if you liked ""Before Sunrise"", you'll enjoy finding out what happened to Céline and Jesse.However, in spite of its virtues, I thought the film was really lacking something, and I think it was a topic outside of the two main characters. The first film always had as a subtext the idea of travel, and the transient experiences travelers have. This film behaves as though these two people are the most fascinating in the world, and the camera stays tightly on them, barely showing any of the Paris scenery. There are some interactions with other people at the beginning of the film, but that's it. It ended up making me feel that Celine and Jesse had become very self-involved--more so than when they were younger.In pettier complaints, I kind of wish they hadn't explained some of the mysteries of the first movie, especially with the ""she says no when she means yes"" attitude. I also hated the part where Céline says ""it's a woman thing,"" to explain why she lied about something. Sorry, but I don't tell lies like that.A nice bonus is getting to hear Julie Delpy play the guitar and sing--I just wish I had gotten to hear the song about her cat!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I want those 80 minutes back...,"What an utter piece of clap-trap. This is another example of a pseudo-intellectual cinematech art-house experiment that has gone tragically wrong. Unfortunately, it has now claimed the lives of many viewers who too spineless to say they hated it because expressing an honest opinion might cause them to be scorned by those who feel that this movie is a work of art. This movie was no ""Dinner with Andre"" nor was it in the league of other great script intensive movies. This was simply a bad movie. The characters were self-absorbed and terribly uninteresting. The script was stuffed with cookie-cutter philosophical quotes and paraphrases and I wanted to vomit after hearing each utterance. The city of Paris could have been used a distinct character in this movie, in the way that Tokyo was used in ""Lost in Translation"". However, the city of lights was relegated to being a cheap background as if it was on the backstage lot at Universal. Please, please, please, do not make ""Before Moonrise"".

Reluctance,"Finally, Linklater does something with his talent. His strength in the past has been to shape the form of his films to match the subject. At least that's been true when the subject is the tentativeness of existence.He's done well enough in the past, but since his characters were aimless his projects inherited a meaninglessness. Where he tried to impart introspective layers with ""Waking Life,"" those layers were trite threads of fake profundities. Well, never mind. Artists aren't required to be particularly smart  even about who they are and what they do.What is required is the ability to discover and convey something that resonates. Usually in films the resonance is a sort of nervous recognition in the characters and situation. Sometimes, the manner of the film, the nature of the world presented is enough to engage. Such is the value of Kieslowski  and how he managed Delpy.This film tries something different, something commonly attempted and almost never achieved: the direct drama of discovery between two people. This hosts the construction not in any story or setting or even situation, though they are all employed in the service of the goals. Instead, the whole thing revolves around the tentative motions toward intimacy between two people.Why this usually fails is because of the unwieldy mechanics. In order to seem real (most reviewers call this film ""veristic"") the dramatic projection has to be hyperreal, but not so much that it appears artificial. So how do you dramatically amplify lightly probing intimacies? Its all in the most subtle hesitations of the actors, in that range beyond what ""really"" might happen and them forthrightly telling us what's happening.The construction is perfect: all movies are about other movies. In this case, we literally have the last chapter of the romance as a movie with movie values and memories. More, those are romantically captured in a book that one character carries from the previous movie into this one. Thus, all their discussion, all their reluctances are about having the present film approach the previous one.I'm astonished at the perfection of the idea, as astonished as I am about how well the two, especially Delpy, support it.

A Calm Experience,"When I watched the movie I did not know of 'Before Sunrise'. Now I would like to watch that also!! What a great movie!! I never thought how much importance conversation holds in a human being's life. Hats off to director,actors, dialog writer and all involved in the movie. The movie reminded me of meeting a long-lost friend after a long time and how you catch up. Though the movie speaks of lovers it can be applied to any relationship. The flow of the movie was of calm river undisturbed by external things. I felt a sense of relaxation while I watched the movie. We get to see Paris and how when you spend more time with each other your inner feelings tumble out. Is it not strange one is able to connect to somebody 9 years later without much inhibitions? A movie worth adding to your personal library.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable from the start!,"Ever tried to go back to your first love you met years ago? And later you're involved with someone else, and not very happy? This movie gives the word comfort in a whole new meaning. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke star in the sequel to the movie ""Before Sunrise"". They show the flashbacks of ""Before Sunrise"" and it makes the movie more enjoyable to watch. And Julie Delpy's role of Celine is ""tre magnifique"". She sings, and plays the guitar. This movie can be enjoyed in any language. OOH! LaLa! However, the story has a lot of flashbacks and what the future holds for each. Each one found love after nine years apart, yet neither one is happy. Jesse(Ethan Hawke) is a father, but his marriage to his wife is a total mess, Celine(Julie Delpy) is striking out everywhere in France. Both shared their joys and pains, and they seem to rely on each other when they first met. This movie can be definitely used in French class, and I think it can also used as a learning experience for all. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Caring and Thinking Wo/man's Movie - Good to the Last Drop,"Before I went to see Before Sunrise at its June 26, 2004 Austin Premiere last night I read the reviews written here at imdb.com to get an idea of what to expect. However none of the reviews prepared me for the excellence of this movie.As you probably already know, the entire movie is basically of one conversation between two people who (at least seemed to) fall in love nine years previously but had not seen one another again until this day having relied on one date for another rendezvous in Venice -- and having failed to exchange phone numbers, addresses, etc.First of all, the acting was nothing less than excellent, lacking self-consciousness and ""over the top"" theatricality. Much credit for this I'm sure goes to Rick Linklater, the Director, who told us last night after the screening that it was very important to him that it not ""get dramatic."" Ah...a fine director, is like fine wine, no?  Bravisimo!By the way, I also learned at the Q&A last night -- which was with Richard Linklater and the two stars, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy -- and was fascinated to learn that ALL THREE OF THEM wrote this script. To me, that helps to explain how the script could have come out so profoundly well -- full of meaningful insights, questions that are asked by hearts with a bottom line of love and warmth.What I am going to say next is something I have said before about BOOKS, but never about MOVIES -- not for the same reason. That is, I want to see this movie again -- and again -- and again so that I won't miss a line. There is so much to think about and care about among the topics discussed -- about love and life and the world we live in. Some of the things expressed were so interesting to me that I found my own mind running off with a thread of thought for a few moments after hearing what was said. It was just so stimulating. But then I would have to force myself to drop the thought in order to put my attention back to what they were saying lest I miss out on yet another pearl of humor, enjoyment, wisdom, riddle or profundity. I tried hard, but for me hearing ALL of it in one showing could just not be done. I will have to seen the movie again and again until I feel satisfied I have eeked the ""last drop."" And NO, I am not implying that the ending is a letdown; in my opinion it is a delightful ending and I hope-hope-hope that in another 7-8 years these collaborators will get together to write us another script. I want them to wait that long before writing it though, so that they can bring ever more wisdom and maturity to each sequel.Thank you, Rick; thank you, Julie; thank you, Ethan! How REFRESHING and NEEDED it is in our world today to have MEANINGFUL entertainment where the bottom line is where it should be -- for and about thinking and caring human beings. And by the way, Julie and Ethan have noticeably aged; Julie is (indeed) thinner and more mature, a fascinating natural beauty with that sexy French accent; Ethan's resemblance to Tom Cruise startles me. Yet there is another dimension to Ethan and I hope I don't make anyone angry to say I also prefer his acting over the former's. I very, very, very rarely pay full retail price for my own VHS or DVD of a film. I can't wait to buy this one and I look forward to watching it again with happy anticipation.10 Stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The sequel I never wanted to see has exceeded my expectations,"Before Sunrise was a beautiful movie that catered to a romantic ideal: Jesse and Celine share a single day together, conversation flows like wine, and it all ends far to abruptly to ever know if the love was real, or merely a figment of their own hopes. Jesse is the heart-broken cynic, Celine the romantic in search of a pair. It is one of the best examples of young love ever put on screen. At the end of the first movie, you are left on your own to decide their fates.This is precisely why I never wanted there to be a sequel. It was a perfectly ambiguous movie, and the way you interpreted their future was just a reflection of your own cynicism or romantic nature. Yet Linklater decided to answer the question for us in perhaps the most beautiful way possible. For anyone who saw Sunrise when it first came out, nine years of their own lives have now passed, along with the actors. How has the passage of time affected not only the viewers' interpretations, but also the actors?This time around, Hawke plays the romantic. For nine years he has hoped and dreamed of meeting up with Celine. Conversely, for Delpy her romanticism was snuffed out the day she should have met up in Vienna. What Linklater has done is essentially recreate the entire first story all over again, only this time it's from the perspective of a 30-something. The details that got in the way of their first affair: distance, fear, uncertainty -- have been replaced with the more practical (but more serious) details of marriage, children, responsibility.If they could just go back to that point in time knowing what they know now, it would be so simple -- of course they'd get together. But life isn't that easy. Linklater has again given them a chance at true, perfect love, this time with the complications of mature adults. They both recognize how special their relationship is, but the sacrifices they would have to make to be together now have far more serious consequences. Is it worth the risk? The ending is again ambiguous -- perhaps Linklater will fill us in on the details in another 9 years.Note: while Before Sunset does reference Before Sunrise in occasional flashback blips, you really should see the original first. If you have the time, you might try waiting a few years before watching the sequel to truly appreciate it -- though this isn't completely necessary.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rating:8 ?! I don't want to live in this planet anymore!!!,"Just like Before Sunrise, I was recommended to watch this by so many people telling me how much they love it and blah blah blah. God! What's wrong with you people? I mean yes, there were some good dialogs. But it was boring. And i don't get it. Why would I love the movie in which two people just walk in beautiful scenes of Paris and talk about completely different subjects? Plus there was nothing special about acting. And about music. And about everything. Maybe I'm just disappointed, because of all the ""It was great"" and ""I love it"" reviews. I don't know. +is the new one, Before Midnight any better?

Two of the greatest love movies ever,"I only discovered these two fantastic films this very last week altogether with my wife. I rented first the ""Before Sunrise"". As we instantly got in love with it, we ran to Blockbuster the next day to get the ""Before Sunset"". What i must say is that are few valuable words to rate these films. Because this is about feelings. About that ""one in a lifetime love passion"" we once had, or we luckily are having, or yet, we wish we had had. Everything is perfect, Julie Delpy as Celine, Ethan Hawke as Jesse, Richard Linklater the director, the cleverest dialogs in movie history, the less known sites of Viena first, Paris after, etc, etc. Everything so ""real live"", ""real people"" that we viewers, become Jesse and Celine! They are us! We are them! Or we wanted to be... There were great love movies and there will be made great movies in the future, that's for sure. But these two will remain forever in my short top ten ranking. If you miss ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" you will never forgive yourselves! We get to the end of the movies, seeing the credits with a big and happy smile in our face. Next days later we search on the net more stories about ""sunrise"" and ""sunset"", the complicity with that young and then, 9 years older nice couple, grows and grows. And then we are addicted with these movies, and then we watch them again, and again... ""Baby, you are gonna miss that plane"" says Celine to an enchanted Jesse in the end. Was really the end?...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
To be Treasured,"The two movies happened to me. I say happened to me because watching them was like going through an experience. Also because i chanced upon them each time. I had seen 'Before Sunrise' years ago when surfing through the channels i had stopped catching something interesting in the way Ethan Hawk was looking at July. It was the scene when they first meet on the train. I enjoyed the film and remembered it as one remembers distant but good memories. Years later in college a friend of mine saw Before Sunset and was raving about it. I said I had seen the film thinking that he was talking about Before Sunrise. It took me a while to realize that a sequel had been made of the film. And this time, it was a revelation.Yes the film can stand alone as a story, but it would be a shame not to watch the prequel before watching this one. Brilliant acting and dialogs coupled with a most plausible situation that could be a day out of any body's life. Here I am talking about the start of the day. Unexpected meeting with a past. Something that had meant a lot. Which still probably means a lot. But would you acknowledge it immediately? Would you not want to find out if there was still any hope left? I would. And that is why I love this film. It gives you hope that chances missed due to bad luck, or pure bad judgment could still be had again. The idea is romantic and the presentation is probably the most mature presentation of it. This very fact saves the film from being sappy or overly romantic. The dialogs, the interplay, the advances are all so real and so well thought out that it must take a pair of extremely gifted actors to play well. Our actors do that and still manage to keep the proceedings interesting. It must require extraordinary skill and chemistry. Awards do not matter here i think as the film has been made out of pure creative urge. Just the fact that such a captivating yet subtle film exists must be a triumph for everyone involved. And a memorable experience for the viewer given he watches it at the right point in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What if?,"Unfolding almost in real-time, this is a story about another chance for love that was once lost. Set nine years after they first met, Jesse and Celine find themselves older and wiser and still crazy about each other. They meet in a bookstore where Jesse is on tour for his best-selling novel which, incidentally, is a transcript of their magical night in Vienna long ago. He needs to leave for the airport soon and they have just about an hour to spend with each other in Paris. This film is going down in movie history for me as one in my all-time top ten favorite romantic films. It is even better than its 1995 prequel, which was already magnificent in itself. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have unbelievable chemistry. Their two characters are even more real than when they were first introduced all those years ago. Their love for each other just bounces off the screen. This is terribly remarkable film-making. The immediate sequences are a direct metaphor to the urgency of their situation, how little time they have. It is beautiful. I can't even spot the longest shot. It must have taken a real effort for those two actors to pull off these great performances, long dialogues and all. The best part about this film is that it can be seen as a stand-alone. You don't have to have already seen Before Sunrise. Watch it and I swear you won't regret it.http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfection,"Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were just sublime in ""Before Sunset"", the sequel to their 1994's ""Before Sunrise"". Essentially, it's a movie about nothing -- the two of them see each other for the first time after nine years and just walk and talk; yet, at the same time, it's about everything and anything we truly care, desire, and hope for in life. It's about love, our perception of it, our yearning to attain it, and our disappointments for our inability to put a grasp on it. Nine years later, we see clearly the signs of dissatisfaction and disappointments on their faces. Frustrated with the banality of life, yet imprisoned by the vast responsibilities to themselves and the ones they love to endure its miseries, the two of them are no longer as hopeful, nor as romantic about life and love, like they were nine years ago. There is less dreaming this time, more about reality, more about the pains experienced and the compromises made in life. There are also regrets, regrets about this lost love, and tears, tears held back in their eyes wondering what could've been. But the sparks and longings they saw and felt long ago were still palpable, just like they were the night they first met. By the end of the film, it's clear that not all is lost, their love is buried some where deep down in their hearts, cherished by their memories of that one encounter almost a decade ago. And for us, it's always comforting to know that perhaps, just perhaps, their love could eventually prevail, for after all, we are all hopeless romantics struggling to live a life of love and dream.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
We change as we grow older,"A sequel to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and a true testament to the virtue of patience. Filmed nine years after the first film, with the trilogy's third installment Before Midnight again jumping nine years into the future. And like in real life, nine years have also passed since the events of Sunrise.Jesse and Céline, played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, have not seen each other since the events of the first film, but now Jesse is finishing his book tour in Paris and runs into Céline in a bookstore. The whole film is simply their conversation from beginning to end as they walk the streets and parks of Paris. And it is fascinating.Before Sunrise was already a good film. Especially in how it portrayed the age of its main characters. They were adults, if only barely, but not yet old enough to be comfortable in their skins, in their world views. I also truly appreciated how they were mostly attracted to each other's personalities and not just their respective looks.That is present here, as well, but once again their age is reflected really well. These two have lived, have learned, have grown, but they still connect very easily with one another. There is earning to be with one another, because they get each other so well, but there's also caution brought on by live experience and past mistakes.And perhaps it's because I'm closer in age to the characters of this film, but I felt much more in tune with these two than I did when they were still in their very late teens. It's also fascinating that my favourite character has changed from Céline to Jesse. This time it's Céline that has views and attitudes that slightly annoy me, whereas before it was Jesse that was a bit too full of himself for my liking. Not that they're at all unlikable in either of the films, but they have clearly changed. And that feels real.Whereas Sunrise gave us a vision of perfection, of day dreams and hopes for the future, Sunset shows what might really be possible. Sure its plot and events are a bit movie-like in their sheer serendipity, but they still end up feeling more grounded. Very good romance film, no matter how you measure it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love story for romantic adults -- a treat,"After reading poor/mixed reviews in 2004, I put off watching this sequel. What a waste..It's a great movie for romantics, especially those who believe in the endurance of old feelings regardless of how the romance ended.Unlike other viewers I found no mystery to the ending -- they do get together.Jesse's inability to leave her when he finds her again, and his positive response to her last question in which he states helplessly that he will miss the plane is a clear indicator that despite the complexity of their current lives (breakup and divorce with their current mates), they are together this time. It's also implied by their mutual revelation of how unsatisfied each is in their current relationships. Jesse cannot love his wife as she expects it and Julie has suppressed her romantic feelings so much that she is satisfied with an intermittent long-distance relationship. Neither mate stands a chance to Julie dancing to Nina Simone as she seduces Jesse to stay.His acknowledgment that he will miss his plane is delivered with a smile that reminds me of certain scenes in two early Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward films (Paris Blues but especially The Long Hot Summer) in which Paul simply cannot stop grinning at his real love Joanne when they are flirting because he is so nuts about her.This movie was a treat...",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
My favorite of the three films,"This is a film that many people relate to, but most who relate to it will be ashamed to admit it. It's unconventionally romantic, emotionally complex, and much too real at times.One of the reasons why I love this film is it's difficult to deal with. You find yourself wanting what they want, yet you know you shouldn't. It's as if we all become the characters the moment the film starts and we are taken on a journey of deep existential and moral questions. We know the answer to the moral questions, but we pretend we don't know. We pretend Jesse and Celine are the heroes we are rooting for to win, but we know they are the villains of the story.While Before Sunrise was an innocent movie about two young people with innocent and pure intentions, Before Sunset is about how the same people are now impure and not innocent. They are manipulative from the very beginning, manipulating themselves and the whole situation, but their passion and love is the same as in the first movie.This is an incredibly sexy movie about two people; one is up to no good and she knows it deep down, and the other is a dirtbag who pretends to be an innocent good guy. But Linklater lets us pretend that they are both innocent for our own selfish benefit, then at the end we are left secretly shameful of what we've done. It's almost like we ourselves directed the story where it went and we are left feeling guilty that we did such a thing. However, it couldn't have happened any other way.Jesse and Celine are good representations of humanity. Maybe once in a lifetime will someone have a passionate love like this, and Before Sunset shows us how we are often slaves to that passion. It's appeals to the 15-year-old in us even though we are now 30 years old.It sounds like I'm down on the film, but all of these complexities are why I love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

beautiful,"I do not know why I like it. For the gestures and the smile of Ethan Hawk, for the movements of body Nina Simone-like of Julie Delpy, for the confort, for the dialogue, for the familiar crumbs of the story, for something you expect scene by scene, for the unrealistic realism, for the large themes, for the bookshop or for a not so romantic romanticism.

Intimate Sequel,"I didn't see Before Sunrise. I think I should just come out and say that. I have been told that it adds an extra layer to the sequel and I have no doubts. It almost seems unfair for me to judge a movie this intimate without having seen its prequel. But on that note, it is impressive that the second half of this story could move me so. It's nothing more than one long conversation, probably a kin to ones that I have myself everyday. Yet there is something else here. There is something that is entirely relatable here yet still far enough out of our reach that we are sucked into the film because we want to know that magic that exists only in movies.The story starts with a book signing. Jesse (Ethan Hawke), the author of a novel about a women he met once upon a yesterday and never saw again, is at the final stop of his tour of Europe here in Paris. This is the only part of the movie where he is alone and he sets the stage for what is about to come. He delivers a monologue to the press about a story he wishes to write about a moment that turns into another moment and that morphs into yet another and so on. He is basically describing what is to take place for the next hour. He spys a woman in the corner. He spys Celine (Julie Delpy) in the corner. After he wraps it up, they begin to talk. And they don't stop. Occasionally they travel to a new location be it a café or a park. Topics flow into each other  just as Jesse told us they would.How do you write a conversation specific to two people yet understandable to anyone? Even after seeing the film I honestly cannot tell you. There is something beyond chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. That has been transformed from life to the page by these two. The co-authored the film. In a time of adaptations from every medium possible, it is hard to pick out original screenplays that stand strong and defend their category. Before Sunset is one of those rare scripts that does. The writing is the strongest part here.This is essentially Delpy and Hawke's two man show. There is no one else of importance. They are rarely separate, even sharing the shot most of the time. They wrote the film, they star in it and for all anyone can tell, they were the only ones involved. The direction is so minimal that it is virtually non-existent. And there in lies the genius but it's funny how one simplicity can overshadow another.Before Sunset is emotional provocative in the most subtle way. Were the sun to actually set in the background, you would never notice the difference. The film is shot in real time and so the sunset would sneak up on you the way the film does. One minute there's a sun and then before you know it the sky is pink and you realize you care whether or not they end up together when it seems only minutes ago they were just two people talking about whether or not they had sex nine years ago. ****/*****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Rapturous Dreamer, Boticelli Angel...","There isn't anything more that I can say about this masterpiece, deftly given to us (like a perfectly wrapped present) by the ""cerebral threesome"": Hawke, Delpy and Linklater.So much has already been so eloquently said about this film, (particulary the very first two reviews on IMDb) that my verbiage would be redundant. But I just wanted to put some comments down to try to express the way this movie has profoundly affected me. I cannot count how many times I've seen it. And every single time that I do, the ending STILL makes me *gasp*. Sheer perfection. This movie is all about the connection between two extremely passionate, intelligent and visceral people, and NOTHING that has been churned out lately, can even come remotely CLOSE to this archetype of cinematic brilliance.

Romantic film that leaves you pensive and nostalgic,"I found this movie to be absolutely delightful. I remember seeing its predecessor, Before Sunrise, about nine years ago when it came out on video and being pleasantly surprised by that little gem of a movie. I was slightly younger than the main characters, Jessie and Celine, but their dreams and the questions they were struggling with at the time resonated very much with my own. When I heard that Before Sunset was being released, I was somewhat hesitant about seeing it, fearing that the follow-up would not measure up to its predecessor or that I would find the characters' conversations to be annoying and sophomoric. But Before Sunset turned out to be even better than Before Sunrise. Though just as idealistic and romantic, there is a stronger current of nostalgia in this follow-up. Celine and Jessie are more aware of their own limitations and of the sacrifices they had to make for their chosen paths in life. They are giddy to be around each other but also fearful about confronting the unrealized possibilities of the relationship they have so deeply idealized. Yes, the movie is very much conversation-driven, and the conversations sometimes veer into the realm of pretentiousnessbut then again, who hasn't come off as slightly pretentious when they are trying to impress someone they really like? I felt a strong compassion for these characters who are smart, idealistic, but flawed in ways that are endearing and human. There is a real urgency in their interactions as they try to make up for lost time. Richard Linklater is a talented director who has genuine interest in and empathy for people who are adjusting to the difficulties and demands of adulthood.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A lesser reminder of the first,"I saw the movie along with people who hadn't seen the first movie and they enjoyed it. When ""Before Sunrise"" came out 9 years ago I went to it not knowing what to expect and loved it - it was a story about people like me, it was different than every other movie out there, almost no one saw it. I couldn't help but relate to the young (my age), somewhat naive couple. Now it seems rehashed, a little jaded and I couldn't help but feel that it was more like watching the DVD extras than a sequel - its only slightly longer than an hour and is just like the first, with less tension and uncertainty. If you haven't seen either movie, see ""Sunrise"" first. Any one who saw it will want to see ""Sunset"" as well, but the first is still better.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Richard Linklater should be arrested for tormenting his audience!,"As the movie began to fade to black ... as Celine's image dissolved away ... an angry wail went up in my living room. How could he (Director Linklater) do this, to tantalize and torment in such a rueful, and a cruel way!? Don't watch this movie without watching the prequel (""Before Sunrise""), first; you will be playing an oft confusing game of catch-up, I believe, if you do (i.e., watch these movies out of chronological order). I watched this movie three times before returning it. It is a gem of a movie, and the actors and writers should consider a third installment when the time is right ... not in any prerequisite number of years (i.e., nine for example). Here is my unsolicited vote for J. Delpy for an Academy Award for Best Actress 2004 for her work in ""Before Sunset""! Her performance throughout was captivating, engaging, engrossing. Her display of anger while riding in the van was such that only a Frenchwoman can manifest and it was mesmerizing!!! If she doesn't receive at least an ""Oscar"" nomination, there should be an investigation into Francophobia in Hollywood. Buy the VHS/DVD!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really regret seeing it!,"""Before Sunrise"" was one of my all-time favourite movies, but when I heard they were making a sequel, I was nervous. The open ending of the first installment was so note-perfect in leaving people free to draw their own conclusions about what happened that I didn't want it to be ruined. As such, I delayed seeing this as long as possible.I should have delayed longer. Much longer. Like, forever.Simply put, ""Before Sunset"" takes a couple of intriguing, interesting, fully-drawn characters and turns them into insufferable cads, caught up in their own memories and having achieved nothing of note in their lives in ten years. It takes a beautiful, sweet chance romantic encounter and turns it into the cornerstone of these characters' lives. And it tries to make us believe that there's nothing better out there to hope for, ever. What a thoroughly depressing message! What injustice to these characters, who deserved a whole lot better! Of all the scenarios I ever imagined for these two, this was not it.The first movie was great because it was about two people meeting by chance and truly connecting. But in the second movie, we're led to believe that since then, neither of them has managed to connect with anyone else. Both are in unsatisfying relationships when they meet up again - that part is not that hard to believe. But what is depressing in a creepy stalker-ish sort of way is that Hawke's character has devoted years of his life to writing about Delpy's, and that Delpy's character has devoted a significant amount of time to seeking out Hawke's character for a reunion.Too, the movie downplays the thorny issue of marital infidelity and home-wrecking; people rooting for Hawke and Delpy to get back together should stop romanticizing everything and take a good hard look at the fact that they're cheering for a guy to leave (or at least cheat on) his wife and ditch his kid for a girl he had a one-night stand with nine years earlier. As for Delpy, she's writing and recording songs about a guy SHE had a one-night stand with. And neither of them quite realize the irony - that they're throwing away everything real in their lives in order to chase a fantasy that never really existed.The first movie was great precisely because the characters were practical about the circumstances of their meeting; they accepted the fact that their connection was strong but brief, and that long-distance relationships don't work, and that the future is unpredictable. But neither took their own advice - instead, it seems they have been living hollowed half-existences for the past nine years, just waiting to find each other again.And when they do, what exactly do they find? Is it realistic to think that these two will get along once they try to spend more than a single day together? It's all too obvious that they have nothing in common - even from the first movie, it's obvious that they differ politically, philosophically and culturally, and that the only reason they have such a great relationship is because it only lasts a night. By the second movie, they have grown even further apart on all those issues, plus they each carry around idealized, imaginary versions of one another that they have invented over a nine-year period and that will be impossible to live up to. Relationships - real relationships - are hard work, full of ups and downs, but they're *real*. What these two have isn't real. What they have is, well, just plain sad.If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge you not to, because once you have seen it, there's no going back.

I thought about it a few hours later and reflected on how boring it was and now, 24 hours later, its even more boring. The only thing good was the cute little dance the woman did at fade-out. Actually fade-out was the best thing.  I have to use ten lines to make this post.  So, here goes: Boring. Boring Boring Boring",,Anonymous,Romance
The best movie of 2004 and possibly the most under-appreciated movie in the past 15 years,"I just wrote about how Sideways could possibly be deemed a masterpiece (a rare element in American movies since the 70's) and for a lot of critics Sideways was the best movie of the year. I feel though, it falls second to Before Sunset. The difference between the two and what makes Before Sunset superior is the vehicle that drives the film. In Sideways, it is comedy. In Before Sunset, it is emotion-heartbreak, arrogance, hopelessness, and love. These by innate nature make it more powerful and haunting than the escapades of Payne's great film. Linklater, a great director that makes a Texan proud to be Texan again, directs like a great conductor letting a world-famous soloist take the vehicle where it needs to go but just keeping the headlights on. These two performances are deeply earnest. You can see the heartbreak coming from their own lives inch out of their mouths and glow from the building tears in their eyes. Whether or not they are bringing experiences from their own life is irrelevant. They are channeling what they know these characters need to feel into the sublime script. I hope and feel this will be remembered along with Sideways, Colllateral, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Closer as redeeming qualities making 2004 a movie year worth remembering.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
My words below will never do justice to this film,"Before Sunset is movie so genuine and true to the heart, where two people fall deeply in love without even expressing the words ""I love you"" or even sharing a mere kiss on screen.I have never seen two people interact like those two in ""real life"" or in any other movie. The connection they shared was equally possible as it was unrealistic, but it was in simplest terms a miracle.Even though I haven't witnessed such a miracle, I believe in it, as rare as it is.But, in this life, there are no happy endings, and it's only the path we take to our miserable end which has potential for ""happiness."" Without any reference to statistics and with no intention to hurt the feelings of anyone who might be ""in love"", 99% of the world does not experience this kind of love. Unfortunately for many, the love in this movie is ""true love"", which in effect means if you are not experiencing this kind of love, you are not experiencing true love.The characters do, suggestively, end in a miserable end. But the moments they share is when they experience the greatest happiness known to man.Do yourself and the world a favour and watch and fall in love with this movie. Because I can guarantee that even if I don't find true love with a woman, I can be sure I felt it by witnessing the pure magic in the gem.The only movie ever to bring me to tears! It had a profound affect on me when I watched it and still does. The original is almost as good, but this one had something extra in it to bring me to tears.If you don't understand even one part of what I'm talking about after you watched this miracle, then unfortunately you have zero chance of experiencing true love.This may me my favourite movie of all time!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Astounding,"I saw the ad for Before Sunset on a trip, and had to wait for 12 days before being able to see the movie. That 12 days seemed like ages. I felt that I was waiting to see an important friend after losing contact for 9 years, with all the curiosity what happened to him/her (here, for both Celine and Jesse). I felt fortunate to have seen Before Sunrise exactly 9 years ago without seeing it again so that I have exactly the faint 9-year-old impressions while watching Before Sunset.I was astound after seeing Before Sunset.What I did not expect was how much more serious Before Sunset is, compared to Before Sunrise. That 80 min conversation echoed so many things in life, e.g. why/how one stays in dissatisfied relations, our responsibilities and compromises, our occasional fall-back into feeling sad about life, while keeping our eyes on things still worth our effort and hope. The indirect allusions are so effective.While some has complained about a relative slow pace, I found the pace very powerful. I was practically grilled by those moments of suspense or uneasiness or hesitation. I was also surprised and shocked when the pace was fast at certain points. I don't know whether they are intended or or, but such emotions engaged me like no other movie.It is a very good movie even without hitting anyone's ""soft pots"" though a lot of the reviewers reported being ""badly hit."" The movie itself, the acting, and the story itself are all extremely charming. It definitely surpasses Before Sunrise, which has lent from scenery and is a little too sentimental at the very end. The atmosphere in Before Sunset is created entirely internal, which is amazing. It is also fortunate to have all the natural 9-year change in appearance and maturity in the cast. I cannot help suspecting that the makeup was made intentionally to feature a kind of aging into 32-33. I believe most actors and actresses at 32-33 look much younger on the screen.The technique to have a continuous flow was also used in ""Rope,"" which also delivers to the audience a good deal of emotional engagement for reasons described above.Finally, this movie is really for an extreme minority, but it is nice to hear from others from within that minority group!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great film. See ""Before Sunrise"" first, though","Add me to the chorus of people who really enjoyed this film. I think that the two films - ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" - make for a wonderful experience. Both films are interesting enough to stand on their own, I guess, but this is truly a case of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts.The fact that the actors are themselves 9 years older is one of the reasons why the film feels genuine. At one point in the film the Hawke character says that people stay essentially the same throughout their whole lives, even if their circumstances and lifestyles change. I'd say that seems to be true of these characters, and is done in an interesting way: The two characters - and actors - are 9 years older and how are in a different phase in their life, but the same spark that made them interesting to watch in the first film is true here as well.This is not a film to watch if you're interested in action, or even plot. Essentially all that happens is that two people meet up and talk for about 80 minutes, and that's it. But the conversation is so interesting - particularly since they have the first film to draw on - that it really holds your attention the whole time.I've heard that Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy have toyed with the idea of making more movies about these characters every few years, and I hope they end up doing that.Overall, a great film, and one that really makes you think.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
late magic in Paris sunset,"At first these two seem too successful and idealistic and cliché to care much about them. It's kind of sweet, but kind of naive too. So I said to myself, this whole thing needs pathos. Then the pathos came but I couldn't muster much emotion either, so I apportioned the blame to the director, the writers and the actors in equal shares, which are basically three shares , Linklater, Hawke and Delpy. And then, when I didn't expect anything else, came the magic: Julie Delpy sings a waltz, and it stays with the movie for the few minutes that are left. I don't know if that's worth the price of admission but it's kind of mean to regret having paid it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good 1st Act.  Where's the rest of the movie?,"I was eager to see this movie, as I loved ""before sunrise"". The dialog was real and believable, and yet, however accurate the criticisms of modern life were, it became too mundane. It was a little too real, like watching Julie Roberts change a diaper, yeah it's ""Julia Roberts"" Whoo Hoo, but ultimately... it's just someone changing a diaper. As we find out how profound of an effect each of them had on the other, I would have thought they'd run out of small talk much sooner, faced with the reality of a life's obsession presenting itself in person.At 80 minutes, including two sets of credits, there was time to delve much deeper into the possibilities. And the question looming large: ""If given a second chance at a past romance, would you do anything differently?"" is hinted at, but not played out. It felt like watching your sexy neighbors all through dinner, and just when they move towards the bedroom, the lights go out. Yeah, I have an imagination, but when I go to the movies, I suspend my own fantasies for awhile, and pay to see someone else's. And they weren't delivered.Rather than a number grade, I would give this movie an I (for incomplete).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
don't waste your time!!!,"Before sunset is a terrible excuse for a movie. The scenes were dry and boring. This movie literally put me and my guest to sleep. It's the most embarrassing display of cinematic performance my eyes have ever seen. The script was pointless and the acting was pathetic. This movie was far from realistic. I feel that no person should suffer through this two hour torture. I had high expectations for this movie, it looked very entertaining. Looking forward to this movie was a colossal mistake. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.. it is a huge waste of time, money, an opportunity to watch something decent. The only positive thing about this is that I had a nice nap.If you have any smarts at all you will not waste part of your life watching this overrated, senseless, boring, pathetic piece of garbage.

"Slight and fleeting but well written, sweet, natural and left me with a slight smile on my face even if it is all a bit idyllic and cheesy at times","Six months after they originally met traveling around Europe, Jesse went to the place that Celine had agreed to meet him only to be left by himself. Almost a decade later Jesse has written a book based on this one night meeting and is on an European tour. At the Paris location, Celine arrives to meet up with him. Overjoyed to see her again but pressured to leave for the airport in an hour and a half, Jesse goes for coffee and a walk with her in order to talk and catch up.Its been almost 10 years since I saw the original movie and had a vague recollection of it but I wanted to go to the cinema to see a film. I was left with a choice of Spiderman 2 or this film and I plumped for Before Sunset (although I will see Spidy another time). The film opens with some flashbacks and a rather pretentious Jesse talking about his book before the film proper starts with the pair taking yet another walk. From here on in you need to be in at least a semi-romantic mood or the pace and tone of this film will just grate on you. For me, I was open to see where it went and, although some of it was a bit cheesy at times, generally I was carried along with it. The tone is quite natural and the romance is not forced, in fact it isn't really that much for a love story for the majority. The long conversations are enjoyable and engaging and it is these that gets us into these people's lives just enough to care about them. The wandering film continues to a conclusion that may frustrate some but was perfect for my needs. For my money it was the sheer amiable mood of this film that made it enjoyable. At the end of the film I had a little smile on my face and, although it was only a fleeting feeling from a film that won't stick in my head long, I did feel a little warm thanks to the film.Of course it isn't perfect and it will be easy for the 'real men' in the world to just dismiss it as nonsense and, partly, they are correct. The dialogue at times is very natural and seems to fit the characters but at other times it is very close to being part of a fondue set. Likewise the characters are not as 'real' as I would have liked  she's an environmental saviour and is pretty and friendly; he's a sensitive author type who has youthful good looks etc. At the start of the film the two actors played the characters very eager and all smiles and I hoped that they were doing this in the way we all do when meeting someone  putting on the pleasantries. But I hope that this would fade as hurt etc came out; it came but it was left very late in the film and the material was kept just a bit too sweet. Delpy is still good despite her rather self-righteous character but it took me longer to warm to Hawke who, although likable, was unconvincing as the man that the script told us Jesse had become. The two have a good chemistry though, and it is fun to walk through Paris with them listening to their conversations that are interesting, pretentious, flirting, funny and cheesy  but still enjoyable to sit through.Director Linklater does a good job using Paris as a backdrop without going for the really obvious locations or landmarks in a touristy film type of way. More than that though, I was impressed by the technical aspect of the film  long tracking shots in one take and an impressive moment where the camera follows them (from the side) up two flights of stairs. As writer he did OK and, if you're not able to accept a little bit of romantic dialogue and warm chat then you're in the wrong movie.Overall I enjoyed the movie but, had I been in the mood for action then I would have been less patient with it. At 80 minutes it is brief and sweet and left me feeling a little warm inside for a while afterwards. It is not the type of film that will stick in my memory for months to come but it did the trick for 80 minutes  I wandered round Paris listening to friends chatting. It's not all perfect  far from it, but it is fun if you're in the mood. As the final shot faded, the audience got up to leave with little smiles on their faces and everyone was polite and friendly as we left  I came out into the corridor as an earlier Spiderman 2 had just finished in the other screen and the place was packed with running teenagers, hyper kids, hassled parents  all a bit hyped up and bustling; in other words  for a calm, peaceful and warm Sunday afternoon I had picked the right movie to go to and, if that's what you want then try Before Sunset.",,Anonymous,Romance
why it doesn't matter how it ends,"It is interesting that most of the critics like this one better than Before Sunrise because the characters are ""more mature"". My take on this is: most of the critics are closer and above this age range (early 30s) and it is simply more difficult for them to relate to the first movie. However, these two movies are even more worthwhile considered together especially from the point of view of the audience that were 20 when the first one came out and are almost 30 now. Back in 95 Before Sunrise resonated with me because it was very relevant to the way I and my friends looked at the world, we had similar dreams, concerns, it was the way we talked. And of course we imagined meeting this one soul-mate with whom you understand each other without having to finish sentences, and you have exactly the same doubts and look forward your life ahead and are reluctant to commit right then because who know what else may come your way. Today Before sunset has exactly the same effect, I am almost 30 and I have changed just like the characters and I have similar problems and again this the way I would talk and the themes I would discuss in a conversation. I am sure this is roughly true for this whole generation. I don't think the open ending is intended for us to guess what happened in either of the two movies, although Jesse says in the beginning of Sunset: well it depends, if you are an optimist they meet in 6 months and if not.... I think the open ending in both movies emphasizes the fact that it does not matter whether they end up together or not. The point is that they are both enriched by meeting and spending a few hours together and by having a good conversation. Sometimes we choose not to be with someone that we feel is our soul-mate, simply because it would cost too much (kids, other people getting hurt) and that is fine, we still have experienced this connection and we will treasure it for the rest of our lives. It is not about letting your true love slip away, we don't know for sure if this is true love, what we know is that we made a connection. I find the brief episode when Jesse tells the journalists the topic of his next book very descriptive of what the movie(s) is all about. This connection that makes our lives richer and better may happen in a night, or in a few hours or in a few moments.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Romance for the realists...,"I must admit that I went to see this movie without any expectation of how good or how awful it may be. All I knew was the Times (NYT) recommended it and the plot appealed to me so I went to a matineé show and was extremely pleased with the result. The picture began with Jesse wrapping up his book tour in Paris, and was blushing red while answering questions about his work which I found out as the movie goes along, was the romanticized version of his and Celine's love affair that did not happen. She came and saw him at the bookstore that he was in and went on from there. They reacquaint themselves with each other, spawning endless conversations from every conceivable topic. They also can't help but look back from that day in Vienna and wondered what if. I just recently saw Before Sunrise, the prequel to this film, and must say that I enjoy this one more, only because the topics of conversations were more mature, and the romantic notions were more realistic. Their connection is so palpable, it made me wish I knew someone with whom I can speak candidly without fear of being judged. The film is shot in location in Paris, and it certainly contributes to the aura of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Walking and Talking and Nothing More,"We pick up the lives of Jesse and Céline in mid-stride. When we left them at the end of Before Sunrise, they refused to exchange addresses and last names, but were going to meet in Vienna in six months. Nine years later, we glimpse their lives again. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has finished a book and is giving a reading/discussion and Shakespeare and Co. in Paris. At the end of the reading, he spies Céline (julie Delpy) watching from the wings. They go for a walk to catch up before he has to head to the airport. During this walk we learn that they did not meet up in Vienna, and have both attempted to move on in their lives.There are several things that make this movie stand out. First, this is a movie of dialogue and discussion about live, living and one's views, beliefs and outlook. There are no explosions, chases, kisses, heists, plot twists, etc. This is just two people talking. What I loved about the two films is the easy and open way in which these two discuss trivial and deeply personal subjects and how they are intermixed. What else made this film engaging was the warts-and-all approach to life. These characters weren't glamorous or glamorized, they were just people. And the fact that they picked up and explored the people they had become from mid-20s to mid-30s, who had strayed quite a distance from the idealized vision of their future they had had nine years earlier really brought it home. I too, am different and worse than the me I had planned on being 9 years ago. The only problem I had with this film was the character of Céline, it didn't ring true to me, too much idealism left and until she wigged out in the taxi, I didn't buy into her life.This movie is like crispy french fries and special fry sauce. In the west, fry sauce is a big deal. It is usually a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise with various spices and flavors added. Special fry sauce is a sauce the cooks (me included) used to whip up at Carousel Ice Cream Parlour in Provo, Utah in 1995 for ourselves and a few other employees. It had regular fry sauce, BBQ sauce and more mayo to make it a little tangier and better than the regular. Now this movie doesn't have much to do with the flavor or texture of special fry sauce and crispy French fries, but I only worked at Carousel in 95 and the experiential phenomena surrounding this dish (that I only ate during one year) overwhelm the taste in my mind . I was a different Poco back then, and thinking about the super fry sauce take me back to a more idealistic youth and the big plans I had for myself. 7/10http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most believable romance I've ever seen.,"Julie Delpy is perfectly beautiful in this intelligent and deeply affecting romance. The dialog speaks from the soul. The Parisian scenery is gorgeous, Delpy's music is moving, and the performances are pitch perfect. This is even better than Before Sunrise (1995), the film for which this is a sequel. The two protagonists are more complex. They have both suffered disappointments, yet - as Celine observes - their personalities are essentially unchanged, just more finely carved. The film's ending is inspired. The only mild criticism is that the characters are almost too eloquent. As a sequel to Before Sunrise (1995) this could not be bettered.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
So nice,"Before Sunset is a cinematic dance of emotions that earns a solid 7/10 in my cinematic diary. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy's performances are a nuanced masterpiece, carrying the weight of years in stolen glances and unspoken words. The film editing seamlessly weaves through the streets of Paris, mirroring the delicate dance of connection and separation. Its strength lies in the authenticity of human connection, and though it occasionally stumbles into the realm of overly intellectual dialogue, it's forgiven for its genuine attempt to explore the complexities of love. The music, or the lack thereof, allows the silence between words to echo with unspoken sentiments. The cinematography captures the golden glow of a fleeting romance against the backdrop of a timeless city. Before Sunset is a poignant exploration of love's evolution, leaving a lingering ache that reminds us of the beauty and impermanence of the moments we hold dear.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awesome and not letting it slip away,"Nine years ago, I watched the first movie ""Before Sunrise"" in Singapore and it became my all time favourite movie. I always wonder what have happened to Celine (Delpy) and Jesse (Hawke), and all the questions about whether they had met up six months later and one night stand still lingered. I could not forget the dynamic relationship between these characters and their thoughts about life, death, their friends and their relationships, although mundane but brings out the extraordinary side in everyone of us.Nine years later, I am now living in UK. Whenever I screened the DVD for this movie, the college room was always full. I found a lot of friends who loved this movie. By the time when I was told that the sequel is out and it's entitled ""Before Sunset"". I could not believe it, and it's like the Tolkien fans waiting to watch the trilogy.I have just watched the movie today, and realized that the characters have evolved. The way which they viewed their relationships. There is still the magic between them. As most of the issues that came to my mind from the movie are resolved elegantly in ""Before Sunset"", I cannot help but feel the same way on how this movie gave me the idealism to believe in romance. I felt that Celine and Jesse have shown us that how important beautiful moments are to our lives. The conversation they had about the environment, the politics of the world and things in the movie, is so much like what I would experience being in their age.Although the ending is not what I expected, I still think that the maturity and chemistry between these characters will live with me as I grow. I hope to hear from them when we all reached 40s. This is a movie which grows up with the audience, and every time you revisit it with a different notion of what life is all about.Definitely without doubt 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An interesting romance film,"I didn't remember seeing the first film of this series, ""Before Sunrise"" until some of the footage from that film was featured in its sequel, ""Before Sunset"", also directed by Richard Linklater. The premise of the story is that in 1995, Celine (Delpy), a young French woman and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) are two young strangers that meet in Vienna and spend the kind of night together anyone with half of a brain and an ounce of romance in them would envy. They walk, they talk, they sit, they talk, they have sex, they talk. And throughout the evening, they realize that they are probably meant to be together forever. She has to leave, but they tell each other that they will meet in Vienna in six months. ""Before Sunset"" picks up 9 years later, and Jesse is on the last leg of a European book tour, in France. The book is based on his experiences that night, so it of course shocks and awes him when he looks over at the patrons of the bookstore and sees Celine. They proceed to spend the next 75 minutes or so walking, talking, sitting, talking, and figuring out what ""could have been"".The story is so much deeper than I actually portray it, but the film is indeed a simple one. Essentially done in real time, the camera never leaves the two characters as they walk around Paris, sit in a coffee house and ride on a ferry boat. Because the film is so simple, the story has to be substantial, and it is. Even if one has not seen ""Before Sunrise"", it is easy to not only figure out the back story (thanks to the use of clips from that film) but to become emotionally invested in the characters of Celine and Jesse. The chemistry between these two actors is substantial, and the characters themselves are so likable that even though I normally have a complete disinterest in either actor separately, together I find them charming. The actual conversations (ranging from the regular ""catch-up"" stuff to existentialism) are really so natural; they did not seem forced or staged, an easy hole to slip in to with such a dialogue-heavy film. I'm sure that the incredible backdrop of Paris didn't hurt the romantic undertone of the film. There were a couple of conveniences that seemed to betray the otherwise intelligent feel of the film, namely the fact that Jesse's marriage story is a complete cliché, not unlike any number of stories someone hears at a cheesy pick-up joint. Fortunately in that instance, (though I can't completely forgive it) the connection between them is so obvious that it somehow (though not completely) seems a little less sleazy.""Before Sunset"" is nominated for an Oscar for its screenplay, a choice that I find very interesting and agree with. It is worth of its nomination (though will doubtfully win), and it's also one of the few romance films made after 1968 that I actually enjoy  because it has a brain. 7/10 --Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
In one word: trite.,"This film lacked all the charm of the first. In Before Sunrise we have this intriguing & alluring physical attraction and intellectual interest between two characters that ""destiny"" has united on a train. We follow them through an exhilaratingly spontaneous evening as their youthfully curious sensual dynamism develops. Their dialogue is interesting and sincere, and their attraction is sweet and sort of nostalgia-evoking.In the second this is all replaced with dialogue that feels contrived and scripted, and which reeks of pseudo-intellectualism. Let's just set aside the fact that the endearing young love of the first is replaced with a pent up lust in the second, so that we can focus on the fact that Hawke's character is married during this little escapade, which renders the whole attraction categorically repugnant. Maybe things won't to work out in his marriage anyway, but people with integrity honor their marriage until it is over. Are we suppose to identify with and/or sympathize with this character?!? Get a divorce and fool around, or exercise the most minimal amount of self-respect & dignity and follow through with your own commitment.Moving the promenade to the streets of Paris felt predictable and petty to me, it didn't save the movie, and finally, the film itself felt low-budget. I don't recommend Before Sunset to anyone who isn't middle-aged, divorced, and looking for consolation in a story of unscrupulous mediocrity. I do say that reluctantly, and apologize for its harshness, but that is the brutal truth. It's a middle aged, unaccountably cynical, and trite remake of the first, but 10 years later in Paris.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Let's talk,"What chances would you give to an 80 minute film to hold your attention which has nothing but an American man Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and a Parisian woman Celine (Julie Delphy) talking? Not much I would imagine. Well, this film not only grabs and holds your attention but makes you fall in love with the characters like the prequel ""Before Sunrise"". Our young protagonists in their early 20s were in Vienna for the day. In ""Before Sunset"", they are in Paris, 9 years from their tryst in Vienna, having lost complete contact of each other during the time.We follow these characters as they have grown from their previous romantic meeting, become more matured, responsible, more cynical and probably more regretful for their predicament to be apart. It is intriguing to listen to their delightful conversations to listen to as they walk through Paris and one of the reasons for that is, Julie and Ethan have written their own dialogs. Which makes the performances look so completely non-rehearsed and natural. It brings to life their characters which is all we remember of the film and it is most that as an actor and writer you can achieve.Linklater has always been a master of conversations, although he has set a very high yardstick in terms of the quality of it. It has to be engaging, quirky, real, meaningful. He is a master director and the diversity of his filmography speaks for itself. There is always a sense of languid ease to his film, maybe reflective of his persona.A great love story. One that will stand the test of time and will definitely touch your heart.",,Anonymous,Romance
I was involved with them immediately. Again.,"This movie is about two people talking. When I saw the same premise with a Broadway director and a semi-employed actor, I was bored to tears.

I'm not like them, and I wouldn't want to be their age again, but I enjoyed every second of watching and listening. I really remember very little about the first movie except that I also enjoyed it. I don't remember details about the characters or even their promise to meet again. That didn't matter. My companion didn't see the first movie at all, but that didn't lessen her enjoyment.

Richard Linklater shows what is,"Nine years after ""Before Sunrise"", Richard Linklater reunited Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy for the Academy Award-nominated ""Before Sunset"". This time they have a brief fling while his character is in Paris on a book tour.Rather than just being a plain sequel where the same things happen, this movie lets the characters have a conversation, waxing philosophical and addressing topical matters. Basically, the movie shows what is and what could be. I still haven't seen the third entry in the series, but if this is any indication, then I'd better see it.

Came out hungry from the cinema,"I haven't seen the first part, Before Sunrise (1995), but many around me had and did not stop telling me how a beautiful movie it was. So I went after Before Sunset with the feeling that I will see a nice romantic movie. Well, I did not get it. This can be a nice movie for some, but for me, it is not something I would take my girlfriend with me to have a night out.The film tells about Jesse and Celine meeting in Paris after their romantic night in Vienna 9 years ago. Jesse wrote a book on their romance and gives a small talk in a local bookshop where he meets Celine. They start talk and they go on talking.Basically, the movie is about their conversation, which is very authentic. Jesse has the man type ""jump in where we left off"" style, immediately starting at the intimate level, while Celine starts from the distance and slowly warms up to the intimate level they had before. At the beginning they go along the more superficial themes, what has happened during the nine years, what is life about at the moment, then they pass on to tell their feelings, motivations, their memories of that night they passed together.You see 90% of the movie Jesse and Celine talking to each other in premier and second frames (only the face or the face with upper body). The movie presents the story ""real time"", the 80 minutes you spend in the movie is actually the 80 minutes of their conversation in Paris. Therefore the camera never leaves them; you always see Jesse and Celine on screen. On the top of that, you are given very long runs between cuts. Like when you see them from the front talking to each other walking along a small street - you get it from entering the street to the corner, with the same fram, without any cut. For me, it was just too much of the same image - although they walk, so the background changes - and felt quite uncomfortable in my chair. It was not boring, but made me feel somehow anxious. In fact, after the first 30 minutes, I changed my place 2 rows back in the cinema, because I felt ""to close to the screen"".The end of the movie was the major disappointment to me, as there was no end. In the middle of a special moment suddenly the music and the picture fades out and the black screen with the list of the actors come up. We all stayed silent in the hall looking at each other with the face ""what's up, is that a joke?"". But it was no joke, the lights turned on, so slowly we decided to get up and go as the film is really over. I came out from the cinema mentally still hungry, as the story did get neither a sad nor a happy - or whatever - end, it just stopped. I wanted to see a nice romantic movie with some happy end, but I did not get it.If I consider this movie in itself, as it is, without any expectations, this is a great film, that breaks in something unusual to nowadays' action-romance-thriller movie with all the bells-and-whistles style pictures you get used to. Before Sunset gives conversations, feelings, situations and atmosphere, that you usually only get from independent European directors. It gives you time to digest and makes you consider whether you ever were in such a situation.However, when you go to watch this movie, you do it after hearing how beautiful the first part was and how romantic it was. So you sit in ""I will see a beautiful romantic movie tonight"" in your mind, but this is not a romantic movie. This is an unusual film of an original idea. I think that editor Richard Linklater should have filmed this story on its own, not as a second part of ""Before Sunrise"". Like that, it would get a 9/10 from me. However, like this, I can only give a 6/10.To answer your question, whether should you watch it or not, yes, you should, as I plan to watch it once again myself. However, you should do it without the romantic-movie expectations in mind.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sooo simple!,"It is a real good filmmaker that can turn the ordinary into extraordinary. Before Sunset does just that in a very simple and effective manner. I have become fond of Richard Linklater's ability and wisdom of seeming magic in what could have been meaningless in other hands. The growth of the relationship within the boundaries of time is as realistic as it can ever be, but unlike reality TV, this film possess an artistry filled with beauty. Bravo! The acting was very natural. Choices were made by the demand of the previous moment rather than for the mere Eggo. Both actors were very much into what they were doing. The listened to each other and really heard one another. Cinematography could have been easily sacrificed if it were not for the wisdom to let the actors do their thing and you just there to record. Great job everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great start - poor finish!,"I saw and liked Before Sunrise when it first came out. It was a watchable romantic-comedy without being exceptional. I only saw it because of limited film choices at that time. I guess I had a broader range of films to see when the sequel Before Sunset came out and only saw it recently because the high IMDb user rating sparked my interest.First off, it is better than the original. It's been the case with several movies that the sequel bettered the original e.g. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Spider-Man 2, LOTR: Return of the King and (I know I'm stirring up some controversy) The Godfather - 2.Before Sunset starts out very well. We are given a short and sweet recap on the events of Before Sunrise. You can comfortably watch Sunset without having seen the original. We then have Celine and Jesse walking through Paris chatting and catching up on their lives. They also take a short boat ride on the Seine and eventually a car ride to Celine's flat while continuing their conversation.The entire film is a conversation between two people with no action. What makes the film unique is that the conversation sounds very natural, the kind of conversation two normal, intelligent people who click would have. That, plus the beauty of Paris makes this very viewable and romantic. We have a bombshell or two dropped along the way about what the two have been up to in the past nine years. It adds to audience interest and the complexity of where they find themselves vis-a-vis each other.Sunset comes badly undone in the last 10 minutes. The moment Celine starts singing ""Let me sing you a waltz"" and mimicking Nina Simone, the film nosedives. The conversation becomes unreal and forced where throughout the movie it had seemed so natural. The ending was a cop-out. The story needed to find an end and me being a noir fan, you can guess what end I would have preferred.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Before Sunset: Still don't see the appeal,"The first of two critically acclaimed sequels to the critically acclaimed Before Sunsrise (1995) see's us catching up with Jesse & Celine 9yrs later.I found the first to be a dull, slow, ""Talkie"" film with little appeal and claim the same here. I simply do not see the attraction at all.Hawke is unlikeable again, Delpy is devoid of the charm she had in the first and the whole film feels like a desperate attempt to cash in on the popularity of the first with yet another ambiguous finale.I like the idea of the simplicity behind both films, I guess I just didn't appreciate the lines of conversation or the way they ended them both.I believe the films would have been a lot more appealing if they'd both shut the hell up, strapped a go-pro camera on and just given us 90 minutes of of the wonderful country and it's architecture.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sublime and profound,"I saw BEFORE SUNSET as soon as it was released but never had even heard of BEFORE SUNRISE. But SUNSET stands alone and works alone. Having now seen SUNRISE - SUNSET is sublime in its even greater simplicity and its profundity. Linklater's even greater restraint in part 2 shows his total confidence in his creation and his astonishing actors. The frisson of engagement where all is in the subtext is just thrilling in both films, and, no, not everyone will get it, but for those that do, these movies affirm life and the power and subtlety of human love.Someone in the postings said that the movie is unrealistic! Yep! It's a movie! Yep, the ""real"" characters (whoever they might be!) wouldn't say fascinating things every second together but this is a movie capturing the essence of the invisible electricity between two ordinary people. Listen to how we actually speak in ""real"" life.... We bumble and rarely stick to the point. To allow Linklater to edit their story (in the writing and in the cutting room) to the essence is called film-making and it does not represent a lack of truth but a heightening and intensifying of the experience of the two characters - akin to their own memory of what happened to them.Thank God films like this get made, and for those that don't like them - go see the latest blockbuster of which there is an endless stream. The choice is between a bistro and McDonalds; a family run pensione or the Marriott. The vast majority choose the latter out of laziness, a lack of imagination and avoidance of risk. (Just the predictable story elements that Hollywood sticks to, to get the right demographics to get mass bums on seats.) Good luck to them.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
movie magic,"it is true that the original is one of those films you don´t want a sequel for but here it is and it may be even superior to the first film. however, that is not important insomuch as the protagonists have grown older and so have we. It just feels right and not contrived at all to have the two meeting again. It feels like this is just how it must have happened. Both films definitely stand on their own. Jessie and Celine are adults now, wise, mature but still, you can´t help feeling like a teenager while watching them because you root for them as much as for anyone who you have been friends with your entire life.Julie Delpy is one of the most amazing living creatures on earth, she may actually be an elf. the material is not what you may call typical cinema stuff as there is indeed much talking going on, however, the ending is pure movie magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Life on the screen as nobody has ever done it before!,"I saw ""Before Sunrise"" a few months before I saw ""Before Sunset"" and I was amazed by both films. ""Sunrise"" had this... youth! When everything is easy to be done, everything is possible and you're not holding back since you've never been hurt before. You are not afraid but you are living the moment. Maybe I saw the film when I was at the correct age... I'm close to the age that Jess and Celine were in the first film and I new that this could be real, that this could have happened to someone at that age! The way that both actors were on the first film was as they were connected somehow making it so real that you could caught yourself thinking and hopping that there will be a classic -Hollywood made- happy ending to make sure that's just a movie and nothing more! But no, no compromise whatsoever! And now to ""Sunset"" which starts with both characters acting awkward, playing hide and seek. They are now older, 9 years older, which make every person change a lot and they are both afraid each other. You need less than 15 minutes in the movie and you realise that you feel like the first movie, but now is even better! You are sure that this is real life, you can easily be convinced that it's a home-made video or a movie based on a real life! As the minutes go by and you see them revealing themselves to each other once again after all this time you feel no acting but real feelings between them. The act of deception in all it's glory! Hawk and Delpy better than ever before and Linklater just brought reality in a way that no one could ever imagine as possible! If I had to chose a film to watch for full 24hours that would be it. Every time you see something more in it, something that makes it more real! One of the best films I've ever seen.... EVER!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
CLassy romantic movie 10/10,"Although I hadn't seen the prequel to this film, my date had and she filled me in on many details. The experience of the film would be enriched by having seen the previous film first, but it certainly stands on its own.It reminded me of one of my favorite movies of all time, ""My Dinner with André,"" in which only 2 characters talked for the entire film. In that movie, the friends had been close, drifted apart, and then had a brief reunion at a dinner. At that dinner, they caught up on what each other had been doing. André Gregory and Wallace Shawn played themselves and represented opposite sides of a dialectic, say romanticism against conventional reality. ""Before Sunset"" is parallel in many ways.In one sense, it is a romantic story -- two people used to be lovers and lost touch nine years ago. They meet again and spend an afternoon together. Will they decide to continue their relationship?We also have the charm of conversation and exploration, reminiscing, feeling out what we have in common and finding out what we have in common now. - where has this individual been? - what are they capable of? Can that other individual make decisions, and how much freedom do I have?Despite their ability to relate and talk, Celine and Jesse view the world and relationships differently -- Celine is more cynical and reserved, while Jesse is more open to settling for the ""not-perfect-but-good-enough.""Possibly there are a few people who have not had the personal experiences that at least somewhat relate to the premise in this film -- a relationship where one wonders, ""What would've happened if I had pursued it?"" but most people have. There is also the dilemma of meeting that person again but being involved in relationships of responsibility -- my family, my children, my current life. What would happen to them if I pursued my own happiness at the expense of theirs? Can I do that? Can I value my own happiness above theirs?In spite of the fact that the film doesn't answer these fundamental questions, it nevertheless brings them to our attention.I feel sure that Delpy and Hawke contributed greatly to the feeling of seamless, natural dialogue.Almost half of the voters gave it a 10/10 when I wrote this. For those of us in that group, it's fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lovely lovestory that keeps you wondering,"This is a movie that brings you back in history. Nine years ago the movie Before Sunrise made the girls fall in love with Ethan Hawke and the boys fall in love with Julie Delphy and all of us fall in love with European summer. Now, we get to know what happened after the couples brief encounter. The couple made a pact in the first movie to meet each other after six months. We now get know what happened with that. The beautiful couple now meet again, still beautiful but with more wisdom and bitterness. After a while we understand how much the brief encounter i Wienna really meant to them and their lovelies after that. For about 1 and a half hour the couple walks and talks about real stuff, the dialog is interesting and very honest. Ethan and Julie are truly believable. As an audience you want them to stay together forever, you ace for them. The ending is perfect. Thats all I'm gonna tell you about that!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
a feast for emotional romantics,"Well once u have seen Before Sunrise there is an innate curiosity to find out what happened in Dec in Vienna and Before Sunset not only answers the curiosity but creates one of its own through carefully well written dialogs and great screenplay. The movie is about coming together of two people who met each other a long time ago and fell in love but circumstances did not allow them to, they talk about politics, environment, love, sex, relationships but the feelings that evolve after meeting one another is what I feel is the USP of Before Sunset. If u see Before Sunrise and u come to know that there is a sequel to it u will go for Before Sunrise before too long. Before Sunset goes well beyond weaving the emotional drama then its predecessor, and the question it asks of viewers towards the end is quite sentimental. Through an answer from Ethan at the start of Before Sunset the director seems to make his point of view of why keep the viewers in dilemma. The chemistry between the lead pair is superb and no wonder Julie and Ethan were actively involved in dialog writing for the movie. The ten yr gap between the two movies seem to be well thought out in the script as well as well as the makeup of the artists. The movie is not for those who cannot stand the marathon dialogs between same two characters for a continuous period of one and a half hours. After seeing the movie you seem to be looking for the next sequel and whether we will get another romantic fiesta from Ethan, Julie and company is a question that remains in mind for the viewers",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
50/50,"if you're into listening to other people's life long conversations, then you might be into this movie, but if you're looking for anything more than a walk around Paris, then I wouldn't even consider watching this film. The characters were very interesting, which might make the story interesting to some people because it's usually the characters that make the story interesting. It doesn't obey by standard romantic drama films. It is simple and the action/conversation is more realistic. But, on the other hand, if you're looking for that standard of romance in which the two engage in a wild ride of romance, you are going to be disappointed because at this point in the story, that happened already...9 years ago. So I suggest renting something more of the standard persuasion.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Did Celine actually read Jesse's book or not?,"The beginning of this movie where Celine and Jesse talk about Jesse's book was very confusing because Celine can't decide if she actually read Jesse's book or not. At first she comes to Jesse and asks questions like ""how did you describe me in the book?"" or ""did we meet 6 months later in your book"" as if she hasn't read the book but a few minutes later she starts complaining about how she was portrayed as a neurotic in the book and how she didn't like the way he told some of the stories in the book. A few minutes later she asks questions about the book again as if she never read it. She can't decide if she actually read the book or not. There were several lines implying that she never read the book and several others where she says she read it and even calls out specific details in the book.It felt like most of the dialogue in this movie was impromptu as opposed to pre-determined so there were many inconsistencies in how characters spoke and they couldn't seem to remember what they said earlier and kept contradicting themselves all the time.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing but a waste of time...,"First of all, let me state that I'm a sucker for romantic movies. Romeo & Juliet, The Notebook, Titanic... you name them! But this movie, wow. How can you NOT be disappointed ? The worst thing is seeing it having a high rating here on IMDb and being on the ""Best Movies"" list. Something HAS to be wrong here. The people who give it a 10 out of 10 obviously have some issues.Since I've never heard of a first movie based upon these 2 characters, I did not see it (Before sunrise) so maybe this didn't help. But how on earth do people appreciate or waste money on this ? This is by far, the most awful movie I have ever seen in my life. The only thing they do is talk talk talk and NOTHING happens. I thought it was going to be like this for 15 or 20 minutes ? No, for 80 minutes ! How on earth can you make a movie out of 2 people having a boring conversation ? I didn't even ""feel"" the chemistry between these two.A total waste of time and money, for the people who MADE this movie and for the people (who like me) wanted to see this.

Best movie of all time for me!,"Firstly i would like to express my disbelief about the rating this movie has received here: an 8.0/10, and the same as 'Before Sunrise'? You've have got to be kidding me!!!! And I cannot believe that it hasn't won an Oscar either, for me this is hands down the best movie ever made in Hollywood.As for the movie, it has so many dimensions that are imperative; it is difficult to pinpoint one single aspect of the movie as the most overriding one. Yet, this movie conveys one simple message: the importance of youth. Life is only worth living when you are young at heart, it does not depend on age. Jesse and Celine are living miserably because they have forgotten what it means to be 'young', even though they are very successful in their lives. Youth is better understood by those who have passed (and lived through it)it than those who are living it. Love is better understood by people who have loved, and lost it. This is the simple reality, and this movie tells us that.What makes this movie far superior to its predecessor is the fact that the actors have matured, and are understanding youth/love better than they did in the first movie. This is evident by every sentence Jesse says, every look Celine gives; simply stunning. I have loved before, and lost her: i feel myself not only compatible with Jesse but Jesse himself. Everything that comes out of Jesse's mouth is what i have said to my love.As for the movie itself, the setting that it takes place in could not have been better: Paris. It is every person's fantasy to go there. The lighting is great, and everything else to. About the movie, the way it has connected the beginning to the finish is amazing. The way Celine dances in the end is exactly the same way Jesse described it in the beginning of the movie. I was extremely sad at the end of the movie, as to how little time Jesse had to capture the magic in Celine's apartment. The playing of the song was a brilliant idea, as well as how she dances in the end. Jesse's reactions in the end are precious (even though they hurt so much, when he's realizing what a life of misery he's lived in the past 9 years). He doesn't want to leave her, but life is not like that. He has a kid, wife, responsibility and everything else that he needs in his life; without the one thing he truly longs for: youth. Unfortunately, life is like that.Each and every moment that Celine and Jesse had together in this movie was a moment to savor. Unfortunately, time is of the essence and not on their side.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
when the moments strike again,"A very sensitive but forward approach to take a lead on the prequel... but more than extending the story , its an extremely realistic treatment to the conflict of feelings and emotions which we may or might not deny to confront everyday.If somebody touches you truly and deeply , time and space would never change the effect that person has on you. This is more pronounced by the evidence that the external changes(the shape of your life ,your deeds and the people added/deleted ) wouldn't deviate the line of sight somebody has for your true self!!! High five to the makers again for bringing this out so subtly!Again , its commendable that the dialogues , making noise through the streets of Paris would so beautifully keep you digging to the screen. The curiosity element of the movie is alive all through and even after it. The freedom of imagination is an added feature which leaves it unbiased and non-judge-mental!The prequel is good but this is more appealing as it traces a journey we all live through but mess up with due to our own contortions!A must watch...but NOT BEFORE YOU WATCH THE SUNRISE! :)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simplicity at Its Best,"I think a lot about the original and the sequel of the movie is said in the title. ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" are about this short period of time in everyone's life, when we are at our most conscious, most creative, most open to life and full of expectations. Hopes that each day will enrich us, present us with new and exciting opportunities, that it will bring us closer to that perfect image of us that we first had when we were five.However, the sequel is more about the specific moment in life when we have already realized that we aren't anywhere closer to that perfect image; that life has already peaked for us without us properly understanding when and why and that it has began its inescapable decline.What makes this film a masterpiece, like no other, is its simplicity. It is a multi-layered film, without layers-a simple idea (a long wished for reunion of two disillusioned souls), faultless acting and what's important in life dialogue.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An impressive addition to Before Sunrise as Linklater proves once again that he has what it takes when a script is needed to carry a film.,"I purposely waited over a space of about 11 months in-between viewing Before Sunrise and Before Sunset (they were after all made nine years apart) in order to create some sort of feeling; some sort of atmosphere; some sort of reaction. Although this tactic required patience and tolerance, I feel it actually worked in a way. What made it a reality is when you first get a glimpse of the character of Celine (Delpy) and then Jesse's (Hawke) hilarious reaction. I myself recently met up with someone who means rather a lot to me; I hadn't seen her for the best part of a year and although our rendezvous was actually planned; Before Sunset's encounter really was all about the girl seeking out the guy and surprising him in the shop so although I can't relate to Jesse's surprise as he wasn't expecting her; I can relate to his emotions of reunion.I mentioned in my review of Before Sunrise the feeling of luck and chance that was evident (and pretty much acted as the theme for the film) and also the atmosphere of 'fly on the wall' film-making  it was unlike anything I'd ever seen in an English speaking film before but Before Sunset feels more cinematic; it feels more like it's a film with a setting, characters and a script but I do not mean this as criticism it merely proves what a good director Linklater is when it comes to his own universe of films. If he had done what he did before with Before Sunset, he would have pretty much made the same film as he did nine years ago and that wouldn't have been good.What I liked about this film more than its elder brother is the feeling that we know the characters and I felt more settled with the exchanges flying to and fro. The characters repeat to one another what they've done in the nine years in-between films without actually showing it meaning you have to listen to catch up. This happens quite early on and thus; draws you in immediately as a film that's dialogue driven like this one has to have the audience hooked from the start and the back stories are a great piece of nostalgia; not only for the characters but also for us: the viewers who also want to know what's happened to them.When these two people talk, they deal with issues only people who know each other or have shared something very special together can talk about. In the first film; these issues that revolve around first loves, what you look for in a partner, etc. were dealt with in a rather colloquial manner that I found a little odd as they'd only really known each other for half an hour and had only met on a train through a chance encounter, but here it fits perfectly since they actually know, remember and probably love each other.The film makes good use of its location in Paris as it did in Before Sunrise with Vienna and it really doesn't seem like its only 77 minutes short. The long takes and nothing-ness dialogue make it so that it feels like the whole day goes past but again, this isn't a bad thing as it's 'this kind of film'. If you can look past the way the characters overreact nearer the end and some of the 'filla' in the script at various times; you'll find a film that comes close to adding a new definition to the genre of 'Romantic/Comedy'.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Art, movies, love, sex, dialogues, conversations, music and theater? Is that why society sometimes condemns art forms of sorts? To prevent a movement of unpredictable thought? An artist, like a person inlove with symptoms often operates in a dream world like a Henri Rouseau painting, this state is comforting and discomforting to the individual, and this discomfort often results in chaos which is artwork.

This movie contains little more than A and B long shots, which to you non-film uber-nerd folks means person A talking and then person B talking for long takes with few or no cuts.

Therefore, all this movie contains is talking between the two characters for about an hour an a half on any mundane subject from religion to love to world pollution to politics and on and on and on and on.

Hello Young Lovers - Part Deux,"I was surprised how many in the audience of ""Before Sunset"" had not seen the previous ""Before Sunrise"" as I didn't think it was possible to follow it, let alone appreciate the dialogue, stand-alone.This ""Part Deux,"" as it takes place in instantly recognizable Paris, contains less explanatory flashback material than the consequently essential trailer did, as the premise for the movie is a specific ""what if?"" portend of future potential regret that Ethan Hawke's Jesse used to seduce Julie Delpy's Celine for a night around Vienna almost ten years ago.  How can someone who hasn't seen the first film judge the tricks memory may be playing on each character if you don't know what you remember really happened?It is a wonderful premise and creative writing collaboration among director Richard Linklater and the stars to have the characters revisited in the real time of being older in a real time conversation that is filmed a la Eric Rohmer, like his ""Les Rendez-vous de Paris.""The movie carries an additional subtext that shadows the characters and adds to the complexity.  Back in 1995, Hawke was at his most earnestly, shaggily adorable and Delpy was an up-and-coming starlet.  But now we've seen Hawke rise to an Oscar nomination, as well as a novelist like Jesse, while becoming tabloid fodder for the break-up of his family with Uma Thurman, and he bears a gaunt, haunted, shorn look.Delpy has during this time only surfaced occasionally to American audiences, so that her strong, luminous character here is particularly captivating and believable as a professional activist as well as a songwriter (quite sweet on the soundtrack and probably on her own CD, too) and you simply can't take your eyes off her.  She nicely counters the image of her delicate beauty with frank exchanges and well-kicked profanity.Elements of the premise have been done to exaggerated comic effect in the Western satire ""From Noon Till Three"" Neil Simon's ""Same Time Next Year"" and ""The Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions barbares),"" but this feels natural.Where the earlier movie had the charm of a late night, dorm room bull session resonant of  the potentials of youth, this one is an amusing probing of protective defenses to honestly reveal thwarted, older and trying to be wiser expectations as they circle each other to consider once again grabbing what could be the brass ring amidst the complicated real lives they have built.This ending is as deliciously open-ended as the first and I look forward to revisiting Jesse and Celine ten years hence.",,Anonymous,Romance

One Perfect Day In Paris,"I saw this film 4 weeks ago on a Cable channel in Australia. I just happened to watch it on an off chance, and within minutes of the movie starting,I got completely absorbed in it. The movie was simply told, but the story was anything but simple. It was one of the best films I have seen so far! The entire movie was shot in a few scenes, and with a moving camera. All the two characters do is talk to each other.Jesse and Celine have met after a 9-year hiatus. Jesse is an American and Celine is French. They met in their early twenties in Italy. After a brief Romance, they agree to meet again in 6 months in the same place, but due to Celine's grandmother passing away she is unable to make it. But we find out that Jesse did come, and years later he writes a book about the incident. This compels Celine to come to his book signing in Paris,(which is where she lives),as she identify's that the story he wrote is about their liaison.After they meet they start talking about their current lives and it is revealed that neither of them are blissfully happy in their respective circumstances. Jesse who is married, obviously is not in love with his wife anymore IF he ever was, and appears never to have got over Celine, and Celine, who never got married, appears never to have got over Jesse either. Neither of them where able to forget the romantic ideal that they had held for the other.The day that they spend together walking around Paris gives us an insight into the characters and their mindsets. It also fills us in on their first meeting, and what happened consequently, and also their present lives and the dissatisfaction they have in the same. I just loved the way this story was told, one afternoon, two people, good conversation, and no embellishments. Some of the conversations where SO normal, that you didn't feel like they where constructed dialogue at all. As the day progresses their conversations become increasingly honest. Almost painfully so, and many things about their depth of feeling for each other is revealed.Ethan Hawke was at his best in this film. His performance was honest and heartfelt. I loved it, and Julie Delpy's performance was equally good. They had a great on screen chemistry that added to the authenticity of the story.The story basically ends ambiguously, and it is up to us to decide if they are going to get together this time or not? We are convinced by the end of this afternoon that Jesse and Celine are meant for each other. We are left hoping that they feel the same!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simplicity.,"""Before Sunset"" is so very simple. There are only two actors and only one simple story. But that story will crawl into your heart and stay there, sipping its camomile tea, listening to street musicians and wondering if true love really exists. Because the story knows it does, but it just wants to make you wonder too...Basically the movie is about two people who meet again, both thinking the other had forgotten about what they shared a long time ago. They just walk and talk, discovering a lot, sharing a lot and probably deciding a lot. Might sound cheesy, but it's worth every penny and every minute spent on it. Don't miss it for the world.Truly an unique movie experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very unique and a beautiful love story with an interesting dialogues,"When I watched this film I had no idea about its first part. This was probably the first movie I felt in love with and also the one I've watched the most times. Then I was informed about the first part and watch it also but I think the second part is still the best, not even mentioning the third one.This second part is basically the conversation between two characters. The man and the women are talking about bunch of different things which are happening in their life but there conversations are really meaningful and interesting.So, that's a love story.

"The second of three ""Before..."" movies","(2004) Before Sunset
DRAMAThe second of three movies starring Ethan Hawke as Jesse and Jule Delpy as Celine who reunite again after 10 years apart, Jesse a book author and he stops by chance while book signing somewhere in France, and the two then continue their captivating conversations regarding their views about marriage, the world etc... The idea is simplistic yet interesting since the dialogue is improvised and we the viewers want to know what they're going to say since they're two respected actors in the business. Although it's a continuation of ""Before Sunrise"" made in 1995, viewers don't need to remember anything about from the first movie, and still be able to be immersed by their point of views just because we don't know what to expect them to say. Both Hawke and Delpy are given writing credits along with the director of the movie Richard Linklater.

Stunning - another snapshot of life in your 30s,"Loved the first film and this second film was just as good. Surprisingly short, yet shot in 'real time', the acting is strong and the script is a magnificent piece of work.Some may feel that this was more mature than the first film, but in ways, that's how it should be. The film is completely about two characters and the world around them is passingly incidental. However, years have gone by and they are now in their 30s, dealing with concepts of marriages and relationships that are running into difficulties and pondering questions of faithfulness to practicality vs daring pursuit of happiness... and perhaps fate.Could not take my eyes off the film and the ending hits the mark perfectly. I particularly loved how the performances were top notch and natural, nothing went 'over the top' and the dialogue captures the spirit of the first film without trying hard to reproduce or 'go own better'.Highly recommended and this ""Before..."" series is magic and moving, as is the scenery and direction. Surprised that it's an American production. Can't wait to see the final installment and Boyhood.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Charming and Fun,"Before Sunset is the sequel to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, and is equally amazing. The on-screen chemistry between Ethan Hawke (as Jesse) and Julie Delpy (as Celine) alone makes them worth watching. In the first installment, the two characters meet on a train in Europe and end up walking around Vienna together for the rest of the day. At the end of the film they decide to meet again in six months at the same train station. The second film is set nine years later. Jesse has written a book about their time in Vienna, and is on the last day of his tour in France. Celine meets him after the book signing, and they spend the remaining time together until his flight leaves. Before Sunset retains the casual banter and romance from the first film, but it's more serious and less fanciful. It shows how the two have grown up, which is shown through their many conversations throughout the film.",,Anonymous,Romance

No, the truth is that I wasn't expecting an ending, I was too occupied immersed in the story. It just mesmerized me the acting of Ethan and Julia, you end up thinking that all that stuff that it's happening is real.. their facial expressions, the reactions.. man, I just loved it.

Believable (though unlikely) love story,"Being that this starred Ethan Hawke, it wasn't hard to convince me to see this. I had heard some ""rumor"" of this being a follow up to another film but I paid little attention.Truth be told, this is a brilliant film. I'm not quite sure which part is the best - the subtle acting or the casual conversation in which this film is written. From the very first instant, the audience is drawn into the story as a sort of ""fly"" who happens to be listening to two long lost friends and lovers. Both Hawke and Delpy are so comfortable and casual with each other that you feel as though this really happened and is not just some movie.Hilariously witty dialogue and true to life observations, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. There is a definite passion that emits from both actors, creating an even stronger sense of belief in the possibility of this happening.

The space between words.,"As with its predecessor, 'Before Sunset (2004)' is at its most successful when it focuses on the relationship between its two core characters, this time painting it as a painfully accurate reunion. This focus on 'what could've been' and 'what may be yet to come' is where the piece really shines, crafting a palpable dynamic between its two long-lost lovers and giving the story a strange sense of suspense. Of course, a seventy-five-minute conversation is going to meander. This is especially noticeable when the topics of conversation turn to philosophising, with changes in direction sometimes being as drastic as going straight from ""how are you?"" to ""do you believe in god?"". When this is the case, the dialogue reflects the writers far more than the characters - I mean, you can practically hear Linklater saying some of this stuff - and the experience is worse for it. Still, it's all remarkably compelling for what it is. Despite being slightly theatrical, it feels incredibly 'real' as compared to others in the genre. There are no grand gestures or arbitrary break-ups, there's just an excellently evolving relationship. It's also great how the space in-between words is sometimes as important as the words themselves, indicative of subtle writing that really knows what it's doing. Overall, it's about as good as it's predecessor. As an experiment, it works rather well. It's not always the most engaging affair but it often makes you smile and it has a decent pace considering it's a constant 'talk-fest'. The core relationship is what really keeps you watching and it really is one of the best in its genre. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Pinnacle for Disappointment,"This movie may be heralded at an anticipated sequel, but it is definitely a letdown for any expectation of any type of value other to be a sort of vouyer that takes pleasure in listening in on a conversation between two people with some severe emotional issues.I would say rent this movie(hopefully you did not pay to see it in a cinema yet) only if you are desperate for something to watch.Better yet, borrow it from someone if you can. You will be glad you did not pay to see it.The only people I can think of that would be even remotely entertained by this low budget and cheesy movie, are people that have problems talking to the opposite sex and want to see how silly they may appear to someone that might overhear what they say to others.",,Anonymous,Romance
More than just a romance,"This movie was absolutely amazing. I think it might strike a chord with many of us who feel for 'one special experience', or who feel 'lost' or 'stuck' in life or relationships. This isn't a flaky/surface romance; it runs extremely deep, and it is every bit as good or better than the original, only with a different flavor. It's the same type of blunt honesty between the characters as in the first film, and the chemistry is tangible.This film puts Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy back together about 10 years later, and the results are intriguing and incredible. The way these two interact is so genuine and pure; it sets the tone of realism laced with magic. The whole movie explores a build-up of feelings between them, with a sort of phony 'everything is fine' wall which slowly crumbles as the movie goes on, and with this journey, you see the cynicism and the experiences that have shaped them over time. There are some definite twists to the story, but they are realistic twists, and seem to be for realism's sake only, rather than for viewer appeasement. Whoever wrote this screenplay should receive an academy award, if they haven't.This movie runs so deep, it helps me rekindle beliefs of love, and challenges me to trust so much more in what I know is true in my heart. It really addresses the issue of how so many people get stuck and caught up in what they think society expects of them. They forget that the heart knows; the heart is what you start with as a child- it's what makes you yearn, desire, hope, and burn for someone; it is the essence of a human being.The characters demonstrate the cold logic that takes over with age, combined with a loss of the youthful hope from so many disappointments. You can really see these things in the characters, but there is a glimmer that really returns throughout their experience together. Julie Delpy truly threw herself into her role, and I can't help but think there is something more going on between her and Ethan Hawke; it almost seems too good to be true. Anyway, I gave this movie a 10. It deserves it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a sequel should be.,"Before Sunset is what a sequel should be. The actors and director got together because they wanted to continue with the story and there was more of a story to tell. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy show great dramatic range. Lest we forget that they also helped write the movie and that too provides another level to enjoy the film on. It doesn't drift into conventions, it makes its own rules. This film is what romantic movies should always be: true to life. It doesn't shy away from the fact that these two may not get together, it doesn't provide a simple answer. It asks the audience to take the journey with them. The last 20 minutes of this movie is some of the most honest, heartfelt, and emotionally draining moments I have seen in film. Looking forward to Before Sunrise 3 in 2013. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A simple but wonderful waste of time.,"Before Sunset is simply a movie of depth, a movie of reality. Stripped away are the special effects, the predictable-ness, and there stands the truth of life. This movie is of two people having a conversation. A spontaneous one. While this may sound boring it's real, when you talk to someone you don't plan out what you're going to say, there's no cue cards, it's interesting to see where their conversation leads them.Acting is not overdone, they were able to catch the awkwardness, the comfort level and the true feelings the two characters, Celine and Jesse had for each other, in their eyes. Brilliant.It's not a movie you'll remember for years and years. But it's a wonderful way to spend your sunset, or your sunrise. In many ways this surpasses the prequel.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Quite My Love Story,"From Before Sunrise to Before Sunset, my feelings about this story haven't changed. While both films are worth watching, they're not exactly my cup of tea.In Before Sunrise, I appreciated that the film felt different from the usual romance or drama movies. The simple premise-a boy and girl meet, share a connection, and part ways after a brief encounter-had a certain charm. But for me, its simplicity made the story feel shallow and a bit surface-level. Some scenes felt unrealistic, like when they decided not to exchange numbers or addresses before going their separate ways. It felt more contrived than natural, making it hard for me to relate.The dialogue was clearly the heart of the film, but it was hit or miss. While some parts were interesting, others felt overly pretentious and repetitive. The characters seemed eager to unload every thought they had, and after a while, it became tiring. I struggle to enjoy films where the characters spend most of the time talking about themselves without much happening.Moving on to Before Sunset, I found the story a bit more engaging. It brought up intriguing questions: What happened to them after their first meeting? How have their lives changed? Would their connection still be there? These questions added a layer of complexity that the first film lacked. The characters also seemed more mature, discussing deeper topics that felt more meaningful. I liked this growth, but their chemistry still felt overly idealistic at times-like they were living in a fantasy that needed a dose of reality.However, the film eventually fell into the same pattern as the first. The conversations became repetitive, and the lack of variety made it feel monotonous. The ending, while somewhat fitting, felt anticlimactic and unsatisfying. Honestly, I think Before Sunrise and Before Sunset could have been combined into a single film with a proper resolution to their story.Overall, I'd give Before Sunset a 6/10, slightly higher than Before Sunrise at 5/10. While I respect what these films tried to do, they just weren't for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Leaves you with this depressing notion that no matter where life takes you, you will always be disappointed and unsatisfied...","The sequel to the adorable and dreamy Before Sunrise from 1995, Before Sunset meets the original film's characters, American writer Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French social activist Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years in the future, in the year 2004. The turn of the century definitely made it's impact on our two heroes, as did the turns of time. Now being 32 years old (as opposed to 23, the character's age in the first film), they are both much more mature and much less naive about what life has to offer them. Sure, on the outside they both made it well: Jesse is married with a child he thinks the world of, and is just visiting France during a PR tour for his recent published best seller (loosely based on his night with Celine, by the way). Celine, on the other hand, is engaged in a meaningful relationship as well, and after living several years in the states, where she finished her second degree, she is now an active member in several environmental organizations. Alas, underneath the surface, they are both aching inside. Neither of them is happy with the life he or she is leading, and they both find themselves compromising in cozy relationships and careers, with the memory of that mid-90's night still very much alive in their hearts and minds.This time around, Jesse and Celine stroll around Paris rather than Vienna, and as much as this city is beautiful and filled with inspiration perhaps even more then Vienna, it is something we have seen in many films as well, and the cinematography doesn't really indicate something new about the city. As opposed to Sunrise, the two lost souls now only have time until Sunset to catch up with each other, when Jesse's flight back to the states leaves. They spend their few hours together talking about their 1994 rendezvous and how it altered their lives, then exchanging their mutual disappointment from the twists and turns of life, touching numerous social ideals on the way.Sunset deals with some interesting concepts of second chances and becoming sober from all sorts of promiscuous ideals one might have as a young individual. It is a mature, self-aware film, that meets our heroes now leading a much more realistic, yet extremely disappointing, life style. While all this might add up to a positive overall viewing of this feature film, I myself found it to be quite anti-climatic in comparison with Before Sunrise. Since I know real life is often depressing, and rarely leads one to his true calling of his heart, I often turn to movies in search of a more escapist experience, that'll shed some light on my life, rather than paint my future in very bleak colors. As a 25 year old young adult currently writing this review, I would like to think that life has more to offer than yearning for some old sweetheart while watching my years fade away. Whilst Jesse eventually gets his second chance to meet Celine in Before Sunset, the movie never really lets you know what happens with them afterward, and instead leaves you with this depressing notion that no matter where life takes you, you will always be disappointed and unsatisfied for large periods of times. Being such a stubborn dreamer, you would have to excuse me for not buying into this perspective of life (yet?).For what it's worth, I could have been much more satisfied have I had only seen the first installment of this love story, being left with much hope and desire, rather than being faced with the biting reality in the second installment.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is a movie built almost entirely out of dialog,"This is a movie built almost entirely out of dialog, and it's real good! The acting, too, I caught myself halfway through the movie becoming seriously attracted to Julie Delpy's characterI think I love heran example of the acutely tuned acting in the movie is the scene in which they approach the bench and then sit on it for a while, the gestures that express a desire to touch checked by hesitation, held backas he is physically holding back, she is doing so emotionally, contriving a casual attitude towards their night spent together 9 years earlier, towards the hopes and fears which have grown inside her since that night and which for her are connected with that night and with him. And their conversation is just full of compelling thoughts and ideas; it raises to the surface large and latent feelingsI am not referring to their desires to solve world issues, but rather to the more personal thoughts that come out suddenly and wake some sleeping impression in methey spend long stretches in moderately stimulating discussion, and then, he or she will say something that they've been thinking about all along, this constitutes the ebb and flow of the film's energy, it's what makes it dynamicif the world was ending tomorrow and I knew it, ""I probably wouldn't want to talk about the environment, or my bookI'd still want to talk about magic in the universeonly I'd want to do it in a bed in between intense love making sessions with you.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A tour of Paris, and two peoples' minds.","Ultimately, a satisfying little movie; even for a late 50's non-romantic, such as myself. Congratulations to the two principals for carrying the entire movie on the strength of one nonstop dialogue....indeed, I have never seen a movie that even attempted such a premise. Hawke and Delpy actually carry it out. I was tired, and listened to much of the first half of the movie with my eyes closed. Yes, I might have even nodded-off for a few minutes. But the thread of dialogue kept my interest up enough that I had to start watching at about the same time the two were at Notre-Dame Cathedral. Now I know I don't need to see Paris - this movie was the ultimate travelogue of the River Sienne. The shoreline promenade evoked memories of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" and it's dramatic end. Now that I think about it, I doubt they really had such elaborate concrete work in the days of the French Revolution, only in the Liam Neeson movie of it. Funny, how the setting had such a timeless aspect to it. Anyway, I digress....could they have pulled-off this eighty-five minute conversation (in real time: probably about three hours of relationship time) on a blank sound stage, without the beautiful backdrop of Paris to enhance their every word? Only with your eyes closed.Strange, that the writers and principals would decide to reprise the original movie, nine years afterward. It works well, and has a very credible feel to it. I suspect that this one will be ""an all time favourite"" of many a young, sophisticated, and well-educated female; it's niche audience is most certainly in the female dormitories of many a college campus.

Captures the moment,"I have been aware of this movie, and it's good reviews, for a long time before I ever decided to watch it -- for the simple reason that I don't particularly like the look of Ethan Hawke's face (he looks like an addict).However, I must confess, it was a very good movie. This is the only movie I can recall ever having seen in which there are no time-cuts; the movie is 77 minutes long, both in runtime and in ""movie-time."" In every other movie I have ever seen, there exists a story, and then it's like the story is run through a series of un-reality filters to crunch it into a certain amount of time, and distort reality in such a way as to make the characters seem more dramatic and more real than real life, while at the same time being very unreal if you actually think about it.

"A Magical, Elegiac Continuation Of ""Before Sunrise""","Notice that I said ""continuation"", as opposed to ""sequel"", which is mostly a Hollywood term applied to cashing in on the success of an original film. There is nothing ""commercial"" about Richard Linklater's inventive, playful, wistful, and ultimately piercing story of two people many of us felt a deep cinematic bond with in the first film. For everyone who was content and beguiled by the aching ambiguity of the ending of ""Before Sunrise"", who felt no need to explore what became of Jesse and Celine, I think it's safe to say that our hearts still yearned to see them together. What ""Before Sunset"" does so beautifully is to show the effect of time on these two soul mates, how young love and youthful idealism have given way to life's weary compromises and bittersweet memories of what might have been. The torrent of glorious dialogue is back, only this time it's as remarkable for what is not said as much as what should be said. Jesse and Celine circle around each other with small talk, a rudimentary update of their lives in the intervening 9 years that slowly, irrevocably, and anxiously builds up to confessional regret. To see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy again 9 years later is like running into two dear old friends we haven't seen in a long time. Their rapport and chemistry together is extraordinary. To those who feared this film would somehow diminish the specialness of the original, it feels like an unequivocal homecoming. And the true miracle is it leaves you wanting more. Something tells me that many of us will never get enough of Jesse and Celine, and in that creative spirit, I'm sure Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy have Truffaut's ""Antoine Doinel"" films with Jean-Pierre Leaud, and Michael Apted's ""7-up"" series well in mind. For the time being, we have this wondrous little film to be thankful for.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointed,"I love Richard Linklater. He's a terrific filmmaker who's made some of my favorite films. I think Waking Life is absolutely brilliant. However, in my opinion, he's also made some duds. But that is the price of pushing the envelope and I don't want to discourage that. I too thought that Before Sunrise was a warm and wonderful film. I'm a huge Julie Delpy fan. I think the idea of having the actors from the original film contribute to the screenplay of the sequel is inspired. Bravo Richard, Bravo! I love that about you. What I didn't love was the result. Basically it didn't go anywhere. Flat beginning, middle and end. No magic. Maybe that is what it was trying to convey, the loss of magic, inability to recapture the magic. But why make a film about that? Why end the story of these two characters on a down note? You should have avoided the sequel and let us imagine a better future for them.I wouldn't be writing this except that I was perusing the top 250 list and was shocked to find this on it. Now I accept the fact that the list contains goofy choices and omits some outstanding films. I'm used to that. But, WOW! Its just getting wackier.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not bad . . . not great either.,"As mentioned in the summary line, this movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.What I liked: The movie takes a risky gamble by really being a simple dialogue between two people as they meander through Paris. I liked the feeling of being right there with them as they spoke. Although the camera angles were simple, it was still portrayed in a way that really got me involved as not only a viewer, but more of as a participant.What I didn't like: I never really felt much of a connection between the characters. Although the director did well in getting me involved in the movie, I never felt that characters had much of a connection. Some of the dialogue was trying to show how a conversation between two people who haven't seen each other for a long time would really go, but it came across to me as a bit cheesy.Overall: If your looking for a romantic film I would say skip this one. To me it was simply an hour long conversation between two old friends that never quite got anywhere.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good movies,"This is a composite review of both ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"". I suppose there will be some ""spoilers"".The first movie introduces 2 characters Jesse and Celine who meet up in a train en-route to Vienna. They feel a connection and decide to take a tour of the city together. The movie chronicles their tour and ends with them going their separate ways. Throughout the movie, both Jesse and Celine talk & exchange viewpoints. As they see the world in very different ways, there are a lot of enlightening conversations about life, death, the state of the world at the time etc.The second movie picks up nine years after Jesse and Celine's original trip to Vienna. Jesse is now married with a son and has authored a book based on his experiences with Celine. During a book tour ending in Paris, he meets Celine once again and once again they roam around the city sparking up a variety of conversations. The director leaves the ending deliberately ambiguous as to whether or not Jesse gets back together with her.Overall, while they do tend to drag sometimes, these 2 movies are very original and worth watching at least once, especially if you're sick of the hundred odd rom coms beating around the bush but admittedly the second one is not as good as the first.I would rate the movies individually Before Sunrise-8/10 Before Sunse-7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Before Sunrise Sequel is better,"The original movie, Before Sunrise, was okay but it seemed to drag and yet I had to keep watching these two people with a time limit on their relationship, if they even have a relationship. And then the ending was so ambiguous that my first thought was ""I hate this movie."" but then my second thought was ""Will then get together again? What happens next."" I just finished watching the sequel Before Sunset and it was even better. Then ending is still open but not as open as the first movie. Correction to the other review, the city that is the setting of Before Sunrise is Vienna, not Venice. While I wouldn't pick these as my all time favs I did enjoy going along on these two people's journey through time and life. I could connect with the characters and we all have that one relationship that we never quite got over and wonder what might have happened if only...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Movie I've Seen in Years,"I honestly can't remember the last time I was so affected by a movie. This is simply the most beautiful movie I've seen in years. What's more, it affected me very personally. It really forces you to reflect on your own life. Even with movies I love, my enjoyment is usually of a very abstract, aesthetic kind...I admire this or that thing, this bit of dialogue, the way that scene was lit. With Before Sunset, I can't even comment on it so bloodlessly. I felt like I was face to face with my own joys and disappointments when I was watching it. A masterpiece. Richard Linklater is probably the most gifted and humanistic director alive...which is strange, because he's so unprepossessing, and has no particular aura of auteurist holiness. (Bully for him). Film students are probably still more influenced by Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorcese than Linklater, which is a shame.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just connections between two human beings,"Just when you think Before Sunrise couldn't get any better, here comes Before Sunset.Again, these two talked for the entire 80 minutes and you won't even notice the city of Paris before the film draws to an end. Just talk. Connection between two human beings. There aren't many people in the world who you can talk with for hours and hours without feeling bored. So when you are lucky enough to meet some, try your best to keep them in your life, no matter what form the relationship takes and no matter what the relationship takes.

Soulmates Intersect and Wallow in Thoughtful What-Ifs,"I never thought 1995's ""Before Sunrise"" was any great shakes perhaps because the concept felt like a romantic conceit albeit an intelligently scripted one especially for a film about a couple of kids in their early twenties. Time has probably mellowed me, as I find director Richard Linklater's 2004 sequel an entertaining talkfest that pierces with certain life truths. Nine years after their life-altering brief encounter in Vienna, Jesse and Celine meet again in Paris. Now a successful first-time novelist on a book tour, he sees her show up at his final book signing at the famous Shakespeare & Co. bookstore, and after some hesitation, they pick up where they left off. Celine is now an environmental activist, and their conversation continues for nearly an hour and a half in real time, before Jesse is scheduled to catch a plane home to his wife and son. Linklater follows the lovers -- who had promised to reunite in Vienna in six months and never did -- from café to park to boat to an intense car ride to Celine's apartment. In a manner that seems even closer to Louis Malle's ""My Dinner With Andre"" than the first one, they spend the time talking about the passage of time, shifting ideals both political and romantic, harbored ambitions, unfulfilled desire, religion, sex and monogamy and inconsistent memories.Looking particularly aged compared to the flashbacks from the first movie, Ethan Hawke effortlessly captures the frustrated ennui of an unfulfilled artist, his romantic ideals reborn by this unexpected encounter. But it's Julie Delpy who more dexterously shows the subtle impact of her diminished expectations against her luminous former self, peaking with her visceral emotional breakdown in the car. She also shows herself to be a fine singer as she performs a plaintive waltz for Jesse at the end. The film is quite brief, just eighty minutes long, but it feels like the right length given the story's limited focus. Truth be told, there is still an air of self-indulgent pretension to some of their bantering, though I have come to accept the fact that this is a truthful aspect of their respective characters and the basis of their chemistry together. The fact that there is an easy, unforced air about their dialogue has a lot to do with Hawke's and Delpy's contributions to the script (they receive co-screen writing credit) and with the real rapport between the two actors. The DVD is relatively short on extras, for instance, there is surprisingly no audio commentary track, but there is a brief making-of featurette that helps provide the context of the story relative to the previous movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't Get It,"I really missed something with this film. Usually, when it gets so many raves, I end up loving it as well. I thought that the one on-going scene was annoying and that the characters were so completely self-absorbed that it ultimately turned me off. Ethan Hawke's answers at the beginning did not feel like real answers to me (""Isn't everything autobiographical?"" - What does that mean?), and Julie Delpy's role didn't seem personable or that deep. The dialog to me seemed so stilted that I got uncomfortable just watching the movie. The neat thing about this movie is that it really is centered on just those two characters. When that is done well, it can be riveting. But that makes it high risk - if you don't like the characters, there is nothing else in the movie. I didn't like the characters, so for me, the movie was a turn off.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
My poor little heart 💔,I rarely ever enjoy intense movies. I am more of a chick flick kinda person. But this movie just tore my heart.

A second chance (light light spoilers),"Wow, this is one of those rare Hollywood movies that makes you reflect on your own life, how different things might have been had small events in your past carried itself out differently. It is deeply moving and inspirational and ultimately about being fortunate enough to have a second chance.I really felt for the characters, and you feel blessed to know that they have been lucky enough to be given a second encounter.What is amazing about this movie is all the hidden language that is being communicated, gestures, hand movements, eye contact, all carefully thought out to communicate the things that are not said.What is being said IS deep and meaningful, but you get into a sort of trance where you are watching the movie unfold on two levels; on one level which is about dialogue, but on another emotional level which makes the movie an amazing journey and an incredible joy to watch.In short, cinematic perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Movie,"I'm not a big fan of romantic movies but 'Before' is in my opinion one of the best Drama/Romance trilogies of cinema and out of all three this one is my favorite. It is very simple yet so deep and meaningful that sticks in your mind for a while. The movie barely has plot but it captures you from the beginig till the end. Before Sunset as the other two movies is not just a love story, it's a movie about life. Two characters are demonstrated as two human beings with their own strengths and flaws just like all of us. Therefore, watching the movie and moving on with them and listening to their conversation during time is like taking a look back at our own lives and having chance to reinvestigate our thaughts about what actually matters in life. It's within those lines that the movie sets It's points. It reminds us that how small moments can change our lives. That how time can be cruel and forgiving at the same time and that you got to enjoy the ride not just looking forward to the destination. The atmosphere is similar to the first movie. However, dialogues wisely show the effect of time on Jessie and Celine to further develope their characters and their relationship. Performances are so natural that you reckon everything is spontaeous. The shooting and frames are beautiful and the movie finishes with a magical ending, keeps you wondering about what will hapen next.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Superb, extraordinary, radiant & rewarding.","Mr. Linklater, Mr. Hawke and Ms. Delpy have caught romantic lightning in a bottle with this delectable continuation of Celine and Jesse's life stories.Rich, ponderous, rewarding. Brave film-making. Courageous acting. It all deserves to be remembered and awarded.The two standout scenes. One is inside of the sedan with both Jesse and Celine making brief, mutually unnoticed, gestures to console one another. Each reaches out to touch the other but pulls back, hesitant to physically acknowledge what they are mentally feeling. The other is silent as they wind up an apartment building stairway.I saw this premiere at the LA Filmfest. The crowd seemed touched, but typically Los Angeles in not knowing quite what to do when confronted with a film so deeply felt.Superb, extraordinary, radiant and utterly, completely, hopelessly, hopefully romantic.A must see for those who believe that life is fullest in it's details, not it's broad strokes.",,Anonymous,Romance
Before Watching: Before Sunset (2004),"""Before Sunset"" (2004) is the sequel to ""Before Sunrise"" (1995) and follows Jesse and Celine as they meet nine years after their first encounter. Like its predecessor, Before Sunset a romantic movie, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:As with Before Sunrise, the emotional impact and reward from this movie comes from the level of resonance one experience with the characters - more dialogue will hit home, train of thoughts will be relatable, and they will undoubtedly be more sympathetic. Audiences younger or older risk losing a lot of value and emotional satisfaction because of this very reason.An important thing to be aware about is the tone in the dialogue. Before Sunset is cruder than its the prequel, and there are frequent gags and talk about sexual subjects which can risk upsetting conservative or sensitive people, or at least detract from the overall viewing experience. The moral grounds in itself is also quite loose, as it becomes more and more apparent throughout the runtime that Jesse and Celine are tempted by the thought of leaving their current partners for each other, which doesn't feel entirely in line with the people we got to meet in the prequel. This can be perceived as quite questionable.Finally, the resolution to this movie can also by some be perceived as unrewarding, as consequences are not really dealt with as consequences, or at least one in the same way as one would expect from the prequel. It is hard to say more before giving away the plot, but before watching Before Sunset, one could benefit more from being less conservatively consequential here than in Before Sunrise. Do remember, however, that this movie impacts you depending on how much you can relate with the life situation Jesse and Celine are in, and that nothing in this review thereby can be taken as a final say.My personal grade: a disappointing 6/10.

How they lie, and how they come up to each other after years, with pretension and masks. But also how they get comfort and settled eventually.

Great acting and connection kept after so long after,"It's nice to see this movie, a sequel to the great story presented in Before Sunrise (1995) about nine years apart. Having the sequel parted by so long of a distance, the movie adapted the circumstance and created a nice twist to continue on from Before Sunrise's ending. I like how the location is now in Paris, that most of the movie's length features the great sights of the great city; it's walkways and alleys between tall old buildings, the cruise on the river, and also of course the famous Parisian garden walkways. I also like how this time the movie ends more in conformity to what the audience will prefer more when they see how Before Sunrise ended. Yet I score this movie lower than its predecessor because the whole thing only feature a faster time than the former. I like how Hawke and Delpy still managed to stay consistent and kept their connection nicely, even after literally nine years.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
the intense beauty of emotional vulnerability,"As most may know, this movie takes place 9 years after the movie Before Sunrise, and takes place in real time. the characters of Jesse and Celine meet again, and in tentative and insecure steps, reveal to each other how much their fateful meeting affected the rest of their lives.it is touching and amazing to see these two actors portray this gentle unfolding with such talent and joy. it makes it more remarkable when the actors (in the Q&A after the screening) admit they rehearsed every scene over and over again, going over every moment and movement in detail. they make it seem effortless, natural, and smooth. it's a tribute to both the actors that the audience never feels that their reactions are contrived, nor does the conversation feel at all directed.whether you are a ""romantic or a cynic,"" as Linklater put it last night, ""you'll get something out of this.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Stealing back those hours that could have been...,"""Before Sunset"" is definitely one of those few select films which are great sequels to their predecessors. The funny thing is you don't ever feel inclined to critique such films, you just want to bask in its sunlit perfection, walk with the characters in the eternal city of Paris and get lost in a reverie. It's like a capsule of time taken out of the entangled lives of these two dislodged yet strangely connected souls, a page in their journal. You seem to project those unexplained emotions in your heart in the brilliantly portrayed characters, lose yourself in the meandering by- lanes of Paris and the words and repartee of the protagonists and you realize slowly with the characters the cost of missed opportunities and those painful could-have-beens. Despite the expected pragmatic, mature tones of the characters neither Jesse nor Celine could fully escape the effects of that intoxicating night at Vienna all those years back as we are left to imagine how it must have been in that original moment for it reverberate through the rest of their life leading up to Paris. And just like before, they set out to create another litany of vignettes that will surely go on to have repercussions in their lives. At the end you feel like it's the perfect sequel to ""Before Sunrise"", like you have always imagined Jesse and Celine to steal a few lost hours from the eternal flow of time and continue the conversation they had 10 years back in Vienna. The script, the walk and talk shoot, Nina Simone and that waltz song goes on to show the burgeoning brilliance of Linklater, ably assisted by Ethan and Julie. Echoing Jesse at the beginning of the movie here's the perfect test to examine if you are a romantic or a cynic - if you love Before Sunset you are bound to be a true romantic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Haunting, Entrancing, every bit as wonderful as its already cult status indicates","What can I say about Before Sunset? Haunting, Entrancing, every bit as wonderful as its already cult status (only one year old now) indicates. Ethan Hawke, gaunt, hunched and withered, and Julie Delpy, wiser and better, accidentally (or did fate set it up?) meet up a decade after their previous single day together to spend another day reliving it, and catching up with a decade that they eventually realize was all about that one day. What a love story this is! No love-making, but intelligent conversation that is orgasmic, covering the environment, Buddhism, the modern self, psychotherapy, relationships, America and Americans, sex and gender, God  pretty much everything that young people care about in ones and share about in twos. This is an even better film than the first one, sharper and tighter, and benefiting from the ground laid down by it, so that we now care so much more deeply for this couple that were essentially strangers to us the first time around. America meets Europe again here, as the couple walk around talking over Parisian backdrops that are not at all hard to look at. This is a must see, but only after you've seen Before Sunrise. I loved these two films with only a day in between viewing them. What would it have been to have seen Before Sunrise when it first came out and to then see Before Sunset a decade later?

Solid movie but little overrated,"Given the type of film and the fact that this is a sequel, I mentally prepared myself for what the film would look like. This is a movie where two people literally just talk for an hour and twenty minutes. The topics are various, but since this is not their first meeting, then some things gain weight. From the conversation we learn their current situation and they referred to an event from the last film. I think the actors have improved (they're nine years older here after all) so I felt their emotion. The problem is that the real film only starts somewhere in the middle of the film, until then they talk trivial things and nonsense. I also belong (I'm probably in the minority) to a group that didn't like the end of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The second most fun I've had as a third wheel,"Before Sunset exceeded my expectations for a sequel. In my opinion it lives up to its predecessor but with its own unique tone,
with each offering a unique experience that the characters go through in different stages in their lives.The excitement and youth of the first, stays in that very moment locked away. A moment they refer to often, as maybe their most memorable or fondest night ever shared with another individual, while here in the present, we find a slew of new emotions evolved from the first experience, but now with more mature and worn out individuals, that find themselves going through a similar scenario.I watch these incredible performances where practically, all they are doing is walking around and catching up, yet I find myself captivated.When I think about it on a technical aspect, most of the scenes, are shot in one shots. Personally, I can't help but feel as if it's a live performance that was all done in single takes. This footage feels so real to me, more like a play than a movie.Yet another thing that helped me connect so well with these characters, is the feeling that I've had almost identical conversations or thoughts myself, and to see them be played out feels so personal.In the end of the movie, we are still left wondering, how does it work out for Celine and Jesse? It ends as ambiguously as the first did, and in a way, it's even more ambiguous if we take in consideration what happened the last time they were in a similar situation.It really can all boil down to our own outlook on life and love. With everyone having their own experiences and finding themselves at different stages in life.For now, I consider myself somewhat hopeful. I guess we'll find out in Before Midnight.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
between hello and goodbyes..,"Those months of craving, just to have a glimpse of Before Sunset is over. I finally managed to watch the movie. Though I wont discuss any technical details about the video or audio quality of the video I got. What I will be discussing is a about how did they manage to fuse Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. Those nine long years of stillness. An open ending that we just wished that someone knew how it ended. That's what kept me clinging on to Before Sunrise. It ended not with a happy nor sad ending. But it made some of us empty in some way making us want to know more about them. So what we did was to watch it all over for so many times over and over and over. And with every end of the movie we learned more about them. A hundred and five minutes of pure conversation with one another. Their glances and stares. The empty streets they've walked. The topics they discussed. Even though we watch the film for so many times we can never end this movie. They never exchanged phone numbers, never gave their address to one another. What they only have was just a promise to meet again after six months at the train station. If ever one of them gave away their phone number. We could just probably generate a happy ending, because either one of them can call the other to meet sometime. And just because of those digits, we can be rest assured that they'll see each other again.Finally after nine years of waiting we finally have a sequel. Though I hate the idea of having a sequel because it might spoil those special moments in the movie. But I just can't blame them to make one, because there are times that we should know about it. Because the movie moved us so much in a way that Jesse and Celine were more than just characters in a simple movie, but it slowly seeps into our minds often that they've became a part of ours. Before Sunset was seamlessly appended that those questions we used to ask ourselves were answered, like 'did they ever meet again?' or 'what happened after six months?' Just don't be surprised that a measly eighty minutes is short for a sequel. The film runs in real-time where Jesse has to board a plane to New York. Jesse or Jesse Wallace(they finally figured out a surname) attended a book signing of his first published book in Paris. And there she met Celine. Then the story continues where they just both walked on the streets of Paris on their way to the café. By just watching them together again made a feeling of joy and contentment within me that kept me glued to their dialogues. Again, the best thing about this movie is the simplicity. Before Sunset was just showcasing ordinary lives of two strangers who have met nine years ago on a train. I would definitely recommend it to everyone, even though you haven't seen Before Sunrise. And if you liked Before Sunset, without delay try to watch Before Sunrise to complete the picture. A+",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Same Great Characters with a Not-So-Slight Hiccup,"Before Sunset follows Jesse and Celine 9 years after they first met as they meet up once more and hang out for the hour or so before Jesse has to catch a plane.Similar to 'Before Sunrise', this is a movie about the same two people talking. And that's it. No real plot or anything, it's just a reunion. And it still works. These characters haven't lost their flair quite yet, it's still interesting to watch them interact with one another.Once again, the acting is all pretty solid as well, with both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy pulling off great performances. And as per usual, they play off of each other very well.And yet again, the writing is good. The characters have realistic, yet semi important, conversations that are rarely boring or uninteresting.Still, with a movie like this the pacing does suffer. There are scenes in this movie that dragged more than they should have, and they were noticeable. It was noticeable when they picked up again, and they were noticeable when they started, for no particular reason really. It's just how the movie is structured.This review has been a rehash of the one I wrote for 'Before Sunrise', although I do have one new thing to say. There's a scene towards the 1 hour mark where one of the characters has a sudden outburst and it's kind of out of place. Everything's going well and their conversations are wrapping up and suddenly one of them just gets super mad and starts ranting. While it wasn't totally out of nowhere, it noticeably changed the tone so quickly that it was hard to ignore.Overall Before Sunset is, while good, not as good as it's predecessor. Everything good about the first one is good in the second one, but tonally this sequel has some challenges. In the end I would only recommend this movie if you liked the first one. There's really nothing new here from the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Only if you watched After Sunrise.,"Before you read this, you must know I'm saying all of the stuff under the circumstance that I DIDN'T WATCH AFTER SUNRISE.To be honest, I couldn't enjoy the movie at all. I seems to me this movie was all about just two people who happen to meet after 9 years of separation and have some conversations about their life which is not so interesting for other people.Perphaps you might say Ethan Hawke's acting was very realistic in this movie and actually some part of me admit it, but at the same time it seems to me his acting was so awkward in very bad way, and as quite many people mentioned he looks absolutely terrible in this film.Nevertheless, considering a bunch of people praise the movie and only a few put negative comments, it might be just because I'm an amateur movie fan who couldn't enjoy the movie and catch the true meaning or beauty of the story yet.

Genuine story of romantic love. Excellent epic second chapter!,"I'm not normally the type to watch romance movies but ""Before Sunrise"" is the exception.

I actually feel like I've just had a romantic fling myself; where I have those uneasy, restless, and irrationally passionate feelings.I was really surprised to see this sequel after so long. However, the nine year gap between the two chapters makes the story feel so much more grand and epic.The movie really compares romantic love vs. human love in such an excellent way.When I try to describe this movie to others, it sounds so sappy, but this conveys such raw intimate emotion in such a genuine way like no other movie or book that I've experienced.

Hugely Satisfying Sequel.,"A hugely satisfying sequel to Before Sunrise. I do not wish to say that it is better then the first film, as both are good. Yet, I personally feel that Sunset has an emotional rawness that goes deep at times and so is maybe the maturer work. Or maybe its just that the characters have matured. In any case it is an enjoyable watch. It rakes a little time to find its main groove, but when it does, you feel that you are entering into a place where hearts are vulnerable and exposed.

A perfect blend of  words and characters,"This movie is for those diligent viewers who are looking for a serene and pacifying movie. I walked into the theater with 2 my friends and I was the only one to sit there till the end.This movie runs on a slow note and is a perfect sequel to the part-1. Before you watch this movie, i would recommend you to watch the previous part. By the end of first part, the two characters decide to meet at a spot which they were expected to do by the beginning of the second part, but quite contrary (yet very realistic) to it, they couldn't. The way they find each other is awesome which is depicted in a very beautiful way. The movie then again runs on a smooth note and they start rediscovering each other again. Hawke and Delpy are the only two faces you are gonna find throughout the movie but you feel like witnessing two worlds walking languidly.The climax of the movie is more than what one could ever expect. It ends at a note that's as sweet as a jack fruit and keeps revolving inside your mind for the next couple of days. This movie falls into the category of Sweet Land, Lost in Translation and Finding Neverland.I would rate this movie a 10 upon 10 and highly recommend it for sensible viewers like me who know how deep an uttered word could go and how deeper an unuttered word could run.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Subtle Vivid Movie,"This can easily be classified as the best ever sequel to an already fantastic movie.The combination of age and constraints are so beautifully inter-played in the subtleties of the actors expressions that you can't help but simply be engrossed completely within the characters.The Rhapsodic delight of the conversation which veers from a little tease to highly sober and back to a tease again embodies the quintessential verisimilitude of life, entrancing the viewer in its very simplicity.Absolutely the best subtle, surreal and surreptitious acting ever. And for all its worth - this movie deserves an all time accolade, for its simply a timeless classic.The director, the crew, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have truly created a momentous masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I loved it,"My wife and I watched before sunrise when we were dating and both liked it. We became married and eventually watched before sunset. It really recaptured the feeling, had some hard truths in it, still positive and carried on the feeling, we both loved it. The last instalment wasn't so hopeful and I don't think I watched all of it( I'm a romantic so I want aq good outcome). I would recommend Before Sunset if you like dramas, like a positive outlook. Its helpful to know what happened in before sunrise before you watch this one though.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
watch BEFORE SUNSET(s)...,"""As we grow old we appreciate things more"" is one of the movie's dialogs. I'm starting to like this trilogy since 'before sunrise' (which I saw many years back). The first part of the story is about two people who just meet on a train in Vienna. They meet after 10 years in a Paris library in this movie. Some profane lines in between, as the movie is wholly a conversation between two opposite sex adults. I felt there wasn't much of back-ground music in this. Still there are number of songs which are nice. The movie too gets boring after a while, still happy it is just for 80 minutes. The bottom line : Like a typical adult male fantasy to meet a nice girl traveling, still I feel a tiny-bit yawning.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Before midnight,"This is a film that has an European look. Director Richard Linkletter has decided to continue the story in a way we can accept it. In Jesse and Celine, he has found an attractive couple who play well together and what's more important, they get our attention from the beginning.Jesse and Celine belong together, as it's obviously noted in the film. In spite of the movie being a continuous dialog, it never bores, but one can see that the picture is not for everybody. Mr. Linkletter's great achievement has been the fact that he kept it at 80 minutes long, anything more than that would had bored us, perhaps.Julie Delpy has a radiant beauty. She seems to be more mature for her years. On the other hand, Ethan Hawke shows more chiseled features; he seems to be older. Delpy and Hawke play well together. As it happens when people that have a lot in common and where there's a real friendship, these two can stay away from one another, but the moment they meet, they pick up where they left off.Since the director and his two stars collaborated with the screen play, it is easy to see they all were very attuned to the material and it shows on the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stultifying,"Can a movie consisting of nothing more than plain dialogue and superficial interaction between two people who look back on one night of passion they shared a decade before -- two people who spend almost the entire movie doing nothing more than chatting and walking through sunlit, winding streets -- transcend its simple form to become one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of the last decade?No. It is one of the least interesting ways to spend an evening with one's loved one.I couldn't help giggling at the part when she says she had only three songs, one of which is about a cat. How I wished she would have launched into a Phoebe-like rendition of ""Smelly Cat!""Utterly boring.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Question of Character,"Nine years after Before Sunrise, director Richard Linklater lets us drop in once more on the chance meeting of his two characters, Jesse and Celine. What we know is that they did not rendezvous 6 months later as planned in Vienna. For the next 80 minutes, Jesse and Celine retread the past and analyze their present circumstances.As with its prequel, Before Sunrise consists almost entirely of non-stop dialogue. But in many ways, the movie trumps its predecessor. Instead of a full day, the film occupies the real time of less than 2 hours. The tension is stronger, as they are constantly reminded that Jesse must reach the airport in time for his flight. The stakes are higher as they try to uncover why they are both possessed by the one night stand almost a decade ago. They are both in relationships (indeed, Jesse is married with a 4 year old son) but can't find the same connection with their significant others that they found with each other. There are near misses of meetings, recollections of longing that begs questions of their own incompetencies... as lovers, as good human beings. Thankfully, Linklater makes the questions (or, that they are brave enough to ask them) more important than the answers. His affection for these characters is enough to yield them privacy; once again he opts not for the soft landing of a determined ending, but an open question.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Great, and more substantial than Before Sunrise","Great movie, and more substantial than Before Sunrise.I thought Before Sunrise was okay, but overrated. It was pretty much another romantic drama. Better than most in that it has more depth of characters, has a fairly unique and beautiful setting, and direction and plot are more subtle and original than most. On the down side, it was very dialogue-intensive and some of the dialogue is just incredibly pretentious, navel-gazing stuff.Before Sunset is still very dialogue-intensive. This is still an irritation in that you want some respite from this, some period of reflection and calm. However, in this case it does propel the story forward, unlike Before Sunrise where the dialogue seemed to go in circles and not really go anywhere.That is where Before Sunset is so much better. By setting it nine years after the first movie, you get a a more complete story, more character development, more a sense of what they mean to each other, more genuine emotion.For these reasons, making this sequel is a stroke of genius on Richard Linklater's part. Instead of a snapshot of these two people's lives, we have a timeline, a sense of lives progressing and changing, of memories and regrets. Not ships passing in the night (as the first movie made them out to be), but soulmates.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie for adults,"Taking up the story 9 years later, this is a very similar movie in its construction but so much more adult in tone, simply because it deals with real people and time and feelings.

So good...........,"Just like the first and third film. This film manages to create a once in a life time event of writing, chemistry and acting. Even though in my opinion its the weakest of the trilogy, This is not a bad film at all. Everything about the film works. The one thing that doesn't make it a 10/10 is that it is to much like the first in the begging. But by the end of the film, it changes and has the best ending in the trilogy. There isn't to much I can say about it because its already been said. The acting is fantastic as well as the writing. The directing has a low budget feel. And I love the scenery. Overall this trilogy is a must watch to everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
We meet again,"In Before Sunrise (1995) Jesse and Celine had a romance that was over the next day.Now nine years later they meet again in Paris, where Jesse is talking about his book he has written.They end up talking like they did the last time and they start falling in love with each other like they did the last time.Are they meant to spend their lives together? Before Sunset (2004) is the result of three intelligent minds working together.Those three people are the director Richard Linklater and the actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.They all were also writing the movie.The dialogue between Jesse and Celine remains interesting all the time.They're at the same page with the interaction.That makes you believe these people belong together.The chemistry between the main actors hasn't faded at all.Not even the least bit.It's not impossible if the relationship of these two takes a further course and the movie series goes on in the future.Hawke has suggested such an idea.I wouldn't mind that if they succeed to keep it as interesting.These two movies certainly have worked.Both of them are kind of movies that make the world look a little less cynical.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Compelling and a great watch!,"I don't normally watch many films and so decided to watch the IMDb Top 250 to make up for this starting at #250. I only realized half way through this film that it's a sequel to a film which I'll come to later in my journey.I found the film very intriguing, both Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are superb throughout, and although the 80 minute film for me consists almost entirely of the two main characters talking about how their lives have changed and what might have been since they met 9 years ago in 'Before Sunrise', you feel compelled to watch to the end and the film does a great job of maintaining this interest.I'd recommend this film and look forward to seeing both the prequel and the latest one 'Before Midnight'7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"very good, but not as good as the prequel and the sequel","Before Sunset was good but a slight letdown after Before Sunrise. As a standalone feature there would have been no issues. It picks up where the previous movie has ended, although a decade later, but leads us towards an obvious development and finale.Nevertheless, this is an excellent movie, although not the one i'd watch over and over again. As in the prequel, this is more or less one uninterrupted dialog. Since the protagonists have aged, their discussions are more mature. If you've seen all three installments, including Before Midnight, the thing you'd probably appreciate the most is the way their discussions develop.It seems that the authors meticulously planned the script. At certain points you'd feel almost as in a psychoanalytical session.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The best ""one shot"" film I've ever seen","I already have seen the first movie Before Sunrise and I was very interested how they managed to create something at least as good as the first movie after nine years. And yeah, I'm surprised how they did it in a great way.The plot of the first movie showed almost 24 hours of beautiful, realistic, and kind of mysterious romantic relationship development of the two strangers, of course, cut into 90 minutes. But what they did in the second movie, they filmed that 80 minutes real time, in a ""one shot"" (using different camera angles), so you literally walk with the couple across the streets of Paris without any cut or interruption. And there is continuous dialog, very similar as you would have in their situation. They talk now mostly about their lives in their 30s and typical life events for this age. This can be for someone exhausting because there is literally no pause or distraction but people who likes long dialogs focused on details in human interaction, they will love this movie.Again, it graduated from the beginning, the interaction development was done amazingly, and I loved the end so much - that is where the chemistry between them is again at the very height.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

However, the big con here is that they are both married now. Plus, there is little to no substance to this movie. I and my co-worker both watched it separately last week and where very disappointed.

The emotions were just out there - raw and powerful. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy should be very very proud of their acting.There had to have been so much of their real lives revealed in that movie, which was very brave of them.The first movie spoke to me too, as I was young and idealistic about love. I had a Jesse too and I was happy to believe that we would meet again.This one totally articulates my disappointment and pain with where my life's at now.Oh, to be young and passionate and fearless again.My only question is ""where is MY second chance at love like that?"".",,Anonymous,Romance
HK Neo Reviews: Before Sunset,"Tagline: A genuine attempt at recapturing missed opportunities Review by Neo: Perhaps it is almost truism to say that it is human nature to desire what we cannot have. It is part life that people will have to endure through situations where it will leave them with the feeling of what if and what could have been. While, people may say that what has passed has already passed and there is no point pondering or going back to asking what could have been. That is why Before Sunset is such a good movie as it is able to depict all these underlying and deep emotions that we have all kept within ourselves and soul.Life is never easy, meeting the right people requires the right timing and the right place, it may well be the right timing for you, but for someone else, the timing may not be right. The person may be still letting go out their past or may be the couple could be separated by distance. I remember a girl asking me, why we didn't meet earlier, at that moment, I just said that if we did, we might never be together. Thinking back, at this very moment, it makes you realised that while the timing was perfect for me personally, having just graduated, about to start a new job, and being able to let go of the past completely for the first time, but love is always a two way thing. Perhaps for the girl, we probably met 3 years too late.9 years on after their fateful meeting in Before Sunrise, they meet again in a bookshop in Paris and what is so wonderful about this movie is definitely the realism and the underlying emotional core which coincides perfectly with the witty and thoughtful dialogue. Once again the Wong Kar Wai's theme is evident here, love is all about timing, and it is no good meeting a person too early or too late. For the case of this couple, it is more of a case of everything being right, except for fate playing a game on their love. All these lead to further feeling of regret and the ever lingering emotion along the lines of unfinished businesses.Like Before Sunrise, the unfulfilling sudden ending gives hope to the audience to engage in their own sort of thinking. Perhaps, they won't be together, but at least their second meeting allowed them to give it a shot and finally a way to possibly put the regrets behind them. Then again, one needs to look no further than the current cinema running of Two Days in Paris for an answer.Ethan Hawke is perfectly cast as the guy and Julie Dephy has this undeniable likable nature about her that makes her character so believable. Their chemistry together is just radiating off screen and on screen. There are moments in the car that allows Julie to expresses her acting chops and director Richard Linklater wisely engages some memorable flash back to evoke further emotions.All in all, Before Sunset is by all means a good little movie that goes only a little longer than 1 hour. Not unlike the situation within the movie, perhaps Julie was right, maybe their relationship is only good for short term meetings. It is a pity that they weren't together 9 years ago, but what made the movie better is the manner that Ethan realised that his love for her was not just single sided and knowing the fact that at the same time when he was lonely and thinking about that someone, the feelings are mutual. As we venture to the end of this review, it is now 2:17 pm, on the 25th of March 2008, a moment that will not come back again and with a brink of an eye it have already been exactly 3 months since that fateful meeting. We might meet again one day or perhaps not, but I guess no one really knows. Let's finish off with a beautiful quote from Julie: ""memory is a wonderful thing, if we do not have to deal with the past"" A quote that rings so true and real (Neo 2008)I rate it 8.5/10www.thehkneo.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Before Sunset: 10/10,"Most of the time, sequels are for big budget summer blockbusters when studios realize they can double their profits by releasing a movie that's basically the same. So I assume most people were surprised that Before Sunrise, a small romance that only made about $5.5 million would warrant a sequel. But it did. I haven't seen the first one, which was released in 1995, but that didn't stop me from seeing its sequel, Before Sunset. I have learned that you usually don't need to see the first movie in series to understand it. Some enjoyment may fall out of it, but it's still coherent nonetheless. Before Sunset is a sequel where you don't need to see the first. In fact, I think I probably benifited from not seeing the first.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is promoting his book, which is largely based on the events of the evening in Before Sunrise, where he had met Celeste (Julie Delpy) in Vienna and spent an unforgettable night. They had agreed to meet up again in six months in Vienna. Celeste finds Jesse after the book signing and they talk. They walk around Paris and talk. And talk. And talk.It's movie like this that you recognize as being great, yet you can't really explain it. It could be how much I seemed to get to know and like these characters just by hearing them talk. The camera never leaves them, which makes us seem like intruders and eavesdroppers to their life. It could be the simplicity of their lives that we find fascinating, and how we can relate to both of them in more ways than one. It could be the sophistication of the dialogue (which was written by director Richard Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy). The spontaneity of the dialogue makes the movie feel more real. And it's all in real time, which adds a sense of urgency to the movie.Both Hawke and Delpy, who are basically the only characters in the film, put in good acting jobs here. They exhibit the normal characteristics of life-they aren't over the top or caricatures. They seem just like average people, and that adds to the charm and the overall real feel to the movie. They have forgotten some of the events of the evening nine years ago (as would the viewer). The constant barrage of dialogue doesn't hurt it; actually, it's very entertaining and interesting. They talk about various subjects, and you never feel time dragging or anything of the like. Before Sunset is simply a beautiful film. It's simplistic and down to earth. You may not like my lack of words to describe it, but once you see it, you'll be at a loss for words, also.My rating: 10/10Rated R for language and sexual references.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the most artistically romantic movies ever,"Richard Linklater is probably one of the few young directors working today who can be called an artist and watching this film you can understand why. This is a sequel to Before Sunrise and what one notices at first is that the filmmakers actually waited for the characters to grow older in real time so that now we meet Jesse and Celine they have actually aged, which makes their dialogues and relationship all the more relatable. Both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have no problem going back to their older roles and it is refreshing to see them talk and act naturally- they have great chemistry. Do watch this if you enjoy realistic romantic films.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An underwhelming reunion,"9 years after the events of before sunrise, Celine meets Jesse at his book launch in France. In the end of before sunrise they promised that they will meet in Vienna again after 6 months. But Celine doesn't show up because of her grandma's demise. So after they meet we find out that Jesse is married with a son and Celine is dating a photo journalist. They then travel around France sharing their past experiences until Jesse has to catch his return flight in evening.
I loved before sunrise as I feel its a best love story I have ever seen. In sunrise they spent a whole day together and part ways the next day. So as a audience we also feel like we have spent a memorable day with them. But in sunset we get a feeling of an unsatisfied one day picnic we have on Sundays because they spend very less time together. Another drawback I felt was with its abrupt ending without any proper conclusion. And last thing I felt disappointed was that Jesse and Celine don't have the same chemistry which they had in sunrise. But there are some great scenes. My favorite scene was in the cab where Celine shows her frustration of not being in a committed relationship and in return Jesse talks about his failing marriage and both wanting but unable to touch each other. On the whole, before sunset falls on those category of sequels which only partially captures the magic of its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An awesome film that's gotten even better with time!,"Before Sunrise used to be one of my favourite films but I found Before Sunset to be even better. An absolutely fantastic film! Julie Delpy is awesome and she can sing like an angel. The last 30 minutes kept me in so much suspense and intrigue to wonder what the hell was going to happen to the couple. Just like Before Sunrise the ending makes you want more. Please make a sequel but don't make me wait another 9 years! How great were the scenes of Paris! How great was the dialogue! How amazing were the uninterrupted scenes! How stunning is Julie Delpy! Can anybody pass me her number? Ethan Hawke does a great job as well.

The Riveting Conversation Goes On and Grows Up,"I just finished watching ""Before Sunrise"" and I am glad I do not have to wait nine years to find out what happened to the love story of Celine and Jesse in ""Before Sunset"".Jesse is now a successful author after he wrote a novel about his very special encounter with Celine we all watched in ""Before Sunrise."" He was doing a book tour in Europe and the last stop happened to be Paris. It just so happened that the book signing was a bookshop which was also Celine's favorite. Of course they meet, and then went around Paris the rest of the afternoon until Jesse's plane will be leaving at sunset. As with the first film, we see them talking about how their lives went since that fateful day in Vienna years back.Julie Delpy (as Celine) did not age too much, but Ethan Hawke (as Jesse) looked significantly older. But the years did not diminish their chemistry with each other. The script by Richard Linklater this time was shorter, more sober, with deeper issues and mature emotion now, compared to the first one which was generally lighter, whimsical, with palpable youthful vibrancy. The transition over the years was perfectly reflected in the words they spoke. Again, we are drawn into their conversation, until that open and puzzling final scene.OK that is it. I will definitely go watch ""Before Midnight"" when it opens in local theaters next week.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A reflection of my romance in Paris,"I went to see this film last night with my wife, whom i met up with in Paris about 10 years ago. i guess when you've had a real romance to a story that would leave this one behind, its hard to be unbais.The beginning of the movie made a good comment, the writer said we all see life through the tiny keyhole that we look through, which i feel is very true. i guess my keyhole was full of true romance and excitement which took 2 years to blossom and a couple of trips across the planet. So when you've experienced what the writer was trying to do, but you won the real McCoy, then its easy to be critical.To me the movie lacked substance, the actors didn't really appear in love, but more like a couple of actors trying to appear this way.i never saw the first movie, as i was unaware that it existed, but i feel it must have been far superior to this one.i can well imagine that people who have always dreamed of true romance and mystic, but have never obtained it would enjoy this movie, because they are looking through a different keyhole.its a shame the world could not see through the keyhole of my romance, it would have been a box office hit.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Stunning, literally stunning","I can't imagine the pressure that befalls you when you decide to do a follow-up to a known masterpiece nine years later. I also can't imagine many filmmakers creating such a perfect follow-up as 'Before Sunset' turned out to be. Much like the first one, I just sat there stunned as the credits began to roll. I've taken some time to reflect on the film and I think the ending in particular may be close to the best I've seen. Two simple lines that I don't think I'll ever forget.I could listen to the dialogue from this movie for the rest of days and not get sick of it. It feels so natural, but it is also incredibly thoughtful without feeling pretentious. Not a single line feels out of place. There is never a moment where you question whether that character would actually say such a thing.These films are taking a lot out of me I have to say. They're hitting me hard (in the best way possible). I have one more to go, 'Before Midnight' and I can't wait to see it. This was perfect. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The script is exceptional once again, with dialog that doesn't feel like it is scripted. Some might even argue that this is slightly (or a lot) better than the original film this is based on. Whatever the case, we have one of the rare occasions, where a sequel does not fall off quality wise.You have to like romantic drama or stories about life in general to really get into this of course.

Now Here's An Unexpected Movie Sequel!,"Before Sunset picks up right where the first film, 1995's Before Sunrise left off. For those who have seen that film, one would not expect a sequel especially a decade later. But this sequel captures the magic the first film left us as well as the charm, romance, and the ideological dialog. All this film is two people walking the streets of Paris and talking to each other, but we feel connected to these characters for the eighty minutes this film is on screen. The screenplay is very sharp and not once can we tell if the dialog is forced. This film is an example of how an excellent conversation should be, especially between people who haven't seen each other in ages.Richard Linklater's sequel reintroduces us to the characters of Jesse and Celine. Jesse is now a bestseller author who has written a book based on the one night the two of them had nine years earlier. While promoting his book in a bookshop, Jesse runs into Celine. With Jesse returning to the states that evening, the two spend the afternoon together catching up and reminiscing on what could have been.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy continue to show such natural chemistry between each other. If I didn't know any better, they could have been two ordinary people having such an engrossing conversation on love, politics, and more ideology of that nature. This film doesn't need a large cast and I feel that both Hawke and Delpy were perfect in their roles.Overall, Before Sunset is an excellent sequel to one of the best original romantic films I have ever seen. Both of these films succeed without being sappy or forced. I liked the natural feel of this film and it's a shame Hollywood doesn't produce more films like these. They are the perfect compliment to the special-effects era of movies. This is a sweet, romantic modern-era romance film and a fitting sequel to Before Sunrise. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Movie of 2004,"The best way to describe this movie is by the following comments of a film criticquote: -------- ""Sunset"" plays out in real time -- in 81 minutes of unfolding getting-to-know-you-(again) conversation -- and its tug of suspense comes not only from that waiting plane but from the need to grab at chance and from the larger looming deadline of age.It's a movie about how people woo each other with words, looks and glances. And though some will complain that ""Before Sunset"" is all talk, it struck me as real, highly diverting talk--beautifully staged, acted and visualized.Delpy and Hawke co-wrote the script with Linklater, and they keep Jesse and Celine iridescent and fresh, one of the most delightful and moving of all romantic movie couples. A lot of that charm comes from the speed of their patter, the way they keep the words spinning between them like two great tennis players on an endless, brilliant rally. And since they both show so well how the characters have grown, they can believably break into anger or anguish at their current frustrations and the memory of desire.All three of the film's primary collaborators take advantage of their own opportunities with this one, layering Jesse and Celine's 80-minute conversation with a freshness, a surprising urgency, and two characters full of desire, faults, and - still - hope.--------The movie has a brilliant script and dialogues.I just love the conversations between the two lead actors (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke) in the movie. The chemistry between them is electric.The best moment of the movie is undoubtedly the climax of the movie where Julie Delpy sings a song. She sings an improvised little nonsense song about lost love that keeps skidding into pain.quote: -------- Celine: (Celine's song) Let me sing you a waltz / Out of nowhere, out of my thoughts / Let me sing you a waltz / About this one night stand / You were, for me, that night / Everything I always dreamt of in life / But now you're gone / You are far gone / All the way to your island of rain / It was for you just a one night thing / But you were much more to me, just so you know / I don't care what they say / I know what you meant for me that day / I just want another try, I just want another night / Even if it doesn't seem quite right / You meant for me much more than anyone I've met before / One single night with you, little Jesse, is worth a thousand with anybody / I have no bitterness, my sweet / I'll never forget this one night thing / Even tomorrow in other arms, my heart will stay yours until I die / Let me sing you a waltz / Out of nowhere, out of my blues / Let me sing you a waltz / About this lovely one night stand--------I thought 'Lost in Translation' was the best Romantic movie I had seen in the recent past.""Before Sunset"" is a few notches better.... :)So, What's your favorite movie of 2004? :)~Nirjhar",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Richard Linklater created a whole film about a few hours spent between two reunited lovers who reminisce of their past together. The whole entire movie is a just one giant conversation. It is just absolutely incredible in every way. Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect of film and is perfect in every way possible.I highly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Does not stand alone only of interest to viewers of After sunrise,"Rather disappointing sequel. The plot is so weak that the actors, though talented, are not attractive enough to carry the whole weight of a 90 minute movie. There are just these two actors carrying the plot, only tiny glimpses of other characters.Technically the two talking heads are often clearly screened against background film like an old Hollywood movie with actors in a car.Worth watching if you saw the first movie but otherwise not something for a new viewer to watch.Don't buy it, record on TV and the you can fast forward through the many dull dialogues and enjoy the Parisian scenery",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"No plot, No storyline, and No Character Development","I heard good things about this movie so I decided to get a copy and watch it. I can honestly say I have never seen a more pointless waste of film than this movie.It is easy to sum up this movie. A man and woman who previously spent one day together meet again nine years later. The guy has a plane to catch so they decide to spend the intervening time together. They talk about a few things that happened to them during the previous nine years and a number of random unrelated topics. She notices that he has missed his plane and the movie is over.Sounds like a thriller doesn't it? :-) There is no plot; nothing happens. There is no story line; just a bunch of random conversations. It is not a character study. In fact, character is completely irrelevant. You could pick the character of any random John Doe and Mary Jane and the movie would be exactly the same.In short, I wasted one hour and twenty minutes of my life watching this film.",,Anonymous,Romance

I laughed out loud and cried like a baby. Too bad it had to end. Obviously you choose your own ending. I say Jessie stayed in Paris and they picked up where they left off in Before Sunrise. At least, that's what i hope they did. The songs Julie Delpy sings are enchanting and lets your mind drift in and out of the story. Well done. Unlike other films, this one grabs your attention with sensitive dialog, intrigue and poignant moments. A classic love story from start to finish.

"A great pair of films,  but where ""Sunrise"" was a charming breeze,  ""Sunset"" was a storm of emotion.","Once again a stunning city as a backdrop and the emphasis of the changes in both of them gave greater poignancy.As they spent their day together, first one, then the other had the upper hand in presenting an indifferent front to their true feelings, but each time they circled around each other the truth began to dawn that many years ago, there really had been a connection.The Taxi scene near the end was raw and unexpected - the song was exquisite and came across as a genuine expression of Celine's feelings; then and now.The end ? As Jess said in the bookshop, the outcome is up to you. Are you an optimist or a cynic.It worked for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Man, it's great to be alive","Initially, I had planned to watch Richard Linklater's Before trilogy in three days, watching one film after another. However, upon viewing Before Sunrise, along with writing the review, I took note that this trilogy was about time, time progression, and how people respond with being in company with one another for either an extended period of time or, in contrast, a relatively short period of time sporadically. I thought in order to make the trilogy bear a wee bit more relevance and realism for me, as a viewer, seeing as impatiently waiting nine years between each film to see them in theaters was an option I missed, I'd distance each film by about two weeks (and with the amount of films I watch in between, there would hopefully be little obsessing over what happens to the characters in between that time). My confession to you, the reader, is that it took all of my strength not to watch Before Sunset sooner than I had scheduled it; Before Sunrise is the kind of film that blindsides you so greatly, and tickles your human spirit so tenderly, that when it's over, knowing there's more films of the like makes you want to seek those others out immediately. Unfortunately, I had to exercise some restraint in the process to at least add some personal realism to this series; like I was impatiently waiting with these characters to see one another again.Before Sunset picks up exactly nine years after the events of Before Sunrise, which focused on an American man named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and a Frenchwoman named Céline (Julie Delpy) met aboard a train in Vienna and spent the entire day roaming and conversing through the city, agreeing to meet nine years later in the same place. Jesse is back overseas, however, this time in Paris, doing a book tour for the novel he wrote about his encounter with Céline and how it changed his life. During the book tour, he runs into Céline, shocked as can be, as he recalls how their original meeting didn't go as scheduled because she presumably forgot about their agreement to meet. It turns out, a personal tragedy occurred in Céline's life, making her unable to meet up with him. Now, however, they are together and spend a brief but glorious day in Paris together, again, roaming the streets talking about philosophy, personal happiness, their own lives, their own musings, and so forth, all captured under the beautiful streets and attractions that Paris has to offer.Hawke and Delpy have officially made themselves comfortable in the roles of Jesse and Céline. In this effort, they seem more relaxed with one another, especially Hawke, who has made his character assume more of a pleasantly comic role, but never to any particular fault. Delpy's character, on the other hand, has grown more cynical to the idea of love and attraction, remarking how the past two guys she dated wound up breaking up with her and finding love immediately following the break up. ""Why couldn't they ask me to marry them?,"" she asks Jesse, in a crying fit in a taxi, ""I would've said 'no,' but the least they could've done was ask."" Jesse, on the other hand, is married with a kid, and breathlessly doing a handful of book tours. He's not happy, surprisingly enough, but just passively content with his life. He admits his marriage isn't provided with the romantic/fairy-tale idealism that he's madly in love with the person he sleeps with every day, but that he respects, cares for, and trusts his wife as a person, which, he believes, is what it comes down to ultimately. However, any thinking person can see what Jesse and Céline share is true love. After nine years of no contact, and not even knowing each others last names of full backgrounds, the two can assimilate back into a particular environment and pick up a conversation that's laid dormant for nine years as if it was just discussed on the previous day. On top of that, it's important to note how comfortable the two souls are around one another, sharing personal opinions and diving into past experiences in a way that only happens with one other person once in a blue moon. If you can recall one experience you've had with another person where you and them divulged personal details with one another because you felt explicitly comfortable and safe in their presence, you are an incredibly lucky soul. If you can hold on to that, you're an even more fortunate person.Before Sunset, above all, is a continuation of Linklater's fascination and study of time and human interaction. He has constructed two very interesting and complex characters and has given them the ability to reconnect with one another every nine years. With that, he toys with settings, ideas, and philosophies, and essentially uses these two souls to communicate thoughts and ideas about how we interact and how times heals, impacts, and effects all of us, especially our relationships, in different ways. Before Sunset is a beautiful continuation; a love-letter and joyous appreciation for the human spirit, with two great actors even more adjusted and oriented to their roles than ever before, leaving for seventy-seven minutes of rich and potent dialog. If you don't extract something from this film, or feel something, I may need to check you for a pulse.Starring: Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Directed by: Richard Linklater.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unabashed Romance; Real; I Loved This Movie,"""Before Sunset"" is one of the most unabashedly romantic films I have ever seen.Even in our age of full disclosure and no privacy there remain moments that this viewer, anyway, has never seen captured on film before.""Before Sunset"" captures some of those moments.Two adult characters converse. Watching them, you wonder -- and you know that these two characters are wondering the same thing -- where will this conversation go? Is it just an exchange of banal, prepackaged rants and scripts? But, the two characters keep talking, keep talking past rough moments, and awkward discomfort, and strange anecdotes.After a while of this, they come to say shockingly open and intimate things to each other.Before you realize that you've been swept off your feet, the conversation has become as intimate as the best sexual act could be.These two characters are using mere words to reveal hopes, and pains, and vulnerabilities, that we usually sweep from our consciousness, because the world has no room for them ... except during magical moments such as those dramatized in this film.There was one aspect of ""Before Sunset"" that didn't work for me. Ethan Hawke, especially, gives a poignantly visual performance. He says things with his eyes and face that he does not convey in words.Otherwise, though, this film is not visual enough to be fully satisfying as a film. Its charms and power are almost all verbal, all in the script. That being the case, ""Before Sunset"" would perhaps have been better as a radio play.The director cheats his audience; he doesn't care about using his camera to allow his audience to view Hawke, Delpy, their powerful and magic interaction, or Paris in a new and high impact way.But that's a minor complaint. ""Before Sunset"" swept this viewer off her feet. Days after viewing it, I'm still under its spell. It's appropriate that we understand spells as being cast, primarily, with words, with language. What language does here is truly magic.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

They are given the chance of a lifetime to rekindle their once-in- a-lifetime love, but they talk about how miserable their lives are instead.

Manicured verbiage masquerades as veritas,"I was not a big fan of Sunrise, but it was better than this. Sunrise had joie de vivre and impetuous energy. This has manicured verbiage, mostly totally artificial manicured verbiage. Even Shakespeare's wackiest rom-com has more realistic dialogue than this has.When they are not being artificial, they are exposing how shallow they are. Jesse tells her ""I just can't love my wife the way she needs to be loved."" If Celine has any interest in Jesse and any brains, her response is ""Oh. How is it that she needs to be loved?"" NOPE. In this farce, she hears that and just goes on blathering about whatever popped into her head.Of many other examples, I'll give 2 inter-connected ones. Jesse said he has a 4 year old child. He said it took 4 years to write the book. So, we are supposed to believe that, as his wife was giving birth to their child, he began writing a book about the woman he loves that he met, but lost in Vienna. Then, he tells this woman, whom he hardly knows, that sex with is wife stinks, and basically that his marriage is a burden. Really? If this is all true, his marriage and the sex stinks due to having written this book. However, no way would a guy tell this to some woman he hardly knows and has not seen for nine years and that he considers neurotic. No. Way.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Journey through conversations.,I cannot stress enough how good the writing is in these before films. It all feel so real and authentic and it's just conversations. I didn't realise how fast these 80 minutes passed away. I could listen to both celine and Jesse talk for hours and not get bored. I think Julie delpie is the soul of the film besides it's writing. You can see it in her laughs and in her eyes that she is a hopeless romantic who is really heartbroken. I think she is just too lively and yet very sad in this film. I loved loved her in this film and i for sure liked this one even more than the first film.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of My All-Time Favorites,"Well, I guess my Summary Title says it all. I never tire of watching either one of these two (Sunset and Sunrise) gems, strolling around Vienna or Paris with Jesse and Celine. I hope they get the next one together and out soon-- they only have 2 more years! But seriously, Richard, Julie, Ethan: forget the 9 year apart time line-- give us another Jesse/Celine fix asap! And then another, and another! Never stop, it would be the most fabulous thing, to see Jesse and Celine throughout all their life together. Awesome! And btw, I thought it was Ethan that should have received the Academy Award for ""Training Day"", not Denzel- even though I love Denzel, and admire his work very much. It was sort of the same situation as in ""Rainman""-- Tom Cruise did a more incredible job than Dustin, but Dustin had the showier part. Just a btw, sorry to leave the gist of the thread. Just a shout-out to Ethan, ya'll. A wonderful, wonderful, and I feel, greatly under-appreciated, actor.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lean and effective. Older and wiser. Sexier but also in many ways less charged, more measured, but with a new kind of tension.","Sunset is an emotionally charged powderkeg. And yet it's so undramatic and so human. Clearly, Linklater is a raw filmmaker and all involved are practising what they preach, they aren't proselytising, but they are making films about people who are segments of themselves.Stylistically and tonally, it's a totally different film, it feels like it's grown, it's radical in just flowing almost in real-time, it follows from behind or infront, just watching them as they snatch just a little more time, something movies can rarely show well.It has the most exquisite ending I've ever seen. A soft and generous compliment to the cab ride moment where we see the deep empathetic sadness of two people somewhere they never dreamed they would be.I found it really cathartic and emotional at the end. Not sure why. I guess I'm their age now, maybe that's it. This has always been my favourite, but viewed as a trilogy, it's a perfect middle part.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"OK, it's just a romance movie!","I'm the type of film-goer who normally indulges his video appetite with crime drama, intrigue and Cold War suspense flicks. However, I now find myself vicariously watching this momentarily reunited couple walk and talk through the streets of Paris. What's going on here? What kind of bourgeois sentimentality is this? Why am I watching a romance film?I'll tell you why: it's a gas! I had been so amped up with Iraqi war fatalities, Va. Tech. shooting news analyses, etc., that I needed something to watch to chill me out just a little. And this was just what Dr. Feelgood ordered. At first, I wondered whether Ethan Hawke was going to be another phony self-serving existentialistic pseudo novelist or was he going to lighten up and go a little further into his character. Alas, he did lighten up, and he and Julie hit it off from that initial meeting onward. But, to me, the real carrier of the thespian torch was undeniably Julie Delpy: No holds barred emotional outpouring, but without any accompanying self-pity. She encapsulated modern day woman, with all the verve, intelligence, beauty and also, the vulnerability. No shame in her game in an outstanding performance!The two of them continued along their Parisian stroll with soul searching dialog and the usual ""what have you been doing?"" stuff, but, more importantly, with so much free-flowing wit and zest for life. My bottom line proof of enjoyment is while watching this movie unfold, I had a constant grin on my face, eating up the sequences of events and enjoying the related inevitable tension that was building up along their soulful journey.But in the end, Julie's gorgeous 3/4 time song with her own vocal and guitar accompaniment coupled with the Nina Simone song shortly thereafter was an ever so poignant conclusion to a most memorable movie. As Ethan said about the plane to catch in the final scene... well, you see it for yourself!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romance + Intelligence,"""Before Sunset"" and ""Before Sunrise"" are two perfect examples of how to make romantic movies that are deep and intelligent at the same time. I couldn't say what's the best one. As far as I can see, it's only a single movie to me.It may look like a movie easy to make, but if you pay attention to all those long sequences of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy walking in Paris... Well, you gotta be a great director to do it right. And what to say about Ethan and Julie? Them both have grown as performers (especially Hawke) and they make an outstanding job here, facing all those never ending dialogs.PS: It makes no sense to watch ""Before Sunset"" if you haven't watched ""Before Sunrise"". I recommend you to watch both movies in a row.*My rate: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie completely dependent on dialogue,"Though not due out in theaters until July, I saw this film at a screening at the South By Southwest Film festival in Austin last week.  The movie is completely dialogue-based, and in order to pull a movie like that off, you must have an amazing script and amazing actors.  In this case, both are present.  The movie flows so well, and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy interact so well, you would think that Linklater encouraged them to improvise practically the entire movie, but during the Q&A session after the screening he said that not one line was improvised.  It's rated 'R' for some language, but nothing is too shocking because it all fits together so well.I would strongly encourage everyone to see this movie - especially those true romantics out there.  Depending on the marketing of the movie, it might come across as a chick flick, but I saw it with a group of three guys and another girl, and the guys all loved it also.I would also like to point out that though this is a sequel, you don't need to see ""Before Sunrise"" to really get and enjoy this movie.  It stands alone quite well.On a side note - As well as being the lead actress, Julie Delpy also was one of the screenwriters, and also wrote and performed much of the music in the movie.  She is amazing!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated as the first one,"To begin with, the synopsis could warn that it's part of a F trilogy.And again, characters are so boring and fake, it tries in vain to sound natural but it fails deeply.It's just a lot of romantic BS mixed with nasty and weird sex conversations.It's not terrible at all, but even for teenagers it's useless.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

so simple and amazing,"So I just saw Before Sunset. It is such beautiful movie! I can see why this ranks # 112 in the top # 250. I can't believe I didn't think to see it before. My mom and I just about always watch DVD's and video's together (we have the same taste most of the time), she'd probably think this one is boring because it's all talk and no actual action (in sense of fighting or running and stuff). I usually go for a little speed in movies as well, don't get me wrong I like movies like this but when I'm in a videostore I don't go out of my way to find a jewel like this. I tend to go look for a good action/comedy or a thriller, but I just loved this movie. The story has no elaborate scheme to it, it was just so simple, the whole concept and how everything played out. It was so serene and just calm but up beat (it's somewhat contradicting I know) and in a real sense. The movie has a pace but like real time, it's not like a day went by in several minutes. It was very romantic and I was just intrigued by their conversation. The whole movie revolves around these two characters Jesse (Ethan) and Celine (Julie). I just love the simplicity of the whole movie.It's amazing how a night, nine years ago, can make you realize that have so much in common with each other. Its funny that they can strike up a conversation after nine years that actually has some context to their experience and feelings, they make each other laugh, almost cry. They're just a perfect match, after knowing each other one night that happened nine years ago, they still have so much to talk about. Yeah, sure some of it (the beginning) is pure superficial BS and just politics and such, but still their conversation had a lot of substance to it. I just find it incredible that someone is able to know another person like that and be able to 'pour' their heart out after one night. (sorry, I can't seem to get over the one night thing.) It is just so unlikely that 2 people that met each other nine years ago, spent one night together and still remember everything that happened, meet again to find that they still feel the same way about each other. That one person, one night, deciding to show up or not can make someone dismantle their whole believe system on what love should be like, what life should be like. To be able to have such an impact on another life is just amazing. (it is to me, I've never met someone who had such an affect on me) Everything that happened in those nine years makes them the people they are today, they've changed but still they find that they're just made for each other. That one night can make such a difference in you're life...There was never a dull moment in the movie, no real awkward silences, every silent moment had a purpose. I was an absolute pleasure to see the interaction between Ethan and Julie on screen. I was on the tip of my seat and I didn't want to miss and word that was spoken. This basically never happens to me! I was just so amazed by the connection and conversation between the two characters. A while back I met a friend from grade school, we hadn't spoken in 6 years and we had absolutely nothing to talk about. It was so weird, 'cause we were friends back then and we got along fine, but now it's like there's nothing there. I guess that's why I was fascinated by these characters.Anyway, I definitely recommend seeing this movie, it is just, I don't know I can't explain, you just have to see it. And if you don't like it, well I don't know what to think of that but I'd definitely like to hear why not.These are a couple of quotes from the movie that I really liked.""Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past.""

True to life depiction of a timeless dilemma,"This riveting film ""works"". Who could not fail to relate to, or aspire to, connecting with someone at a spiritual level that transcends mere physical reality. Herein lies the strength of this film, for in abandoning the screen writing convention of ""show don't tell"" for exquisitely crafted dialogue in which the characters actually share ""real"" experience and emotion the film conveys what pictures alone cannot, the interior of the characters, and humanity in its ""natural"" state. The documentary style and intimacy generated by the dialogue leave the viewer feeling like they are right alongside the characters and actually sharing a real time experience. Who could not fail to be moved by the notion of deeply connecting with someone years previously, tearfully parting, suffering the pain of separated souls yearning to be re-united, and the self torture of wondering what might have been. Imagine years of being unable to remove the indelible imprint of a twin soul from the psyche, and the shock and exhilaration of meeting again years later. This 70 minute microcosm, packed with intervening life experience, personal development, emotions, blame, recriminations, and love that goes beyond the physical, undimmed by the passing years, induces alternating laughter and tears in the viewer. This is achieved by what is said, and also by what is not said but untuitively known by the viewer because they are drawn so integrally into the film, and by skillfully ""underplayed"" performances that generate empathy. The spellbinding performances subtly depict nervous and uncertain actions reminiscent of innocent and naive teenagers not knowing what to do for the best. For anyone interested in the human condition this film is quite simply unmissable, and worthy of multiple viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Powerful,"""Before Sunset"" is one of the best movies I've ever watched. Watched is the wrong word - experienced is the correct word. With each scene I was drawn into the dynamics of these reunited lovers. I felt the nervous excitement that existed between the two. I could see myself in both of these characters and in their life situation. The complexity of emotions were wonderfully developed with each passing moment.How many of us decide to pursue our best self instead of our honest self? How many of us don't understand that our best self comes from our honest self? How many of us live afraid of really loving?

Painful,"This may have been the most excruciating movie I have ever endured. The premise, perfect; the atmosphere, unbeatable; the chemistry, totally void. I entered the theatre knowing this film may venture away from the typical, slobbery, predictable, unrealistic, ""love"" story but never had I expected the total disappointment that laid upon me as the last scene faded to black and the credits rolled. The film lacks the jolt of electric eye contacts or embraces. Not even a dot of a plot line exists. I couldn't even appreciate this droning attempt at cinema for it's unique camera angles or mesmerizing backgrounds. Naturally, filming in Paris adds volumes to a films reputation but the focus was not the sites of Paris but rather the intrusive eavesdropping on an estranged couple. Perhaps if I had viewed Before Sunrise prior to buying my ticket to Before Sunset, I would have had a better understanding of the direction of the continuation. My recommendations would be to drop a few dollars on the beginning of this video diary and view it in the comfort of your home so at the very minimum, if it lulls like it's sequel, you would have the luxury of telemarketer as a welcomed distraction.",,Anonymous,Romance

Jessie and Celine are riding a train through Europe, but they are sitting in different parts of the train and have never met. An argument between a middle-aged couple causes Celine to leave her seat and take the one across the aisle from Jessie. They share an uncomfortable smile when the fighting couple rushes past the two of them.

Beautifully Imperfect,"What made ""Before Sunrise"" so wonderful was that the two primary characters were flawed like real people. They were occasionally vulgar, or rude, or annoying, but we never stopped liking them.The truest accomplishment of ""Before Sunset"" is that these same flawed characters remain steadfast in their imperfections, but have gained an additional wordly-wise maturity. What's more important is that in the follow-up of the one night in Vienna, we see how profoundly the experience shaped the two characters in the same wonderfully eccentric, artful, and pensive ways.The growth of these characters in the interim seems so natural, it literally feels like we're reunited with them, following this conversation with the same curiosity and shyness. What's more, is that the artistic spirit of the original film carries with emotional resonance through the picture's conclusion. There are no easy questions, and no easy answers, provided in the film.Best of all, it sensuously exposes the audience's predisposition for ""canned"" plots - where we strive to see things neatly tied up and concluded. I must admit that more than anything else, the unanswered questions in the film are more interesting than the loose ends that they tie up. At one point early on in the film, Jesse remarks to three readers of his book that one is a romantic, one is a skeptic, and the other is neutral. The romantic fills in the ending in a way that holds true to romance, the skeptic toward realistic pragmatism, and the neutral simply accepts the ending at face value.And I loved it. It's so atypical of any ""romance"" or ""drama"" film out there because it's so unabashedly human, imperfect, awkward, sensuous, ambiguous, and ultimately, perhaps even hopeful.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An excellent movie about the most meaningful search of our lives.,"Before Sunset is an excellent movie on the very basics of that feeling we have been searching for. It is a beautiful mixture of optimism and pessimism at the same time presented you in 80 unforgettable minutes. The dialogs will take you back on time and force you to question the past relationships. It is about hope, it is about despair. It is about not giving up when you most feel like to. This is a type of a movie that could encourage you to make a change in your life first time you get up in the morning. Or gives you the feeling to call that certain someone that you have been seeing in your dreams for a long time time now. I would really want to see the third leg of a trilogy within the intoxicating atmosphere of Istanbul.I would like to end by a quote from the film: ""Baby you are going to miss that plane""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Sequel That Compliments The Original,"I liked this film's predecessor, ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), a lot because of its intriguing characters, the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy that never let up, and the dialogue that never felt written even though it was. The original movie could have easily done without the sequel, just as many films not based on comic book characters could. With that idea in mind, this film could have also brought the story of Jesse and Celine to a happy ending that felt like a cop out, which I expected it to do. However, director and writer Richard Linklater manages to bring these characters into full circle in ""Before Sunset"" without giving the romantic comedy fans what they want, which is why ""Before Sunset"" is just as good as its predecessor.Taking place nine years from where the original film left off, Jesse (Hawk) is no longer a slacker, but an established author who wrote a bestselling account of his one night with a French woman he barely knew. Since he did not exchange contact information with Celine (Delpy) when departing Vienna, writing this book was more or less the best way of contacting her, which he does successfully as he visits Paris and attends a book signing. She meets him there, and they discuss their lives since their previous encounter, as well as where their lives are headed. Perhaps the most pressing question, at least by eager audience members, is if they are actually going to stay together this time.Amazingly enough, its very easy to find this movie on DVD, and far more difficult to find ""Before Sunrise"". The latter film was released once on DVD in 1999 and, as of the date of this review, is out of print. It's surprising too, because I go to video stores and see the ""Two DVDs for One"" set of movies all the time. Sometimes the movies go together for obvious reasons, such as ""Cocoon"" (1985) and ""Cocoon: The Return"" (1988). Other times, I've seen ""Kids"" (1995) and ""The Rules of Attraction"" (2001) together in the same set for no apparent reason. ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" deserve to be watched in the order they were made, because I doubt moviegoers who had seen the former would not care about the characters in the latter. However, considering this film received an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, and its predecessor received no nominations (other than an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Kiss), I could be wrong.Again, though, this film is on par with the original in the excellent dialogue and the undeniable chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. In this movie, there are longer shots of them walking and talking together. In the first movie, the cameras cut back and forth to show each one of them talking to the other. Here, they're in the same frame, so it's even more amazing that they engage in their conversations and never even come close to missing a beat.Being a fan of the original film, part of me longed for Vienna over Paris. I know that's hard to believe, but the shots of the film in the original were so good, and the places Jesse and Celine visited were not touristy. In this film, they go around Paris, but they don't stop by the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre a.k.a the real touristy spots. They venture through the cobblestone streets and coffee shops, and eventually through gardens and aboard a ferry. All this great scenery, meanwhile, didn't distract from the characters' conversations.And again, Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy gave reason for why you wanted or needed to care about these characters. Especially in the case of Jesse having a troubled marriage and Celine having relationship problems, the dialogue reflected situations you could sympathize with if not relate to. And this script had an upper hand on the original in that the characters were far more mature now with problems that went beyond finding themselves. The ending also had you guessing, will Jesse leave his wife for Celine after all? Will he make his flight out in the end? These questions are not even hinted at before the end of the film.Last but not least, Julie Delpy's songs cemented this film's memorability for me, especially her song ""A Waltz For A Night"", which should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song that year. It was just one of the reasons I kept watching this film until the very end, not even stopping in between to use the restroom. It's all a testament to Linklater's ear for an intriguing film that does not necessarily tell a story. ""Before Sunset"" lives up to its hype, does not pander to unfamiliar audiences, and is just as good as the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Watching paint dry,"The idea is good and so is the acting. What makes this film a supreme bore though, is the script. It is not that it is far-fetched and unrealistic, on the contrary, it is very realistic and many a viewer will immediately recognise the way the two protagonists, who may have lost sight of, but had not forgotten, one another, interact. From the tentative exploration of the emotional landscape in the Parisian café at the beginning of the film, to the more intimate open closing scene with its mixture of sexual tension and regret over missed opportunities and choices wrongly made, the script, filmed in apparent real time, stays very close to life. However, like some nineteenth-century realistic novels of which this film reminded me a little (e.g. George Gissing's New Grub Street), realism does not necessarily make for compelling viewing. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the film, not even in the acting, that lifts the everyday story to a higher plane so as to invest it with more meaning. It would seem that just like its protagonists, the director failed to make good use of an opportunity.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dialogue delivery beyond excellent!,"I watched this wonderful movie yesterday afternoon and both my wife and I are still more than a little stunned by the beautiful manner in which Paris was laid before our eyes and the realism of the dialogue and delivery  by Hawke and Delpy.I was completely taken by the naturalness of Delpy's delivery-I would have bet that it wasn't a film if I had just heard her speaking and not known that it had been scripted.  Dare I say that it could have been Reality TV in that the dialogue was written so accurately and delivered so well; I have never watched a fictional movie that was so realistic before-it was so natural.Having given these fulsome praises to Before Sunset I must also say that the director, Linklater, made an extraordinarily courageous film-a film that I would have bet would never be made because Hollywood does not make movies with only dialogue and no action.  Nothing outwardly happens in this film-why would you ever believe that two people walking through quiet Parisian streets and setting in old cafe's could make a movie that would hold it's audience.  Maybe the new generation creating movies in Hollywood has decided that people don't always want to watch talking robots and moving plasma-maybe the French have known all along what makes a movie.In any event-I thought this film was a film maker's film and it is a pearl among coal lumps.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Memory is Never Finished,"We saw a sneak preview of Before Sunset last night and then rushed home to revisit its precursor--Before Sunrise--on video. I can sum up the appeal that Linklater's diptych holds for me in a few words, spoken by Julie Delpy's character in the first film, which both works live by:You know, I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us. Not you, or me... but just this little space in between. If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something... I know, it's almost impossible to succeed, but... who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.(you can read the whole script here, if you're in the mood--although I wouldn't recommend that; in general, it's not the matter of these conversations which is so compelling, but the manner in which they are conducted--and you've gotta watch the film to experience that!)In keeping with my preference for revisiting the old, rather than scratching vainly at the scab of ""absolute originality"", I liked the second film even more than the first. Or perhaps I should say that the second has added lustre to the first. And a third, if made in the same spirit as these two, would undoubtedly have a similarly intensifying effect. This is, of course, why I love corporate comics so much--I truly do believe that, the more you think earnestly about anything you ever loved, the better it gets. These films stake out a philosophic/aesthetic position which is in direct opposition to the one that Charlie Kaufman puts into the mouth of ""wise fool"" Donald, in Adaptation:I loved Sarah. It was mine, that love. I owned it. Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away. I can love whoever I want. You are what you love, not what loves you.No way! A memory is never ""yours"". It must always be rebuilt through narrative. And a story is always told to someone else--even if that someone else is an idealized projection of your own mind. You aren't ""what you love"", you're a part of whatever you help bring to light through interaction with others. Implicit in Donald's statement is the idea that the artist's task is to nail down the way he/she feels about the world--capturing objects in the treacle of love like flies trapped in amber. I can't agree with this at all. I prefer to see art as the attempt to create ""a soundtrack, magnetized, out of sync, to the filmstrip of the (intersubjective) Sublime"".Near the beginning of Before Sunset, Delpy asks Hawke why he wrote an entire novel about one night that happened nine years before the events in the sequel. After hemming and hawing his way through a bunch of stock responses, Hawke finally admits that he wrote the book in the hope that she would see it, read it, and show up to discuss it with him. In other words, it was an attempt, as Hawthorne would put it, ""to open up an intercourse with the world."" He gets his wish--and the discoveries that these two make about what ""really"" happened to them in the first film expose the proprietary theory of memory for the sham that it is. Our lives don't belong to us. We rent them to each other at sympathetic rates.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's Magic,"This movie is nothing less than magic. How I look at this movie is, we should watch the movie keeping aside any conventions we believe in. For example we should not think or worry at all about the fact that Jesse is married or if Jesse and Celine get together at the end. It really does not matter. We should just focus on the magic they create when they are together. We should just live like them in that particular moment and periodically looking back to the past. The best part of the movie is it created the magic between them instantly as it did in Before Sunrise.Awesome movie",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
surprisingly good,"I can't express how brave it is to make a movie with no action, no sex scene, not even a kiss, and trust that it can still be appealing and even a masterpiece. This entire movie is a one hour and twenty minute long conversation -- that's IT. And yet it's entrancing; I was never bored or impatient, I felt like I knew the characters myself by the end of the film. It's not perfect; nine years is a long, long time to maintain an attraction, however deep, that only had one night to develop. But, I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of watching these two characters reveal themselves with such subtlety and grace. The ending was absolutely perfect for the tone of the film -- if it had ended in the expected way, I would have liked the film far less. As it is, I can only once again emphasize how daring it was for the people involved in this film to make it exactly as it is in a time when movies increasingly rely on car chases, guns, bombs, and ever more explicit sex to attract their audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant brilliant film,"I love this film. I like it better than the first one. They're older, not so idealistic, so maybe it seems more realistic. And even more poignant, because now, second time round, you know they mustn't let the other get away, so throughout you sit holding your breath, waiting to see whether they do end up just talking again, just making the brief connection, or whether this time they really seize the moment and are prepared to risk allowing the connection to be permanent. I didn't realise how profoundly it had affected me, how many little bits of it have kept playing on in my subconscious since I saw it the first time round. And it's so subtle, like with the first one, the emotion is portrayed with just a glance or a gesture. A hand reaching out to touch the other but pulled back at the last moment, a look of longing or sadness, an angry outburst that you know is misdirected, but genuine nonetheless. It's harder to be as cynical about this one than it is about the first because they themselves aren't so naive, so even jaded people who don't believe true love happens outside of the movies, but still deep inside wish that the happy endings could be true if only life didn't get in the way, can find something to identify with.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

THE movie of summer 2004,"First i was a bit afraid it could be a crappy romance flick .. but i got surprised. The movie is soo great because of the way it is directed. You don't have much of the action and fun we are used to from romantic comedies. It's a realistic and touching mirror of two excited and unsure people meeting after 9 years of no-contact. There's no background music (like in the Dogma movies) and the scenes are simple. For example there's this scene in a cafe (a great, old french cafe with fantastic athmosphere). They sit there and talk .. for about 20 minutes of the movie. and it's not even boring for the viewer. I mean, it's so ""real"", and so exciting to watch them getting in touch again. And there's such a great humour in certain scenes, SO SUBTLE!! i love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boring Personal Conversation,"I felt like an intruder on a very very long and very boring personal conversation. Neither Ethan Hawke (Jesse) nor Julie Delpy (Celine)were able to portray any real interest in their own conversation let alone bring the conversation alive and draw the viewer into their lives. These two young people who had met 6 years earlier in a ""passonate"" fleeting moment (The subject of an earlier film)seemed intent on destroying any pleasant memories that they had each carried of the other! This was the longest stupidest movie I believe I have ever watched! The use of brief ""flash-backs"" from the movie filmed in 1995 was unique and interesting because the characters had changed (matured in appearance) but not unrecognizably so. The Movie set was very nice (maybe it was really Paris?). But the streets of Paris and the ""flash-back"" technique could be put to much better use elsewhere! The Movie contained a lot of unnecessarily nasty language - maybe in an attempt to make the conversation provocative? Don't waste you time watching this movie!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Did you like the first one?,"Because if you didn't, you'll like this one even less.  While the dialog is not quite as spontaneous as the original, this is still a VERY worthy successor to a movie nearly all it's fans thought should NEVER have a sequel.  The characters aren't quite a genuine as they were in the first film, but that's one of the things that keeps it so real.  If these two characters were less cynical and more open like their 1995 counterparts, it just wouldn't be believable.This isn't a film for the masses.  A fiend of mine in her early 30's watched the original on DVD the night before we saw this one at SXSW, and she thought the sequel superior, but after considering them both, said that had she still been in her mid 20's, she probably would have enjoyed the original more.  It speaks to a certain age of viewer with a certain level of intelligence and maturity.  Most other people just won't get it, and will think it's a waste of time.  That's ok though, there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes.",,Anonymous,Romance
Reunited and it DOES feel so good,"In 1995,director Richard Linklater introduced movie audiences to Jesse(Ethan Hawke)and Celine(Julie Delpy),two strangers from America and France(respectively)who meet on a train,stop in Vienna,drift through the lovely,historic streets and architecture as they converse,bond and,ultimately connect,only to part ways,unsure(as was the viewers)as to whether they would ever see each other again.Almost ten years later,Linklater,along with Delpy and Hawke,decided to continue the stories in real time,and this time an impromptu(and the script and story gives the viewer the right to doubt that)meeting during a book tour that Jesse is a part of to promote a novel he's written(regarding the fictionalized encounter he and Celine had)that stops in Paris,which just happens to be the home of Celine. They are elated to see each other at first,and then for the next(almost)two hours,proceed to take their conversation across the city. The mood changes in waves,as each examines their lives since their encounter and come to various philosophical realizations(or even un-realizations). Once again,as they both long for each other despite practically everything(i.e. he's married with a son,she's afraid of deep,ever-present relationships),and their closeness over this second bonding opens the door for perhaps another chance at romance that was kindled--and was extinguished just as quickly--and once again,you the viewer are left wondering: will they do it? Will it take this time? The possibilities.I was very pleased to see these character brought back. I was very impressed with the first movie,which I saw for free as part of a studio promo when I was in college,and felt after I saw it that this merited another look-see. A script penned by Hawke,Delpy,Linklater and Kim Krizan is written and rehearsed with such sharpness that,like the first firm,the feel of the conversation is relaxed and almost improvised in feel. Thes characters have grown up--in fact,in some ways,it feels like they've grown up possibly TOO much--but they still hold their memories and feelings with some of the same passion they had when they were twenty-somethings. Being of nearly the same age,I feel like this was the closest of just about any movie I saw out of the 90s that had ANY relation to my generation IMHO. This was not a widely released,nor wildly popular movie and that surprises me none.This is,like the last one,a purely conversational film and many people just simply have the patience for a film like that. I had been somewhat lazy about getting around to see this(on DVD,no less!)and maybe that came from subconsciously was afraid that a follow-up to the first movie might blow some of my theories or desires for the characters would not get realized or abused. I am happy to say after seeing this that none of that really happened. If anything,it actually carried along these characters in a natural arc that made them even MORE likable and real to me than previous.Personally,I'd love to see an Act III of Jesse and Celine,maybe this time in the states. And like before,there should be no rush,since these characters had plenty of time to develop for a largely satisfying Act II.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Can you imagine that none of them is not even nominated for an Oscar? Speaks volumes about the Academy once more.This is a very difficult movie to make. The ingredients need to be just right.

"Very fews cross the expectations,This definitely tops the list..Love it,Live it,Feel it..","When ""Before Sunrise"" was released,it was a very bold attempt that time,a movie based on just 2 characters all through running time was a risky attempt but Richard Linklater handled the script flawlessly off course aided by most natural acting in a romantic movie by Ethan Hawke/Julie Delpy..In 9 years the first movie had made so much fans that when it was announced a sequel was on the run,many fans like me felt a chill after we saw blown up sequels of Batman/Matrix.Amongst all these fears,I watched the movie but when it ended,I watched it again,this is only movie I have watched back to back so far.What made me do it: The movie runs for 80 minutes and from start to end you can't move your focus,one blink and you may miss a valuable dialog which might definitely change the way you think.The background is same that Ethan and Julie mainly walk and converse throughout the movie but its the conversation which has matured 1000 times than first movie.There is nothing to complain,Before Sunrise excellently depicted 2 very young people meeting,Before sunset deals with more mature talk as their aging with time is so natural.This is which really makes this dualogy more interesting in repeat viewings.Without before sunset,the first movie was a great effort,addition of this masterpiece creates a synergistic original flavor to both movies.While the first movie was a great direction effort,here dialogs rule the show,many quotes of this movie can be complimented in real life (Believe me,have done that).Julie Delpy/Ethan Hawke/Linklater worked a lot on the script and it shows.This movie hits you like a 10 ton iron,somewhere you will find yourself in it.Before Sunrise was 100 % duo perfect performance of Delpy and Hawke.This time Hawke is not bad but Julie really passes him by miles in her performance.May be its because she has more dialogs,may be I felt more sympathy for her character,but whatever,she is lovable,innocent and so natural in this movie.The direction is flawless,the scenery mesmerizing and music score so penetrating,you fall in love with this movie and think about it for days.In short,If you like romantic movies,this movie is holy book of all romantic movies.10 out of 10,too bad I can't give more...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The manor-isms in their conversations felt real at times, yet at times it seems as though they were trying too hard to make the conversations(the jokes, laughter, stories, playfulness) seem realistic to the point that it was annoying...i feel as though they did not pull that part off in this film...things i did enjoy about the movie were the following shots while they were walking instead of a lot of cuts, the long shots i feel like are harder to pull off...and i thought that the ending and storyline was good...unfortunately it just did not intrigue me and i became bored with it...if anyone else felt this let me know",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Most of these scenes are edited in long, single takes, that can't help but feel realistic. There are no quick cuts in real life.I can't stress enough how everyone should see this.

"A ""thanks"" to the writers of the movie... a very personal comment","It's been such a long time, acting, pretending to be someone else - not one, but many- I no longer recognized myself. It sounds cheesy, and even normal, and that's what it is, completely normal. All human beings are supposed to belong, to adapt themselves. Even the criminals adapt themselves to a certain way of living, to a certain group, and they follow the description of their role in society like it was a prescription. I'm not implying to be different, or special, but the contrary, I am totally common, totally normal. Just another human being with an existential crisis, suddenly trapped in her comfort spot comfortable, but frustrated, adapted, but miserable fearing life, above all. Just recently I watched a film that made me feel like I had been raped. Like someone came and saw my naked mind, my naked soul, possessed it and wrote it down to shoot it later in ""before sunset"". I am nothing like the perfect beautiful blond actress, and certainly I am not a successful intellectual activist although I do like the ""wonder woman feeling"", helping here and there once in a while. And neurotic? maybe I am a little of that. One of the scene shots in that movie, named ""Dying inside"" told my love life story in less than 4 minutes. It's funny how insignificant you feel after such a thing happens. My concepts of love, romanticism, independence and frustration are there, in those 4 minutes along with the funny story of boyfriends that break up with me and get married, and call me later to thank me for showing them what love was. And that passive anger of not having been asked of not having deserved that honor While I am sure I would have said no, and I am sure none of them were the right oneif such a thing exists. I've been hiding for 5 years behind the wall of rationalism. Logic, strength, independence. And all these years I have longed for that experience of romantic love that was stolen once, or many times in my past. It's funny when it doesn't matter anymore to tell the truth out in the open, for anyone to see it grasp it and maybe get the courage to tell their own I am just another woman longing for her blue prince to pick her up on a white horse and take her to his castle well not that simple of course. In my long 5 years of single life, I have managed to put together the most ridiculous huge and complicated list of perfect attributes for that blue prince In the end though, I guess it would be enough to know someone that makes me shiver just by the encounter of sights, that threatens my rational arguments and with whom I can forget the bullshit and simply be myself but believe me that alone is too complex to even get close to reality It's funny how human beings love to complicate the beautiful simplicity of life and when it becomes a vice I doubt it has a way back. I have a confession to make, I am a weak daydreamer of romantic love, like any other cheesy woman And I am dying inside pretending all the time the strength and independence I don't have. I saw my self in that movie, like I dared to face a mirror for the first time in my life and found a tiny little creature too scared to even look straight into her eyes. I wish I could thank the writers... for ""stealing my story"", in the end maybe that's the story of everyone... and somehow, that's a relief. In the meantime, I'll keep on laughing at myself until I am too tired to continue my own acting role and decide to show the real one if that ever happens.22/11/04",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Major letdown: an uncalled-for sequel,"What a major disappointment...This film is VERY contrived, taking all the magic from the first endeavour. I watched and loved ""Sunrise"" a few days ago and was thus very eager for this. I wonder how most people - well, here at least... - seem to find it so good. One word occurred to me throughout the whole experience: unnecessary. Plus, there's some real painful dialogue to go through this time around, namely from Celine's character. Lame, clichéd, ill-written. The location is once again a mere postcard, but even that works less good than Vienna did.Perhaps the worst thing though: this time it was virtually impossible to feel the attraction. Null chemistry. What I saw were two actors trying to rehash their old hit. Acting the whole time. And using ""right?"" at the end of every 3 sentences.Now if I could just unsee this and stay with the magic of the original movie...",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Insult to Injury,"The prequel was bad enough: this is a direct insult. Rick Linklater's not been back to Europe (some would guess from the first movie he only saw it on postcards) and Julie Delphy's contributed most of the dialogue.And dialogue is all you get, dear moviegoer, and if you think for one moment there's something deep and subtle here, maybe you should go on a wild goose chase for the holy grail or UFOs in Nevada. Delphy wrote good dialogue, but the premise of this turkey is tripe, tripe, and more tripe.Endings can always be bad, but Linklater excels at them. And if the first one wasn't bad enough, here he comes spitting in your face with the second. He has one thought on his mind only: $$$. I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say it's an utter crass cynical cop- out with a sole purpose: leave everything open for yet a third movie in this abortive series.And what will they call that? 'Before Sunrise X' as they initially called this one, where 'X' becomes '2' or '3' depending on? Or how about 'Before Noon'?Whatever: it's going to be a turkey too. If you've seen both this and the first, avoid that third one if/when it comes. Don't strike out.",,Anonymous,Romance
What ifs and Whys,"Just like the first movie, talking is the main thing that drives of the story. This time, less intimate. There were uninsteresting moments especially in the first half.

Looking forward to watch the third movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful sequel worth seeing....,"8.3/10This is a beautiful film that was worth being made. I say that because often times sequels disappoint because they are made for the sake of being made. However, this film was made to find love.Director Richard Linklater uses his real life experience to tell both this story and the one from ""Before Sunrise"". Linklater met a woman, had an incredible night back in the 90s, and then lost touch. This film was made in an attempt to find her again. Unfortunately, that woman passed away before even the first film was shot, but he didn't find out about until after this films release.That being said. The heart that is put into telling the story is simple, yet beautiful. While I found Hawke's and Delpy's chemistry to be not as strong as the first film. The words and the body language came across poetically. I get there has been a passage of time, but I would've thought that the chemistry would be stronger than what was portrayed.While the acting didn't get to me. The story did. ""What if you had a chance with the one that got away?"" This part of the story touched me deeper as I've had this thought about a girl and so it became more personal on screen.The fact in the movie that they have a rekindling after such a long time apart and they think about the ""what ifs?"" gives it a human connection that lots of people have thought about in their own lives.The story is even more encapsulated by the cinematography. It's simple yet captures the moment. We're living these two individuals lives for 80 minutes in real time. The continuous shots and the walking of the environment just absorbs into itself.Overall, a great romantic sequel that portrays a real world ""dilemma"", but tells it in such a poetic way that you care about what's happening. I would definitely recommend the ""Before Sun"" series, but only if you don't mind the odd explicit conversations about sex, because remember real world circumstances.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved it!!!,"I watched the first file exactly nine years ago, some part were vague but they flashed back a bit. I found it tasteful, engaging, and highly realistic. I felt I was with them, walking around eavesdropping on their conversation. It was excellent! I found the actors were able to maintain their chemistry mixed with anticipation of what each of them was going to do next. Both actors did a great job of appearing nervous yet natural. It was nice to see both characters had evolved, yet remained the same. I felt both ethan and julie did a fantastic job of recreating their connection. I also appreciated a bit of a tour of Paris in the film. Since ethan is visiting Paris it was nice to capture his perspective of Paris. All in all, I really loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Linklater does it again,"Before Sunrise, released in 1995 was a phenomenal film about young love and as someone who does not care for romance movies, I really really enjoyed Before Sunrise. Knowing that there were two sequels, I was even more intrigued. Well, in 2004 Before Sunset was released. The film was written, directed, and produced by Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, School of Rock, and Waking Life) and stars Ethan Hawke (Before Sunrise, Waking Life, and Assault on Precinct 13) and Julie Delpy (Before Sunrise, Waking Life, and Three Colors: White). The film was a financial success and also a critical success as well.Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke) is on a book signing tour and just so happens to be in Paris where he meets back up with Celine (Julie Delpy) of whom he met nine years before in Vienna and where they both had a night they would never forget. But now they are older and the question about what the future has in store for them still looms over head.Before Sunrise did a great job at portraying young love in how it can be quick and spontaneous and the ending was open ended enough for one to draw their own conclusions. Before Sunset was not a sequel that anyone asked for but Linklater does it again and gives another smart and powerful film. Before Sunrise was about young love and so Before Sunset is the growing up and wondering if love is for all. The big question anyone watching this film is gonna ask is whether or not Jesse and Celine get together and seeing where all the conversations go throughout the film. The acting feels natural as I always have seen in Linklater films and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine (while at first awkward) picks right back up as they practically pick up right where they left off. I cared enough about the characters in the first film that I was wanting to know more about them and what their lives have been like in the time since. Once the film wraps up, I find myself wanting more. Luckily, there is Before Midnight for that.Before Sunset is just a really great film all around and while I cant find it easy to recommend (it's unconventional style as with a lot of Linklater films will turn many away), it's definitely one to check out if you really enjoyed Before Sunrise.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A satisfying and charming sequel,"Jesse and Celine meet again for the first time since their encounter in Vienna, 9 years previous. This sequel follows a very similar format to Before Sunrise; it is more or less a real time conversation between the two leads, as they meander through Paris. This time, I felt the city was less of a feature, and it also feels more urgent snd purposeful as you know how the characters feel about each other already. It is charming, with phenomenally realistic performances. The conversation topics, stories and perspectives from both characters give a completely realistic impression of how these people have developed in a decade but also captures the essence of 30-something adulthood vs 20-something adulthood.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good dialogue but otherwise utterly trite film,"This movie is essentially the same shot of two people talking the entire way through, how can you call that a film?

The script isn't terrible, in fact for what it is, (an hour and a half conversation), It's watchable, but only barely and only if you are the type of sucker who appreciates that stuff. I don't want to insult people but more than 5000 people rated this 10 out of 10?

Romance Is Back In Town,"This is a real breath of fresh air in a movie climate grown stagnant with in-yer-face encounters that pass for love stories.  Superficially it couldn't be more simpler; the two protags who were last seen nine years ago in Vienna now meet again in Paris and schmooze about love and life and the whole damn thing.  And that's it - superficially. But underneath there's a whole lotta stuff going down. A coupla weeks ago in this same spot I blasted that bad joke Godard for his pathetic use of meaningless long takes in his debut film, Brainless.  Here's how it SHOULD be done, Jean-Luc:  The camera LEADS Jesse and Celine through tiny Parisienne thoroughfares but we don't really NOTICE because all the time they're walking they're TALKING, so where the aimless rambling of Belmondo made you AWARE that the camera was following him to no purpose, the dialogue that Delpy and Hawke lay on us has the opposite effect, making us FORGET that there's even a camera THERE, let alone what it's doing.  There's so much to praise here, not least the performances in what is  virtually a two-hander, if there are a brace of more natural-seeming performances out there than these two then I'm ready to show my ass in Macey's window. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better Delpy lays a song on us, in her own, undubbed voice, words and music by one J. Delpy (in real life she has just released an album of self-composed songs) and for perhaps the first time (her English is THAT good) we remember that she is actually French. The voice is warm with just a touch of Peggy Lee wistfulness about it and rounds off a perfect film.  9/10",,Anonymous,Romance
For those dissatisfied with Before Sunrise,"For those who were thoroughly disappointed by Before Sunrise, I have this to say: everything which did not work out then will come into place in Before Sunset as if by magic.I didn't even know what hit me.But it wasn't simply magic. This film is the product of the daring in a director, the maturity in the script and the honesty in the actors. If you have lived life, you would have known the anguish, the pain, the bittersweet and the what-might-have-been wistfulness that comes with romance. Stripped of melodrama, a singular curse of most Hollywood movies these days, this is about the most feeling film you can get.Now for the magical part. The ending was so sleek and such a tease.

MASTERPIECE,"I can't wait to finish this Trilogy/Before Sunset is a bit different from its predecessor, although it is the same as the Walk-and-Talk genre, but here it may be a bit lacking for romantic scenes, in contrast to the previous one which was very sweet.But that doesn't mean this film is bad, what I noticed was the unique story telling of this film.In this film, Celine and Jesse chat in real time, not with their predecessors, which is a very extraordinary thing for a 2003 film, almost all of the storylines are told directly and without any cut the acting of the two actors is very very realistic. , they look like they really miss each other but hold back their longing because their relationship status is not what it used to be. Changing facial expressions, the way they talk they both do this very - very realistically and IN ONE SCENE / CUTThe subject of the discussion they talked about was also quite heavy and related to their life problems, the climax of which was when Celine and Jesse were in the same car, where Celine and Jesse's very realistic expressions and body movements really depicted the figure of loving one another,each other and I repeat again hindered by their current status.In terms of acting and concept, this film is truly extraordinary, for those of you who like action/romantic films that are even more dramatic, I'm sure you will be bored and even sleepy watching this film.This film is a very unique and beautiful Masterpiece, I recommend this film for those of you who are tired of the same Romance films and try new things.Rest assured, if you are people who watch this film carefully, surely this film will feel very extraordinary.That's all from me, Bucek AlexsanderCheers.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Unexpected Reunion,"Richard Linklater presents Before Sunset (2004), which is the continuation of the talks that began in his film Before Sunrise (1995).This time has been nine years since Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) met, both now meet again in Paris and talk until the time comes when he must take the plane back home.The film is narrated in a linear fashion, we follow the two characters as they tour the city and talk, much of this is based on long sequence shots, which makes the film look like it is happening in real time. It is a simple story that is constructed from dialogue with the two characters. This is about second chances, in this case both begin to question themselves if they love to fantasize about the possibility of being together and lament about how fate has separated.Both the plot and the characters are very human, we handle something as normal as it is a reunion, and through that we have a history.The two main actors relied on the script, which shows in his performances, then, both know their characters and naturally react to everything and anything that helps the film feel forced and dialogues are very spontaneous.It's a film that ultimately leaves us wanting more, and that could be frustrating. Shows how the first love never forgets and leaves a big footprint. The fact that long after you return to be with the person you fell in love and know that you only have a few hours before separating again is what affects them the two characters and the richness of the film is to see them bring that situation through almost pure dialogue.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Romance is alive again; Hawke & Delpy are a cinematic couple for the archives,BEFORE SUNSET (2004) ***1/2 Filmmaker Richard Linklater reunites with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in this follow-up to their romantic comedy/drama 'Before Sunrise' nine years later where the one-night standers are inevitably reunited when Hawke is in France for a book-reading of a thinly-veiled account of their wonderful day and night together. Picking up almost immediately from their last encounter the two chatty and intelligently pleasant lovers try to rekindle a lost flame but more importantly self-discover just where they are in life with some very funny and poignant almost improvised dialogue (the three artists collaborated on the script and storytelling at hand) which runs breezily thanks in large part to the exquisitely beautiful French locations in an effortless non-stop walk between the two (Lee Daniel's documentary-like cinematography gets the job done).

"A great film about details, with very dynamic dialogs","There is no much to be said in a small review about this film. What i can say is that is a fantastic film and should be seen for everyone. It's all dialog based, but they are so interesting that it keeps you involved in the story in the entire and relatively short running time of around 80 minutes. It follows accurately the events of 'Before Sunrise' , the first installment of the now 'Before's trilogy' that it's set 9 years after the events of the aforementioned film. The protagonists share their experiences of the past 9 years, thoughts about the world and themselves. It's fantastic, and as i said, each subject talked about is richly detailed and interesting. There is apparently no cuts, every event is told in it's fully form. In fact, it is a real-time film, if that exists. And again, it's noteworthy saying: It's all about details. The walking on Paris's streets, the harmful barroom, the nature in the park, the emotions raising after each dialog about their lives... wonderfully rich.Definitely worth checking out. 9.2/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Their older, bolder, better","Before Sunrise follows Jesse (Ethan Hawke) who is now a bestselling author and reconnects with Celine (Julie Delpy) in Paris as Jesse is having a book tour as he's become a bestselling author. It follows similar territory as the first film but in my opinion, it is better and might be my favorite film out of the three films.
You can just feel the vibe of Paris and the characters wonderment even just watching their back 
 The biggest improvement that this sequel does than its predecessor is the pacing. It is about 20 minutes shorter than the first film giving it a brisk 80 minute run time. Another reason why this film works better is how mature the main characters are. In the first film, Jesse and Celine, although way more mature and intelligent than anybody typically is their age, they were still young and didn't have as much life experience to have even more thought-provoking conversations about life itself.The film is all dialogue and what I loved and admired about this film so much is how much this film depended on the two main leads. There isn't any action sequences or even supporting cast that can steal the show. It is focused squarely on these two performances and its just AMAZING and yes I had to capitalize that because that's how much praise they deserve. They achive what other actors strive to achieve, when watching the film, you don't notice the actor but instead feel as though you are watching real characters and eavesdropping on their daily life.The camera work is impressive as well as there are many long takes usually through a whole conversation of the two leads walking through Paris. Speaking of Paris, it is absolutely gorgeous and with the camerawork you can see the beauty of Paris as you are walking with Jesse and Celine.The problem is I can't really talk about what specific conversations these two share in the film without spoiling the experience for you. You find out where they've been during the past nine years, why they never met again, where they've been, what they are doing, in the past and maybe even in the future. Although I can't talk about the many philosophical conversations the film has here's a little taste of it!- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MwEo1B2ypkBefore Sunset isn't just my favorite film in the franchise but one of my favorite films of all time. Its a film about how something so small such as conversing can turn into something bigger, more thought provoking, and ultimately life changing. The ending is one of the most perfect endings to a film that I have seen. Its so simple yet hit me so deeply, and I could not recommend this film enough it is a true masterpiece that I hope you love too. :)Well that went deep.Score 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very well written and supported by good performances,"Reviewed November 2011This is more like a romantic version of earlier Kevin Smith's comedies. Very well written and it's quite mandatory that it is as the entire movie is just one conversation. I would've rated it a bit higher had it not dragged a bit somewhere in the middle.Jesse (Ethen Hawke) has a one day encounter with a French girl Celine (Julie Delpy) during his college days and has a wonderful time. They decide to meet again on a set date in the future when Celine doesn't show up. After 9 years, Jessi writes a book on the incident and gets quite famous. On the Paris leg of his book tour he meets Celine again and strikes conversation which is the content for the rest of the movie.For a wafer thin story like this, it requires excellent screenplay and a tremendous chemistry between the leads. The talent behind this movie sure delivers the required goods and a special mention should go to Julie Delpy for her excellent presence and contribution to writing. Only problem is that, it feels a little long to reach what it wants to show. There is a little drag just before they both get on the cab which spoiled my mood though it picks up soon after and ends fantastically. It operates on a shoe string budget and never deviates from the core of what it wants to show.It is extremely enjoyable and a good opportunity to showcase the writer's prowess and they do it with great panache.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm sure my wife would love to know that I met an ex-lover and we spent half our time together in Paris talking about sex. Perhaps this is why relationships today don't work out, but this is just my own musing. And it might be one of the worst endings ever.

Bravo.I do find myself as an emotional film critic because very few films do get my respect and result afterward in a personal session analyzing it. Wonderful not to see all the special effects, irritating one liners and simply use the intense conversation between two strong individuals. A conversation which is following the course of nature. You could almost use the famous film quote: ""You got me at hello"". When these two people meet, the question was more when then if. Being so obvious this didn't by any means destroy the true plot of the film.

great movie!,"I've seen ""Before sunset"" (german title) on the ""Berlinale"" and was really overwhelmed because I didn't expect so much from that sequel. I've seen the first part in 1995 and I liked it. But I loved the sequel because the makers successfully satisfied the expectations of the audience and - in my case - did even better.In the beginning there is a distance between Hawke and Delphy. Both are older now. They seem more reasonable, more secure. But after a while they approach each other step by step. And the more they talk, the more they reveal of their inner constitution, the more the audience is drawn into the films atmosphere.In a way it turns 1995 again, but its not the same, its different because of the experiences they made since that time.

Excellent Drama,"Well, isn't this what life and love are all about? Consider the dynamics of two characters with an obvious untold passion for one another and you have the makings of a dynamic and intimate exchange of the heart. This movie is not big on special effects and mundane for those who desire visual excitement, but therein is the essence of a human drama which takes place on the streets of Paris, a coffeshop, a tourist's boat, and a chauffeured vehicle ride to a quaint apartment.My first play of this movie was less than interesting; on re-play, I paid closerattention to the dialog between the two persons played by Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy .. and hence was almost bored on the first viewing; but the second time around I finally watched closely the conversation between two people ... it so reminded me of my dating relationship .. that I began to identify with the character .. it could have been my story, and, perhaps it is all of ""our"" stories as we pursue that special person in love and life.Julie Delpy pulls off a strikingly warm and witty performance, very much in control of the conversation and the dialog. A good use of camera-close ups pulls the viewer into her eyes and smile and ... soon she's your girl .. the one you desire, the one who erases the stresses and deadlines of the day.Ethan Hawke depicts a character who is the faithful husband, father and an accomplished author/romance novel writer .. his first encounter with Delpy is but nine years before and they have gone separate ways .. experienced different loves .. and yet the chemistry of their relationship is about to ignite in this touching and heart-felt exchange of commentary.One quickly sees an arresting chemistry between two ordinary and yet complicated people who have learned that life is never simple; and love is fleeting .. the honesty with which they exchange their world views .. and more importantly their personal desires is what draws the viewer into the dialog. We learn, sometimes in Griffie language, of hurt, pain, and wantings of the heart ...This is a movie that warrants a close inspection of the dialog; and while the clues are all there ... it is not until the ending that you see the pieces come together. Adult situations without Griffie sex -- a thinking person's movie.

We have to stop meeting like that.,"Nine years previously a much loved, but little known movie, ""Before Sunrise"" was filmed. Jesse and Celine met one on a train to Vienna and had a magical day and promised to meet each other 6 months later.Now, 9 years later the sequel is filmed telling us what happens 9 years later. Of course they meet again and I am not going to tell you any more simply because you should go to watch this movie with the same air of mystery.Now I watch ""Before sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" together, and if you have never seen ""Before sunrise"" then watch the two movies together. Because they are almost seamless in their natural style and go well together. Personally I was automatically thinking this would be a bad, we are all old and mature type sequel (Like the Sequel to the great musical ""Hair"", called ""Haircut""...and that isn't a joke, it is the real sequel).Yes, the characters and actors have grown 9 years older. They are more mature. They are also an extension of the people we met 9 years ago. Celine is a little more neurotic and Jesse a little more annoying and self centered.Once again, they will spend some time together. But far few hours this time, they are older with more time pressures. They also have more mature ideas about the same things they talked about before, as well as many new things too.Filmed and acted in such a natural style, you can't help feeling that these are real people.

It is the most realistic romantic movie I've ever seen...,"Before Sunset picks up nine years later and, unbelievably, it is an even better film. Actually, I'm not sure which of the two films is really better, except that ""Before Sunset"" is more relevant at this stage of my life and ""Before Sunrise"" is now more nostalgic. They are both so perfect in every way, and I can't think of another film like them. I guess Linklater was influenced by that genre of French films in which ""a man and a woman have a conversation about life and love and not much else happens."" The difference is that so often in the French films the conversation is banal, pretentious or self-important, posing as something more profound. Linklater's dialog is so natural; it moves from the mundane to the intelligent without a single false note. Both films were written and directed by Richard Linklater who does this kind of talky, real-time, thoughtful and realistic slice of life better than anyone (his film, ""Slacker,"" was a masterpiece). The story of Before Sunrise/Sunset is about serendipitously finding one's soulmate (for lack of a better word) at the wrong time, and desperately trying to forget and move on, but utterly failing. In the case of the couple in the film, they discover each other when they are students traveling on a train through Europe; he's American, she's French. When they unexpectedly meet again nine years later they learn that, in the intervening years, neither had found anything remotely close to what they shared in their brief time together, and they reconnect so easily, it's as if only a couple of months had passed. Once again, as in the first film, their timing is off; neither are free to drop everything else in their lives to take the plunge and play out the romance. As the Ethan Hawke character puts it so well, ""It is a choice between being my best self or my honest self.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Before Sunrise: Part 2,"Before Sunset is the sequel to the romantic movie Before Sunrise. Like its predecessor, it takes place strictly in real time. Again, there is no action or any other elements that are supposed to be present in a typical movie. The movie just focuses on the meeting of the two lead characters after a gap of 9 years since they met on the train. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy return and in addition to acting they also helped with the screenplay and are credited for the effort. The acting is effortless and the fact that the characters as well as the actors have aged exactly the same way adds to the realism that this movie aims for. Richard Linklater does not disappoint with the sequel that manages to stand as a great film on its own without comparing it to Before Sunrise. My only grievance for this movie is that it tends to get overdramatic in certain moments like when Julie Delpy breaks down while explaining that she always fails at relationships. The ambiguous ending keeps us wanting more which is just brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Blah Blah Blah,"In the beginning this movie seemed to have had some promise, but all is lost within the first 45 minutes or so of the film. The basic premise is two past lovers chance to encounter each other again years later, but their lives, of course, are different now.The movie is all dialog, save one musical performance. While this itself is not a turn-off for me it may be for some. I've enjoyed other movies of the format, but this wasn't one of them. The dialog is mainly between the two main characters. And the conversations, while many of us have experienced these dialogs with friends and lovers, past and present, and have probably enjoyed them and have fond memories of them, it's a completely different issue when one is not the participant and instead an involuntary voyeur. There's none of the same satisfaction or heightened emotion and instead I mostly wished I was somewhere else. After a while I'd pretty much heard all I want to hear and I'm thinking, ""Why don't they just sleep with each other already and be done with it?"" But instead the viewer is forced to witness, not though action but through talk, 80 minutes of the past and present lives of two individuals who still haven't given us reason to afford them any empathy.The writing does nothing to save it. It's not particularly humorous, witty, or interesting and so basically comes of as if the camera picked a random couple in Paris and decided to follow them for a day, giving us the full unedited account. I understand that this is a sequel and I did not see the first in the series, so understand that my lack of empathy might be thrown off because of it. I can only hope the first one is not as painful to watch.But if you play the movie with the sound muted you get a nice videography of Paris. Maybe then you could make up your own interesting dialog.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"'Your going to miss your flight...', 'I know...'","Call me a hopeefull romantic, but I loved this sequel.I have read the previous reviews and everyone has compared it to the first. It really should not be compared to the first, but an extension.'Before Sunrise' showed Jesse and Celine at 23 years old. Still in college, full of hope, dreams, and an ideology of youth.'Before Sunset' shows them nine years later. Hope lost, dreams gone and youth taken by age.As Jesse says in the beginning of Sunset, depending on what type of person you are, the hopefull...they meet six months later or the cynic...they don't meet. You as the viewer want to know what happens.Everyone loves a happy ending...sometimes reality does not give us one. Sunset is so close to real life it is scary.When Jesse and Celine are in the car and pretty much expressing how much nine years ago shaped there lives and afraid to feel the same they did on that July 16th so many years ago. How many times have we all felt that way...So, I leave you with Celine dancing and telling Jesse that he is going to miss the plane. Jesse agreeing, and the look in there eyes or hope, dreams and youth, slowly coming back.I would like to visit them again in about five years, still wondering if they do get back together.

Real,"It's one of the best written romance film ever I watched yet. It doesn't have complicated storyline or anything. Just walking and talking, don't even a destination while walking.I always saw romance movies a bit fake, or maybe I just realized it. Because I think what makes this movie perfect is that they didn't talk about only one topic that related to the plot. They just talk, like everyone talks with each other, but with little touches to the plot. I believe that's what makes this movie truly natural and naive.must see

An Equal Sequel,"Quite an engaging gab fest - loved the long dialogue scenes, loved the to and fro, and loved some of the acting. But I think I preferred the first meeting. Sure they were young and naive then, but that gave them an excuse for spouting optimism and romance. Here they're a bit older and wiser and the conversation feels less natural and more forced. The randomly deep insights, while impressive, clash a bit with the other insecurities and awkward jokes. Their current relationship is possibly too stuck in romanticising the original, therefore giving them false expectations of what they have now, but this doubt can probably go down as a plus for the film. A definite minus was some of the occasionally excessive false smiling, which I have to mark up against Ethan.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Trumps its predecessor,"Before Sunset outdoes its predecessor, Before Sunrise (a good film in its own right), because we are faced with the same characters in a more dramatic setting in their lives.  The idealized and rather immature notion of romance is gone, but parts of it is sought after by both Celine and Jesse, who face the all-too-familiar stage of loneliness and boredom in the mundane aspects of their days.  Powerful and heartbreaking, their conversations reach so much deeper than simply a declaration of love, but also encompasses confession and understanding of pain and loss.  It is a great movie through and through, right from the beginning to the end (especially the magnificent ending).  If you haven't seen Before Sunrise yet, I recommend seeing it before you see this one.joe k.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Excellent screenplay, fantastic role performances, sweet and original. Great.","This movie is just genius in its own genre. It's a romantic drama not like any other I've seen. I have to admit that I've never seen the first one (Before Sunrise), but I know things about it and pretty much the whole plot to be honest. This movie got me interested on the first one, so I'm probably going to watch it when I get my hands on it.The acting is just excellent in this film. The whole movie focuses on these two characters Jesse and Celine, played superbly by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. The chemistry between is just so close to excellence. What makes this movie interesting is that these two characters just simply discuss about everything, something which is just normal for people to talk about and they don't hold onto one subject, as the subject of their conversations changes all the time. It just makes the movie so real and you forget about all the acting, it's like that those two characters would in fact be real persons and not made up ones. This brings me to the dialog, which is by far one of the best ones I've seen on screen, it just feels so real. The flow between the conversations, the whole dialog, is just fantastic.The movie lasts for 1 hour and 20 minutes, which feels like the whole plot is based on that lenght, it's just so flowing. I mean it's like the two characters would actually hang around for just one hour and those 20 minutes. They just move from one place to another and there is no other characters interrupting their conversations or anything, the whole movie just focuses on the two characters which have this certain tension between them. There is no other essential characters, which is kinda intelligent, or at least for me. I like to think that Jesse is more of an aggressive type between the conversations of the characters, though they're both are feeling a bit ashamed in a certain level, because of what happened 9 years before. Jesse's making these references to for example sex and the night which they spent together 9 years ago and so is Celine, but not as much as Jesse, who quickly changes the references to fooling around and joking, using it as a certain self-defense. Or at least that is what I think of it.There isn't one single unnecessary scene in this movie, every scene is there for a reason, which brings me to the conclusion that the screenplay's just excellent. Though the movie is a romantic drama, it isn't cliché at all, so I can recommend this movie to everyone. It's original, interesting and entertaining in its own way and it is a surprisingly pleasant movie to watch although there isn't actually anything mind breaking happening, just a movie about normal people in normal circumstances and it just does it so realistically. Just great.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too much meaningless dialog,"It seems like this movie was trying too hard to be another ""My Dinner with Andre"", but that aspect failed. The dialog between the two characters was just so superficial and uninteresting, not thought provoking at all. What made that worse is that I think it was intended to be ""deep"". I found myself thinking, especially about the Celine character, ""When is she going to shut up?"" Because she was talking so much about so many uninteresting and superficial things, it also took away from the romantic aspect between the two characters. I really didn't feel any chemistry between them.I should add that the high point for me in this film were the songs that Julie Duply wrote and performed. She has a lovely singing voice.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful, sad, happy, real. Simply amazing.","First I have to say that I haven't been this moved by a film for quite some time. At the first you notice that its not filmed in an ordinary manner. Its a dialog between Jesse and Celine. And if i would have known this before I might be put off from watching it. Don't be.In a way the whole dialog represents the way we think during our lives. It sums it up in a way. It is just so authentic. How we slowly become numb, maybe don't even realize it. Love turns out not to be what we expected but we never really stop hoping somewhere deep inside. We have dreams and we wish them to come true but reality drags us down. Having a dream, a strong wish, desire can be extremely hard and emotionally painful if it does not come true. It is just a burden, a perspective by which we weigh our experiences.But then again when we have our dreams come true, after a while,don't we just find ourselves wanting more ? Not necessarily. When you have experienced the good and the bad, you do not idealize that much anymore. It think it is about enjoying the simple things, honesty, joy, following your heart and not your ego, being a good person and living one day at a time.Made my day in any case.",,Anonymous,Romance
Utterly majestic.,"In 1995, director Richard Linklater released a little romantic comedy called Before Sunrise, which made only 5 million dollars, but became a cult favourite on VHS/DVD.  Nearly a decade later, Linklater reunites with the film's stars (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawk) to produce this sequel.  The motive clearly wasn't financial, given the rather limited success of the original; this was a labour of love for all involved.  I haven't seen the original film, but having seen the sequel, it has now become a major priority.  I must see where this all began. The plot is minimalist.  Jesse (Hawk) is now a successful writer, and is touring Paris when he encounters Celine (Delpy).  Jesse and Celine wander around the city for an hour and a bit, with Jesse's imminent departure the film's ticking clock.  The plot is not the point; this film relies on dialogue and the strength of the two actors' performances.  French actress Julie Delpy is truly radiant as Celine, instantly becoming one of my favourite actresses.  Ethan Hawk, who has done little work seen by me since Dead Poets Society, is also great as Jesse.  No other actor has more then a couple of lines. The dialogue of Before Sunset is wonderful, all of it feeling natural, never forced. Like the first film, the ending of this film is open-ended, although there is a very obvious (and correct) direction for series to take.  Bring on Before_______.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
more depressing than the first!!!!!,"in this sequel to before sunrise Richard Linklater once again takes a masterful albeit bittersweet tone to film dialogue and walks away once again reminding us of Shakespeare's line about life being but ""sound and fury, signifying nothing"" this time around however he takes the anything can happen attitude of the first sequel and smothers it under an attitude of ""but most things are improbable"". The continuing story of two strangers who can and should be but simply aren't also reminds us of the short story by Haraku Murakami ""On Seeing The 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning"" The sadness of the fleeting moments and how even as we grasp at the here and now it still manages to slip through are fingers, seems to be what Linklater as down to perfection and the everyone should see this film and it's sad predecessor before they die.

You don't get the chance to see sequels to movies like this very often.So, this was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year for me. I just saw a sneak preview of it yesterday and it works on exactly the same levels that the first one did. It is simply just these two people walking the streets of Paris (Before Sunrise was Vienna iirc) talking, talking about life, romance, people, love, relationships. The movie relies on acting and dialogue. Aside from the views of Paris, there isn't much more to it.And I loved it. It was a wonderful movie.And I love movies that rely on acting and dialog to make them work. I saw another Ethan Hawke movie recently, ""Tape"" which follows the same principles.

"Linklater did it again...great film, perfect title.","I never expected to see a sequel to Before Sunrise and had I heard that they would be making one, I would have simply asked why.  But having seen a screening of it, I profess that Linklater has managed to capture the magic again.Linklater, et al, have successfully brought us another wonderful and intimate film with Hawke and Delphy.  Their characters have grown into adults in a way that you would have hoped and expected without being predictable.  Delphy and Hawke have a unique and pleasant chemistry that keeps you rooting for them the whole time.  I'm sure these two are very close in real life.The setting and scenery are perfect and left me longing for a trip to Europe and lamenting the fact that I wasn't actually watching this in Europe.One of the many things that impressed me the most about this film is the fact that you need not see the first one in order to understand this one. Another thing that impressed me is the perfect title, ""If Not Now"". I'm glad that this is the title.  It would cheat the whole charm of the film if they went with something like, ""Before...this"", or ""After...that"".  A title like that would only be pandering to the marketing department, not to mention the fact that it would make it sound like Ice Cube's ""Friday"" series.Before I conclude I would also like to applaud the fantastic ending.  Not many filmmakers can pull and ending off like that without leaving an audience feeling cheated.  In this case the opposite is true and I left feeling rewarded and satisfied.",,Anonymous,Romance

Low-Cal Romance,"This low-cal romance is probably a triumph for Hawke personally, who worked on the script, in terms of its astute commentary on current relationships experienced by Generation X. It's reminiscent of a comment he made in REALITY BITES about life being a random series of events and near escapes - you know the line.The two actors carry this vignette in an 80 minute running dialog which is so well rehearsed that at time it has a sing-song quality. Speaking of song, one of the film's highlights is Duply's sweetly sung love ballad with notes of dismay, which recaptures her essential beauty and charm in the nick of time before the film ends, (but doesn't really conclude).Being a chick, I gulped down every moment of this frothy café latte made with skim milk, and would not change a bit of it, even the abrupt ending, except for one small detail. When Celine mistakes Jessie's ""merci"" for ""messy"", she sarcastically mocks his French. If I were writing the script, I would have given him a come-back bit, complimenting her improved English skills with, ""but you, your English is, how you say, 'tres bien!'"".",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A sequel that satisfies,"You should really see ""Before Sunrise"" (1995) first. If you don't enjoy that - and many will find it too slow and wordy - then don't bother with the follow-up. If you liked the original - and I certainly did - then you have to see this sequel (2004).It's the same director and co-writer (Richard Linklater); it's the same actors playing the same characters (Ethan Hawke as the American Jesse and Julie Delpy as the French Celine); and it's the same structure (essentially one long conversation as the duo walk around a European city over the space of a few hours). Again the dialogue and acting are so naturalistic that one feels that one is listening in on a real exchange.What's different? It's day not night. The city is Paris not Vienna. Most importantly, it's nine years later and Jesse and Celine have lived and loved in their own fashion and had time to think about what might have been. But can it still be? Most sequels fall short of the original; this one complements it beautifully.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Picks up right where the first left off, just a little later than planned...","I must start by saying that finding Before Sunrise on DVD turned out to be just as taxing as finding this wonderful followup in theaters. Apparently limited release means just that, and if you don't live in NY or LA, its very possible you wouldn't even know these movies exist. While its not necessary to have seen the first to enjoy this one, you owe it to yourself to know the entire story. Before Sunset picks up where Before Sunrise leaves off. Well, not quite. Its well after the six months agreed upon for the next meeting. Jesse has written a book about the fateful night he spent in Vienna, of all things. He's on the last leg of his book tour, which just happens to be Paris. As he's fielding his last question he catches a glimpse of a familiar face and somehow manages to wrap up the session w/o totally losing it. After a brief chat outside the bookstore, Jesse has the idea that Celine could show him around Paris before his plane leaves that evening, which she gladly agrees to. As the two learn more about the years that have passed they can't help but to be drawn closer. Closer to what is the only real question... Much like the first, this film is a great date movie, exploring the various insecurities we all have, the emotional baggage we accumulate over the years. It also goes into the whole ""what if"" factor of situations that don't receive the necessary closure and expands on how some moments really do stick w/us longer than we intend. Ultimately the film revolves around the many faces of love and the different roads that the search for it can lead us on.

Love before the sun sets,"Before Sunset isn't only the underrated and hidden gem of Richard Linklater but also that of 2004. The simple reason is that this has to be one of the best movies of this year.The movie depended very much on Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy and their compelling chemistry is unmistakable. From the time they left the book store till the time they ended in Celine's apartment, it's 90 minutes of witty conversation that covered a wide range of topics from books to environmental issues to politics to love and life. There was never a dull moment because there's so much realism and bittersweetness in the recounting of that fateful night 9 years ago. And it's this night that had caused two long-lost people separated by time and distance to rediscover the love they had always had for each other despite the changes to their lives in those 9 years.Julie Delpy puts up a good job as Celine whose love life had never been smooth but still held deep love for her one night companion 9 years ago from which her memory could never erase. Her display of emotions are spectacular, culminating in the scene where she emulates a late famous singer's moves while Ethan Hawke was watching her. Her heartfelt rendition of the original song Waltz for a Night must have been the highlight of the entire movie.Ethan Hawke has displayed much maturity since Sunrise and playes a guy trapped in a loveless marriage whose yearning for Celine is so strong. When he cast his eyes on Celine, it's almost as if he had said so much to her when no words were even spoken. It's that look that transcends time and space.In the end, the movie isn't your typical romantic story but achieves its aim to touch one deep inside and ask oneself if one had ever known love like that. It doesn't matter how long one might have known someone but it's really the power of the being connected to someone wherever the person is that makes the difference.It's about re-living and -capturing that moment that will potentially fulfill an unended desire, knowing that without this person, your life will never be whole. That's what love should really be, perhaps. And yes, all these achieved without any sex.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Not just once. Each viewing yields a different interpretation.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A completely silly film for the intellectually pompous.,"Well, if you want to watch two unattractive 30-something smokers who talk a load of philosophical twaddle while attempting to intellectually crawl through the absurdity of the X Generation's philosophical pretense to , um, get laid or whatever, then you might actually force yourself to watch this tripe all the way through.It's a silly and meaningless film, fatuous, but it will probably appeal to the armchair philosopher who undoubtedly believes he's watching something, like, um, really deep as he discusses it over the wrong wine with the crappy shrimp dinner  The acting is pretty good, in the sense that the actors are not self-conscious (unlike the film) and can at least remember their lines, but the script is simply a wordy pseudo-intellectual waste of time, flecked with the tell-tale anxiety that is always present when the superficial attempt to describe existence. I am sure the writers believe they're intellectuals, breaking barriers in dealing with ongoing male/female angst don't you know, throwing in a few French phrases to flatter the audience, who also think they're intellectuals but whose French is limited to ""oui"" and ""Coca Cola"", but who cares  In the end, no one cares. In the end it's a romance that's not romantic.Some critics on this board have attempted to compare this to ""My Dinner with Andre"", which is truly a masterpiece of writing (and a 9/10). ""Before Sunset"" has only a pale semblance to that great film.Four out of 10 only because the actors do a great job with a pretentious script.",,Anonymous,Romance

The french girl seemed strikingly smart the way she performed during the whole movie, very intimidating women indeed. I met her during a award ceremony in San Fransico and she is a amazing women. I wish the cast best of luck and success for future.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Worst movie of all time,"Going to the dentist for invasive surgery, paying double for my utilities, jumping from a moving vehicle-do these fun things before seeing what must be the worst movie ever. It was so terrible, that my wife and I considered it a challenge just to watch the WHOLE THING. The ""acting"" - stilted and unbelievable, the dialog-clumsy and sophomoric! I had no idea this was a sequel to another movie, when I learned this I was flabbergasted. Reading some of praise were some of the stuff that made me laugh out loud, like the part where Celine (that name reason enough not to see this) reaches out to touch and then pulls her hand back, ooooooh wow, I could almost taste how tentative and conflicted her character was. I want my time back. Please, will the makers of this movie share whatever it was they were smoking with me.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film was like seeing an old friend,"I saw the first movie ""before sunrise"" years back and it is the best romantic film I have ever seen. Maybe because I love traveling. I love traveling because anything can happen when you are in a place you have never been. The excitement of what you will do and who you will meet. The first movie really is a prerequisite to this film. You will be lost and probably bored with this film if you do not see the first one. I don't think it can stand on its own.The major difference I see is that the first film was also at a slower pace.All the scenes seemed rushed a bit too much in this film. The characters have very similar behaviors still from the first film. I thought there was no chance they would ever make a sequel to the first film since it was so odd, so I was thrilled to see they actually did.I have to say that I feel a bit sad seeing the film though. Both characters seem to have spent the last 9 years without what they really wanted in life.Neither makes any claim to be happy or really even close. The ending was pretty powerful with the scenes in the cab. The film really should have been longer and paced slower I think. It does end on a note that is sort of not a good possible solution - as if life has gotten more complicated now that they are older and they are now hopelessly lost since they didn't make it work the first time around.I am glad they made the film, and it does show that maybe when you are young, you can be very romantic, but when you get older, you are forced into reality by the structure of life. I highly recommend seeing both films. I could not recommend just seeing this film on its own.",,Anonymous,Romance
Long Love Chats on the Sena River,"""Before Sunset"" is a very personal movie. Starting from there, you won't expect cheesy dialogs, nor action scenes but sincere conversations in the zenit of the beautiful Paris and discover how Love can be utterly talked and not physically demonstrated. That is basically it: Love is talked and debated to its best. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delply are helped by their sound chemistry and a perfect use of their hidden emotions to show profound love.A very spontaneous script is softly produced as we travel over the charming settings on the french Riviera. This movie is recommended for quiet, peaceful moments in couples. The lack of dynamics and the somewhat little change of scenario make it dense, but there's no issue if you fell in love hearing the honest dialogs.If you are a romantic person; then this movie is for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredible,"This movie, Until Sunset is incredible. The way the characters interact, really makes you feel a connection between the characters and hope they find a way to stay together. The chemistry, conversation (and the background scenery) really creates a magical atmosphere. I enjoyed this much more that the first movie, Until Sunrise. It feels much more ""real"" and the bond between the characters comes through much stronger, more emotional and more authenticly. After watchilng Until Sunset, The first movie Until Sunrise feels really ""blah"" compareed to the intenisity of the Until Sunset. You can feel throughout the movie how the characters are still holding themselves back, and not trusting themselves or the other person to express their true emotions, but through the way they speak and body language, you feel that the strong emotions are right below the surface, yearning to be expressed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A talky romantic effortless sequel,"""Life's hard. It's supposed to be. If we didn't suffer, we'd never learn anything.""Before Sunrise felt like such a perfect romantic movie that many people had doubts about reuniting these characters nine years later and making a sequel, but fear not because Richard Linklater gives us another perfect story and both Delpy and Hawke are magnificent together. I imagine that everyone that had seen the film back in 1995 made their own conclusions of whether or not these two lovers met six months later like they planned, but now Linklater decides to tell us what happened exactly. I didn't have to think too much about it because I saw Sunrise yesterday, watched Sunset today, and now will get to watch Midnight. I thought this was a perfect sequel to Sunrise and pretty much follows a similar plot line, but with more mature conversations now that the characters have aged. I imagine that those people that had to wait nine years between each sequel probably had a much richer experience than those of us who simply got to see these films in one week, especially those viewers who were about 23 years old in 1995 and matured at sort of the same rate these characters did. In Before Sunset the characters are in their 30's which is the age I'm at now so I related much more to what they were saying this time around. The first film was nostalgic, reminding me how I thought when I was their age, but this time I could identify with them in the present. Looking back and remembering those connections you made with someone and realizing that those connections are hard to come across now that you are older. I guess in a way you value things more now that perhaps in the past you wouldn't. Linklater succeeds once again at bringing a really romantic tale to the big screen.In Before Sunrise Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) met as strangers in a train and spent a night together wandering the streets of Vienna. Before Sunset takes place nine years later as Jesse is at the end of his European book tour in Paris. He has written an autobiographical book about his encounter with Celine although he never admits that the events are true. When he finishes talking about his book he is surprised to see Celine there waiting for him. She lives in Paris and had heard he was going to be speaking at that book store so she decided to go see him. Jesse has to be back at the airport in an hour, but the two get together once again for a cup of coffee and a walk through the streets of Paris while they talk about their life, work, and relationships. They also let us know what happened that day they were supposed to reunite in Vienna.If there's something negative I could say about Before Sunset it's that it is way too short and you wish the characters could have spent at least half an hour longer together. This time the film and the events that take place are in real time so you have several long shots (the longest one is 11 minutes long) and few editing going on. The film isn't as brilliant to look at, but it is a great conversation to eavesdrop. The chemistry is strong again and this time there is more conversation and less passion, but it works really well. Before Sunset never felt like a forced sequel; it was more of a continuation of that movie and hopefully I will feel the same way about Before Midnight. Linklater was nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay and deservingly so with the contribution of Hawke and Delpy who also co-wrote this film. Before Sunset is a beautiful and romantic film that is well worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just two characters constantly talking...And it's great.,"What this movie basically is, is a conversation between two character, one guy and a woman talking about life in general, there dreams, society and what they faced etc...But the movie is very interesting and is just entertaining to watch two character just ramble on. The movie is believable and realistic to the point you can't help but buy into it. Although few times I felt it was actors and actresses on screen but most of the way through it felt like real people not characters having real conversations with each other. And that is one of the elements that drives this movie besides the topic of the conversations which is another key element that made this movie good. What other thing that impressed me is the long one take scenes during the conversations since if they screwed up they would have to start that whole long take over again. Sometimes it seems like it compacted a bunch of interesting thoughts about certain stuff into one movie as much as possible but for the most part it's alright. And it also didn't seem all that forced and seemed natural most of the way through to the point it felt like a improv or they winged it. Some of the stuff the characters cover some audiences might agree with and some might not, but it's still interesting conversations that you won't mind listening to. Like how sometimes you might eavesdrop into other people's conversation and be interested in it, this movie is the epitome of that. The chemistry between the two characters was also really good. The ""what if"" aspect to this movie is also very well integrated into this movie. Even if this movie is about two people having conversations you will probably appreciate this movie even more the second time you watch it.8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
nearly perfect,"When Jesse and Celine met 9 years ago in Vienna, I fell in love with them - bright eyed, full of life and love. Waiting so long for Before Sunset was a test: Are you an optimist? Or a realist? This film was worth the wait. I stood in line at the Seattle International Film Festival with hundreds of other fans who shared the same sentiment. As far as I could tell, we all held our breath as they met again, and cried when we heard if they had ever met again in Vienna all those years before.And just like before, this film leaves loose ends.

Uuuuum.....,"I am slowly working my way through Empire Magazine's Top 500 films. Sometimes little gems turn up - Cinema Paradiso, The Thin Man, Clerks - and occasionally I'm left cold.I'm afraid this film was in the second variety. Before I watched it I read only good reviews - how does IMDb classify them? So I thought it would be worth dropping a few slightly more alternative thoughts on a film I so wanted to enjoy. 1. The main characters are soooo boring, honestly I cannot imagine spending any more than 10 minutes with them in real life. Gauche and self obsessed; not my cup of tea and definitely not people to care about. 2. The script is weak as water. It honestly sounds like they were making it up as they went along - badly. It was like watching Big Brother - boring people saying boring things. 3. There's no atmosphere to the film, no colour, no spark. I mean nothing - no characters, no character. It's great to see Hollywood drag itself out of its natural home - the west coast, and even better to attempt a film like this, but it never really works. Setting a film in Paris and employing a French actress doesn't make it worth watching, I would suggest trying one of the other 499.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spirited emptiness,"The second half of a movie that started 10 years ago, the second half of a relationship with these people. Few things have changed since; so again we have a film worked in someone's typewriter; two actors of some talent brought in to improvise a chemistry and flesh a connection; a passive camera attached to these people, more or less the same medium shot tracking them down Paris.We get to see that both have changed since we first met them. She has grown despondent in her spirited idealism, his cynicism has been mellowed by more experience inside of him. Both have been deeply shaken by an encounter with the emptiness of life. Otherwise it plays very much like that earlier film, except with anxieties that have matured along with them.But this one has the additional benefit of layering in that first film, a second perspective that was missing there. The man has written a book from the events that we experienced as that film. It could have been very potent stuff, like 2046 is to In the Mood for Love. There is some effort to comment on fictions shaped from memory, but it is light-weight stuff at best.The other thing that could have been potent is how the gap between these two films is handled, the part that went unfilmed and is actual life away from the camera. How they handle it in turn, between them. It is again a disappointment; we know within the first 15 minutes all that is to know, who showed up and who didn't. It's even more slight if you consider that we got a film like Certified Copy since.What is left is that scene where Celine goes boating. She gets to see the Seine from a perspective hitherto unexplored, a touristy view. They bare their souls with a little less cuteness this time, but maybe these two were not worth getting to know in the first place, or this filmmaker to tell us about them.",,Anonymous,Romance
Not a One-Time Watch,"If someone asked me to give a one-line review of Before Sunset, i would say ""Maximum use of minimum resources."" All praise to Richard Linklater for bringing out a better sequel to his high-critically-acclaimed Before Sunrise. Keeping the essence intact, he brings his brain-children Jesse and Celine to the City of Love, Paris. The dialogs catch the viewers' attention and its a smooth glide from start to end. The performance of the two stalwarts stand out. Ethan Hawke as Jesse Wallace is flawless, but what takes this movie to another height is the bravura performance of Julie Delpy. The sensitive, sometimes erratic woman, Celine, she portrays comes to life and it is like she is giving you a tour of Paris. The screenplay is one of the best of the decade. Richard Linklater, along with his two character leads, Ethan and Julie, wrote the screenplay together that adds the edge. The songs are soothing, especially ""A Waltz For A Night"" and ""An Ocean Apart"". Nina Simone is also paid homage by a mesmerizing mimicry by Julie Delpy. The editing work could have been better. There are a few gaping flaws, or goofs as we know them. I have enjoyed the movie all the three times I watched it. The scenes remain in your head long after it is over.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Praise of the film and discussion of some reasons why it works so well,"""Before Sunset"" is one of the most exquisite romantic modern films I have ever seen. It is reminiscent of the following two movies: Claude Lelouch's ""Un homme et une femme"" (""A Man and a Woman"" 1966) and Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Trois couleurs: Rouge"" (""Red"") in that it is a magnificent study of the inner workings of a relationship between two people who meet accidentally: a man and a woman. But their ages, nationalities, and successes (things often used to classify people) are not why the characters in these movies connect. These films are brief glimpses of details that make relationships so intense and so special. The backdrop of Paris adds a lushness to the film's beauty, and it is a comment on the themes of movement, transience, and touring or visiting a place as opposed to living there and it becoming fabric in one's day-to-day ""real life."" At first viewing, the conversation between the two characters feels so natural, making it surprising to learn that there is no adlib in this film. However, at second viewing, (We stayed for the very next showing of the film!) the brilliance of the construction of the conversation became obvious. Every word is fraught with risk and meaning, even in the beginning of the movie, as the characters talk around the subject of their relationship so masterfully, while using it as every referential point in their dialogue.The themes in their conversation have a universality to them, and the connection between the characters makes the viewer forget that there is a clash of cultures, for she is French while he is American. The film manages to isolate bits and pieces of what it is that truly connects two strangers - soul mates in a once or twice opportunity in a lifetime.The ending of this film is nothing short of breathtaking. It makes me think of the Woody Allen film ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" in that the viewer is tempted to leave his/her seat and walk into the movie itself. For, this movie portrays a world where the possibility of returning to pivotal people in our pasts and revisiting the most important moments in time, where our lives irrevocably change is possible.Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke, and Richard Linklater are brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
more than lives up to the first film,"The film is wonderful. If you saw the first, 'Before Sunrise', you'll definitely want to watch this sequel. I was very anxious about the prospect of a sequel to Sunrise which was a self- contained film that wasn't demanding a sequel. Although 'Before Sunrise' ended with an aching ambiguity I was dreading the prospect of a sequel because it would have been far too easy to screw it up and ruin the memory of the first. To their credit, they didn't. In fact, I found that Sunset surpasses Sunrise in depth and maturity. Both characters reappear now nine years later as more complex and with greater depth. The writing is spot-on and authentic, and it's clear that everyone involved has invested themselves into the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect,"Ingenious is the best word to describe this film. The beautiful Paris setting for two people who reunite after nine years apart after one magical day is pure heaven. That being said, this film is purely for those who love independent cinema and love films purely about people. If you love those two things, you will be hard pressed to find a more perfect romantic story than this one.One of the reasons this film is so special is because it takes us from the awareness we are watching something fictitious; it just feels so real. The relationship between Jesse and Céline feels so authentic. This film basically just encompasses their conversation in Paris before Jesse flies back to the U.S., and we as an audience realize how human these characters are. Their personal lives are in a corrosive state, they have never felt for another human being the way they did when they saw each other for the first and only time 9 years prior, and they ultimately realize they are not complete without one another. Most films would have a hard time establishing this pivotal part of a story and making it seem so real in just 80 minutes, but this film does it and succeeds.

"Not a Sequel, Just a Long Pause in Life","One of the most charming films in many years, Before Sunset gives love a second chance with two enormously believable actors in their original roles. Reprising the roles of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), the story takes up 9 years after they parted in Vienna after a one night stand, and the failed plans to meet again in 6 months, a semi-broken promise. But, for the couple, their paths cross again when author, Jesse winds up his publicity tour in Paris, and Celine, the environmental activist, attends his reading at Shakespeare and Co.If Paris is for lovers, the city is the stage for the duo to cruise its afternoon haunts and river as they catch up with their lives that have gone in diverse successful but unfulfilled directions. Celine follows her career to help environmental causes, but her heart remains closed and unwilling to open to another failed relationship. Jesse married his college girlfriend and has a child, but his dreams of something more still bring the memory of his unresolved relationship with Celine to his sleeping hours. What if is always seductive and so the reunited couple discuss what seems least important and hurtful in an effort to avoid the regret that seems to envelop them at every sentence.The notion of a second chance with the one who got away is every middle age and older individual's daydream, yet so few adults get an opportunity to have their dream come back in their life.With an abandonment of youthful pretext, the mature Celine and Jesse admit how the other was the innocent and most intriguing moment for them. However, they failed to act with foresight beyond youthful exuberance. In hindsight, they are both wounded or unfulfilled having failed to achieve what they held as the most personal goals -- that of meeting again with the lost love. Richard Linklater creates an enjoyable and mature film of resolution and renewal as the story of Celine and Jesse begins and ends at the exact right moment to leave audiences satisfied.Using both the on screen chemistry of his actors and the perfect timing of their storyline to resume the characters next move, Before Sunset is perhaps one of those rare films that is a better film than the first installment. It picks up right where it should with characters who have grown as individuals and through life's adventures, might grow more as their story continues to unfold.One need not view Before Sunrise to enjoy Before Sunset and the aging of its actors is both right and enjoyable. Hawke is not a boyish student, and Delpy is seductive with a French confidence that exudes sexy. The film's locations, dialogue, and music is just right for anyone who wants to step in the shoes of Jesse and Celine, and perhaps, take the next steps along their crossed new path.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Ok,"Let me start by saying that I was extremely disappointed with the sequel to Before Sunrise, Before Sunset. It fell far short of what I expected after viewing the first element of the trilogy.After having a good amount of time spent watching Before Sunrise, I expected Before Sunset to be a sequel that lived up to the hype. However, that did not happen. First of all, I must say that I loved the introduction of Jesse's situation in Paris. The presentation, the way it was written and intrepreted by Ethan Hawke (who is to be truly congratulated for his magnificent performance in this film and the previous one) and just the bookstore they chose (which is a real beauty) creates a certain comfort. It is almost as if the viewer is given the opportunity to settle down on his couch to the sound of magnificent words, for a wonderful journey is coming. And it is because of this that my disappointment is extremely greater than I expected.So I first criticize a fact that has been haunting me: is it possible that they still give Ethan fewer lines? He is an incredible, genuine actor who gives his all for the work, and for some reason that I don't understand, he hardly speaks at all in the first forty minutes. Instead, we are stuck listening to the wonderful stories of Céline, Julie Delpy's character. I was obviously ironic. And that brings me to my next criticism: the theme of conversations during the first forty or forty-five minutes. Everything that is discussed always revolves around the sexual relationships they had and she had afterwards and the like. If someone can explain to me what the need is for the viewer to know the story of Céline's boyfriend and the Buddhist monks, I'd really appreciate it. This criticism obviously and mostly stems from Céline. It really tires me to hear the same thing over and over again. And it derives in the next thought. Tell me, until the last twenty-five minutes, what do we learn that is of real importance about Jesse and Céline? About Jesse we know almost nothing, because he has virtually zero dialogue compared to Céline. About Céline, we already know what she talks about. So I guess I can say that what the film lacks is character development.In contrast, the good points. The first is obviously Ethan Hawke. Great actor and you can see that he enjoys the moments he spends making this trilogy, because the result, on his part, is truly stunning. The way he shows himself and the feelings he reveals while conveying his dialogues allows the viewer to create an empathy with his character (the same is not true for Julie Delpy, I find it extremely difficult to like her character). The second is my favorite part of the film: the last half hour. This is where we see the little but important character development and where we see the most impactful dialogues. The third is the end. By ending with a cliffhanger, Linklater creates a high desire to view the third film. Did he miss the plane? I guess I'll have to see the third and final element of this collection to figure it out.It is in these moments that I wish other numbers could be put in as ratings, as I feel torn. Do I give it 7, largely because of the dialogues (which have haunted me since the first element of the trilogy, Before Sunrise)? Do I give it a 8, largely because of the attempt at truthfulness to humanize the characters, beyond carnal desire, in the last half hour? I'd prefer to give it a 7.4, but since that's not possible, I'll give it a 8, to the confidence that the third will be better. If it is not, I will edit this review and will lower the rating of 4 that I gave to Before Sunset.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: I saw the third element of the trilogy a few days ago and found it mediocre. However, I also realized that, despite having a lot of filler and cringe situations, 4 is a well-deserved grade for Before Sunset.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
simple could also mean boring.,"I liked the fluidity of the dialog, although I don't consider its content as deep as everyone does. It was just a simple dialog, and as simple I also imply boring. I think it lacks passion and truly connection between the two. The last scene on her apartment seems so fake. At the end of the movie I felt like the director wanted to show simpleness and coolness, but it seemed so forced that I just couldn't buy it.

Great movie except for the ending,"OK, this is fair warning. Before Sunset is all talking. I would describe it as a romantic My Dinner with Andre or maybe an intellectual chick flick. The movie is one extended conversation between the two lead characters, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). They walk through the streets of Paris, they have coffee at a local café, they walk some more, they take a boat ride on the Seine, they are driven to her apartment, she invites him in, they talk a while in the apartment, movie over. That's it. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, forget it. You won't like the movie. People who don't like Julie Delpy or her character won't like the movie either because she has about two-thirds of the lines. Personally, I was fascinated by the conversation, and I thought Celine was mesmerizing. I did have one huge problem with Before Sunset. It ended too abruptly, before the end of the conversation. I wanted to see how things turned out, but the movie just leaves you hanging. At the screening I went to, there was a collective gasp from the audience at the end because we weren't expecting it to be over. My bottom line - great movie except for the ending (8 out of 10).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great acting, very good writing","Julie and Ethan do a great job of pulling off long scenes with intricate dialog while still legitimately being in the moment. After seeing this DVD several times, I can see the work they did as actors slowly building towards the end.Take a look at the movie with the sound low if you'd like to see how they evolve in their more ""animal"" selves -- as actors they do great work with flashes of mood in their faces and in their body language.It's interesting also to see scenes from the original movie in flashback. Before my wife and I saw Before Sunset, we rented Before Sunrise. I'd recommend that to anyone interested in seeing this movie.One final comment: Notice how little music is in the movie.

A Pleasantly Forgettable Treat,"Before Sunset is the indie sequel to the 1995 indie favorite, Before Sunrise. It's worth thinking about that statement for a moment or two. An indie sequel. That alone is something of note. That the sequel is quite good is also of note, but this is indie film-making where if a director is talented they tend to stay talented. It also was made for $10 million, which, despite it being significantly less than the $200 million blockbusters filling theaters recently, does still put its indie status in question. Regardless, what we have here is a pleasant movie, presented in a unique method, that largely maintains its integrity throughout to ultimately give you a warm squishy feeling that most of those uber-expensive blockbusters lack.The film stars Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke as Celine and Jesse, respectively. Years ago, in another movie, Jesse and Celine met on their way to Vienna, fell in love, had a wonderful day, then said they'd meet back in Vienna six months later. 'Before Sunset' informs us that, for one reason or another, they never made it back to see each other again. Jesse has turned into an author in the intervening years and is on a book tour in Paris for a novel he wrote about the Vienna trip, and Celine, having read the book, comes to see him. After a brief press conference, the two get together and begin to catch up on how the other has been doing with the other's life in the eighty minutes that Jesse has between the conference and his flight back to the United States.The eighty minutes is important because the entire movie plays out in real time, with not a single moment lost between the end of the opening credits and the start of the closing credits. The camera follows the two as they walk about Paris conversing about everything from career to sex to misconceptions about the last time they met up, generally following the ""we bought a steady-cam and by God we're going to use it"" school of photography.This style, while offering excellent views and colors throughout the film, does grate during some of the longer shots, putting you in nervous anticipation for a cutaway to another shot--or maybe that was just me being impatient. It also gives ample opportunity for the occasional mistake, in this case a few instances of visible boom mikes, something the $10 million budget should have prevented getting into the final edit.These few instances of perceived laziness, however, do nothing to detract from the generally excellent performances given by Hawke and Delpy. The two are conversationally frank and very believable, each delivering their dialogue in the kind of memory-drunk ways in which those types of meandering conversations tend to flow. In short, the performances are perfect for the material. If the material itself has any faults they are probably in the latter half of the film where the conversation goes from being happily non-committal to something of much more emotional depth. The transition between these two styles was realistic though given the feel of the film itself up to that point, it can be a bit jarring. Both sections of the movie are handled with equal aplomb, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoyed the first, happier, half to the second, more involved, half.Ultimately this is a filmic light snack. Something tasty, not too filling, very enjoyable, and in the end pleasantly forgettable. It is a window into eighty minutes of two lives intersecting years after a hopelessly romantic fling that stands apart from its prequel, looks beautiful, is well written, and is remarkably honest.",,Anonymous,Romance
It's so real!!!,"This is hands down the best sequel to the great romantic movie ""Before Sunrise"". Hats off to the writers for it. Because there could have been so many possibilities but this is actually the most real one and that makes so much sense.The whole movie is just the two characters talking about how their lives went after their meeting in June of 94. And you can actually feel how they're feeling if you've ever been in love or a long distance relationship. I'm just amazed how accurate this movie is. That sense of uneasiness, excitement, love, anger and everything mixed perfectly pouring out when you see someone you love after a long time.... That you go numb and don't know how to react, like you create pictures in your mind that this would happen when we meet but actually nothing happens because the emotions are so strong that body ceases to react !!!The dialogues again are great and actually for movies like these they're the fuel so they better be good! And the ending too is very symbolic...

some moments of life become our entire life,"This movie is surreal. I can't even believe how the crew especially these actors pulled off this absurd storyline. There is no specific plot in it, they made a whole movie about 2 people just talking while walking in places which gives little glimpses of how the non-Parisian media sees Paris. Nothing out of the ordinary. That's what exactly the beauty of this movie is. They brought a conversation from a normal day and reminded us this is how people behave, this is how we miss people, this is how we have conversations, this is how memories are made, this is what life is. The conversations are interlaced so smoothly. It is deeply intellectual but done in such a casual manner- that sounds like people talking about their next meal.
This movie is a character study. I love how in the movie Jesse talks about why he wrote a book about that one moment of his life. This movie is the real-life reflection of that marvellous concept.
The only reason I'm not giving it full stars is because of the 1 problematic tangent of cheating. Well, I believe having strong romantic feelings (except nostalgic) for some else is cheating. Despite that, I love this movie, definitely on the top of my list of romantic movie recommendations.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Let me sing you a waltz!,"A trip to Paris, hanging out after 9 years since Vienna, everything is perfect.

Unexpected surprise.,"I've never heard of 'Before Sunrise' and I'm not a fan of romantic movies at all. But 'Before Sunset' was excellent. It's hard to explain but I recommend this movie to everyone. This is what would really happen after a fleeting romance. And they did it right, and they did it in the positive way. There could have been an awkwardness in the movie, or there could have been suppressed lust that would have flown out the gates. But we see real adults in these characters, and for once in a movie. Everyone involved with 'Before Sunset' did an excellent job.Set nine years after 'Before Sunrise,' Jesse and Celine meet each other again and catch up.An amazing thing about intimacy is that it never has to be physical. Throughout this movie, Jesse and Celine talk. The fact that they talk to each other so openly and honestly is where the intimacy lies. You don't have to see them hold hands, or hug, or touch each other every five minutes to see that they contain a certain intimacy between the two of them. They let themselves go by just being themselves, and we see that unfold when they converse about how they see the world and what they feel. This movie is an accomplishment and success in itself. It deserved its nomination for Best Screenplay at the Academy Awards and hopefully it will be a further success throughout the test of time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie just show the feelings of two person and you get confuse is it love or beyond this love thing.,"Well,after watching 'Before Sunrise',i was very excited to watch this film.There's no doubt that the storyline was great.What can i say,i was pretty impressed at the beginning when i came to know that they couldn't meet again in Vienna as they had planned.Some of you might have assumed that by film's title,but i hadn't.I've to say that Hawk and Deply was just perfect for this movie and i don't think anyone can do it better. Linklater didn't just just write a story which will melt anyone's heart but was able to bring it life to make it real.Well Done Richard Linklater! this film isn't just a nice sequel of the original film but also completes the story and keep you hungry for more.As we know,Jesse and Celine love each other so much that they were like meant to be together and this film focuses on how you'll react when find your lost perfect match whom you were meant to be with and after all these real life suffering what will do when you finally find them.The movie was artistic,at first i was starting to think if there's anything wrong with celine but as the story flows it made everything clear.At some points of the movie,You'd just love to see the facial expressions of them especially when celine sings song.iI just fall for that scene.Ending was a suspense but i like it that way. This isn't a typical romantic movie we use to watch,it got spark.and thats why i think it's Classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful,"At first glance, 'Before Sunset' may not seem extraordinary or even remotely moving. However, a second glance will prove all first impressions wrong.Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply are natural before the camera - they slip into the lives of Jesse and Celine so essentially that you can't see the boundaries between actor and character.The music, with three songs performed by the talented Julie Deply, is equally astounding. I found myself re-watching the movie just to listen to the soundtrack.The script, written by the director and the lead actors, is amazing. I love the fact that the actors, the closest people to the characters, had great parts in the composing of their own text. In this way, the words are more natural, closer to the personalities of the characters themselves. Jesse and Celine are ordinary people, and yet they aren't. They're normal, in the sense that they lead lives and discuss utter randomness that becomes meaningful in the manner that it is spoken. They are extraordinary because they have each other, two chance encounters that can be played out only on film. But that's what movies do - they capture the extraordinary. And that's what sets this one apart from the rest - the sprinkle of surreal in a sea of the ordinary. And what a beautiful sea it is!Needless to say, one of my favourites.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ethan Hawke's Reprise of an Earlier Role,"This movie is so self-circularly referential that its amazing.  Ethan Hawke plays a write who has written a book about a day in his life when he met the most wonderful girl, and fell in love, and agreed to meet again, but never could.  This movie reprises the previous movie, ""Before Sunrise"", where all the action of said book takes place in Vienna.Ethan Hawke actually co-wrote this movie, so to a large extent the role he plays is true, in a fictional sense.The preview for this movie is one of the best previews i've ever seen in my life.  It doesn't hurt that I visited Paris for the first time in my life 5 months ago and would love to go back.  The movie takes place in 80 real-time minutes of dialogue between Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Dempsy).What would you say to the love of your life, loved and lost, if you had 80 minutes to try to restart that love affair?  How would you do it?  Where would you go?  What would you do if you said something to offend her?  How would you play it without acting too aggressive?  All those questions, and more, are answered in this movie.For anyone that has ever loved and lost,This one is a RINGER.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was just like being there,"Not one second of this movie seemed in any way contrived. It was as if I was the proverbial ""fly on the wall"" listening in on a very plausible, convincing personal conversation between two people who fell in love nine years ago and haven't seen each other since . . . or forgotten each other for so much as a minute. I was totally involved in this movie from near the start until the last minute . . . which is perfectly done. At the end, you know what's going to happen right then, but not where the next few hours will lead. There has to be another update to this story which takes us to where they are in, say, 2009. If the next chapter were to appear, I'd be waiting in line to see it -- along with many, many more who ""get"" this extraordinary film I'm sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
We waited for it for so long but it really deserves the wait.,"I loved ""Before sunrise"" when I saw it some years ago, the only bad point in it (for me at least) was that the ending wasn't so clear, you didn't really know what would happen, if they will be together or not afterwards.This new film has the straight of the first one and you have the chance to see what had happened to the character's life from that moment. The characters grew old but they are still the same persons we met nine years ago. They made a great job with the dialogs and the background. It's like meet two old friends after a long time.

White-Hot Passion Of The Mind,"That 'Before Sunset' succeeds almost as well as its predecessor, 'Before Sunrise', gives me hope that a romantic movie doesn't have to be hackneyed tripe. That it's stepping in the same places as the original DOES keep it from greatness, though. The first movie was about how American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Frenchwoman Celine (Julie Delpy) spend a day together in Vienna, talking about everything big & small and falling in love. They part and we didn't find out if they ever got back together. The sequel picks up 9 years later when Jesse is in Celine's French neighbourhood on the last leg of his book tour. See, he wrote a successful novel of their one night together, although he has trouble admitting just much she's really meant to him. She unexpectedly meets him in the book store and they conversationally pick up right where they left off.Experimental indie radical Richard Linklater (who co-wrote the script with his stars and also produced & directed) doesn't waste any time on extraneous material. It's all about the 2 would-be lovers. Jesse might be a married father and Celine might be committed to another man, but they belong together. We know it and they seem to know it too, even though they spend a whole movie fighting their primal urges. They're likable and intelligent people, largely because they're also funny, self-deprecating, and rebellious. Hawke & Delpy invest a great deal of delicacy into their characters too. Not only do the actors have wonderful chemistry, they know when to pull back and be guarded about their feelings.I recently saw 'My Dinner With Andre', which also sparked bolts of electricity in my brain. I desperately needed to debate someone after seeing that conversation-filled film and I wish I'd taken a date to each of the 'Before' movies. Both are sexy in the best sense. Who needs naked skin and moaning lust when you have white-hot passion of the mind? Since the story is essentially told in real time, these are two people who spend about 80 minutes holding something back. The ""will they/won't they"" question will not be answered in this review, but that sexual tension keeps the whole production together.With the exception of his hugely popular ode to rock fun-fest, 'The School Of Rock', Linklater likes to leave loose ends. His pictures work because his characters do what smart people usually do with their free time---talk. And free thinkers usually come around to the subjects of literature and music. How fitting then that Jesse immortalizes Celine through writing, while we later she how she has immortalized him through music. If two characters have ever truly connected on the motion picture screen, it's these two. 'Before Sunset' isn't a perfect movie (partly because it's cribbing so much from the '95 film), but it's a glorious way for lovers and other strangers to connect within the confines of a movie theatre.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
If u think before sunrise is the best... This is even better,"The way this movie starts is very interesting and without wasting any time it makes them meet so effortlessly in a way that we feel like there is no time gap between the movies. Or it is may be I am binge watching the trilogy. The question of whether they meet after 6 months is answered in a very minimalistic and beautiful way. And this brings them to find comfort again talking to each other. That is really brilliant and pure poetry.And there is no conflict or up and downs in story arc. Just the time constraint. This is really not proforma of any usual story. I have not seen this kind of story telling before. Usually movies that leave some impact on you are mostly confined to a genre and some conflict - victory scenario. This script is not limited to those things and requires not much from actors but makes a large impact that too in a pleasant way.One thing is clear now atleast is that they have had sex that night and that too twice. But this time ambiguity lies in the question of will they ever meet? or will there be any closure for them?Wow!!! Kudos to the director for both films. I have yet to watch the third part. I don't know if it gives me the same feel as the first two, which is why I'm writing my review here itself. Just enjoying the moment and sharing my love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Smooth and real.  You wonder if it's a movie.,"There's one thing that strikes you about this movie: it TOTALLY does not seem like a movie. It is rare in cinema today that the dialogue (and that's virtually all there is in Before Sunset -- conversation between the principals -- and thank God for that) is so real and so smoothly, naturally and humanly delivered that you (sweetly) fall into a state where you think you're eavesdropping on two people riffing off each other, responding to what comes up next and, above all, NOT working off a script.I discovered that the reason for this impression, for that delightful result -- other than the consummate acting skills of Delpy and Hawke, of course -- is the fact the two actors played the major if not total role in writing the screenplay. Boy, does that show. And wow, does that pay off.What a gem!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gawd Awful BORING Movie,"I rented this because I thought I'd score some points in choosing a chick flick this time. The reviews were positive. My wife asked me why this was a ""chick flick.""

Two people walking through Paris and yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blahing about big ""MEANINGFUL"" topics that they didn't believe and couldn't make me believe they believed. My wife was insulted. ""Is this what they think women like?"" So my she says, ""I'm going to take a shower; let me know if anything actually happens."" Fifteen minutes later, nothing had. ""You missed the car chase,"" I lied when she returned. She gave me 'that look.'Why did they make this movie? Why did I waste $2.57 to rent it?

Simplistically Original,"First to begin with , I was personally enthralled with the role Ethan Hawke played in the award winning film 'Training Day'.I developed a certain penchant for his character in that very film and his method of acting in general.And so as soon as I heard about this movie (mind you i never heard of the first one in 1995) i immediately got it.Amidst all the chocolaty romantic bull which usually hits the screen this movie was by far THE BEST ROMANTIC FILM i have seen i.e. even if you can categorise the film as a romantic one. In my opinion Richard Linklater (Director) has done a beautiful job in maintaining a parody with 'Unity of Time and Place ', which is usually a parameter in theatre.The film more than elaborating romance between the two characters explores the helplessness of them both . Separated by time and distance the conversations between Hawke and Deply are a glaring reality of society today. Over the past 9 odd years both seemed to have moved poles apart in terms of lifestyles as Hawke is married (rather unhappily i feel) while Deply is more freelancing than anything else. But what connects the two of them on screen so well is their underlying hate for a 'submissive relationship'. Much more than the meandering conversations the location chosen and shot is PERFECT. The stereotypical characters of Jesse and Celine have give original performances, free of any acting guidelines. At the end of the movie a feeling of nostalgia, hits you whether of the past you have already experienced , or the future which may very soon be your past!.Brilliant script and memorable acting makes this movie a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Even better than Before Sunrise,"Before Sunset is the absolutely beautiful sequel to Before Sunrise, two films by Richard Linklater starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Both movies focus on two very interesting characters, an American (Hawke) and a French woman, when they meet at junctures in their lives.In the first movie they meet for the very first time on a train and take a whimsical walk around the streets of Vienna. It's about discovering a place, memories, love and relationships, all of which are pieced together with beautiful dialogue and a fantastic story.Before Sunset is the sequel, set and filmed nine years after original. This time it follows the couple around the streets of Paris, and amazingly the dialogue surpasses the beauty of the previous movie. The cinematography is passive, yet intensive, which only enhances the stunningly crafted monologues. The couple meander, discussing what happened on that night all those years ago and how their lives have been influenced by their encounter.The dialogue is mesmerising - a real insight to both sides of emotion and love. I recommend watching 'Before Sunrise' before watching 'Before Sunset' to fully appreciate the magical journey of this romantic masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
minimalist masterpiece,"A guy, a girl and a plane to catch. That's how simple the plot is, yet there you are at the end wondering where all the time went  which of course is the theme of this story about two lovers reunited after a decade apart. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do something much greater than give performances  they give of themselves. They listen to each other, and when is the last time you watched a film and noticed that. Their sensitivity toward the material means they do not miss a note, or rather they miss many notes, just as two nervous people would. They play with each other, and every time a character says something that seems dishonest, the other character calls them on it. There is nothing fake about this picture: Linklater just lets two charismatic actors roam around Paris, and it is enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Amazing Film...,"This is an amazing film, and I very much admire its simplistic design.This is a movie about `the encounter' between a man and woman nine years after they first met and have fallen in love.  The maturity and chemistry between the main characters are incredible.  The conversations, a major component of the film, are real and spontaneous, thanks to Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan's wonderful script.  The entire film focus on the two main characters (Jesse and Celine), and the camera switches between them.  Most of the shots are long and close, which makes the audience feel that they are actually in the scene with them.  This really tests the acting skills of the cast, who pulled off wonderfully.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrific film in its own right,"There are a lot of sequels out right now, and normally the major concern is, will this one hold a candle to the original? In this particular case, ""Before Sunset"" does not hold a candle to the original. It does not have to, since it IS the original. If I have never seen the first on, and only saw this, I would still think it is one of the most masterfully movies ever made. Yet, it is hard not compare the two in the context of the change of the characters. And even though the ""younger"" version was maybe more about romantic, this one has more of a sense of urgency. The whole movie, they had a lot less time to catch up than the last time, so they have to get more out in the open in shorter time, being more cautious adults this time. This is probably one of the few films your don't really have to see the original before. I know many people will disagree, but I compare it to listening a foreign opera with no subtitles: enjoy the emotion, understanding will come later. And as a side note, both the director and the stars (Delpy and Hawke) are producers and writers, which is yet another reason to see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good romance movie,"Before Sunset' is a mesmerizing exploration of love, loss, and longing. Nine years after their whirlwind romance in 'Before Sunrise', Jesse and Céline reunite in Paris, and the chemistry is still palpable.

The film's conversational tone is both intimate and engaging, as the pair stroll through the City of Light, sharing stories, secrets, and regrets. Director Richard Linklater masterfully crafts a poignant, bittersweet narrative that lingers long after the credits roll. With its stunning cinematography and thoughtful themes, 'Before Sunset' is a cinematic treasure that will leave you enchanted and contemplative.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
AAHHHH,"I came into this movie with high expectations, which I would any movie placed in the top 250. However, the only description I can give it is; completely boring. The dialog was pointless, trivial, and poorly delivered.The acting and chemistry between the characters was pitiful. I have never watched a movie with so little plot, there were no twists nothing is accomplished except for rehashing the first film and giving un-unique insight towards current events and love life. I do appreciate the long scenes without cuts, and how the movie was based basically on one continuous moment but that alone does not equal an entertaining or though provoking movie. Extremely overrated. I gave it a generous 6, um maybe i should give it a 5",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like nothing I've seen in a long time,"This movie (and its predecessor) might be the best character studies I have ever seen. There really is nothing but character development which may be a turn off to many (no effects, no big plot surprises, no stunts,,, really nothing but dialogue in both movies). I will say, you absolutely MUST see Before Sunrise first or this movie will be pointless. This is one of the most original movies I have seen in years, and is incredibly risky for the makers of the film. In today's short-attention-span society, a movie like this is really hard to pull off with most audiences. I was incredibly skeptical about a second movie when I heard it was coming out. I was afraid they would ""hollywood"" it a little and kill the magic of the first. Yhis, however was the perfect conclusion to the first. Everyone wanted to know if they re-met 6 months later, and that was answered, but the mystery of their future together (the best part of the first film) was retained. You need an open mind to watch these movies (and a bit of a romantic side) but they are well worth the couple of hours you put into them. This movie shows what 2 fantastic actors can do with a good script and incredible chemistry and not much else. I reserve 10 ratings for movies that define genres or change the way movie-making is done like the original Star Wars or Ben Hur, but I gave this movie a strong 9...maybe a 9.8 if they gave me decimals.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent sequel cleverly plays on ambiguities in the first,"This is a great film that I recommend to anyone - including those that might normally avoid 'romantic' films. Like the first (Before Sunrise) it's not slushy and manages to keep your attention throughout, despite the fact that the whole film centers on the dialogue between the two leads.However, I would also recommend that anyone intending to watch this film tries to see Before Sunrise first. If you do, or if you have already, then I have an interesting question for you: did they sleep together? I have found that the answer is almost consistently the opposite depending on whether the person I ask is male or female (I'll leave you to decide which is which).This question, which I remember discussing with the girl I saw the first film with, is played upon very well in the script of Before Sunset. They also managed to develop the characters in a completely believable way, with both revealing how complex their lives had become since their last encounter. In common with the first film there is some interesting social commentary and the film deals very well with the cultural subtleties between the two leads.What disappoints me is how a quality US film like this seems to get such limited exposure in its country of origin. At least that's what it seems like from over here....",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thanks for reminding me why I fled the USA,"Man where do I begin other than to say this movie and the prequel sucked. I put the maximum number of stars since IMDb is hell bent on only giving the good reviews priority to the readers as opposed to giving priority on the first come first serve basis. Both movies were a french-wannabee flick using only dialog as its mechanism. The problem is that the characters are Americans and Americans talk about the stupidest things, as we see throughout the entire movie. We have a Joe Mangina douche bag who is smitten with this self entitled princess. He actually shows up to meet this bimbo at a place and time they agreed to meet 9 years ago and of course she is not there. The chick is a typical narcissistic American female, passed her prime at age 33, complete with her selfish attitude as she stated that she wished someone had proposed marriage to her and then turns around and says ""I would have said no, but it would have been nice to have been asked"" so really her desire is not to be married but rather to flush down the toilet a mans genuine affections of love. That's sick. This film clearly demonstrates that American women are selfish idiots and American men are desperate spineless wimps who cater to to them.

I had a similar experience,"Seeing this movie and its predecessor made me think of a similar night that I had in 1991 at Disney World.  The first movie almost paralleled the night I met a woman with whom I connected.  Unfortunately, as we were both poor college students and lived a long way from each other, we decided not to contact each other for the exact reasons that Jesse and Celine didn't in Before Sunrise.  People who have not had this situation may think the reasons are stupid.  When you are young,you have met the one, and have little time, you don't think too clearly.  That is the brilliance and reality of the first film.I never met this woman again.  However, Before Sunset has dialogue that I think would happen if we met again.  The characters felt the same feelings that I had.  Like the characters, I wondered what my life would have been if we had stayed in touch.

Simple and Perfect,"When I first saw Before Sunrise, I got caught by the performance and most of it by the story. I was a teenager, and to see that so romantic story in those ages, makes you search in your love life for that romanticism. After the ages, like the two characters, I have had a lot of ""problems"" in my love life for that reason, specially to get sex... They realize that such romanticism is impossible to keep, and they grow as adults also. But thank god or whoever, the second part of that marvelous movie exists, and that gaves us another vision of the romanticism and of the love stories. The second part is much more mature, much more bitter, but also much more realistic. In my opinion the fist one is very very nice, and a marvelous love story, but this second part is even better, for it's bitter vision of the ""tragedy"" of love.

Part 2 was very predictable and a little bit silly. I'ts a lot more difficult to feel one with either one of the characters. The love seems like gone after all those years. But they still love each other but they don't want to admit it. Then the end is really bad, I think. For me it was like worse it couldn't be. The movie itself turned me down yet.

A PERFECT little gem of a movie,"Very little about this movie prepared me for this absolutely delightful film. Ethan Hawke isn't one of my favourite actors, I had never heard of Julie Delpy, nor the director Richard Linklater, before.I have watched the movie twice. Actually I wasn't fully paying attention when I watched it the first time, but starting with Jessie (Ethan Hawke's character) fielding questions about whether his novel is autobiographical, it got me good, and never let go for one second; up till the very last scene where Jessie said ""I know"". Fade- out. One of the most remarkable thing about this movie is the continuity. The whole movie felt like it was just one take, lending it such authenticity and immediacy. Of course, I had to see Before Sunrise afterwards; and I must say that I like this second installment a whole lot more. Before Sunrise is much more ""ordinary"", and I don't know whether it is because I watched Before Sunset first. In fact, I might end up thinking Before Sunrise is superfluous. In other words, in a way I wish I had not gone ahead and watched Before Sunrise.This is not so much a love story. To me, a love story can only be told, in whole, afterwards, with a definitive ending. This film is more about romance, and feelings. It may yet develop into a love story, if there are more installments to come.The film should not be compared with epic love stories like Doctor Zhivago, but surely can stand on its own merits as an example of a ""perfect"" movie.Finally, as I was brought up in a ""gentler"" age, the few instances of the f-word did jar my sensibilities, but I can put all that down to context, given the world we are living in now.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Subtle romance with real facts of love life form the core of the movie,"The writer of the story did a great job. He brought forward several subtle points, facts of life, in a subtle romantic story. In short, the movie captures the essence of love life as most persons live it in this world.The characters in the story discuss and go over several points. one can neither argue against the facts presented nor support it entirely. Those are the points even we think about but cannot come to either support it or write against it because of it's subtleness. We usually write off such thoughts(points) as ""That's Life!"".The storyline's standpoint is also the same. In the end, we would want to see the characters together but then we don't want to too.Overall, the movie was excellent. I suggest that all the romantic/drama movie lovers out there to see it and enjoy. I am sure you would end up appreciating the movie a lot. It's the kind of movie that you would care to remember even over the passage of time.Enjoy the story and movie!.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Phenomenal Camera Work,This film is so basic but amazing with an incredible focus on the two main characters catching up on their lives. Even though it is a conversation throughout the whole movie the camera work makes up for it.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great thought provoking flick,"Like its predecessor, Before Sunrise is one of those movies full of commentary on everyday life. Nothing heavy handed, just line after line of brilliant observation put into simple terms. If you're the kind of person with strong memories and consider yourself a product of your own mind this movie will appeal to you. Some won't care for the lack of apparent action but they're missing the point. There is plenty going on here. Though the dialogue is rich it only serves as an undercurrent. It casts no light on what's really going on here yet through it you see its shadow. Short and sweet. It even ended exactly when I thought ""it should end right now."" What happens next? Who knows? I like that it answers almost nothing, just like in the first film (except for all the big unknowns from the first film!)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful!,"To finish up the story 10 years ago, it's not easy to play it beautifully. This film certainly has done it.One of the best film ever. Romantic yet so touching. So easy going but real. People can relate to the characters, the story so easily. That's why it touches me so much. Feels like it describing my last ten years or the ten years ahead. It is amazing! Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply are great in the movie. They have played the feeling of odd when first met again and the 'can't miss this again' at the end so well.I also love the last song of the film by Nina Simone.

Intelligent and Thought Provoking,"As you probably already know, this film is a dialog between two people who had a one-night stand 9 years previous. I had not seen the first film but Before Sunset is probably as fine a film you will ever see that involves nothing but two people talking.There is no drama, no action, and no special effects. These two people open up to each other unequivocally and talk about life, love, and desire. There is no resolution at the end. These people are in their early thirties and are still too young to understand everything in life but they still have optimism and ideals,along with disappointment. The dialog is intelligent and thought provoking; two thing that are conspicuously missing from movies these days. This alone is worth the price of admission.This is not a cinematic film and you have to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate it but if you are, it is very rewarding. This is a film about what really matters in our lives. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love in Paris - 90,"A memorable experience of Incandescent emotions and real life concerns, the most unabashedly romantic slice of life cinema since Brief Encounter.

A Pleasant Summer Film Worth Catching,"Before Sunset, 3 out of 4 stars 80 minutes Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy Directed by Richard LinklaterA Review by Jimmy GeurtsBefore Sunset can be seen as movie-making in the moment- a film that requires the audience to focus their attention on the movie for a meager 80 minutes if they hope to find themselves swept away by this pleasant albeit fleeting piece of film. And those who let their minds wander from the amiable characters and their coincidental meeting may notice some of the script's shortcomings and as a result might not enjoy Before Sunset to its highest potential. Despite myself I found myself enjoying the sequel to 1995's indie favorite, Before Sunrise. One of Before Sunset's strengths is that it is not a sequel made for financial reasons, so it as a film does not need to be held by a need to satisfy commercial demands. (It was made on a budget of only $10 million). Rather, I like to think that Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy, like many of us, wondered if Jesse and Celine ever met again in Vienna six months later like they promised each other to after that unforgettable night. When we see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy on screen, the two seem to be reuniting with the characters of Jesse and Celine just as much as they are acting them.Before Sunset picks up nine years after Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) parted ways. It turns out for one reason or another, the two never did meet up in Vienna. Jesse is now married with a kid, and Celine, while not betrothed, is currently dating a photographer. Jesse has still not gotten over Celine, and has written a book about the trip to Vienna in the past few years. He is in Paris on a book tour when at a press conference Celine appears into his life again. The two make small talk, about everything from idealism to sex, and try to avoid bringing up the inevitable question: why they never met again after that one magical night in Vienna.There is a sense of urgency to Before Sunset's proceedings because instead of sharing a day together, Jesse and Celine only have eighty minutes to reunite until Jesse must take his plane back to the United States. Hawke and Delpy play off each other very nicely, and share a chemistry that hides just below the surface. Hawke as usual does a very good job, and Julie Delpy is just radiant as Celine. The way Delpy plays Celine I could see how someone could become smitten with her.For the most part I found Richard Linklater's script to be well done, but especially later in the movie, the conversation between Jesse and Celine does occasionally feel stilted and uneven. In addition, the transition between friendly chat and long-held feelings seems to be a little rough. I can appreciate that this probably intended on Linklater's behalf to emphasize the sudden shift of heart of the two characters, but for a director who I see as having such an ear for earnest truth in his films' dialogue, I would hope he could find a more natural way of changing the mood of the film. Only minor complaints but they did hurt the film for me nonetheless.The film plays out as if we were right there with Jesse and Celine, being careful not to cut away from the conversation of the two. Before Sunset is shot with a steady camera and fairly successfully manages to balance both an intimate feel and a good sense of Paris' beauty. And while the movie does use transitions but not to the point where it becomes a distraction. In other independent movies like Running Time, it might've benefited the film's strengths more. Before Sunset is not of those movies.Before Sunset is like a light meal: pleasing, light, and ultimately forgettable. Fans of the original who wondered what ever happened to the two after the credits rolled will probably enjoy the sequel. Anyone that disliked the first Before Sunrise aren't going to find much here that will change their minds. For everyone else, it provides a healthy alternative to the Hollywood action blockbusters of the summer.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Oscar nominations for Best Actress and Screenplay.,"BEFORE SUNSET. * * * 1/2.Actors: Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy. Screenwriters. Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy.Director: Richard Linklater.To start things off I usually hate romantic movies. I find them very predictable, the characters make me sick, and I usually feel depressed after i view them. I was lucky enough to see ""Before Sunrise"" when it came out to video and I was amazed to see that the guy who made ""Dazed and Confused"" was brave enough not to do another commercial film. Since then I have always been a huge fan of Linklater's work. I loved his Animated ""Waking Life"", and I enjoyed his family flick ""School of Rock"" Richard is the only director I know who can make both big mainstream movies and small independent films and not look like a sellout.""Before Sunset"" continues nine years after ""Before Sunrise"". Jesse wrote a book about his one night in Vienna with Celine and is in France at the end of his book tour. Celine shows up and the two of them decide to spend the afternoon together before his plane leaves.What takes next is a series of conversations, and this is where the real gem of the screenplay comes into focus. Because this one does not use pop culture references to get you into the story. It's just normal people having a conversation, but I assure you that it's not boring. I was interested in everything these characters had to say. On their afternoon together they begin to let down their guard and tell each other just what that night really meant to them. Jesse and Celine are both currently in another relationship, but it's clear that these two should be together. It made a true love believer out of me when most films assure me that it's dead.""Before Sunset"" is a perfect companion piece to ""Before Sunrise"", but you don't need to see the first one to enjoy this. It stands on it's own as a very good contemporary love story. I hope Oscar voters are wise and nominate Julie Delpy for best actress nods and one for best screenplay to Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, & Julie Delpy. More actors should take cues from them and write their own sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing.,"Before Sunset is an oddity, a sequel to the one-night-in-Vienna romance of 1994's Before Sunrise. This time the pair reunites 10 yrs later in Paris and 98% of the movie's length is one unbroken conversation between the two. Sadly Julie Delpy ain't quite as beautiful while it seems Ethan Hawke has caught a nasty case of the Hivees. She's an environmental activist and still single he's married and is oh merely a best-selling novelist on a publicity tour promoting his book based on the one night these two spent together in the first flick. So it all gets very self-reflexive real quick, and annoying and not hot. She says that she's romantically numb and he describes his married life as running a nursery with a woman he used to date and has had sex < 10 times in 4 years. They don't kiss or make any promise to meet again and it's all ambiguous and noncommittal and forgettable. The screenplay was co-written by the two stars and a lot of the dialogue is humorless and chilly. I'm pretty annoyed by the whole thing and I think I've loved every other movie directed by my man Linklater, from School of Rock to Dazed & Confused to Waking Life to Slacker. This one I can live without. Mitigating factor: Delpy's awesome apartment, revealed in the last 10 minutes.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Epihany.. resonated... the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.,"This was the most emotional movie experience I can recall, ever. So beautiful, and so true. A movie that had me riveted to the screen in spite of its simple setting: No sex scenes, no action, no stunts or special effects: just two people talking.""The one that got away"": one reason this film touched me so is that this is the story of my life, too. Twenty years ago I too let the one that got away get away. I am Canadian, she was Italian. My story's setting was Rome. So similar.But the characters in this movie get another chance; I found myself almost shouting at them ""take that chance - take it"". This movie brought tears to my eyes - lots of them.To anyone who has ever chosen to take a path in life, or chosen not to take that path, I say ""please see this movie"".I also say ""follow your heart"" - If I could have watched this movie 20 years ago, my entire life would be different now.

wonderful and enchanting,"This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen! Highly recommended. The film was sweet but tense until the very end, and even after that! When we see Jesse and Celine nine years later (it actually is nine years later since Before Sunrise was made) they have changed, and not necessarily for the better. However, sparks still fly and the chemistry that was first seen in Before Sunrise is more alive than ever. The question of whether or not they really did meet one another six months later is answered. The question of whether they belong together will also be answered in this sequel. (as if we didn't know the answer to that from the first film!) Jesse and Celine converse for the whole 81 minutes of the film, which incidentally follows real time. It's amazing how just one day can change your life... watch this film and see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An introspection of our prevailing notions of love.,"The strength of the Before Trilogy is it's writing. It's a momentous task to write dialogues which don't feel scripted. One way in which this film achieves this is by making the two leads write the screenplay themselves.The screenplay, combined with Richard Linklater' s fascination for real time, makes Before Sunset look like a beautiful recording of the conversations unfolding between Jesse and Celine. Linklater uses long takes and gentle camera movements to ensure the realism. Neither lighting nor editing call any attention, and thus, the feeling that one's just watching a movie is never induced.
.
Before Sunset reveals a lot of thematic depth if the viewer has already watched Before Sunrise. After 9 years Jesse and Celine meet once again, and like the previous meeting, their time is limited.
This time, their talks are mature and introspective rather than instinctive.As the tension builds up, the dialogues become more revealing, and this reaches its zenith as they get into the car. It's then, when they reveal the greatest stings of their hearts. Their experiences shatter the delusion of ""the right-one"". And tough, they never directly confess, but in these moments of tension we get to know how much they regret the missed opportunity and that how much they mean to each other.The final song just kills it. It's so emotionally engaging that one cannot choose to escape the calm echoes of the melancholy. Before Sunset, like the other films of the trilogy, is more of life unfolding on screen rather than a movie. It's great!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
How has Linklater hoodwinked so many?,"This movie is OK until you remember the only two characters are totally annoying. The acting and minimal circumstances in the film are so real until you remember that those things don't necessarily make a movie good.

""but that's not the point, man."" Oh yes, clever indeed. Linklater, Hawke and Delpy could have pulled this off if they didn't take it so darn SERIOUSLY! BTW - I didn't see the first film or even know about it until afterwards. My viewing results may therefore be contaminated.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Chemistry makes this movie, an 80 minute masterpiece!","**** out of ****Nine Years Later...Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reprise the roles of Jessie and Celine, meeting again for the first time since a seemingly magical one night stand in Vienna nine years ago. Their reunion, literally, is a dream come true; Celine appears at the bookstore where Jessie reads from his first novel, which not coincidentally is based on the train trip where they first met.What if, Jessie muses, as they walk through the streets of Paris, he wrote the book for the sole reason that Celine might read it and find him again? ""Before Sunset"" is an unabashedly romantic film with an ending so perfect it took my breath away.Jessie has only a few hours in Paris before he must catch a flight back home. In the brief time they have together, Celine and Jessie talk without cease, wildly making up for lost time. They discuss their careers, their love lives, their youthful idealism, their adult lack of hope, the state of the world, and the painfully persistent question: what if? Jesse and Celine fluidly move through the city, walking cobblestone streets, sitting in a typical Parisian café, passing through a lovely garden, and wandering down to the banks of the Seine, where they ride a tourist boat, Notre Dame luminous in the backdrop. The conversation never stops, but the talk is never dull. Unlike ""Before Sunrise,"" which covered fourteen hours, ""Before Sunset"" takes place in real time. Celine and Jessie frequently allude to the flight he must catch, and as they walk and talk, I, too, couldn't help but worry about the minutes dwindling away, the plane that must be caught, and when Jessie continues to steal extra minutes, the tension increases. Linklater did a marvelous job of investing the talky premise with suspense.Delpy and Hawke co-wrote the script with the director. Jessie and Celine are characters they know well, inhabit fully, and their conversations (probably based on their own experiences) feel both spontaneous and true. The grown-up lovers are intelligent and politically aware -- a successful novelist and an environmental activist, after all -- and if they are perhaps more beautiful than most, they are extremely appealing and heart-breakingly real.Excellent movie: Get off your asses and watch classic movies like this. If you didn't see the original, it is required movie to fully understand the characters. Everything is perfect, from the brilliant editing to the sudden but creative ending!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Restores my faith in American cinema,"It's been nine years since Jesse and Celine kissed and parted ways at that train station in Vienna, vowing to meet again in six months.Director Richard Linklater's premise for the sequel to his delightful 1995 film, ""Before Sunrise,"" is simple: Jesse's now an author pimping his book in Europe, while Celine's making the world better in Paris. As chance would have it - or, is it truly chance? - Jesse's signing books at Celine's favorite Parisian bookstore.Linklater and his actors, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, take us on an indisputably charming, funny and poignant journey as Jesse and Celine reconnect in the few moments Jesse has before flying home to the U.S.Hawke and Delpy are now nine years older and it shows. After Linklater lets us glimpse the younger Jesse and Celine in a few quick flashbacks from ""Before Sunrise,"" we realize Hawke's marital problems seem to have taken their toll and Delpy might have lost that celestial loveliness, but still looks beautiful.And like Jesse and Celine, we, too, have grown older, though not necessarily wiser. Jesse's edgier; Celine's slightly more neurotic. These days, their views on life, love and the world might not be as Panglossian as before, but more rooted in reality.""Before Sunset"" is all about the what-ifs in life, something most, if not all, of us can identify with. And about getting a second chance at correcting a mistake.Linklater shoots Jesse and Celine's stroll through Paris in lengthy, unobtrusive takes. Hawke and Delpy are so relaxed in their roles and with each other that we easily believe they're two soul mates seeing other again for the first time in nine years.Hawke and Delpy might have helped write the script, but several moments seem improvised. There's the initial awkwardness as Jesse and Celine skirt around what they really want to know about each other. Then, as they invade each other's personal space, the emotional walls come down. They chat about their lives, loves, coincidences that well might have led to something else for both of them.Both actors are sensationally good in this picture. This might very well be Hawke's finest performance. He and Delpy have terrific chemistry; their emotions are genuine; they play off each other as if they're two old friends awfully comfortable in each other's presence. And the writing's authentic, especially during two scenes - on a water-taxi and, later, in a SUV. There's nothing about this film that rings false.And just when we're wondering how Linklater will end the story this time, he produces a sublime conclusion to a masterful, magnificent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

well worth seeing straight after 'Before Sunrise',"I watched it last night straight after 'Before Sunrise' ... the first time I'd seen either. An excellent movie that celebrates life and love without the Hollywood treatment ... I thought it very real and believable, the characters, the conversations etc. and has been mentioned elsewhere, the obvious chemistry between the two. A refreshing change to see 'intelligent conversation' the centrepoint of a movie ... the desire to get to know another intimately thru questions and answers, and the toing and froing banter between them. I loved the duologue (except for a few crudities them seemed out of place and unnecessary), the observations about the big things and little things of life, and the way conversation flowed so naturally between them. The camera shots gave us plenty of time to observe the nuances in their facial expressions (and appreciate Julie Delpy's beauty). The enthusiastic awkwardness of their initial meeting ... the developing relationship with time as each other's lives are revealed ... very well handled. Hmmm ... think I preferred the first movie even more, for it's novelty etc., but this one was a pearler as well ... well done to all involved for coming up with another great script and performances.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best. Sequel. Ever.,"Really not into ""romance"" movies, but I just happened to watch ""Before Sunrise"" over a year ago, and was totally transfixed. And when I looked it up here, and saw ""Before Sunset"", I went straight back to the remote to see if they were showing it next.Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!So it's been over a year, and I've totally forgotten about the movie(s).

As he remarks in a conversation in a café, she is skinnier, and not as a criticism of how she was 9 years earlier.

A definitive statement on love in the modern world,"In 1995, Richard Linklater released Before Sunrise, and every nine years since has released a sequel. While sharing certain characteristics, each film is unique and worthwhile in their own right, but taken as a whole, this trilogy is something truly special. Some say that they are the best films about love and romantic relationships ever made, and they just might be. The series follows Jesse and Celine through the years. Jesse is an American traveling through Europe when he meets a French girl who is on her way home to Paris. They get to talking and Linklater's camera follows their conversation throughout the rest of that single day as the two fall in love. And every nine years, we revisit the couple at a different stage of life. Because of the time between the films we get the unique experience of watching two characters age, retaining the core of their personality, but taking on greater complexity as the years pass. The first film is about embracing the moment and forging a genuine human connection. The second film, Before Sunset, is about the regret of missed opportunities and the need to be true to yourself. The third film, Before Midnight, is about the consequences of actually getting what you want. Each film utilizes long takes which pull the audience deeply into the dialogue heavy narrative, and the fantastic performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy belie the fact that they're actually acting. These magical films are not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Beautiful Cinematic Sunset View!,"It dawned at me many years ago that the 1995 Richard Linklater film ""Before Sunrise"" was one of the supreme bang-up romantic narratives in cinematic history; even though the main characters are not showed banging. ""Before Sunrise"" tells the story of Jessie & Celine's one-day romance in Vienna. Jessie is the American and Celine is the Frenchie. They were young, vulnerable, and adventurous. The film's open-ended finale left us pondering if they would reunite in 6 months. Before you know it, 9 years have passed. So you know what that means, Sequel Heaven! Jessie & Celine are now Sunset People! Doing it right! Night after night! OK, Summer's over! Donna Summer, that is. ""Before Sunset"" is one of the best sequels ever! I know some of you think that my brain is fried by getting too much sun with this overstatement. However, you have to experience this breathtaking sunset to believe it. In ""Sunset"", Jessie & Celine unexpectedly reunite in Paris nine years later. They're older, wiser, and more experienced in the game of love. Will they recapture the magic in this ""Sunset Place""? If you are an avid fan of ""Sunrise"", then you will adore the ""Sunset"" even more. The film's poetic masterful screenplay is quite deserving of its Academy Award nomination; which by the way was scribed by Linklater, Jessie, and Celine. Yes! Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Their acting was also not too shabby. Ethan Hawke as Jessie and Julie Delpy as Celine were commanding thespian performances that were definitely on the sunny-side up category. Without a doubt, the best acting duet of the year! Reunited and it felt so good to see Hawke and Delpy on screen together again.

Great Sequel to a Realist's Romantic Paradise!,"'Before Sunset' forms a fascinating and intriguing second chapter to 'Before Sunrise'. It's been 9 years after their first meeting in Vienna. Answers to all the questions, like what happened 6 months after they first met (decided date) and many such things, are cleared.This one is set in the captivating city of Paris. Contrary to the exploratory aspect (each other , as well as the city) of first part, this one is a little more confrontational and analytical. They analyze how they and their lives have turned out, and how things could have been different. The movie is intelligent, sexy, sad, nostalgic, and talks passionately about the importance of time and love.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are still stunning and elegant. They, as well as their characters, have matured. They are enthralling throughout. Their lonely, distraught characters seem to be meant for each other, even more than the first part. The car scene, in which both of them unburden themselves, is truly spectacular and beguiling.This part too ends on a charmingly ambiguous note.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Before Sunrise is one of my favorite romance films, and it's sequel, Before Sunset, may be even better.","The most impressive element of these two movies is easily the fact that they manage to make a single, twenty minute long conversation about completely random subjects extremely engaging, while still maintaining realism and subtlety. This film is even more impressive than the first in that regard, because the entire runtime only takes place in around five locations and, unlike the first, is set completely in real time. So the entire film really is just an hour and twenty minutes of these characters lives put on screen, which works because they really do feel like real people. This is achieved by the excellent, grounded performances, with actors who have great chemistry with each other and perfectly capture their characters detailed mannerisms, which subtly tell the viewer a lot about them. These protagonists have so much depth that they truly feel as if they live outside of the film, that they have a life which isn't even shown. That's also not to mention how excellently this film captures the way people talk, with every conversation being realistically slow paced, repetitive and lacking a clear point. Much like the first, this movie also perfectly captures the awkwardness of these characters situations, which at times is surprisingly funny because of how real it feels.The structure of Before Sunset is incredibly unconventional; there's no real climax as it's really just plenty of conversations without a clear structure, again, because it's all presented in real time. Looking back at the film, it does have a sort of semblance of a first, second and third act, but the entire thing is just so small scale and subtle that I didn't even realize when it hit the high point, or low point while I was watching. All this, and the short runtime, meant that, when it ended, I was sort of shocked, as I thought there would be a lot more. At first, I thought it finished too abruptly, but after a few hours of thinking about it, I started to realize that it actually works incredibly well. It flawlessly captures how this situation would happen in real life and it won't leave my mind for some reason. For only an hour and twenty minutes, there's so much to unpack, and the more I think about it, the more I start to love it.Excluding the unconventional narrative, the plot doesn't fall into any cliches, and there aren't any unintentionally cheesy moments. No scene, not even what I suppose is the climax, is presented as 'big' and really everything is kept subtle and realistic throughout. Very little is told to the audience, causing you to read between the lines; the little exposition which is present is communicated very naturally throughout conversations, and the same can be said for the many complex themes this film presents.Much like Before Sunrise, this film is very much so based around character, and the technical aspects definitely aren't the focus; the editing, direction and cinematography aren't supposed to be noticed, and it succeeds in that very well. Really every technical aspect is very subtle and builds realism, such as the background noises which are realistically loud, as well as the lack of a score. There are plenty of extremely impressive long takes which last up to ten minutes and still manage not to draw attention to themselves. All these elements are very simple but work flawlessly for what they're going for, my only issue with them, or the entire film really, being that there's a scene at the start where there are flashbacks to the first movie, Before Sunrise, which was very cheesy and completely unnecessary. It only lasted for around five minutes and isn't really a big deal, but I still found it annoying.And to top it all off, Before Sunset is amazing as a sequel. It works perfectly as a companion to the original in terms of continuity and the characters are a very natural progression from the people who we followed in the first movie. Even just the tiny details in their mannerisms from the original are still present here, and there are plenty of subtle references indicating how these people have changed, and stayed the same.Overall, Before Sunset is an amazing film which I can't stop thinking about, and is currently right behind La La Land as my favorite romance movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Great Great!!!,"I can't say much, the thing is everything in this movie is great! I really enjoy the story and I felt a little sad when the movie ended because I wanted to see more, I wanted to listen to more good conversations, I wanted to see the way Jesse looks at Celine, I wanted to see more...This is the first time I watched a more-talk-than-action movie and never got bored because the dialogs are really great. We can relate some of their stories to our lives, the connection between Jesse and Celine and their acting are great. The ending's great.This movie is one of the best romance movies! I love it. It's really worth to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Intelligent, captivating, fantastic","I only saw Before Sunrise this year, and was thrilled when I found out a sequel had been made. I have since bought both films on DVD and watched them both several times.The dialog in Sunset is captivating and the actors performances are captivating. I have liked Ethan Hawke in other films, but watching him in Sunrise and how he has developed in Sunset has made me a fan for life (and what fantastic eyes!!) Every gesture and every expression that Ethan and Julie make is just perfect, which is what makes seeing this film over and over again so worthwhile. The fact that Ethan and Julie were so stunning at what they do has inspired me to get off my proverbial and get on with what is important to me.I know this film will be one of the most worn out in my DVD collection. If you have an intelligent mind and are a bit of a romantic, you'd be an absolute fool to miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Don't watch this before the prequel ""Before Sunrise"".","Most of the people posting negative comments on this film have admitted to not having seen the prequel, or only having seen it after watching ""Before Sunset"". I first watched ""Before Sunrise"" 6 yrs ago and although forgetting the name of the film and the cast, the story had stuck with me ever since. It was last week I got to see ""Before Sunrise"" again and watched ""Before Sunset"" a week later. I enjoyed ""Before Sunrise"" even more and found the sequel so much better than expected. The skills in writing, directing and acting the story of an ""impossible love"" has never been done with as much perfection as these two films together and Richard Linklater has all of my respect and admiration. This is an incredibly deep, philosophical story about Life and Love, excellently portrayed by Jesse and Celine. It is certainly not a film to everybody's taste, depending on life experience and age, and ten yrs ago I cannot say for certain I would have appreciated these films as much. However to me this film would be the definition of film making as an art form at it's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beautifully done....,"I saw this movie with my girlfriend. I didn't expect very much, I had only heard good things this movie but not enough to know what I was going into. This movie surprised me a lot. It's a beautiful film with excellent acting. The film is brilliant crafted, the moving camera just follows them walking in the city. Very simpel. But so effectful, because you just begins to follow them too. And that is the actors fault, they play their characters so heartfelt. It just seems like we're looking at Ethan and Julie. The story is again very simple. They meet again.This film makes you in a good mood. Because it's so subtle and sweet and loving. It's easy to love and easy to hate. People that hates this film might think it's boring. I don't think so because it's a fascinating film because of it's simple approach to filming the film. Only when the characters are sitting or standing still the camera is steady. That is what the film do so great. Because it let's the viewer be the camera. You are camera, you just follow them..Personal I got inspiration from this to make with this kind of moving camera effect. Not exactly the same way but I hope it has the same effect.To people that haven't seen film yet, see it and enjoy it, let yourself follow these two characters talking and walking in the city of Paris. I really people should see this film...",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Oh, the pain...","This is among the talkiest films I've ever seen.We meet, once again, the characters from ""Before Sunrise"", after several years have elapsed.Celine still talks at an astonishing pace. Whatever annoying drivel pops into her head, just runs right from her mouth. She reminds me of a Chatty Patty doll of old - pull the string and yak, yak, yak. Jessie appears to love the sound of his own voice, while he speaks in platitudes that to him, must be very profound indeed.In this film, the characters meet up again for the first time after the one night of passion they shared several years ago.You'd expect them to be awkward with each other when they get together, given their circumstances. But despite the endless talking and reminiscing they did as the film went on, I never felt that awkwardness dissipate. Their relationship felt stilted throughout, especially when it seemed like he was trying to sleaze on to her. Where was this 'connection' that they allegedly shared?In one scene, Celine and Jessie are being driven in a car. She is emoting heavily to Jessie about her post one-night-of-passion life, finally yelling at the driver to stop the car and let her out. I was hoping he would pull up on a bridge and toss her in the River Seine!The only thing I was grateful for while watching this film was that there weren't any cyanide capsules nearby.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
The adult evolution of this so genuine and sudden love generated by an unexpected meeting again.,"The second installment of the ""Before"" trilogy. Follow the love story after 9 years, bringing on the table the evolution of their lives and their failed meeting that they promised each other when they were young.I like the evolution of the characters from a more mature way but having connectivity with what they sowed from the first film.It has an equally good script, it is not as romantic as in its predecessor but it maintains the existential and subjective problems that go so far.I think it reflects the evolution of that love and idea that the characters have of it in that more mature age of adulthood but that remains unfinished. Even insecure or unstable, where they see little delivered based on their past experiences not so successful.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sun never set after watching this movie,"Well who says you need millions of dollars,eye popping technology and huge set pieces to make a movie(i.e. a good movie).Here is an example of how two people walking the streets of Paris in a single afternoon sharing their life experiences realize what their life has become without each other and what it could have been had they met on 16th December nine years ago.Both have complains,questions and what if's towards each other.Both want to go back in time and change their life because none of the two are happy with their life.This is not a story about love but about the unfulfillment of the love story told with deep dialogues and solemn expressions.And the ending,well what can you say about that.I always love those movies which do not spoon fed you but leave you to comprehend it with your own imagination and that's where this movie scores hugely.This movie will be incomplete without it's first part as it builds on that relationship with a maturity which the first part lagged.I will recommend this movie to anyone who like me doesn't believe in love much but in the idea of love.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An enjoyable movie without any purpose,"That's how I would describe the first movie too: as a very enjoyable and sweet movie that ultimately had no goal, no purpose. It just ends and it leaves without any sense of catharsis. After watching the first movie I felt I didn't have to watch it in the first place.Now having watched the sequel and hoping this would bring something to the trilogy, I can honestly say that this is part 2 of ""The movie without purpose"".Usually great movies have a plot that by the end pays off in a way or another (either good like The Dark Knight either bad like The Last Jedi), but they all pay off. That's part of why people watch them and other movies. Because by the end the movie has somewhat of a finality that makes you look back on the movie and say ""it was worth it to watch this movie"". Here on the other hand, there is no finality, there is no ultimate purpose of the movie with the characters or with the story. I never felt relieved or inspired or with a sense of catharsis when I watched either of the two movies (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset). Sure it's enjoyable and lovely to see these two guys walk around a street talking about different things from life and making you question how do you relate to those things, but ultimately this movie has no deep meaning or a main theme runing throughout the movie so that by the end you could feel moved or inspired or feel that movie was worth it.I don't understand who would consider this movie a masterpiece or the best movie of the year since there are way more movies that have also a realistic feel to them but above all have purpose and a message. This one does not!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Before Sunset- Perfect way to explore your Love.,"I think most people will find this movie more interesting than Before Sunset (the prequel) because the characters are ""more mature"" in this movie. It plays out in real time as the characters spend one afternoon together in Paris.It has been nine years since events of Before Sunrise happened. Now Jesse has written a novel named ""This Time"" accounting the happenings of his time with Celine as per the prequel of the movie. To promote his sales in Europe, Jesse on his last stop at Paris happens to met Celine, though this time it was not accidental and Jesse has to leave Before Sunset to catch his flight back home. Jesse is now married and has become a writer. Celine is there with boyfriend of hers ,who is a photojournalist. CONVERSATION continuing from the last movie has gone a level or two ahead and maturity is pretty much visibleFirst it appears that both leads are leading a pretty happy life. In fact it is not. It becomes clear in the course of their talk that both are dissatisfied to varying degrees with their lives. Jesse reveals that he only stays with his wife out of love for his son. Celine says that she does not see her boyfriend very much because of his commitment towards his work. A meaningful personal talk at wonderful locations of Paris and great shots of steadicam followed by awesome Screenplay says enough in itself. Life is unpredictable. If Jesse and Celine exchanged some contact information with each other, the story would be different. But there were not so many ""ifs"" in life. You must grasp the opportunity or regretting is unavoidable. The themes in their conversation have a universality to them, and the connection between the characters makes the viewer forget that there is a clash of cultures, for she is French while he is American. The film manages to isolate bits and pieces of what it is that truly connects two strangers - soul mates in a once or twice opportunity in a lifetime. Personally to me,Before Sunset is better than its prequel because the characters Hawke and Delpy wrote the dialogue themselves inspired from their respective personal lives & conveys message of many unsaid things regarding LIFE in a pretty convincing way. My Rating -10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
who cares?,"This waste of time sucked ass. I cant think of a more boring movie. Even at 88 minutes it was about 86 minutes too long. Nothing happens here. It is literally the two subjects going over their lives of the past nine years since their ""hot"" affair ended. WHO CARES? Ethan Hawke looks anorexic, almost like an aids patient at different times in the film. He also seemed almost as bored as I was watching throughout most of the never ending dialog. Julie Delpy is only slightly more believable. I rented this film based solely on the fact that it was highly rated (in the top 250 films as rated by the voters of the IMDb. However, really, no matter how high this seems to be on the IMDb's top 250, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! UPDATE! (8/30/08) Still remember how much I HATED THIS MOVIE!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jesse and Celine meet at Paris nine years after their meeting and spending a night together in Vienna,"Before I get down with the review, I want to specify why I picked the second of the Before trilogies instead of the other two. The first film was made out of a simple and exciting journey of two free, passionate young minds, whereas this film is set into a scenario where both the protagonists are engaged, in fact one of them is married with a kid. So it was relatively more challenging to continue from where the last film left off and maintain the same plot, like they meet, they have a chit- chat until one of them have to leave for a flight. There has been a change in mentality and lifestyle for both of them, and it was necessary for the movie to depict the same, which the director has done incredibly well! The whole film basically revolves around a continuing conversation just like the first film, only this time around the director didn't have plenty of choices for the environment, like a pub, or riverside, or rooftop as it was in the previous version. What amazed me the most is the way the story unfolds, how they initially appear really happy about current life, but as the movie progressed we gradually get to know how they are actually not fully satisfied with their current relations, and how they try to forget that night, but can't...for obvious reasons. There is so much conflict throughout the dialog sequence, that even though it was just two people walking and talking, you never feel awkward, or bored for a moment. Truly an outstanding piece of direction by Richard Linklater.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredible. Linklater is still my hero.,"I saw this movie last night, July 30th (had to wait that long before it came to a theatre near me).I went with my girlfriend and three other friends. We were the only people in the theatre unfortunately, even at 10:15pm when it started. Whatever, it's a Hilary Duff/Cinderella Story world, what can I say.I worship Before Sunrise, Waking Life, and Slacker. I think Richard Linklater is one of the most important writer/directors of all time, especially now.This film was as good as, if not better than, Before Sunrise. The dialogue/chemistry was still there, in full effect. It totally rocked, insanely. It fulfilled my expectations and exceeded them.In a world plagued by ""romance"" films such as A Cinderella Story and Sleep Over, it is so refreshing that Linklater is still making amazing films that provoke the mind and heart. Kudos to you man.Everyone needs to see this. Everyone who wondered whatever happened to Jesse and Celine back in 1995. Without giving away anything about the movie, the story was great with twists here and there but it ended just as it should have. Awesome, awesome film. And I have to add, it has a wonderfully ""classic"" quality... the lighting (natural evening sunlight, which lights Ethan and Julie's hair so beautifully in several scenes)... it has a nice ""fuzzy/dreamy"" quality as well, especially the outdoor scenes, which again brings the ""classic"" quality forward much more. It has to be the natural France sunlight. Absolutely awesome.More people need to see this... it only has about 900 votes on the IMDb. Thankfully, it's at 8.6. Let's keep rating it highly. It deserves to be in the top 250 on IMDb, as should Before Sunrise.Thanks again Richard Linklater, you make movies that affect people for their whole lives. Something very few directors have done or ever will do.Go see this if you love great film-making and dialogue which is repeatable and extremely well-written. If you haven't seen Before Sunrise yet, buy it, it's worth every penny and has a tremendously high re-watching factor.A perfect 10 in every way.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than their first one,"This is one of the rare cases where a film based on another movie is better than the original. Way better. I watched ""Before Sunrise"" after I saw this one and was quite disappointed. The actors and the story are more mature in the sequel. Maybe I am too old to identify with the mid-twenty Jesse and Celine and feel more comfortable with the mid-thirties you see in ""Before Sunset"". If you watched ""Before Sunrise"" you can see what difference nine years make. They both have their lives, they both are less adventurous then they were back then. But as they wander through the beautiful set of Paris, talking about anything, the two remember and regret what they had back then and what decisions they made. What could've been? And what could be? The movie follows a slow pace, Celine and Jesse just walk through Paris, talking. But the movie is far from being boring. After it was over I couldn't believe over an hour had passed. I don't know if you have to be of a certain age to really like this movie. If you don't need action to enjoy a movie give this one a try.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
my heart's still in my throat,"Such a lovely film! Of course, I should preface this by saying Before Sunrise (the ""first"" one) has always been a truly heart-wrenching guilty pleasure of mine. OOh, I'm so guilty of loving this film. But, as soon as I get to see Before Sunset again, I will be guilty of loving a sequel as well.I love it. I love the divine simplicity of mid-nineties precocious pseudo-boho banter. I love it. I love semi-art house love stories that really cater to main stream audiences searching for film-junkie street cred. I love Ethan. ""Jesse"" defines the ""every boy"" American boy you wished every American boy you met was like. Nine years later, I still want one of them to be Jesse. ~sigh~ I can dream, can't I?And while Julie Delpy may be the bane of my(or every other raging jealous loony of a girl's) existence, there is simply no other actress that could BE ""Celine"". Her character is so honestly portrayed in the ""sequel""(Ugh, I hate calling it that). Celine's songs will flatten you, period. And Ms. Delpy wrote them!!??!! GAH!! so jealous! You know what? I love Julie too. what a talent!I have been known as a film snob and I can acknowledge that. Yet out of all the films that have fans salivating for a ""I-know-they-shouldn't-make-one-but-I-wish-they-would"" sequel, this one nearly made me pass out with pleasure. I didn't even realize I wanted a sequel. I don't normally like sequels. But thank a higher power this one was made. The characters actually developed. And they developed over the nine year span as the ""rest of us"" did as well. It's remarkably satisfying to have actors acting human.Paris was shot so naturally. You'll love the look of the alley-ways and eye-level walking views. Makes you all wistful for the Vienna of the last decade(errmm..""first one""). A lot of the scenery really goes for a throw back of Before Sunrise. Which, yeah, is totally awesome. For a second, when I saw the boat on the River Seine, I thought it was part of a flash back. My heart was in my throat. Then, that ending. No spoilers, I promise. But. ..I've never been moved to near-tears by a -ugh- sequel in my entire life. Had I not been in public, I probably wouldn't have held 'em back. You CAN NOT ask for a more perfect ending. And this is coming from a girl that makes it a point to hate endings. Yeah, I'm pretentious. But You're reading a film comment, so you are too. ha ha.Maybe my life was a bit too busy over the last decade to have been thinking about what was happening to Celine and Jesse, but ""milkshake!"", I should've. If you haven't seen Before Sunrise, please see that first. Then, I hope, you'll be able to understand why us ""fans"" actually held our hearts in our throats and tried to swallow down tears over this film's ""what might have been.""on that note, anyone want to see this again with me?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's official: Richard Linklater is one of my top 10 favorite directors of all time!,"Having seen this film and its predecessor, I can say that they are so entertaining and engaging to be true.

A cure for insomnia,"(Yawn) This is totally unrealistic. No one can actually watch this film without getting sleepy. I've followed Ethan's acting career with enthusiasm and scrutiny, but I must say, taking this role did not suit him. The pace of it all was way too slow even for mediocre minds. This was worse than ""August"" or ""Junebug."" (see all my reviews; they are not all negative)! The guitar music was sappy along with the odd conversation between ONE man and ONE woman. Where is everyone else? Not many actors can pull off an entire film without support cast members. This was one step up from ""Castaway"" at least... (well Tom did have his coconut head), but lacks the variety of emotions needed for a class ""A"" film. I'm sorry, but this movie was just too under-acted and no one falls in love that fast at their (understood to be) characters' ages and implied intelligence level. Maybe teenagers fall in love that quickly, but real love takes time. If you're looking to pass the time with absolutely nothing else to do, or if you need a good sleeping aide, then by all means, watch this film!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
