Chilling and Sad.Ignore the One-Stars!,"Never written a review before. Haven't felt the need. But after seeing the 1 star reviews of this film,i just felt compelled.Firstly,what this is.I would say a cross between The Shining and We Need to talk about Kevin. This film is desperately sad. A woman who is haunted,first by her husbands death,then by the Babadook all while looking after her young son. This is a creepy, no jump scare, fantastic psychological horror. A rare gem that plays on all those fairytale fears that you may have had as a kid.Second.What this isn't.Well,not ""The worst horror in years"".I get that people have different opinions.I do.But this isn't a film that can justify that sort of nonsensical comment. It isn't a dull jump scare-filled blockbuster. The characters are not hot teenagers. They are believable, disturbed and this makes the film the slow,creeping horror that it is.If you are a fan of horror,it really is a must see film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A meditation on grief,"The Babadook surprised me on two counts.First, as someone who doesn't often get the warm fuzzies at spooky films, this did. It's a well acted, believable account of a mum and child being haunted by a seemingly malevolent 'thing'. Effective jumps and creeping tension are handled well.But I was surprised again by the end, as I came away seeing it as an allegory for deep grief and a way through it. I found it quite moving, the mum finding a place for that darkness, finally taking control of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best Horror Films of 2014,"A single mother (Essie Davis), plagued by the violent death of her husband, battles with her son (Noah Wiseman)'s fear of a monster lurking in the house, but soon discovers a sinister presence all around her.Some people find this film terrifying, some just find it eerie. If nothing else, it stands out as original. Writer-director Jennifer Kent hits a home run, taking what she learned from her very unusual film school (watching Lars von Trier) and incorporating it here. But it is so much more than good direction and excellent framing.This is a film that could fail if the elements were off. If the creature effects were cheesy, it would not be as scary. If the mother was not as convincing, it would not be so emotional. And Noah Wiseman? Wow. Few child actors are able to perform on this level. The last one with this much talent that comes to mind is Chloe Moretz. Give this kid more roles, and give them to him now.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much more than a horror film,"While ""The Babadook"" may display some of the hallmarks of the traditional horror film, there's a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Far from the typical Hollywood bloodfest so brilliantly satired in ""Cabin in the Woods,"" this film's characters are layered, its plot is mercurial, its actions are metaphorical, and its conclusions are ambiguous. All this is likely to disappoint those filmgoers who need to be spoonfed a formula. But if you're a film lover, Do. Not. Miss. This.Director Jennifer Kent understands what most horror filmmakers fail to grasp: that our biggest fear isn't of crazy killers or monsters or ghosts, but of ourselves—what lives inside us, the emotions we have to live with, the illusory veil of self-control.The plot revolves around a mum, her troubled son and the book he pulls off the shelf one night. But you already know too much. This is one film where knowing less going into it will really pay dividends. Really, don't even watch the trailer.Just know that the storytelling and craft are flawless. Essie Davis delivers one of the most challenging performances put to screen with total commitment and credibility. Kent's storytelling is utterly absorbing and she so delicately treads the line between what's real and what's not that you can never be sure of yourself.What you make of ""The Babadook"" will depend on who you are. You might take it at face value, as a creepy monster flick with all the constant threat and looming dread and shocking moments. You might take it as an attempt to capture the authentic experience of mental illness. You might take it as a symbolic story using a metaphor for grief and loss. The best films make you feel something and allow you the room to make sense of it yourself.Personally, I thought about this film for days after seeing it, both because of its ambiguity and because of the themes it explores, namely mental illness and domestic violence. Yes, it's scary. But it's also touching and heartbreaking. While ""The Babadook"" belongs alongside other great psychological horror films, like ""The Innocents"" and ""The Haunting"" (1963), to classify it purely as ""horror"" really belittles its accomplishment as a film that challenges us to examine and discuss issues we are very uncomfortable tackling in reality.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The scariest ""children's film"" I have ever seen","We are all familiar with the scenario: a young boy with an overactive imagination becomes terrified of the monster underneath his bed, and rushes to his mother for a therapeutic bedtime story. But what if this imaginary monster actually becomes real? This is the set up for a new Australian horror flick premiering at this year's Sundance Film Festival entitled The Babadook. Our protagonist, Sam, is terrified of monsters. So terrified he is loosing sleep, causing trouble in class, and creating his own sinister weaponry out of household objects as a means of defense. It's enough to drive his widowed mother, Amelia, into a frantic state of paranoia. As tensions between the two escalate, a new presence called the Babadook makes it's way into the household which questions the sanity of everyone involved. The film cleverly embraces and deconstructs typical horror film conventions in order to create something new. Though it is hilariously playful and entertaining, it's also a terrifying psychological thrill in the same vein as films like Black Swan or Rosemary's Baby. Essie Davis is great as Amelia, but newcomer Noah Wiseman gives an incredibly memorable child acting performance. If you are a horror fan looking for something new, look no further than The Babadook. Just be prepared to have nightmares afterward, and remember to leave the kiddos at home for this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Depths of Despair...,"There's a demon likes to get inside your mind, if he enters he can be a bit unkind, takes you down a winding path, a quite determined sociopath, doesn't care what trauma that he leaves behind.

Good But Overrated,"Why are so many of the reviews here giving this a 9 or 10 taking the time to insult everyone who feels otherwise? I get it with movies based on superheroes or popular book series -- they have rabid fans who lash out. But why this? It's just a horror movie. And, honestly, an overrated one. I'm not saying its bad. It's actually a good watch. But the praise is pretty over the top. It's a well-crafted movie of its type but not an instant classic or any of that hyperbole. One thing I was very happy about was that it actually did follow through with the advertised premise. As I was watching it, about midway through I became concerned this was not going to be a movie about a supernatural creature but rather a message movie about mental illness and child abuse. Thankfully the movie dispels that in the last twenty or so minutes.It's a pretty good (but not great) movie with a couple of nice scares and shocks. However, I didn't find it to be as groundbreaking or unique as many other reviewers. Sometimes I think horror fans are dying of thirst so every little drop of water is oversold as being on par with ""fill in the blank with a classic horror film."" It's not all that. It's just not. And the mom and kid got on my nerves big time before the first hour was up. This is a movie with a lot of scenes of people being assholes. A lot of yelling, etc. If you're like me that stuff drains you after awhile. I had a headache by the end. Speaking of the end, I'm unsure how I feel about it. Kudos for not tying it all up too neatly but I didn't quite get what the hell Babadook was and, more importantly, why is it eating worms? I kinda like the weirdness of that. Hope they don't ruin it by doing a sequel. Who are we kidding, of course they will.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beyond the Creeps,"At first glance, The Babadook may sound like a tale that warns people  to not let children put creepy stories up into their heads. It may also  be like one of those old horror movies with children being influenced  by the ghost. The titular monster seems to have the potential of being  a silly urban legend, such as Slender Man or the Hash Slinging Slasher  (sorry about that), that is destined to be flooded with fan fiction, or  simply just another horror movie icon, but the film surprisingly has a  different aim than just scaring the audience. It might as well be a  character study of a mother having a hard time moving on after the  tragedy she's been through losing her husband and trying to raise her  only son. The real horror doesn't come out that quick, but there is  already a pretty compelling movie when it come to its characters. The  tension is just the prize for being intrigued by the story's core.  One thing people must know about the film is it's not generally about  The Babadook monster. In spite that the antagonist has an ambitiously  great campy design and his story is told well by a twisted storybook  with wondrously illustrated diorama, the movie is still laden on the  more human element of the tale, which is the struggle of a mother who  is unable to live normally. The pacing of her life may move too fast  for the film, but the sadness and deprivation beneath those regular  troubling days are totally manifested even without extending any of its  breathing. The plot mostly concerns Amelia finding a way to overcome  Samuel's behavioral issues and her memories with the accident than  dealing with the whole supernatural threat, for sure it is trying to  build some slow burn, but even without that horror movie sense, it  still feels like they're being tormented by life.  It deliberately takes their personal grief seriously, making sure that  they actually aren't insane, and nobody else could ever understand what  they're going through. This is pretty much the most compelling view of  the film, which makes them reasonably trapped into their own  nightmares. Mister Babadook only becomes the boiling point of the  ordeal. And when it hits to the part of the real scares, it sells well  whenever the monster attacks. Instead of loud lazy jump scares, it  rather spreads away signs of his presence and its effects to the  family. His appearance has more terror if he's lurking in the shadows.  It also has a nice use of practical effects to endure its very  effective creeps. The performances of the two leads are outstanding for  bringing the real heart of the picture. Essie Davis embraces the  character, making her fear, depression, and shifting madness all  visibly genuine. Same to the young Noah Wiseman who as well gives his  character's actions some sense of anxiety.  Some horror fans might get slightly disappointed for not giving The  Babadook monster enough of the characterization he deserves. The other  story is a lot more interesting to follow than his diorama tricks, and  that is why I keep stating that the the movie is best viewed as a  gloomy fairytale about a mother and a son fighting to keep a hold of  themselves and promise to protect each other from the odds, even if the  promise doesn't always apply, than just another horror movie being  shown in our theaters. While it still has the right amount of admirably  campy scares, the film often explores to the larger and much affecting  side of the story, and that sure offers beyond than what you expect to  this stale genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting...,"Don't let the movie's somewhat silly title discourage you from watching ""The Babadook"". If you like a proper horror movie that is driven by an interesting storyline and good acting then ""The Babadook"" should be on your list to watch. It doesn't, however, unlike many other horror movies, rely on shocks and to make you jump in your seat tactics. And that is what makes this horror movie stand out.The story is about widowed Amelia and her son Samuel who are trying to cope with the tragic loss of husband and father. When introduced to a children's storybook titled Mister Babadook, Samuel starts acting strange and claiming that the babadook is around him. Slowly as unexplainable things start to occur, Amelia realize that they are indeed not alone.While ""The Babadook"" is not the ultimate scarefest, then it is definitely a horror movie that you should take the time to watch, because director Jennifer Kent really managed to build up suspense slowly throughout the course of the movie. But a lot of credit goes to Essie Davis (playing Amelia) and Noah Wiseman (playing Samuel) because their acting performances were just amazing.One thing that I was missing more of in the movie was more scenes where we could have seen more of the mysterious babadook creature. Sure, having limited exposure for it adds to the suspense and mystery, but it would have been so much more entertaining if we had gotten more footage with the babadook.""The Babadook"" was a much needed addition to the horror genre. I was genuinely entertained and surprised with how good this movie actually was.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Australian horror film,"You've heard of feel-good films, well this is not one. It's creepy and disturbing pretty well all the way, a good old horror fantasy with a nod to the psychological canniness of Nightmare on Elm Street but much more economical in terms of special effects, casting and I would imagine budget. It nevertheless maintains tension and atmosphere along with some high-flying dramatic sequences from the actors which bear comparison with The Exorcist. The plot also connects nicely with the psychological and existential conflicts facing a single mother whose son's birth coincided with the tragic death of her husband, and the whole nasty Babadook phenomenon, and its unresolved outcome, can certainly be read as an allegory of this traumatic event. Maybe it's over-reading to say the film also contains a Nietszchian lesson about the importance of embracing every aspect of one's life and history, no matter how horrific - but it works for me. The acting is amazingly good from the two leads, although the supporting characters are a bit stereotyped, a directing decision presumably. Sets and locations are charged with a bleak gloom, and the colour accordingly verges on monochrome. Love the specially made children's book, and Mr Babadook's physical character, as well as the wonderfully curated vintage movie footage appearing throughout on the TV screen. And a special word for the very fine intricately crafted sound design.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A ferocious performance at its centre, but still nothing special.","I've never been one for horror. I enjoyed last year's The Conjuring and the tongue-in- cheekness of 2012's The Cabin In The Woods, but they're still throwaway entertainment to me. The Babadook seems to have been building a lot of prestige for what it is. Perhaps that's because it's an independent film operating on a better level than what Hollywood calls horror these days. While I appreciate that the film is an allegory for grief, stress, and the demons of a widowed mother dealing with a difficult child, it definitely shows that more effort has gone into its conception, but it suffers from being very silly sometimes. The problem is that the film is inexplicably rushed. It may have a grungy atmosphere, but it lacks tension from such quick edits. It builds relentlessly without a satisfying payoff. That said, Essie Davis gives a terrific lead performance. I'm not quite sure about her angry outbursts, but the rest is striking and poignant work. The Babadook is a decent horror film thanks to its lead, but already overcelebrated.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
great indie horror,"Amelia is a single mom struggling with hyper-active 6 year old son Samuel with a constant need for weapons to defend himself from unseen monsters. Her husband died in a car accident driving her to the hospital to have Samuel. The school is scared to keep him with the other kids. Even her sister Claire is afraid of Samuel especially to play with her own daughter Ruby. She finds a disturbing children's book about the Babadook. This sets off a scary series of events.Normally, I hate annoying kids but this kid is brilliantly annoying. It's such a fascinating character and the mother's suffering can really be felt.

Not what you expect,"I saw this film on Copenhagen pix yesterday. The movie was compared to ""the orphanage"", and even though i liked that film i was a bit in doubt if i should go for it because i was not in the mood for a heavy emotional, mother and son horror-drama. But its everything but. Sure its horror, sure its drama, but the tone is very different from the Spanish movies around same kind of subject which are very serious.This is way more fresh, snappy and sometimes funny actually, without being lame. But also creepy, its the change of moods thats freaky. Nice style. The actors are supreme and the whole socialrrealistic scene around it is far out and overexagerated, which the horror part also is. But it works, because its a metaphorical movie describing a feeling. Its highly original. If you expect the same supernatural children horror movie As you have seen before, think twice. This is new, this is cool, different. The best movie i have seen in a year. Serious. It never gets melodramatic, its fast, entertaining and a bit psychedelic. Very refreshing. And smart, clever. It has it all. I am a big fan.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A lesson about trauma, mourning and despair.","This horror film revolves around the difficult relationship between an imaginative and active son and his mother, a recent widow, both of whom seek to overcome the trauma of a very poorly resolved mourning. From an early moment, we understand the difficulties that the child brings to his mother, both of which are very poorly understood by all those around them. Sooner, the poor mother seems closer to a fit of nerves or deep depression. This finally happens when the character of a children's book (apparently written by herself) begins to take on a life of its own and to terrorize mother and child. The film is a lesson about depression, mourning and trauma. Sometimes, the bogeyman lives within ourselves and its us that we should be afraid of. The scares exist but the tense and terrifying atmosphere is something that is hardly ignored. Concerning actors, Essie Davis is the protagonist and carries the film on her back with great courage, presenting herself without makeup in order to look much more worn, as it requires her character. She is undoubtedly an artist of great talent, capable of embodying difficult characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The kid was so annoying I spent allot of time in the film just wishing he would shut up. Evidently allot of people thought it added to the movies intensity, it had the opposite affect on me.

Visceral Display of Human Emotion,"The Babadook is a film that deeply explores basic human emotions, such as guilt/mental illness. Essie Davis as Amelia really carries this film on her back. Her performance is remarkable. She displays her feelings of guilt/fear beautifully, and it makes her easy to relate to.Babadook is paced well, and definitely has a few scary moments. The plot depending on how the viewer interprets it, is also either medicore, or genius. The Babadook monster had a lot of potential, which I believe was very underutilized. After awhile he just didn't seem that menacing. There is also the body count to talk about. It is extremely low, even for a haunting type film. The climax was solid, and I enjoyed the ending. I can see how others wouldn't like it though, depending on their interpretation of the plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Miss Fisher, what has happened to you?!","Essie Davis is rather famous in her native Australia for starring in a wonderful television show ""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"". In the show, Davis is very glamorous--with he lovely black hair and perfect makeup and clothes. So imagine my surprise when I saw Davis starring in ""The Babadook""--with her natural strawberry blonde hair and absolutely no makeup whatsoever. In fact, instead of being a timeless beauty like she is in ""Miss Fisher"", Davis looks haggard and old in this film--perfect for the character but also a bit daring and very brave considering her sexy image as Miss Fisher.In ""The Babadook"", Davis plays a harried and overwhelmed mother. Her husband was killed on the way to the hospital when she was going into labor and for the last six years, she's refused to deal with this loss. Additionally, her child is a holy terror--one that would drain even Mary Poppins! These serious problems combined with clinical depression and a lack of sleep make for an interesting combination. Soon, a frightful character from a sick children's book, ""The Babadook"", begins terrifying and tormenting her. Soon the audience begins to wonder just how real any of this is and just how close to losing her sanity this poor woman is.This film is a very, very different sort of horror film. It lacks the usual cheap thrills and frights...and I appreciate that. Instead it shows the darkest recesses of the human mind and is enthralling. Much of it is due to Davis' amazing performance (she makes the film) and bizarre plot. This is much more of a thinking person's horror film-- one you won't soon forget.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
You can't get rid of the babadook (after spending money to watch it),"Just watched this movie on Directv and I'm disappointed. I don't understand why it has such a high score here and on other review sites. The movie starts off with a good story line but, as time goes away, so does the movie. It wants to make you feel part of the story but it fails. It also tricks you into believing something may have happened when it hasn't. True, it is kinda spooky at times but over all you should probably lower your expectations, especially if you love horror movies. Anyway, it's a good start for Australian horror cinema. Of course, if I ever saw the actual Babadook at my place, I'd probably go nuts...",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A flawed but scary modern horror film,"The Babadook is a 2014 horror film directed by Jennifer Kent. (It's actually the feature length debut for Kent) The Babadook tells the story of Amelia, (played by Essie Davis.) a single mother struggling to raise her constantly disobeying child, Samuel. (played by Noah Wiseman.) One day when Amelia is putting Samuel to sleep, he finds a mysterious book on the book shelf titled 'The Babadook,' and asks his mother to read to him as a bed time story. The book ends up being utterly terrifying, resulting in Amelia getting rid of it. But strange things begin to happen and Amelia slowly becomes paranoid that something is after her and Samuel.The Babadook is the film that gets a lot of stuff right, and a lot of stuff wrong. But first lets focus on the positive. Probably the best thing I can say about The Babadook is that it really, really tries to impress and frighten its audience. In a day when horror movies are all generic copies of each-other with predictable and cheap scares, it's a nice treat to see one that actually takes its time setting up a mood and atmosphere, and one that never relies on overused jump-scares to try and frighten the audience. But not only does the film actually try to be original and creative with its scares. It is actually scary. The Babadook is one of the only films I can think off that actually caused me to lose sleep over how scared I was by it. The scenes involving the book are executed perfectly, and I would be amazed if anyone wasn't completely terrified of them. Another positive is that all the actors do really solid jobs in their roles, especially Esse Davis. (Though the kid is incredibly annoying throughout the first half of the film.)But I think it's time we started talking about where the film messes up. For one the film is a little obvious and heavy-handed with its symbolism and message. I'm not against a horror film having either of these things, in fact I'm completely for it. But a little subtlety would be nice. If you somehow haven't heard what the film is metaphor I won't spoil it, but let's just say there's no way you're gonna miss it. Another much larger problem is the third act, it is just way, way, way too overblown. They spend the first hour with some great set-up, and than they completely blow it in the last half-hour. They shove way to much in the later part of the film and you end up with a lot of unnecessarily parts, and eventually it just feels like the film is trying to artificially stretch its length to 90 mins. I really think they could have had a much better film if they just cut 15-20 mins off it. Another major problem I have with the film is the ending, it really ham-fisted and it seems like it console tell goes against the whole idea of the film.In short The Babadook has some really good stuff, and some not so good stuff. But I would still definitely recommend it. Even though it has its problems because it's so nice to see a modern horror film, actually try to be good and original, and even better to see one that's legitimately scary.6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Babadook movie review,"I recently watched the film The Babadook and overall I would consider the movie a success. The film isn't breaking new ground in horror cinema but what it does, it does extremely well. The story is your typical haunted house while the child is the only one that sees the ghost. They add a little depth to the characters which is good. For me what set this apart in a good way from any of your generic haunted house movies that you would find at Redbox was the acting.Essie Davis plays the widowed single mother raising a rambunctious and imaginative child. Much of this film you see her struggling with work and raising this disruptive child that puts a strain on her relationships. I could really feel how exhausted this mother was by Essie's acting. You feel her frustration, her fatigue, and exhaustion throughout the film and that really kept me engaged. Towards the end of the film her acting really sells the horror that is involved in this film.Her son, played by Noah Wiseman, did a great job too. I have a pet peeve about bad child actors. I know there just kids but if a child in a movie sounds like there reading there lines or are saying things that I feel no 8 year old would ever say it throws me entirely out of the movie. Luckily in The Babadook there was none of this. Noah Wiseman was one of the best things about this movie. He seemed like a realistic ADHD kid mixed with a little MacGyver. The kid totally sold me on all his emotions and had me cracking up a few times. He reminded of an English version of Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone that has played way too much Call of Duty and just consumed a Red Bull. I loved this child actor and expect to see great things from him in the future.Visually this film does a few things that I found really effective. There's a lot in this film about insomnia and I felt the director did a few visual tricks that really shows that struggle that the lack of sleep can have on the human body. He also did some good shots that show how glorious a good night's rest can feel. The film isn't your standard horror film where there is a handful of dead bodies at the end of the film. It's a relatively nonviolent film but relies on suspense to keep you engaged. Even though there is a lack of typical ""scares"" and ""kills"" that I see in most horror films I was still engaged throughout the film.I found the designs of the ghost to be interesting but nothing ground breaking. The acting by the two leads are what really sold me on the terror rather than the actual ghost. The only really complaints I have with this film is the ending. I felt the actions by the characters were a little strange and unrealistic but it didn't ruin the movie for me by any means.If you feel like watching a typical haunted house movie that is done extremely well with superb acting then I would highly recommend The Babadook.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
babadook dook dook,"If you want a movie to thrill your inner demons you have to look no further than the Babadook. This psychological horror delves into the symbolic spectrum of our innermost monsters brought to life in a transition from outer to inner demons that torment the troubled mother. Can this monster be overcome through love and the will power of the mother is the real question that thrills the viewer throughout this film. This story centers around two characters, Samuel and Amelia, a child and single mother still plagued by the loss of her husband and Samuel's father. The bleak ambient lighting combined with the dull misc-en-scene of the gray lifeless house in which most of the story takes place help the audience to sympathize with the troubled mother and express her grief burdened world. At the same time throughout the film the child's high pitched screams and reckless behavior from his overactive imagination and fear of monsters further agitates the mother's fragile state. With this atmosphere in place the monster created straight from a child's imagination is introduced through a storybook. The monster who only gets stronger the more it is denied torments the little family and the mother especially. The mother becomes through her denial of the monster the monster herself. This psychological transition is seen as her outbursts towards her son's behavior continues to grow in ferocity. This grows and the monster grows as well and allows the viewer to see the parallel and the question again becomes can she overcome that monster.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hope for the horror genre,"Thanks to the Paranormal Activity and Saw sequels, the horror genre has been left in an embarrassing state. We've been over-dosed on PG-13 ghost stories, that desperately rely on jump-scares, and torture-porn, filled with some of the most horrible acting to ever be put on-screen. Both so formulaic, they're predictable to the point of being boring. Then along comes a little indie film from Australia called The Babadook.The Babadook is a children's book a young boy with an over-active imagination finds, mysteriously, on his bookshelf one night for his widowed, over-worked and sleep deprived mother to read to him. What is found in the book not only traumatizes the boy but also scares the mother. Soon the mother and son are being haunted by The Babadook, a monster that feeds off denial. Is the boy mentally disturbed and intentionally trying to drive his mother crazy or is the mother trying to give herself a reason to murder her son? Is The Babadook real or is the real monster a suppressed part of one of the characters?The film begins and builds with excellence, masterfully directed by Jennifer Kent. It has a dash of influence from David Lynch and is somewhat reminiscent of Guillermo del Toro's earlier work. The first 75 minutes make for a truly intense and terrifying ride filled with spectacular visuals. Unfortunately, The Babadook suffers from too many missed opportunities within the story and the conclusion is more ridiculous than frightening. It makes it seem as if the filmmakers were uncertain as to whether they wanted to create a haunted house story, a monster movie or a psychological thriller. This causes more confusion than necessary, as the monster movie aspect undermines the reality and depth of the psychological thriller.While it doesn't break any new ground, The Babadook is genuinely scary and unpredictable. Despite the ending, Jennifer Kent proves to be a powerful director we should keep an eye on.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Most people will not get it, and rate the movie accordingly","This movie's biggest strength, is also it's biggest weakness. It's a cleverly constructed horror story with multiple layers. The problem is that it never explains itself, nor does it even drop the faintest hint by the end. Thus, people who went into this thinking this is just a generic monster flick, will come out of it feeling pretty much the same. But that is not what this is.The movie is far more intelligent than a lot of people give it credit for. It's also a credit to the excellent direction, that this movie never delivers some sort of forced explanation of what it is really about. Without spoiling the movie, this film tricks you into thinking you are going to see a typical horror movie, but it ventures into far darker psychological territory. But like I said, most viewers will not get it. This is why this movie has received some terrible ratings from some viewers, but this is not an accurate representation of the actual quality of the movie.For the other half of the audience though, this is one heck of a ride. I suspect some viewers will get it halfway through, and some two-thirds into the movie. And everyone else won't get it at all. The acting is stunning, the cinematography and lighting are amazing, and I also really like the sound editing (except when they use a sound effect that's clearly from a very old and overused sound library). I found it especially compelling how the movie shifts focus several times during the story, regarding who the villain is.See it, and judge it for yourself. Do not let impulsive ratings fool you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simply not Scary,"I was recommended this film by a friend, who stated he was watching through his fingers. Why I don't know, it simply wasn't scary.I will admit to not being scared by many films, but if its done properly a scary film can be a delight. Unfortunately film makers these days try to do ""jump"" films rather than downright scary films. For example bits that make you jump from your seat, like Scream did so well many years ago.This film tried to go all psychological scary rather jump scary, for which they should be applauded, They however failed miserably, the ""monster"" was unseen for 99% of the film, and when it was seen was laughable, and I'm putting that down to lack of budget.One thing I would say is the child actor was fantastic, the female lead was not.I would strongly advise people if they are thinking of watching this movie, is to watch a Halloween episode of the Simpsons. Its scarier.I was mightily disappointed with this film, a waste of 93 minutes. If you want a psychological scary film, watch Hellraiser or the first Nightmare on Elm Street. These were done correctly, and stand the test of time because of it. I cant see anyone in a years time never mind 30 remembering this film",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty Good psychological drama/horror,"the Movie starts off a bit slow in my own opinion, in the beginning there is mostly drama and no horror but that changes later on. but they build up the drama and horror quite good and mix in a quite a bit psychological fear and elements, such as the struggle of being a single mom who is struggling with the trauma of her dead husband and a quite difficult child and being judged by others and society as a parent. how the moms struggles with difficult emotions and how that blends in with the horror part later in the movie is mixed in a very smart and good way. the horror effects are fantastic.+ the actors.+ the the music, sound and visual horror effects (i got goosebumps several times).A bit slow in beginning.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Midnight Viewing at Sundance!,"I stood in line on a whim to see this movie in Jan. I love suspense and thriller movies, and this was both. The audience was full of gasps and little shrieks as the movie progressed. Even though I thought I knew what was coming I still found myself caught off guard. The young boy is an amazing actor, and when I learned from the Q & A after the movie how some of the scenes were filmed it made me appreciate the movie more. Parts of one scene reminded me of the movie Sinster which I saw a few weeks before. Not a connection I would have made had I not JUST seen it.Over all I would not miss this movie, and cant wait to see it again with friends.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Filled with Suspense,"The first half of the Babadook is arguably the scariest piece of cinema I have seen in a very long time. From the time that the book makes its first appearance, the entire thing is just creepy. There is an ominous foreboding that pervades every scene, and I truly did not know what to expect, although you knew you were in for something unpleasant.Another great aspect about the first half is that I honestly did not know if ""The Babadook"" was truly haunting this family or if this was a trip into the mother's psychosis. By the end of the movie, it is still not entirely clear.I started to be less afraid once the ""reveal"" happened and we understood where the story was headed. It was still creepy, but I spent more time trying to figure out if she was crazy or if she was really being tormented, the thought of which added a whole new unpleasant dimension. I think there is a difference between deliberately trying to be vague and letting viewers figure it out and deliberately being confusing by putting conflicting clues. That being said, the movie keeps you hooked to the very end and I was nearly breathless as the last scene concluded, unaware of what was about to happen.I definitely recommend this movie. It will not make you jump and scream, but I had goosebumps more than once due to how creepy it was. The second half goes a little over the top, and some will be frustrated by some unanswered questions, but trying to figure out what is happening beyond the surface of this ""ghost"" story is the key to enjoying this ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An outstanding work of horror,"Many of today's horror movies are garbage and have many problems. But this movie works on so many different levels. It's about a troubled family who finds a book called ""Mister Babadook"". After reading it, weird things go on and the kid starts believing that the monster is real. It was expertly shot and each scene sends fear down your spine. What really stands out is how great the editing was. It made us fear the night sequences in the movie and it was so terrifying that I had to pause the movie a few times in the last half hour. The story is also really powerful as it displays the characters emotions real well and it does a nice job setting up what they're going through. This movie has everything that many other modern horror films don't have. The horror genre might be dying out but this movie shows us that it's not completely gone. This movie is definitely up there with horror classics like ""The Shining"" and ""The Exorcist"". Let's just hope that this brand of horror won't be dying out.

"Mediocre 'possession' meets ""Home Alone""","Let me begin by stating that I am Australian, so I was looking forward to watching a much-hyped Australian horror film.I'll also admit that Essie Davis is an exceptional actress, and presented a flawless performance in this film.Unfortunately, that's where the positives end...There is just so much wrong with this film.How anyone over the age of 14 would find this film scary is beyond me.Unrealistic dialogue. Inexplicable actions. ""Try hard"" scare tactics. And quite possibly the WORST and MOST RIDICULOUS 'solution' to cast out the demon.Honestly, I could write forever about how bad this movie truly is, but I already wasted 93 minutes watching it.Truth be told, I'm a little worried that the Babadook might get angry...and...I don't know...maybe, make me vomit black stuff?

Genuinely Creepy. One of the best films of the year!,"""The Babadook"" does two things that seem almost impossible for a modern horror film: create a tense, creepy sense of discomfort from beginning to end without resorting to lame jump scares or over the top gore, and develop its characters enough that we actually care about them.Drifting away from the ""cinema-veritas"" style that seems almost a rule for horror nowadays, the film tells the story of a family that is haunted by the titular monster, the ""babadook"", a creature that, even when he doesn't make a ""real appearance"" on the screen, now rivals icons such as Michael Myers, Chucky and Jason Voorhees in my book. But the short appearances of the monster are all for the best, as in horror ""the less you know, the scarier it is"". Each shot is also beautifully crafted, each one guaranteed to build up momentum until the climax arrives. And finally, the performances are particularly strong for a horror film (someone get that kid an Oscar!).There are still a few shortcomings, particularly on the effects department, but all is forgiven given its low budget, and, aren't all the best horror movies made with heart over money? The only other fault I see in the film is that it could have been a little shorter, but again, this is just a minor criticism.If you're a horror fan or you're just in for a good scare, you should see this right now! (even William Friedkin, director of ""The Exorcist"" loves it!) Let's just hope Hollywood does not the turn the well dry (""Paranormal Activity"" series, I'm looking in you direction...) and leaves this movie at is: a beautiful, nearly perfect little film that is not only the best horror film of the year (BY FAR!) but of the most wildly inventive horror features of the decade.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The horror of ""The Babadook"" comes from a different place than it appears","Horror – especially demons and monsters – as metaphor for psychological trauma isn't a novel idea by any stretch, but Jennifer Kent's ""The Babadook"" is a particularly riveting execution of this concept. Combining modern horror archetypes (e.g. the supernatural, possession, creepy children's things) with emotional family drama, ""The Babadook"" powerfully taps into fears both imagined and painfully real.""The Babadook"" gets under the skin by anchoring its story in the relationship of a single mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), whose behavioral challenges are a source of great anxiety for both of them. Samuel is 6 years old and always talking of monsters, building weapons and requiring a lot of his mother's attention. His school wants to pull him out of his class to address his behavior. As a result, Amelia barely sleeps, and compounding matters is that she's still wrestling with the loss of her husband, who died rushing her to the hospital for Samuel to be born.After 20 minutes of solidly establishing the relatable woes of parenthood and how easily misunderstood children are, Samuel pulls an unusual bedtime story off his bookshelf about a boogeyman-type figure named the Babadook who comes to scare children. This only aggravates their sleeping problems, of course, but eventually the book's warnings start to take an eerily real turn.What makes ""The Babadook"" stand out from similar contemporary boogeyman/supernatural horror films is that the child isn't affected nearly as much as the mother. The focal point of the story gradually shifts to Amelia, to the point that we are just as terrified of what she might do as the stress and lack of sleep continues to compound as we are with the Babadook. This shift really takes hold when a new version of the book appears on Amelia's doorstep after she had torn up the pages, this time featuring disturbing new illustrations.Kent does excellent work behind the camera with D.P. Radek Ladczuk using a myriad of techniques including the incorporation of shadow and quick cuts between effectively posed shots to keep the suspense flowing in virtually every scene. The synergy between Kent and Davis is extremely evident as well, and Davis really drives home the roller coaster of emotions (and sanity) her character endures. It's one of the best horror performances in a film of this contemporary style. (She's also strangely reminiscent of Kirsten Dunst, but that's merely an observation.)The connection between the supernatural elements of the Babadook and the ways it represents a manifestation of Amerlia's personal trauma and feelings is kept just tenuous and mysterious enough to work. If the Babadook weren't connected to her psychology at all, the film would feel like any other horror movie; if it were merely in her mind, we would have no reason to be kept in suspense. The balance and relationship between the two – Babadook as a real children's monster and as one's personal demons – keeps the film compelling and ultimately renders it a success.Needless to say, the juicier, more interesting side of that balance is the psychological side. The way the events of the film push mother and child toward a much-needed reckoning gives the movie its savvy and poetic sensibilities. Maybe ""The Babadook"" isn't as scary or thrilling or bloody (definitely no payoff in that regard) as its contemporaries (I'd argue it is, though I'm admittedly not a horror junkie), but the dread it induces from its non-supernatural elements is another kind of terror altogether.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"If It's In A Word Or It's In A Book, You Can't Get Rid Of The Babadook","An Australian chiller that gets most things right than wrong in a time when almost every other example of its genre is filled with clichés & cheap thrills, The Babadook arrives as a handsomely crafted horror film that presents a welcome absence of jump scares & relies on a chilling sense of dread brought upon by its moody atmosphere to deliver the frights.The Babadook tells the story of a single mother who is still grieving the loss of her husband despite many years having been passed since the tragic incident & is on the verge of falling apart due to her child's behavioural problems & continuous fear of a monster lurking in the house. But very soon, she comes to realize that the monster part may not be all made-up.Written & directed by Jennifer Kent, it was the film's glowing reviews that made me check it out in the first place but it didn't turn out to be scary at all. But unlike most horror films of today, this one touches on some deeper human emotions with a plot that's soaked in symbolism & themes. Cinematography makes really good use of lighting, contrasts & shadows, editing is a mixed bag while music has a mostly muted but effective presence.Coming to the performances, Essie Davis stars in the role of the single mother & her work here is really good as one can make out that her character is going through a lot right from the opening moments. Noah Wiseman plays the annoying kid who ultimately manages to get on everyone's nerves as the story progresses which pretty much explains her mother's dilemma since anyone will go absolutely crazy with a child like that.On an overall scale, despite getting to see such amazing word-of-mouth reception for this film from most people here as well as critics, The Babadook turns out to be an underwhelming cinematic experience for me even though I do admire its effort to try something different with the genre & its take on grief plus creepy ambiance is excellently carried out. Maybe I expected too much but Jennifer Kent's feature film debut is nonetheless a well-crafted chiller worthy of a shot.",,Anonymous,Horror
The Heartwarming Tale of a Single Mom and her Poltergeist Raising her Wildly Undisciplined Son...,"THE BABADOOK was a decent movie but I was disappointed after my first viewing thanks to all the hype behind it. There were a bunch of reviews touting it as terrifying and one of the scariest films of the year; I'm pretty sure there was even a quote from William Friedkin (director of THE EXORCIST) praising it as the most terrifying movie he's ever seen. The film, from first-time feature director Jennifer Kent, is about Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Samuel's father died in a car accident driving a pregnant Amelia to the hospital the day Samuel was born, so it's just been the two of them ever since. It's been rough going, with Amelia stuck in a thankless job and Samuel developing behavioral issues. Severe behavioral issues. He's getting in trouble in schoolfor bringing homemade weapons and his own aunt can't stand to be around him. Then, one night, Amelia goes to read Samuel a bedtime story and discovers a strange new book on the shelf, ""The Babadook"". It's a twisted little pop-up book that scares the wits out of Samuel and, as if that isn't bad enough, it's merely the start of a series of bizarre occurrences. Soon Samuel is ""seeing"" the Babadook and he becomes petrified that the shadowy creature is invading their home. Amelia's frustration with the boy skyrockets when he acts out against this invisible specter but we begin to wonderis it Amelia's years of frustration boiling over or has the Babadook found a host?Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just desensitized but THE BABADOOK wasn't much of a horror film. Thriller, sure. Certainly a drama. But I wouldn't classify it as horror. I was never at any point scared of anything. These warped expectations ruined my initial viewing. I'd bought the movie, reading so much good about it, and sat down with a couple beers for a good scare. Halfway through, I was so put-off by the misdirection that I couldn't be bothered to care. It wasn't until my second viewing, this time know what I was getting in to, that I began to recognize it as a good film. It still wasn't scary but, since I was watching it fresh, I was able to recognize how talented the filmmakers were at creating a constant state of suspense. THE BABADOOK is a very tense film. The visuals are drab and drained of color; Amelia's house is full of cool blue shades and shadowy corners. The rising tension throughout the beginning of the film is slow but you can see it all building up to the point where it'll burst. You can't help but sympathize with Amelia in the beginning; her job sucks and her son is a royal pain. Samuel appears to have two modes: hyperkinetic and screaming. It's not surprise that she's as burnt out as she is, having dealt with this life for years with no one by her side. Anyone could go nuts in such a rut.Then the Babadook arrives and it's too much for Amelia to bear. Things get interesting and I love that, the second time around, I noticed that it's not all as cut and dry as I'd thought. I realized that it leaves it ambiguous whether there really is a supernatural being haunting their little family or perhaps Amelia has finally just snapped and everything occurring in the film is her unconscious mind acting out. It's only really this element that keeps the film all that interesting and I've read some interesting interpretations online. But does it stand out in the genre? Not really; not to me. If you're thinking of checking out THE BABADOOK, manage your expectations and don't let the hype get them too high. It's pretty slowly paced and can feel as if it's dragging at times. The final act where everything finally falls apart is pretty entertaining. In terms of casting, this is essentially a two-person show with Davis and Wiseman. Davis does a fine job as the increasingly fragile Amelia and Wisemanwellyou get used to his antics as the film progresses and, despite his annoying nature, you'll most likely be on his side by the end. There are a few minor characters. Barbara West is their kind, elderly neighbor who is always on the verge of getting involved when things have obviously taken a turn for the worse in Amelia's home but was never bothered enough to get the authorities involved. Amelia's snobbish sister Claire (Hayley McElhinney) sees her sister's suffering but couldn't seem to care less. Really, the Babadook should stop worrying about Samuel and needs to focus his energies on the useless people surrounding Amelia. That, I think we could all agree on. Anyway, THE BABADOOK, while not as game-changing as some critics might want you to believe, is a serviceable supernatural (?) thriller and is probably worth your time if you're bored on a quiet night.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
uncanny,"A single mother struggles to cope with raising her troubled child. Having never faced up to the death of her husband, and possibly suffering depression of her own, she begins to suspect a supernatural presence in her home The Babadook is a disturbing genre hybrid, part horror, part psychological thriller. It evokes the uncanny in self-aware tonal moments, when daylight scenes can seem as threatening as the black of night. Amelia (an inspired Essie Davis) wanders around in a fug, sleep-deprived and still grieving seven years after the death of her husband. Amelia's problem is to resolve how she feels about her son Samuel, the inadvertent cause of her husband's death, born on the day of the car accident that took her spouse. How can a mother possibly not love her child? The manual Samuel (a quite startling performance from young Noah Wiseman) provides the answer. Samuel is what less-informed times used to refer to as 'a handful.' Is the Babadook real or a figment of Ameila's increasingly disturbed mind? The film does a wonderful job of exploring this central theme. Budget limitations at times show themselves - shadow is amply deployed, and sound design is a little less complex than required - but they hardly detract from a very satisfying example of a genre typified by Hitchcock's Vertigo. Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Twisted and spine-chilling thriller you shouldn't watch alone,"This Austrailian horror-thriller follows Amelia (Essie Davis), a widowed mother who's husband was killed in a car crash, and is struggling trying to raise her six-year-old son Sam (Noah Wiseman), who has violent tantrums and copes with an extreme fear of monsters under his bed. One night, when she reads him book titled ""The Babadook"", about a mysterious figure that lurks at night. Amelia and her son become endangered when ""The Babadook"", the mysterious character from the book, comes to life and unleashes an unimaginable terror in their house. This film was directed and written by Jennifer Kent in her directorial debut.The Badadook is by far the scariest movie I've seen since The Conjuring (2013). It left me at the edge of my seat for awhile. Instead for relying on cheap jump scares that most horror films nowadays are known for, this film goes for straight horror by constantly building up suspense so that it will leave you slowly backing away from the screen. It does take away awhile (maybe 45 minutes) for all the scares to arrive, but when they happen, it immediately sends chills to your spine. The Babadook, which is this eerily dark figure with a coat and a hat, is the scariest part of the film. In the scene when it slowly emerges from the dark and scares Amelia and her son, my heart just started pounding. This scene was so creepy and unnerving to the point where I felt the Babadook was gonna come out jump at me. Then you have Amelia, who becomes possessed by the grotesque figure and begins exhibiting nightmare-ish behavior, like vomiting blood and screaming unnaturally. This film just took me by a surprise at every turn.The Babadook is truly one of the scariest of this decade. If you are a fan of horror films, this would be the best choice. However, don't watch it alone. Find a friend or a family member like a brother, sister, or cousin to watch this with. This is a really frightening movie, especially when you're by yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Impressive first feature film from Jennifer Kent,"""If it's in a word, or it's in a look, you can't get rid of  The Babadook.""When William Friedkin claimed that he had never seen a more terrifying film than The Babadook, I was certain that I needed to see this. I'm not a huge horror fan, but I was pleasantly surprised with 2013's The Conjuring, so I went into this with high expectations knowing there is hope for the genre. The film didn't disappoint despite never actually being scary. I don't think that director, Jennifer Kent, was interested in scaring her audience, but rather in creating an uneasy atmosphere that would keep us engaged. She succeeded because while I was watching The Babadook I couldn't help but compare it to some other horror classics like Kubrick's The Shining and Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. Kent spends time in creating an unsettling atmosphere with some annoying characters and isn't interested in creating jump scares like so many horror films tend to do nowadays. The Babadook takes its time to build the right atmosphere and you are rewarded with your patience during the final third act. It is more of a psychological horror film than a graphically violent one. It is almost as if you are watching a dark drama at times. There is more to this film than simply scaring the audience and once the film is over you'll realize that there is meaning behind the narrative. It sort of plays out as a metaphor exploring interesting ideas which I wouldn't want to get into because it would involve spoiling some aspects of the film, but it is clear that there is a surreal undercurrent to the film which effectively says something about the way we deal with grief and parenting. Jennifer Kent's first feature film was a breath of fresh air in the horror department while feeling as a classic at the same time. She will be a director whose work I will be looking forward to in the future. Her screenplay was also smartly written and I know that audiences will benefit from a rewatch because there is a meaning behind everything that is going on. There is an interesting undertone to this film which will only build its reputation over time. If you just look at this film as a monster film you will be disappointed because it has a different agenda.Building a creepy atmosphere isn't enough for a horror film to succeed; you need characters you can engage with. I know that some of the complaints with this film had to do with the fact that the characters were all annoying and that made it hard to engage with, but in my opinion it worked perfectly for what it was trying to do. Essie Davis gives one of the best performances of the year and was a big part of why the creepy atmosphere worked so well. She plays a grieving mother who lost her husband on the day her first son was born. Her son is a problematic and hyperactive kid who is constantly giving her mother grief. He keeps on repeating that there are monsters in the house and always gets in trouble in school for his odd behavior. He's played brilliantly by Noah Wiseman and he effectively gets on the audience's nerves as well. Her mother doesn't really know how to handle him and when they come across a strange book named The Babadook weird strange begin to happen in the house. Essie Davis's character looks incredibly stressed throughout the film and her physical transformation is incredible. Noah Wiseman is one of those rare child actors who actually makes his character feel authentic and believable even when he is throwing tantrums and fits. I was impressed by the performances in this low budget film and they only add to an incredible tense and unsettling atmosphere. I was never scarred by this film, but I did feel uneasy and I also loved what it was trying to communicate. The Babadook is one of those films you should see now before Hollywood comes up with a terrible remake and ruins it. I hope it also marks a change of pace in the way horror films should be approached from now on.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Babadookie,"I watched Babadook on the strength of a random article titled: ""10 Scariest Movies on Netflix"" or something like that. My response to that title is...""Really?""A widow with a young son tries to cope with the death of her husband while trying to raise a little hellion. One day she stumbles upon a book titled: ""Babadook"" and after reading it the so-named entity enters their lives.I'm going to make one safe assumption here: this movie didn't have a big budget. No, scratch that, this movie relied on GoFundMe for their budget. Putting the story aside for a second, the special effects (if that's what you want to call them) were a throwback to the '80's. I'm talking fishing line, camera movement, and bad cut-aways. Allow me to give one example: there is a scene in which she gets into a car accident. She's driving, the camera shot starts getting wobbly, there are some sound effects and the next thing we see are two cars neatly joined for a fender bender.As for the story: I still don't know what it was. Was the Babadook an apparition, a creature, a demon? I have no clue, and nor do I know its purpose. But then what can be expected from a movie called Babadook? Yes, the movie was as silly as it sounds. In fact, at one point I thought I was watching a scary version of ""Home Alone"" or ""Problem Child"". With the boy being a miscreant and the mother being a total train wreck it was hard to get behind the two main characters. I don't see what the hoopla was about this film it was a poor attempt at a scary movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
An incredibly well made film that is a lot more than what it first seems,"'The Babadook' really isn't that scary, which is usually the number one requisite for a horror movie, but this is a rare case of that not really mattering because there is so much other brilliance to the film. It starts out like any other horror movie and I thought to myself here we go again, but by the halfway point I was beginning to realise this was something quite unique and fascinating. The acting was fantastic and there was clearly more going on that what immediately met the eye.A couple of months back I was reading which actresses were expected to be given Oscar nominations and someone mentioned that Essie Davis in 'The Babadook' was the best performance of the year and that they were disappointed she had no chance of being nominated. I thought to myself how bizarre it was to hear of an actress in a horror movie being given such critical acclaim. The genre just typically doesn't allow for such a thing. Now I understand however. Her performance is incredible. Every aspect of her acting was impeccable right throughout the film. No matter the mood of the scene, she nailed it. Another very fine Australian performance from 2014 to go with Sarah Snook in 'Predestination'.It's a great film. Seeing it is only half the fun though, because reading all the theories and small details that may have been missed is a real pleasure. I can't remember a horror movie that seems to have created this much debate and discussion in..... well, possibly ever. The annoying son was an absolutely marvelous creation of a character because it really did put us in the position and understanding point of view of the mother throughout.Had director Jennifer Kent been able to accomplish more frights (the scenes were there to do it) I think this had the potential to go down as an all-time classic. Unfortunately though some people subscribe to the theory that if they pay for a horror movie, they want to be scared. Those particular people also generally don't care too much about underlying messages or metaphors either. A shame because if everyone took the time to appreciate this for what it really is I think they would find some real joy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Babadook Review,"The film is more that a classic horror movie with lots of clichés or jumpscares. In ""The Babadook"" character development, psychology horror and clever metaphors are on point.

"Had potential, but ends up a pretty average horror movie","Had potential, but ends up a pretty average horror movie.Horror movies are easily the worst, least original genre of movies. Really very little room for originality and tend to fall back on the same clichés.The Babadook seemed to have potential, though was never that original. The tension and intrigue were built well. However, it pretty quickly fell back on standard horror formulae, and ended in a random, chaotic, confusing, pointless mess.Good performance by Essie Davis in the lead role. Noah Wiseman makes for a very irritating kid, though that might be the director and script's fault. Even in the beginning, when the movie had potential and hadn't fallen apart yet, the kid was the thing preventing it from being enjoyable.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

baba dook dook dook!!! that was creepy..,"the babadook is the story of a women who loses her husband on the way to have her child...this happened 7 years before and is the main conflict that arises between her and her ingenious 7 year old son. basically the mother indirectly blames her 7 year old son for her husbands death. the child starts out as the poster boy for childhood behavior problems which essentially means hes two screws away from being a full fledged sociopath. the mother on the other is depressed, repressed, sexually frustrated , tired and on the verge of an emotional breakdown. the kid seems to have a ""home alone"" complex coming up with weaponry that proves the kids ingenuity and understanding of what going on whiten his family. nobody seems to understand either him nor his mom and his mom ( and everyone else it seems) all blame the kid for the mothers emotional instability. one day the mother picks up a book with the words ""the babadook"" a child's book about a demon that kills children. this demon suddenly takes the role of the new affliction between the mother and son, as the son claims the babadook is real while the mother contends that its part of his overactive imagination. as the story goes on the roles are suddenly switched when the son now seems to be the sane one and the mother seems to be the one losing her mind. this is not a the typical clichéd mother and son relationship. in the end this movie is less about a demon and instead serves as a metaphor for the difficult relationship between a mother and her 7 year old son. your left with a feeling that the Babadook may be a figment of that families imagination, a manifestation created by the family in an attempt to coup with their problems..but it could very well be real...there is evidence to suggest both may be true. this is a must watch for horror fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Expect Epic Horror,"I had very high hopes for this movie and was slightly let down only because i expected a legendary horror film. The story is more about the mom and son than than babadook itself. This film had very good scares and unsettling scenes of the highest caliber, good acting and a good soundtrack. It was made with a low amount of money but you rarely notice it, the babadook is very scary itself but the way things play out it doesn't seem scary at all after the film was over. I watched with my wife and neither of us were afraid or left unsettled like some of the reviewers have posted. It's sad that they didn't capitalize on his scariness because his appearances were some of the most unsettling scenes i've seen in any movie. If the director held it's suspense and climaxed with more of the unsettling bits this movie would be truly terrifying and would have set a new standard for leaving viewers uneasy and terrorized. Still worth watching for the suspenseful moments in my opinion though.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A new genre of horror down the industry,"I was triggered to review the movie especially when I noticed that the reviewers only gave it a 6.8 out of 10. I'm very saddened that horror movie fans will be discouraged to watch such a topnotch movie once they see such a low rating.The Babadook might not be the typical horror movie one expects when knowing it falls under the ""horror"" genre; for example, you won't find it anywhere close to A Nightmare on Elm Street, or the Exorcist or Child's Play. This is mostly because of the director's decision to deprive the movie from any 'jump scares' which most modern horror movies try to abundantly offer the audience, and in return wasting other elements which will account for the movie's horror aspects.The Babadook narrates an obnoxious story of a husband and wife, which turns tragic after an accident in which the wife gives birth to her troubled child. The visual effects may not be the most appealing and the 'scares' might not be so intriguing, but the story-line is finely put. The movie succeeds in creating a tension which will keep your nervous system anticipated throughout. Given the movie is low- budget, I was very interested in this new horror sub-genre which may have not been offered before.For 'true' horror lovers, please watch the movie. You're up for a good ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tense Aussie thriller,"Tension is fun isn't it. Right from the outside this has it in spades. Sparse swathes of near silence punctuated with loud noises, innocent at first, but constantly building. Our two main characters are damaged, the mother wears it on the outside, the child more internal, but between them the issues slide deeper and darker. A family failing to recover from tragic loss of a husband and father. The simple car crash device could seem hackneyed and their house, minimal grey and drab, well, what I'm saying is the tropes are all there. The spooky kid, a conduit for the unseen terror that lurks and the consuming madness it brings. What's real, what's fiction, as the mother's sanity unravels. It's fun to get mixed up in the fantasy, but there's something much more interesting in looking at what's driving this, the mother's depression, delusion, anxiety, sleep deprivation, parental inability, it's all fuel for a sometimes formulaic thriller, but one that still works really well. I'm never keen on the supernatural, but when it has some anchor in reality I'm on board and this walks the tightrope just right. It helps that both Essie Davies and Noah Wiseman work so well, especially as the screen is largely theirs and theirs alone and it's nice to see a film that knows how to play to its strengths.

The Babadook Review,"The film ""The Babadook"" takes an unique twist at horror that may not seem appealing to your every day horror movie thrill seekers. Jennifer Kent tosses away the modern scare tactics like jump scares and horrifying faces and instead gives us a psychological thriller. The film relies on an eerie atmosphere which is created through the use of lighting and shadows, creating darkness, leaving the audience in a constant state of paranoia. What really contributed to this constant paranoia was the effective use of sounds throughout the film. Even when Amelia was reading from the book, we hear this ambient sound which seems like it was used to unnerve the audience, preparing us for fright. From the skittering of the monster along the walls to the absolutely terrifying shriek of BA BA DOOK DOOK, the sounds really leave a chilling impression on the audience. In my opinion, an interesting concept is that the monster seems to be a symbolic reflection on Amelia's depression which increasingly developed as her mental state worsened from taking care of her annoyingly pretentious child. Overall, Jennifer Kent chooses not to scare you with stereotypical creepy images or noises but instead haunts you through the psychological decay of a grieving single mother.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The good reviews must be a scam! This film is bad... and I mean really bad!,"I am genuinely shocked and confused at all the high ratings for this film. Most well-known review websites have given this film very high ratings and the only reasoning I can see behind this is there is some sort of scam going on to get as many people to go and watch this awful film in the cinema around Halloween time as possible. I rarely go to the cinema and feel this disappointed and robbed of my money but the film simply wasn't good. Is there a possibility critics get paid extra to give films good reviews? I don't know... but from this day forward I will not be referring to critics websites as they either don't have a clue what they're talking about or there is a scam going on in the film industry. I'm particularly disappointed with Rotten Tomatoes who gave it a whopping 96%. This is very misleading, confusing and just plain wrong!The film started okay and the acting was half decent but I spent most of the film waiting for the plot to kick in and to get at least half a scare but nothing! The acting swiftly deteriorated as did the story line. I have seen many horror films before and I am normally quite positive about most films in general but i could not rate this film higher than 2/10 simply for the reason it was badly made. Not only does it copy the basic themes of so many recent horror films such as the conjuring but it portrays them terribly.PLEASE don't waste your money seeing this film at the cinema and don't even bother getting the DVD. If you know someone unfortunate enough to have already purchased it then watch it together so you can witness how unscary and badly directed it is for yourself... then burn it together and never speak of it again.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good Acting, But Not Enough Scares","After hearing so much about ""The Babadook,"" I finally decided to watch it, but honestly, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I went in expecting to be really scared, but it didn't quite deliver on that front. There were only a few scenes that made me a little scared, but overall, it felt like nothing much really happened.The story is about a mother and her son dealing with a creepy book that seems to bring a monster into their lives. The setup was interesting, and I thought it had a lot of potential. However, as the movie went on, it just didn't keep up the tension or deliver enough scares for my taste.I did like the performances, especially from the actress who played the mother. She did a great job showing her struggle and fear. The son was also good, and their relationship felt real. But despite their strong acting, the movie itself felt slow and lacking in action.There were a couple of moments where I jumped, and the atmosphere was creepy at times. However, those moments were too few and far between. I kept waiting for something big to happen, but it never really did. It was more about the psychological aspects and the characters' emotions than about actual horror.Overall, ""The Babadook"" just didn't do it for me. While it had some creepy moments and strong performances, it wasn't quite the scare-fest I was hoping for. It's worth a watch if you're curious, but don't expect to be on the edge of your seat the whole time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Well-Crafted Film,"""The Babadook"" is undeniably a well-crafted film. Essie Davis's commanding performance, together with Jennifer Kent's direction, carries the film. Its examination of mental illness and grief, as well as its skilful use of atmosphere and suspense, are other positive aspects.Yet, despite the film's cleverness, I couldn't help but feel like I had seen it all before. It didn't leave me feeling satisfied after the credits rolled, although I recognize that this is more of a personal issue and many others seem to have a different reaction to the film.Despite my own lack of satisfaction with ""The Babadook,"" it's clear that it has many strengths.Ultimately, if you enjoy psychological horror films with a deep emotional core, you may find The Babadook a compelling and memorable viewing experience, but it's just not for me.Rating: 7/10 (Good, It Gets the Job Done)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""You can't get rid of The Babadook""","My god this movie was such a breath of fresh air when it came out. A movie that's scary without resorting to the hyper-realistic grisliness that so many bigger budget scare fests lean so hard into, and a deep metaphor about trauma and depression come together with great acting from Essie Davis and phenomenal direction from Jennifer Kent, who also penned the screenplay.From that great aforementioned writing/directing from Kent, you very early on find great annoyance in the young character of Sam, which is then brilliantly turned on its head at the end of the film. I absolutely love when a writer can convincingly make you despise a character only to later make you genuinely empathize and worry for them.The musical score from Jed Kurzel is beautifully ominous without being overbearing at any point, a lesson I wish more horror movie composers would learn. The pop-up book itself is one of the stars of the film for me, being one of the more ingenious and macabre ways to introduce the ""monster"" of the movie that I've seen to date.And as for Mister Babadook, I understand that to some degree that very little we see of him has a lot to do with budget reasons, but it is (intentionally or otherwise) a stroke of genius. The little we do see of him is creepy as hell and then, magically, our brains take over and make him twice as scary.

"This is a movie about humans, not monsters.","The acting is simply fantastic. The movie solely evolves around the relationship between the mother and the son and they spend most of their time in the house. With other actors, it could have been a disaster. In that case, it was brilliant.The descent into madness is illustrated in a poignant way. It is dark, sad and oppressing, primarily demonstrated through the dull colours, the succession of scenes where the characters sleep or talk about sleeping, the insertion of television footage and the amount of time they spend wandering in the living room in pyjamas. All supernatural elements put aside, it was a relevant and heart-breaking rendition of mourning, mental disease and depression. This is a movie about humans, not monsters.The Babadook is a vibrant homage to early cinema (such as George Mélies) and, most specifically, the aesthetic of German expressionism. He is probably the best new villain to have hit the screens in a long time! You see just enough of him to have a good idea of what he looks like, but never enough to completely unfold the mystery.The only downside, in my opinion, is the unnecessary use of possession movies tropes towards the end- convulsions, shaking furniture, etc. It all felt a little over the top, and even a desecration of its slow-paced, very original approach to the horror genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There's Depth in Horror...,"If you live under a rock and haven't heard, THE BABADOOK (Australia, 2014) is supposed to be the greatest horror in the past ten years. Even THE EXORCIST's William Friedkin said it's ""the most frightening movie I've ever seen."" Coming from the director of what many consider to be the scariest movie of all time, that's saying something. Still, I was skeptical; though my intrigue was peaked just enough to order first time feature director Jennifer Kent's film.If you didn't know, a successful crowdfunding campaign earned Kent a little over $34,000, which apparently went to the art department. Beforehand, the Australian acted in several projects, and directed two shorts and a television episode. I have not seen her previous work, but after watching THE BABADOOK, I know there are many features in her future.THE BABADOOK stars Essie Davis (Amelia) as a struggling single mother with a rambunctious and creepy son, played by Noah Wiseman (Samuel). Davis is absolutely phenomenal, whether she's sheepish, scared, or on the psycho-mom warpath. Wiseman is equally fantastic as he goes from a socially inept persona to a kid on a mission. In fact, regardless of the role, every actor delivered. It's clear they all had the required skills, but Kent definitely got them to bring their collective best to every take.To close out the trinity, cinematographer Radek Ladczuk brings a remarkable balance of light and dark, along with some interesting camera angles, to create a foreboding atmosphere that never wanes. Thanks to this big three of directing, acting, and photography, each scene is loaded with top-flight layers to keep us focused on the screen, and ready to march forward with each character and whatever situation awaits them.Most of the action takes place in Amelia's home as she and her son face the uncanny in the guise of Babadook. Sure, the name sounds silly, but it's an anagram for ""a bad book"", and Babadook does not play. The most interesting element of the narrative is how the whacked out child and semi-stable mom change mental roles as the film progresses. Mom may not be able to handle the uncanny, but Samuel steps up as if he's waited his whole young life to prove himself – and this is his coming of age moment.As we all know, movies work or don't work depending upon what we bring to the film. Sure, many scoff or outright dismiss THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY for several reasons, but both movies worked for me (especially PA) because they both played on my childhood fears and nightmares. THE BABADOOK may work on those who have young children. When they fear for Samuel, they actually fear what might happen to their child. And as parents, they probably fear holding onto themselves in the face of ""the other"", much as Amelia does. If so, one can understand all the over-hype and five star ratings. Yes, I felt a couple of little jolts, but nothing substantial, and I never really feared for the characters or my own sanity. After all, at this level, what would really happen to a child in a major independent film?Although I have a couple of questions regarding the end of the tale, and although fear didn't sweep me away, the overall execution is enough to warrant 3.5 if not 4 stars. I lean towards the latter because of Kent, Davis, Wiseman, Ladczuk, and even Jed Kurzel's music, which tied in seamlessly with the story. Overall, THE BABADOOK is a great dramatic horror, but nothing to keep you awake at night.More horror at www.crashpalaceproductions.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolute waste of effort and creativity,"Before watching the film I had read reviews which adored the film absolutely. After watching the film, I have come to the conclusion that this is even worse than 'The Happening' (which was the worst movie ever before Babadook for me).It is a challenge for every filmmaker who makes a horror film to employ techniques that have not been used before or else the scare, would in fact not be a scare and would be a straight rip off that audience might have already experienced in other movies. While Babadook tries to avoid these clichéd techniques (which it still does at one point or another), it has absolutely nothing new to offer to the genre. Rhymes and childlike antagonist isn't exactly what the horror genre needs. It needs narratives that play with our emotions.Through out the movie, it seems they've tried hard not to scare us with some experimental shots and editing (straight from music videos and experimental for the genre only) every now and then that I seriously wished to God such style would serve some sort of purpose and help a huge plot twist that is going to help makes sense of what has happened and why the movie was constructed this particular way and probably leave us a scared as well. Well nothing of that sort happened and all it was an experimental waste.So while it is always good to avoid clichés, offering nothing is the worst thing you can do with one's time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Masterpiece.,"Great movie. Will be a cult classic before long I'll wager. If you like jumps every 15 seconds then not your kind of scary movie id suggest. The Babadook is subtle and very unnerving throughout with the occasional in your face scare but only at the right moments. It is a beautiful piece of film making, well acted and considering the small budget a triumph for the small players in the industry particularly in Australia. I think this film deserves an overall IMDb rating of about 8 which is at the higher end for this genre, I'm scoring it a 10 however, to balance the 7.2 it currently has which I feel is a little under par for this thoroughly entertaining film. I cannot think of much I don't like about this film. Maybe if they had a few more million, a visual effect here or there could have been a bit better but that's about it really.

However, having just watched it I was extremely disappointed and was struggling to watch the whole movie as I found myself bored and couldn't bare the acting.The actors in this movie were just so annoying. It was a struggle to watch the boy and his mother, I just generally couldn't get over of how bad of actors they were which is why I'm very confused with how high of rating this film got. There were some brilliant shots in this movie, emphasizing how weak the mother is. I do no think that this movie should be classed as a horror, it had a very minimal scare factor and would much more suit the genre of a thriller. The character and voice of the Babadook also didn't cut it for me. It just seemed too fake and was not scary for me at all. I thought the idea of the book was really good, it was very intriguing and probably the only bit in the movie that I thought was spooky.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Inspired, But Inspiring","TL;DR:If you are a fan of psychological and supernatural horror and are interested to see one of *the* films that sparked many more like it, then The Babadook is worth giving a chance.Extended review:Yes, The Babadook has its influences, but, on the contrary, it is influential. It has aroused more attention and care to horror, particularly the psychological sub-genre and intertwining of grief and supernatural/surrealistic/fantastical natures. Doused in fun clichés and memorable metaphors, I found myself mostly immersed in the experience.The cinematography and dreamlike Tim Burton style were on-point. Stylistically, this is among my favorite horror films hands down. I appreciate both the brightness and drabness.While this is a very serious film and I did take it as such, there were borderline laughable moments due to choppy editing, exaggerated and ear-r*ping sound design (much of which was great, but there were some moments that were far too over-the-top, and even if that was intentional, it pulls you out of the initial effectiveness of the film), lackluster visuals (though the vast majority are fantastically phantasmal), and restatement after restatement.Sure, it's undoubtedly sloppy. There should have been changes to the script and structure before heading into filming as it made much of the last act repetitive and sore. The ending even could have had one minor change to callback and I would've preferred it. The runtime could have been extended for an even slower burn. We could have become more acquainted with repression and triggers. The child actor, Noah Wiseman, is certainly annoying (which he's meant to be) and while he wasn't believable at points, he still managed to tug at my heartstrings. Essie Davis was quite great, as was mostly everyone else in the film.In terms of mental health, the grief and trauma was approached mostly* accurately.If you have not seen the film and are curious about it, I certainly suggest you give it a watch!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing short of absolutely terrific. I saw very frightened.,"I have a rule about my movie collection: whenever I see a horror film that truly terrifies me, a picture that makes me instantly regret sitting in the movie theater because I get that icy grip of fright, I have to add it to my collection. I will also consider a horror movie worthy of finding itself a spot on my shelf if it has a really clever premise, or some dynamite interpretations of a familiar horror trope. Even great performances or some smart references to the movies I like could easily make a movie worthy. ""The Babadook"" is most certainly worthy of finding itself an immortal spot in my roster and if you want a truly frightening and very intelligent horror film, do no miss out on this one.Before I get to the premise of the film, let me ask you this. Have you ever heard someone tell you they consider their pet to be a real member of their family? I'd say that applies to my cat, but sometimes he really makes me angry. He knocks things over, wakes me up when I want to keep sleeping, I have to clean out his litter box and don't even get me started when he scratches me. I love the beast, but there are days when he infuriates me. Imagine that you had a pet like that. Adorable at times, but mostly it's an animal that misbehaved. Now imagine that one day, you hear a knock on your door and through the peephole, you see a monster, the stuff from your nightmares. It tells you that it will never stop haunting you and that if the lights in your house go out, it's coming in through the shadows. You only have one chance of saving yourself... open the door and feed it your pet. Now, on a regular day, you might tell the monster to go jump off a bridge because you love Mr. Whiskers over here... but what if at that particular moment your feline happened to knock over a very valuable dish your grandmother gave you, and it shattered into a million pieces... wouldn't you be tempted to get two birds with one stone by giving that monster your bad cat? This movie contains that kind of complexity and those kinds of scary ideas.This film is about two things. The first is about a mother (Essie Davis as Amelia) who's at the end of her rope. Work is not particularly stimulating, her heart is still broken over the loss of her husband and even worse, she lives with a monster in the form of her son, Sam (Noah Wiseman). He's always misbehaving, destroying things, embarrassing her, pushing away her friends and family with his tantrums and inappropriate little stories. It's enough to drive you crazy! What this movie is also about is a book called ""Mr. Babadook"". Once you read it, you've been marked. You think the creepy illustrations inside are frightening? It's nothing compared to seeing that nightmare fuel of a figure sneaking out of the shadows and getting ready to do who knows what to you.Having lived with a misbehaving little boy, as well as several siblings I can assure you that children are sweet sometimes, but they can also be demons. This movie shows a child at his absolute worst. There were times where I didn't know where the movie was going because I wasn't sure if this was a true horror story with a monster summoned from who knows where and ready to do unimaginable terrors onto this poor family, or if it was documentation of what happens when a stressed mind finally snaps. The movie keeps you guessing throughout and it's a great way to keep the terror flowing continuously. Is it a combination of factors that makes Amelia see this demon, meaning that a normal solution could be found... or is it an actual monster, at which point there is very little, if any hope? What tends to frighten me are the simple things: a white face looking through your window in the middle of the night, a man with a saw running after you for no reason, the dark, things I love being turned against me. ""The Babadook"" is a great example of a simple premise expanded upon enough to make a full-length story without giving away too much. What if there actually is something hiding in the closet at night when all the lights are out? What if believing in monsters was the key to making it go away, but acknowledging it meant confirming an even more terrifying fact, that monsters ARE REAL? What if you realize one day that you actually do hate your son, and that you're a bad parent? Those are what I call primal fears. Anyone can be afraid of this, unlike something really specific, like sharks or spiders. I was totally engrossed in the story until it became overwhelming. I found myself gripping the arm rests of my chair very tightly multiple times and I screamed like a little girl at least once.On top of being effective and being a multi-layered movie, I admire ""The Babadook"" for having some terrific performances. Child actors often spell trouble, but Noah Wiseman is absolutely perfect here. I also thought that the movie had some really interesting points of character development throughout. How I felt about these people at the beginning was very different from what I felt at the end. Finally, I am so frightened of this movie that I absolutely must get myself a copy of the actual book that causes all of the terror. Will I ever read it? Not unless I want to skip out on some sleep, but the idea of owning it fascinates me. I thought it was inventive, intelligent, clever and truly horrifying. It's the best new horror film I've seen in a while. (Theatrical version on the big screen, March 26, 2015)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ba-BA-Ba Dook  Dook DOOK, The Story of the Bababook","There are movies that are loud and upfront with their horror, such as John Carpenter's Halloween. But then there are movies such as Jennifer Kent's The Babadook, that are very subtle about their terror playing off of ideas and concepts that leave a lasting impact hours after the film has ended. This is not meant to bash the wonderful slasher that is Halloween, but instead praises The Babadook for its supreme use of tension and atmosphere to terrify the audience.In this film, Essie Davis plays Amelia, a single mom caring for her young son named Samuel (Noah Wiseman) who is terrified of monsters, while at the same time dealing with her husband's death. One night Samuel picks the book Mister Babadook for Amelia to read, it talks about how the ""Babadook"" comes and scares kids. Both Amelia and Samuel appear to be terrified from the book, this initiates the beginning of their horrifying journey.Jennifer Kent has orchestrated a haunting film that leaves a lasting impressing. From the use of high and low-key lighting to amplify the tension to the brilliant quietness which haunts the film, each and every detail in the film help builds an overwhelming sense of suspense. As a critique, most horror films nowadays tend to overplay their shock factor or ""jump scares"" in their film. While this might be horrifying, it does not leave a lasting impression. The Babadook achieves a perfect balance between horror and terror, leading to an utterly terrifying masterpiece. I give Jennifer Kent's The Babadook a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Plays expertly on your fears,"I vividly remember as a child being afraid of the monsters in the wardrobe and at the end of my bed. This film plays expertly on those fears. It shows just how fragile a woman's mental health can be after a tragic life-changing incident. And it's so sad that her son is caught in the crossfire. Featuring 2 beautiful central performances, this film is highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Horror

The Babadook...What's Next?,"My Babadook Movie Review: By Suphie WesnerBabadook, well, what can I say? It is an interesting movie, no doubt. It has fairy-tale-like elements, as it is all based on a children's book gone sour. Really, it (the actual Babadook creature) looks a lot like a masked robber who has just finished robbing a bank. The old clichéd elements of ""combine storybook idyll, serenity, and child-like tranquility"" and ""utter horror, gore, and vileness"" work here to create a spine-tingling horror film. It is chilling from beginning to end: the themes of forbidden knowledge/fruit (from the actual action of the woman reading a children's book that is obviously inappropriate to her seven-year-old son's impressionable imagination) to the actual act of crossing the borderline of reality to the imperceptible really makes for a killer (pardon the pun) horror film that knocks the teeth out of many modern-day competitors. It is really scary, really engrossing, and really intriguing from the get-go; you quickly learn to care about the characters and how they are going to fare in the end, with this horrible monster on the loose.It is scary in itself, how, an innocent children's book, gets mocked, and in a sense, because this children's book gets mocked, it serves to mock the entire genre of scary children's books by saying that they are not just children's book but they can serve a larger function, representing true evil that lies underneath the world's exterior.The only parts to me that were reprehensible were the utterly predictable scenes where the crazed woman, possessed by the Babadook, kills the sweet white pooch, snapping its head back. I knew knew knew that that was going to happen. Other than that, it serves as a cheery element of mercy that the boy himself and that the woman herself (whom the second Babadook book predicted would kill herself, with a knife) do not get ""killed off"" by the Babadook, becoming not easy prey of the ghoulish robber and adulterer of souls, instead surviving, and with an eerie twist of capitulating to the Babadook by feeding him, who now lives in the basement, worms...Come to think of it, for animal-rights lovers, it would have been nice if the woman had killed herself, for killing her beloved dog, Samuel, who committed no sin except for noticing her odd behavior, but that wasn't in the cards for this film.I think that the scariest parts of the film were the times when the Babadook character actually showed up on her doorstep, wreaking havoc by his entrance into her holy household, with dire predictions of the bloodshed, vile sins, and unspeakable crimes that would ensue, due to the Babadook's wrath. Whence the Babadook's motives for his torment stem, are hard to come by, the movie does not explain them; he is just a torturer, an evil spirit. We know that the book just appeared on the boy's shelf one day, that is all we are told.All in all, it is a great film, with some really terrific terror plots, that do not fail to build up a slow-broiling suspense that slowly terrorizes but sucks you in because the overall story-line is built up so interestingly, you really care about the characters and what is fated to happen to them.This is because from the beginning we are shown the two characters Amelia and Sam, who are drawn closer together, necessarily, by a chain of horrible events which led to her husband's, and his father's, death (he died in a car accident on his way to deliver Amelia to the hospital, when she was pregnant with Sam). They really defend each other and stick up for each other; it is really a vision of true love.",,Anonymous,Horror
Almost perfect,"The Babadook was almost the perfect horror movie. It is well acted, well written, well directed etc. It builds the tension slowly, it builds it well and it never relies on cheap tricks and jump scares. It's perfect... or it would have been if not for the ending. It's not that it was bad, it's just that it was, well, odd. On the positive side, I definitely did not see the ending coming but on the downside, I didn't think it was a very good ending either.Still a really good movie, still absolutely worth watching and still worth recommending to anyone who loves their horror movies scary instead of silly. And hell, maybe you might actually like the ending!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Let It In,"An experience that each one of us can relate to is loss. Jennifer Kent's, The Babadook, forces us to engage in the challenging aftermath after losing a husband and a father years after the accident. The exhausting toll this tragedy has on a widowed, single mother and the isolating development of a hyperactive child in a single parent home creates an immediate, empathetic relationship that has the audience feeling desperately sad and vulnerable. The dark and dull mise-en- scene brings to life the gloomy, melancholy demeanor of Sam and Amelia's home that leave the two characters plagued off from the people who love them most. The draping and dramatic shadows that cover every inch of the house encloses the monster lurking inside, patiently waiting for the right time to attack. I applaud Jennifer Kent for creating such a possessive, haunting, and original type of monster that feeds off our deepest fears. I also want to acknowledge Essie Davis' undeniably brilliant portrayal of Amelia's character development from beginning to end. This psychoanalytical horror divides the audience's perception of what we want to see and what we actually see. The Babadook is not a film filled with gore that will leave you petrified and gasping for air, but the compelling suspense and creepy atmosphere will leave you evaluating what scares you more: the monsters under your bed or the monsters in your head.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

So scary that I spent half of it hidden under the duvet.

This is the most refreshing awesome classic horror that I've seen ever,"I will get to the slight problems I have with the movie in a second, but firstly, I've got to seriously praise this film. One of the things I really really love about this film is it does not have the incredibly stupid jump scare thing that almost all horror films have. Now that alone doesn't make a horror good. So, how did the film handle the alternative to jump scares? Absolutely amazingly. The tension was built so freaken well. We didn't get jump scares. We got a whole lot better. Whenever the Babadook appeared, we saw him in his completeness and saw him approach steadily, with every increasing intensity coupled with great sound effects (I will address the voice in a sec) and truly great acting from Essie Davis and an awesome child performance from Noah Wiseman. Seriously, the great child acting really stood out for me. Now, to get into the details, let's talk about the plot. While you can predict that the end will be that the monster will be cleared up or dead or whatever (I won't spoil what actually happens), the story really isn't about that. The monster, and how the characters develop over the story (and seriously, TALK ABOUT THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT) all come together to produce this great metaphor for depression and great study into how human behavior in cases of extreme stress and tight circumstances. And while the overall plot is 'predictable', the specific scenes are not, and all of them are set up with great tension and buildup and terror, with many moments legit taking you off guard. There are many great scenes that are stuck in my mind and to me make movie history (like the scenes with the reading of the book, the scenes when a certain character gets crazy; I won't mention more cuz you should see for yourself), and all of this makes for a great story. Now, I also mentioned the characters and performances, and boy do these aspects shine in this film. The kid is actually, while incredibly annoying at times (though, to the discerning viewer, understably so), pretty cool with how he protects himself and his mother and how he is actually a good kid and a lot deeper than the viewer might initially think. In fact, by the end of the film, you go through a steady and complete 180 on the kid, and I always love that, because it reveals that humans are a lot more complex that we give them credit for. And the mother as well, how she deals with stress and depression, how she is gradually spiraling downwards and gets more and more desperate is so well written, so well directed, I can't praise this enough. They felt real, and are leaps beyond so many of these stupid horror movie characters that the mainstream audience has gotten used to. There are no moments where you think ""Why the hell is that character doing that? Why are they so stupid?"" No! None of that, and that is so dang refreshing. I loved it. And is this movie scary? Hell yes. For three days afterward, I kept imagining the Babadook in my closet, or on the walls, or in the darkness where I couldn't see, which is crazy cuz all we ever see is his outline! (And just on a tangent, I love the name Babadook. It is kind of catchy and iconic and really added to the character for me :).) And while the Babadook himself is really creepy due to his creepy smile and very large brooding figure, the reason the film is scary is the great cinematography (I mean wow, I always have my gripes of how something is shot in a film, but with this, almost none) and great sound effects and audio. I've mentioned, but I defiantly mention it again. THERE ARE NO STUPID JUMP SCARES! THIS IS ACTUALLY LEGITIMATELY WELL DIRECTED! WOO!! Now, to the issues. While I loved the fact that this film completely avoided a lot of clichés, it went a little bit too far at the end in not completely showing the Babadook. I felt like while the final scenes were powerful, it would've been even better if we actually saw the Babadook and him really physically harming the characters and them being in even more peril that what they already were. Also, there are a few characters that don't really fit too well in this world that is set up. For instance, there is the friend of the mother. Now, it is actually pretty realistic that she would venture into resent of the mother with how long she has been depressed and aloof, and especially how she would resent her child, there are times when she went a bit overboard, and it kind of felt like it wasn't really her but just how the rest of the scene was. What I mean is, while everything that happens with the kid and the scene is intense, some parts of the scene are a bit exaggerated so they meet with this intensity and at times, this is over the top. There is also the kind of cliché of how the police officers won't help her, even though, at the very least, they would superficially investigate the case to satisfy such a desperate woman. However, the good far far outweighs the bad and the good is further boosted by this film being soooo refreshing from all the horror we've seen lately that I can't help but give this film a near perfect score. The score is 4.5/5, but really, it is more a 4.9/5, and this is one of my favorite horror films.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This shows that most horror films are best made indie style, few work with big budget studios","There always seems to be a common trend for the horror films that truly scare its audience. Some examples from the past several decades are films like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Halloween (1978), The Blair Witch Project (1999) and Paranormal Activity (2007). They were all films with meager budgets but received positive reviews critically and box office draws commercially. They also had green lit sequels not many people enjoyed, except for the hardcore followers. There's a subtle difference between making a film independently Vs with the help of a studio. Unless the studio really believes that the director knows what they're doing, most of the time studios will intervene at some point and begin tampering with the director's vision. This leads to cuts, edits, reshoots and changes that most directors do not intend on doing thus fully altering their dream product. Meanwhile for indie filmmakers, directors have a much more limited cabinet of tools such as money (mainly) and resources, yet there's no studio to get involved.Making her directorial/screen writing debut, Jennifer Kent heads this Australian horror film that demonstrates that most horror films continue to be more effective when made independently than working with big budget studios. The story is about a widow named Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) being stalked by an ominous entity known as The Babadook that's making their lives more stressed than it already was. Being that there have been multiple times when films do poorly because the writer to the script was also the director, it's surprising to see how this movie escapes most of those blunders. The majority of the surrounding subplots are presented for the right reasons and help the viewer understand how they affect the main characters. Also the writing barely, if any at all contains the typical horror tropes one would expect to see in your everyday mainstream ghoul flick. One area that stands out as none productive to the plot, is the subplot of Amelia's coworker Robbie (Daniel Henshall) who initially feels like he wants to be with her but it is quickly dropped half way through. Once realized, it didn't feel necessary to begin with.There's also the case of continuity errors and why some things are left unchecked. Yet, these are things that usually happen in every film and it's not the most abundant here. If there's anything else that doesn't make sense it's the antagonist's motives. Clearly heard in the movie, the character states ""give me the boy"", but for what? What's the purpose? Some backstory or mythology would be appreciated for such an iconic figure. This is it for gripes though, the characters are likable and the audience will care for them and the situations they are put into - specifically dealing with sweet neighbors like Mrs. Roach (Barbara West) and the cautious Aunt Claire (Hayley McElhinney). Even The Babadook (played by Tim Purcell) himself is somewhat likable because of just how strange and demonic the character is and how he goes about scaring the living daylights out of this family. The method that The Babadook goes about doing his business is not exactly the newest of things but it certainly is effective.Initially, The Babadook is introduced via bedtime story book that has pop-up figures and its own little nursery rhyme. However as the pages continue to turn, the images become darker and darker foreshadowing possible events. Mind you that's just the beginning. The Babadook is a creature that loves to play mind games. Its movement is rigid, makes cockroach or cicada-like sounds and its voice is raspy almost like its speech being choked out. The design is also something noteworthy too, resembling that of a scarecrow. The violence is not hefty either. There are a couple moments that look painful but nothing that is on the dismemberment level. Jennifer Kent's direction relies more on scaring her viewers by giving them minimal elements to work with. That includes just seeing things for a moment and then disappearing or focusing on a simple object that may have a bigger purpose. It's those kinds of scenes that can give a viewer chills because of the insecurity that it generates.Radek Ladczuk as the cameraman for this production made good use of his surroundings. The house Amelia and her son live in, is exactly what other characters mention it as - depressing. It's a house of melancholy colors that accentuate the mood and tone of the story ten fold. What's best about Ladczuk's work is treating the camera as if they were eyes. By this, if the camera moves in on a character and a sound is made, the camera stops completely. After a brief pause the camera moves again. It actually creates more tension in the scene. Ladczuk's other method is not moving the camera at all. There are some shots where the lens just focuses on a dark hallway or a shadow of a stairway railing. It gives the feeling that there's something else inside the house. The musical score composed by Jed Kurzel is surprisingly effective even though much of the film is silent. There are some intrinsic tunes provided by thumping timpani and bells. It's a foreboding sound that will definitely create uneasiness. Plus, no jump scare stings!Rarely do mainstream horror films produce such chills when it comes to ghosts and midnight ghouls, but not here. It's unfortunate that it still has some problems either having a useless subplot or motivations left unexplained but that doesn't stop it in its tracks. With sympathetic characters, an iconic villain, unconventional cinematography, direction and music, this indie horror film surpasses several other horror properties popular studios have exploited.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is undoubtedly one of the greatest psychological horrors EVER MADE.,"Honestly, I cannot fully explain why this movie deserves the highest level of endearment, because I believe YOU have to experience the movie yourself to fully appreciate it for the masterpiece it is.

An exceptionally made flick on a showstring budget,"An exceptionally well made flick on a showstring budget. Everything in this movie does its job. The story is basically a yarn on ""the boogeyman"" tale, but this goes much further, and more personal. I must point out that this is a thinking persons horror movie that uses camera work, slight music, acting (that forgotten art) and story to scare you. No gore needed to frighten you around the corners of the house. I suppose I should just simply state the plot: A single mother and her slightly off son live in a suburb of Australia (I think Adelaide is a suburb, I am new to this Continent). The son believes there is a dark force haunting them known as the ""Babadook"" which happens to be a quite disturbing children's book they have in their house. Well of course the mother dismisses this as nonsense. Well, we know from other movies what happens when evil spirits aren't believed in...The plot centers around the mother (played wonderfully by Essie Davis) and her spiral into madness. The book almost describes out the twists she will take on her journey. Every element of this movie is paid such detail, that it borders ""genius"". Keep in mind this movie was a kickstarter funded film, made on a 30,000 dollar budget. After watching, all I can say is it screams ""Get Jennifer Kent (writer/director) a budget and let's see what she can do"" Definitely something that any drama/horror fan should be checking out. 7,2/10.

Australian filmmakers remain on top for horror and psychological thrillers.,"Its odd to think that film audiences pay good money to experience fear, confusion and even physical discomfort. Maybe its to heighten the pleasures of everyday normality after the show. This film is an unusual hybrid of two closely related but different genres for which Australian filmmakers are acclaimed around the world: the horror and the psychological thriller. The former emphasises bloodshed and the supernatural, the latter leans toward forms of madness with bizarre and deadly outcomes. The difference is important because The Babadook (2014) is devised to be both, and each genre leads to very different interpretations of what we see.Its a straightforward story about a single mother Amelia whose husband died on the way to the hospital when her son Samuel was born. Amelia is finding it increasingly hard to raise Sam and even his cousins do not want to be near him on his seventh birthday. He believes that a scary Dr Seuss-type character called the Babadook creeps out of the storybook that his mother reads to him at night. This is where the twin film genres diverge. The para-normal happenings can be seen as classic horror, with no logical explanation necessary, just a complete suspension of disbelief. On the other hand, we may be seeing a classic case study in delayed bereavement psychosis, and everything we see is happening only in Amelia's mind.The anxiety-inducing lighting and camera-work carry the atmospherics of the story, but the acting performance of Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman are simply outstanding. Essie transitions between a struggling but likable mother to a woman well beyond the brink of utter despair to complete madness. For his age, Noah shows an extraordinary gift for acting and those huge innocent eyes only accentuate the terror we see. Both actors have the critical element of plausibility that sustains the gradually escalating tension throughout the film. If you are a fan of either fear genre, this is one of the best in the current crop.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

They picked a subject people usually find it silly and turned it into a nightmare. The lighting in the movie was really smart, so was the color correction they picked for the entire sequence. The idea of Samuel being an annoying brat is also really funny, since we all start the movie hating the kid, but we end up rooting for him.

eerie atmosphere,"Not bad at all but let me say that not every horror buff will like this kind of horror. It do has it moments but it also is a slow builder. There's not that much of horror going on in fact but it's the way it is shot and the use of lighting that gives a special feeling and don't forget the performance of the two main leads.The story itself is rather simple. A mother and her annoying child are living together when the father has died by accident. But their child is a real pain in the *ss at home and at school, so the mother decide to read him a book, The Babadook. It's some kind of weird book and the child gets obsessed with it and start to see things but after a while the mother does too, the babadook is alive.It's once the book comes alive in their mind that some creepy shots and eerie atmospheres appear and that's what makes this flick great. Not only that, when the mother is watching TV you also see shots of other classics and the Black Sabbath's (1963) most scary moment is here also to watch.The Babadook is a flick that must have it from it's creepy moments and not for the gore (which isn't in it) like other horrors. As said earlier, not for everybody but once seen you will not forget it, or you will find it eerie or you will find it rather boring, the choice is yours.Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Terrifyingly Terrific Masterpiece of Horror.,"Concept: A mother and her son deal with a supernatural force that threatens the small shell of a family that they have left, along with their very lives.Acting: The acting in this movie for a horror film is extraordinary. Essie Davis, the mother, gives an Oscar worthy performance here. Her decent into madness is truly unsettling and terrifying. Noah Wisemann does a superb job as the son. Starting out in this film you sympathize heavily with the mother and less with the son. In fact you start out hating the son because he's so annoying, and honestly I feel this is done on purpose. It causes the movie to feel deeply unsettling. It's really well done, especially a kind of role reversal later, when you start to identify with the son more. Really great job by this very small cast.Cinematography: There are a lot of really cool creepy shots in this movie. It's really cool to see jumps in the camera at times, kind of like stutters but not really, it's hard to describe honestly. Some shots also mess with your mind a little but in a subtle way. You might possibly see the babadook in the background, sometimes shadows look like him, sometimes you see delusions through the eyes of the mother. It's really a clever job. Later on I'll make more of a point on this, but it supports this idea that the babadook is kind of a thinking person's horror movie.Direction: Jennifer Kent made one hell of a directorial debut in cinema here. The way the story is structured and how so much is done with so little is really to be admired. In some ways it's a throwback to old horror movies and in some ways its new entirely. Jennifer Kent knows what makes a great horror film and that's suspense and Dread. There are no jump scares as you know them in this film, all the terror comes from deeply unsettling material and deeply unnerving content. I feel like Jennifer Kent wanted to do 2 things with this film 1: make the next truly great horror film.2: make that horror film so much more than just some horror film.She accomplished both. This is a story truly about grief with a monster setting or perhaps even allegory. And it truly left me unnerved after my first viewing, even my second and third and even now it still truly creeps me out.Score: The score is relatively small and it's kind of refreshing. It adds to the suspense. What is really impressive here is the sound design. Every single sound plays a role in building tension, Kent Realizes this, which I applaud her for. It's so well done that I think it's the best use of sound in film that I've heard in years.Opinion: I truly love, adore and respect this movie, it isn't done true justice without watching it in the dark and with a good sound system (whether that's headphones or a theater/home theater set up). For my review I watched the blu ray with some surround sound headphones and it really got to me even though it's my 4th time seeing it. I think this should be the ideal for all horror films to strive for. It's definitely in my top 5 horror films. Everything about is great. I don't think its for the normal horror audience that's marketed towards now but this is a true horror film. Say what you want about it, love it or hate it, I truly believe this movie is what horror is about, not cheap jump scares or any kind of scares for that matter but deep unsettling dread.Watch-ability: All colors of the rainbow. After one viewing I don't know how many people would want to see it again except for horror buffs. But I feel like horror buffs who love the genre would truly appreciate this film and re-watch it for all the little nuances and symbolism.Overall Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Babadook,"Horror movies are tough. Genre enthusiasts seem to constantly be reminiscing about the old days while new fans are enthralled with what they see, occasionally ignorant to what came before. The Babadook, the 2014 film by Jennifer Kent was heralded by many as the best horror film of 2014. As a horror enthusiast, I was excited to see the ""new take on horror"" that people were calling The Babadook. After my first viewing of The Babadook, I was simply disappointed, the more I thought about the film, however, the more I began to actively dislike it. The film stars Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman as a mother and son team who rely on each other as the only family they have left when suddenly their lives are interrupted by an evil spirit who seeks to possess those it comes into contact with. ""This premise of two people solely reliant upon each other who then have to deal with a possession sounds a bit like Rosemary's Baby,"" I thought to myself, making me even more eager to begin the film. I was wrong--so very wrong, and although I hesitate to say anyone else was wrong who called this a ""new"" horror film, I definitely don't see the hype surrounding it. I found The Babadook to not only be a poor excuse for a horror movie--it really never picks a genre, and that's fine but a film calling itself a horror movie should be, but a poor film altogether. Just add this one to the list of films I don't understand their widespread appeal.Amelia (Essie Davis) is drudging through life as a single mother to her only son after losing her husband in a car accident on the day her son was born on the way to the hospital. Emotional exhaustion and depression has seemed to take over Amelia's life. Despite her dismal existence, she seems content to live in her somber solitude refusing to make plans or leave the house much. Amelia's son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is a large part of why they never leave the house; he has managed to ostracize all those around him, including his aunt and cousin with his behavior. Samuel makes weapons and takes them out of the house, he yells and screams, and is odd and unpleasant to be around. Despite his many behavior problems at school, Amelia always takes his side against authorities because Samuel knows exactly when to act affectionate towards his mother, manipulating her at every turn. Once Samuel is kicked out of another school, again, Amelia is at the end of her rope and decides to keep him home for awhile while trying to find another school for him to attend. One night before bed, Amelia reads Samuel a book she has never seen before about a monster. Unsettled after reading such a book, Amelia begins to find traces of the supernatural monster in her home. Initially refusing to believe in a spirit possessing her home, Amelia eventually realizes The Babadook has entered she and her son's lives and is refusing to leave.""A psychological horror about a single mother who becomes possessed by a monster that wills her to kill her 6-year old son."" That's how The Babadook was described on its own Kickstarter page, that's not what was delivered to the audience, however. I fail to see the psychological horror element of the film, and that is my favorite horror sub-genre. What was psychological was the fact that more than a horror film, The Babadook is a case study on how debilitating PTSD can be. Another struggle I have is that the Babadook is only in half the film. I prefer a director shows rather than tells, so it's not a problem on its own that we rarely see the monster in this film, as long as we are given the atmosphere of the monster. The problem is, instead of a monster's presence being established all we really get is a series of uncomfortable situations that could easily have been the doing of Amelia's out of control child. The Babadook more clearly exists as a family drama showing the deeply engrained problems between a mother and her son. The relationship between Amelia and Samuel is toxic, abusive, and enabling. The two share almost no mutual respect for each other, as they are each entrenched in their own life position to actively participate in the lives of each other. Amelia is run down, as single mothers often are, but to never accept or seek help for her son's defiance is digging her own overwhelmed grave. Despite being heralded as a unique take on horror, there seems to exist little evidence of such. The look of The Babadook appears to be the love child of Nosferatu and Freddy Krueger, so nothing new there. In fact, seeing the Babadook proves to be thoroughly underwhelming. Some horror standbys are utilized such as the fully-clothed bath, the flickering electricity, and the dog being able to ""sense"" the demonic presence in the air. The nursery rhyme score has also run its rounds in the horror genre. The atmosphere said to be created throughout the film appears to borrow from German expressionism, but the bleak colors aren't enough to caputre that style, nor do they add to the atmosphere of the film, they simply make the picture dull. With no character enjoying an arc to their story, without any standout performances, and devoid of any real scares from a largely absent ""monster"", I certainly hope this isn't what horror as a genre has devolved into.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
You're Entertainment Level will Be Based on How Scary You Find It,"The Babadook (2014)** (out of 4)Australian horror film about a mother (Essie Davis) living with her young son (Noah Wiseman) and both are still suffering from the violent death of her husband seven years earlier. The boys is haunted by an overactive imagination but things take a turn for the worse when a book called Mister Babadook shows up and soon a monster too.THE BABADOOK has pretty much taken over the horror community with some calling it the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST. I'm curious, why does every new scary movie get the label ""scariest movie since THE EXORCIST?"" Why not THE SHINING or some more recent scary movie? Either way, sadly THE BABADOOK ended up being one of the most disappointing horror movies in recent memory for a number of reasons. The biggest is the fact that I really didn't find a single scene scary or intense. Obviously with a movie like this the quality level is going to depend on whether or not it scares you and sadly this one just didn't do the trick.More on that in a bit but I actually thought the first forty-five minutes or so of the movie were good. This portion of the film is actually more of a family drama as we're really given a lot of character development as we see the mother struggling with the death of her husband but we also see her struggle being a single mother and having to deal with an unhealthy child. I thought this stuff was actually well-written and handled extremely well by director Jennifer Kent. I thought she also managed to really show the struggles of this movie and the relationship between the two really did seem 100% real and never forced or faked. Even the relationship with the family members and outsiders came across very believable. The performances by both Davis and Wiseman were extremely good with Davis really shining as the mother who slowly begins to lose her mind.Obviously, on a technical level, the film is quite effective so the level of your entertainment will be on whether or not it scares you. While watching the movie I could see why some would find it disturbing or downright frightening but I thought there were just too many things here that had been done in previous, much better movies. These include elements of THE EXORCIST (mom dealing with ill child), THE SHINING (one sequence really ""borrows"" from the Kubrick) film and even Mario Bava's SHOCK. THE BABADOCK is a decent movie but considering I went in expecting scares, it's a major disappointment in the end.",,Anonymous,Horror
Don't believe the hype,"A woman is involved in a crash. It's a nightmare based on something that happens years ago. On their way to the hospital to give birth her husband dies in a car crash. Years later we meet her again and the her now young son. She works at a convalescent hospital and hasn't gotten over her husband's death. The kid plays games about being a magician and also builds weapons and runs around saying he will protect the mother. But he's also problematic. He gets in trouble at school, with neighbors, family. He looks creepy and drives the mother crazy but in good modern fashion she barely dares raise her voice, let alone give him a good and deserved beating. She takes him out of school, and some child services people arrive. Finally she takes him to a psychiatrists and gets some tranquilizers for him and her.At some point the kid finds a creepy pop-up book called ""Mr. Babadook"" about some creepy guy dressed in black with lots of teeth who wants to be let in the house and warns of killing people. She hides the book but it appears again. The kid becomes obsessed with it seeing Babadook everywhere. The next time she reads it, it now presents a woman who kills her dog, a child, and herself. She, too, has a dog, and as all dogs in movies, it doesn't end well. This new story will become somewhat prophetic as the babadook does enter into her body. The kid will get to enact his fantasies of protector of the mother.On the face of it, The Babadook is lame psychological thriller that's frustrating and infuriating. Who wants to see bad miserable parents and their obnoxious kids? So you end up rooting for babadook to kill these two in gruesome ways. And that's a problem for any movie, if your two main and almost only characters aren't particularly likable. This movie is not scary in spite of what some odd reviews claim. The babadook doesn't really show up all that much. His voice though is pretty creepy.We are led to believe then that there is some very deep meaning to this movie, and there are plenty of interpretation on IMDb. If anything perhaps, this is about the repressed desire mothers have to kill their annoying son, who knows. I don't think this movie aims to lead us to one single interpretation. The problem is that I couldn't care less whether this movie has the deepest religious symbolism or presents some radical political criticism. I didn't care for the characters, nor for the story; I didn't connect. I imagine that single mothers will enjoy this movie, or parents with problematic kids, or folks who feel like their life is driving them crazy.The question I wonder about is whether this director is a good director or not. On the one hand, the story should have lent itself to a better, scarier movie. On the other hand, with few characters and a pretty basic story the director managed to make more out of what she really had. The Babadook enforced my belief that it is extremely difficult to make a good movie about madness, perhaps even impossible.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Slow cryptic eerie thriller, smarter than most","Australian cinema takes what could be a very cheesy premise and spins it into a psychological thriller with The Babadook.The film The Babadook is about a widowed mother Amelia, grappling with her husband's sudden and violent death and trying to raise her son Samuel.Samuel is trying child with severe behavioral issues and is a difficult child for a mother to love, especially given the circumstances. As Amelia tries desperately to manage Samuel she must also battle his fear of a monster known as the babadook which she swiftly realizes may be more than a figment of her son's imagination.Essie Davis is truly believable as the depressed Amelia coping terribly as a mother. Samuel is a terror and gives other horror kids in film a run for their money (I'm looking at you Damien). Given the annoying child Noah Wiseman portrays in the role Samuel, you can almost forgive her for her exhaustion. Samuel as a character might be one of the most taxing children ever featured in a horror movie. After ten minutes of him on the screen I prayed that Amelia would toss him out the car, or hit him over the head with one of his contraptions, which I believe was Kent's intention.Jennifer Kent's horror film is multi-layered and complex, playing into the psychological toll of being a mother under dire circumstances. Her film is perfectly balanced between The Babadook as film about a sinister being haunting a family and as a psychological thriller. Kent's story is well crafted and slow, relying on true horror complemented by eerie music and cryptic acting rather than cheap and lazy jump scares.The method in which Kent displays a dark force lurking in the shadows is much slower and denser and is less literally eventful than other films of this subject matter. It actually may be dense to a fault with most of the understated plot clues going over audiences' heads after just one watch. The Babadook is subtly frightening and could be too nuanced for average horror film lovers but should be a hit with the intellectual crowd.Check out our WEBSITE for more reviews of all the recent releases, in full.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Original and Intensely Unsettling,"The Babadook is an indie film out of Australia so it's understandable if you haven't heard of this one. Essie Davis plays Amelia. The mother of a very troubled child. Sam. We join the family 7 years after her husband died in a car accident. And it's very clear early on that the relationship between mother and son is not very strong at all. Watching as she curls up on the opposite side of the bed after her son has a nightmare is heartbreaking.But all this is made possible thanks to a powerhouse performance from Essie Davis. The other actors around her have spotty performances but Davis delivers an Awe inspiring one. She displays the characters grief and pain beautifully. Without her even speaking it's apparent what she has gone through and is going through.But the meat of the story is served up about 30 minutes in when Sam has his mother read a book about a monster called The Babadook. This is where the film gets intensely creepy and unsettling. It reminds me of the classic film Alien. Using atmosphere to it's advantage. I was terrified for nearly half the movie and You really only see the Babadook a spare few times. But listening helplessly as he whispers his name in a deep throaty voice is instantly nerve racking.Not only is the Babadook incredibly disturbing but Essie Davis is as well. I won't give anything up but man, he scared the pants off me near the end of the film. Even with all this going on movie has the balls to make you question everything that is happening. It truly is a superb and ambitious Psychological Horror. The only downside is the ending feels a bit unsatisfying. But hey, you can't get rid of the Babadook.Overall The Babadook is an emotionally heavy movie with some real depth to it. Not to mention a truly impressive and unnerving performance from Essie Davis. The Babadook could quite possibly be the best Horror movie of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent spooky thriller with good production values,"This is a great film - directed and written by Jennifer Kent using, in part I believe, a city arts grant in Adeleide after some experience working on a Lars Von Trier film. The Babadook lives up to its critical praise with excellent pacing, camera-work, style, suspense and character development.The picture follows the aftermath of a widowed, down-at-the-heels care worker and her dysfunctional son, who are both being stalked, and invaded, by an evil creature from a children's book. The evil spirit, known as 'the Babadook' is sort of a homage to twenties German expressionist horror, and the overall tone is at times similar to the Shining, or the Exorcist.In fact, a few key scenes are overly derivative of those classic films, but its undeniable that Kent knows how to craft just enough suspense, foreboding, and helplessness to create a genuinely remarkable film. Its not without blood and violence, of course, but the film keeps these elements offscreen, or to a minimum, focussing on psychological terror and, well, darkness.This film only shows its limited budget in terms of its small cast, as the delivery and cinematography are all first rate, every camera move and editing sequence feels like the work of a quality filmmaker. Worth watching, although not if you're overly 'afraid of scary movies.'The writer/director also offers signed copies of the haunted book from the films official website if you are a fan of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Effective and Harrowing Australian Horror,"The Babadook reaffirms a few beliefs of mine that I've seemed to have lost over the past few years, namely that horror is not a lost art form; film-makers are still capable of producing material and visual artistry which infuses fear into the heart of the viewer. It also reaffirms the notion that Australia is a country which is very much capable of providing strong and intelligent writers and directors to the mainstream horror community, with Jennifer Kent's debut picture proving to be one of a very harrowing nature, and one that shall undoubtedly stick with me long into the night ahead.Headed by one of the most insanely confronting and intense performances of the year thanks to the exceptional Essie Davis, the entire film is incredibly stylish and well constructed on a technical level, as well as being efficiently paced and building a tension that does not let up until the final few minutes, those final few minutes being but slightly anticlimactic in comparison to the sensational build-up. The build-up itself is absolutely effective, producing scares all throughout before the inevitable final confrontation, though thanks to the aforementioned Davis' performance, we are able to conjure up enough confidence, alongside the main character Amelia, to confront and battle the monster at hand.Though interestingly enough, what propels The Babadook into a category of its own is its refusal to fit into the role of a conventional and generic monster film. Kent tries desperately hard to craft a motion picture that spreads outside its initial genre, and instead expands to a number of different ideas and messages, namely that of grief. In fact, a good way to describe The Babadook is to consider it a confrontation with grief itself, and battling the things that continue to cause us pain and suffering long after the event that has caused such has passed; when we lose a loved one or a friend, we often internalize the damage caused to us. The Babadook represents one woman's attempts to battle such, and to stand forth and tackle the issue head on. In regards to the attempts to branch outside of the horror genre, Kent excels.The cinematography and sound design are each worthy of acclaim, as well as the score; all of these are instrumental in building one of the best atmospheres seen or felt all year. The camera often reacts based on the monster's movements by stopping a close-up as a bump goes off in the background, and this immediately adds a different tension than what we're used to; there is a certain anticipation in this sense, as the camera then continues on in its movements alongside Amelia. The sound design and score are equally as harrowing, both increasing in pitch and volume as the monster becomes more and more prominent within the film. Child-like music, filled with light piano and other innocent sounds occur as The Babadook becomes the main feature of the film, so we're already highly on edge, but the sound design turns overtly creepy as the sounds and volumes begin to heavily contrast with each other; as the monster nears, heavy and shrill instrumentation plays out to warn us of the inevitable doom, only to be stopped as the protagonist focuses on a different piece of interest. All of these components help to dramatically further the film into a tension ridden class of its own.Unfortunately, the film falls slightly within its first 15 minutes, the picture often over-emphasizing certain events within this brief portion of time, commonly to poor effect. The aforementioned ending is also anticlimactic, and the tension is not held as well as one would imagine during the finale of the film. Nevertheless, The Babadook is captivating horror, and a film which will undoubtedly stay with me for a good while. It contains brilliant performances from all involved, whether it be the sensational Essie Davis, the captivating Noah Wiseman or the creepy Benjamin Winspear, and it contains a great quantity of technical brilliance. Ultimately though, it transcends many other horror films by using the monster as a means for a higher message and battle, one that exists on the path to the subconscious of a highly tortured woman. It's a beautifully filmed movie, and one that shall not quickly be forgotten.8.3/10You can check out longer and more elaborate reviews at www.entjunkie.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

a forever-disheveled looking mother and her tantrum-loving kid face a suited-up spook,"Being an ardent horror-cult fan,I invite any new movie in the block with the most open-minded enthusiasm possible and the silly sounding name of the movie prepped me up for a deliciously twisted movie experience, fingers crossed.

While,according to my layman's eyes, subtle trinkets of moments were captured surprisingly, the story itself was a bore. Frankly, I like to be spooked in spooky movies and not a single time did I feel scared. Or trapped. Or helpless as the characters were suggesting.

A Rare Horror Gem,"The Babadook is one of the few truly disturbing horror movies of the 21st century. The movie revolves around a widowed mother tasked with parenting a truly dysfunctional child. One of the nights the mother begins to read a children's book called ""The Babadook"" and creepy stuff happens from then on. The movie is a psychological horror movie which is why it is phenomenal and provides a long term sensation of true terror. The film really gets under your skin as it deals with themes that are very relatable such as grief. The film itself is shot beautifully and the acting is superb by lead characters Essie Davies and Noah Wiseman.

The boy was much more of a monster than The Babadook!!!!!!,"Six years after the violent death of her husband, Amelia (Essie Davis) is at a loss. She struggles to discipline her 'out of control' 6 year- old, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), a son she finds impossible to love. Samuel's dreams are plagued by a monster he believes is coming to kill them both. When a disturbing storybook called 'The Babadook' turns up at their house, Samuel is convinced that the Babadook is the creature he's been dreaming about. His hallucinations spiral out of control, he becomes more unpredictable and violent. Amelia, genuinely frightened by her son's behaviour, is forced to medicate him. But when Amelia begins to see glimpses of a sinister presence all around her, it slowly dawns on her that the thing Samuel has been warning her about may be real.This Australian thriller is one of the most terrifying horror movies this year, because it roots its shocks in the most primal of emotions: mother love.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's absolutely worth a watch,"There are three huge things that made me really enjoy watching this movie, the design, the symbolism and the intelligence of the characters. Most horror movies I do not really like because what we are meant to be afraid of can be entirely lost when the monster shown does not live up to the hype the movie created around it. The only visual of the monster in this movie is through drawings and distorted visuals, we are never shown entirely what the monster is we just know it might take several shapes. I feel not knowing what I am afraid of can add a whole new level of scare, because I'm not sure what it is that is supposed to be scaring me. Another problem some horror movies have is that I stop thinking about it when the movie ends. There really isn't anything more for me to think about in the movie, it's just over now. This problem is fixed here with an interesting level of symbolism, and a lot of the symbolism can be interpreted to be several things. Not entirely knowing what I just watched and having the viewer think of their own meaning and conclusion can add a lot of replay value to this movie. You may think of an entirely different way to think about the movie after watching it for the x amount of times. The third thing I liked was that the main cast were pretty intelligent people, which is basically a long living trope in horror movies that the cast are really dumb and begging to die. I was never annoyed with how situations handled were played out, anything dumb the characters did outside of engaging with the monster is a flaw in their character. Meaning that not everyone is perfect and I feel something when watching each of the characters go through their day. I felt just sad watching the way the characters engage with each other because it is clear that something in their lives is missing, and something in your life is missing if you don't watch this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Lovely horror flick,"The Babadook has been labeled the best Australian horror movie in years. I've got not much to compare to, but I do recognize a good horror picture when I see one. While you won't have to prepare for jump scares, gallons of blood or unbearable tension, Jennifer Kent's movie relies on the expressions of the actors and the psychological darkness surrounding the story. Essie Davis and child actor Noah Wiseman give their best making their facial expressions speak a thousand words and mostly they succeed. In addition, I think it is possible to read a subtext in this movie: the Babadook being the psychological terror of not being able to cope with reality. Of course that's just a possible interpretation (although I like the metaphorical layer of the ending when looking at the movie this way). The kind of horror that adds a pinch of Dark Touch to movies like Mama, Sinister and Oculus. Recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""You can't get rid of the Babadook""","First off: no, this is not a horror movie. It's a family drama with a dark atmosphere and several decent scares in it. But it's definitely not a horror movie.With that out of the way, the Babadook actually is quite a good movie. It's a low- budget one which revolves mostly around the protagonist Amelia, a nurse in an elderly home, and her son Samuel. Samuel has very bad temper tantrums and can't sleep because of a boogeyman living in his closet, which comes out at night to haunt him. With no father in the picture, this obviously has it's toll on Amelia, but she copes. Or does she? As the nights become shorter and shorter for her, her burden becomes more and more heavier.Off course the Babadook has its flaws. The small cast doesn't always deliver, and the usual clichés pass by (like mysterious cellars and cops that don't want to help a poor single mom). But overall, it's pretty well built-up and worth a watch. I rated it 7 stars, and I'm pretty picky with my ratings.If you want see a teen-slasher movie, a haunted house or exorcist flick with blood and gore, you can skip this one. But if you want to feel uneasy in a more subtle way, try the Babadook. You'll be left thinking while the end credits roll over your screen. Have fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What can't we get rid of?,"""The Babadook"" is definitely a creepy movie. Watching it, I got the feeling that it was an allegory for things that remain with us long after they're gone. Things like grief. Indeed, the Babadook says ""the more you deny, the stronger I get"". After all, there are instances when attempts to suppress or ignore a problem cause it to fester or exacerbate.The movie itself goes for a lot of shock value, which makes a lot of it feel over-the-top. In the end, it's interesting to see a horror flick from Australia. The land down under does in fact make a number of horror flicks, even though we think of it as pristine. The movie's worth seeing but isn't for the fainthearted.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's proven lack of sleep leads to insanity.,"I don't really understand the high praise for this movie: it's not scary, the ending leaves many loose ends, the child is sooo damn annoying! If I had a child like Samuel I'd be insane, too, especially, since the damn kid refuses to sleep!! I suppose you could describe this movie as a psychological horror although, without any scares or terror, I have no clue how this can be considered any kind of horror except that Samuel is a terrifyingly scary kid that would make anyone thinking of parenthood seriously reconsider their decision. Both times I watched this movie all I did was mentally scream at Samuel to shut up and go to sleep! How his poor mum, Amelia, didn't beat him into submission out of sheer frustration is a testament to her fortitude ... that boy would drive any parent to insanity.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Truly Horrifying,"In terms of horror films, you will find few quite as truly horrific as this one. Not only is the plot thrilling and layered with all kinds of terrifying possibilities, the script, acting and direction are sometimes so good that its actually hard to watch.If you're used to factory line horrors, which churn out jump scares with meaningless stories, then you might find The Babadook a bit outside of your comfort zone. But if, like me, you revel in talented directing, rich metaphors and incredible screen writing, then this is the film for you.The film has a wonderfully subjective subtext, and massively succeeds in conveying a real sense of the main characters madness through brilliantly inventive directing. It is reminiscent of Polanski's The Tenant in some parts, and just as well presented, but also manages to create something new and fresh.Honestly though, I've seen hundreds of horror movies, most of them are simply annoying, and a few of them are quite scary, but this film was at times genuinely terrifying. And I haven't felt that way about a movie since I was about ten!Viewer discretion should be advised however, as the film does tread dangerously close to the issue of child abuse so those who are particularly sensitive in that regard may want to steer clear.Its not a horror movie for those who don't really want to be horrified. And to me, that means its excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Baba Kook - The Great Australian Letdown,"It is not surprising to have another turkey of a feature film from a country which takes its jaundiced inspiration on movies from Hollywood. Except for one character of a little boy and his neighbour(hence the rating of 2) the movie is all a bit like the Australian wastelands : barren and lacking originality. That the movie has got a rating of 7 on IMDb itself is a travesty as the viewer is confronted with characters that you wouldn't care about, zero scares and a tiresome predictable story line like so many 'Australian' films.

Original Yet Lacking,"Direction/Writing:Jennifer Kent does a good job directing ""The Babadook"". The cinematography and direction is very well done and creates an eerie atmosphere. Her writing is below par and seeing that there were no other writers doesn't surprise me. The writing tends to be generic, unoriginal and corny. However it comes from a good place and I believe with some more development and maybe an assistant writer her films could be as well written as intended. A huge problem I had with this film was the sound. There was no eerie/ambient soundtrack or mix, but at the same time it wasn't dead silence which at times can create the same desired effect.Acting:I wasn't a huge fan of the acting. Very rarely does a child actor evoke a strong response from me and this was not one of those times. Essie Davis' job was on the weak side as well but was probably my favorite performance of hers to this date. Not much to say, it was rather bland with a few peaks near the end.Final Thoughts:I was never scared by this film at any point despite the well crafted atmosphere, this was possibly due to the very obvious foreshadowing if it can even be considered that. Some interesting symbolism throughout but none reaching too deep. The book was fantastic, I loved every scene including the book and I think it saved the film. I also greatly enjoyed the last 10 or so minutes but they do not make up for the rest of the film. I would recommend this film but set your expectations low.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Worst horror film I ever watched in my whole life,"I am a huge fan of horror movie and so I expected, especially from reading IMDb review, that this one is gonna be a cool movie comparing to The Orphanage and also, The Conjuring, which I recently watched in the theater and enjoyed a lot. But this one really make me wasting my time wondering why it got such a high rating here and making me doubt of the quality of the review.The movie plots have nothing just a mother and a boy walking around and around, trying to make you feel afraid but not at all. Babadook is in fact nothing but a character in a book and the movie does in no way make you feel mood-in and in no way make you feel scary even a little bit. After 20 minutes watching, I began to wonder that it may have an amazing plot at the end that scare us, but after 30 minutes watching, I began to feel desperate and for the time left I was wondering when it will end so I can go out of the theater and do something else.

"The Ba-Ba-Ba, the Dook-Dook-Dook, that's all we need to scare you with!","You always need to be wary and skeptical of new horror movies that are coming out and instantly receive unanimously praising reviews from the press and international festival juries. Journalist have quota, festivals need positive publicity, and in the end, you are left behind feeling disappointed and ripped off. I also can't help thinking that our quality norms and standards for horror movies have severely lowered over the past decade. In recent years I've seen numerous horror movies that are world-widely labeled as original, genuinely terrifying and atmospheric, like ""The Conjuring"", ""Don't Breathe"", ""The Witch"", ""It"", ""A Quiet Place"" or ""Get Out"". Don't get me wrong, ALL of these are more than adequate, clever and recommendable horror/thriller films, but NONE of them are the mind-blowing and astoundingly petrifying masterpieces that their ratings or reviews suggest.Does this statement also apply to ""The Babadook""? Yes and no, I'd say. ""The Babadook"" is definitely a different and less conventional type of supernatural horror story. Writer/director Jennifer Kent clearly didn't feel obliged or pressured to make a traditional and mainstream blockbuster, and even downright refuses the use of typical genre cliches like false scares, polished and attractive lead characters or textbook villains/monsters. The ultimate proof of her devoted intentions, I think, is the fact that she keeps ownership of the film's legal rights just to prevent that someone will ever make a sequel. How exceptional is that in the horror industry? What Jennifer Kent did bring to the screen with ""The Babadook"" is a very personal, tangible and harrowing family drama that utmost benefices from its slow-pacing, foreboding atmosphere, bleak filming style and majestic performances (Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman). As to be expected from a psychological horror tale of this allure, it's a film with many layers; ambiguous and open for various interpretations.Is the Babadook real or a fragment of the two emotionally troubled protagonists' imaginations? To be quite honest, I don't know. I'm not necessarily seeking out intellectual or thought-provoking cinema. I already have a lot of thinking to do for my job and I try to contemplate more deeply about raising my children, but I don't feel the desire to over-analyze every scary movie that I watch. I do tend to concur with the fellow reviewers who see ""The Babadook"" as an allegory on unprocessed traumas, everlasting guilt, difficult childhood years and the lack of strong role models. What matters is that Jennifer Kent masterfully brings the titular monster to life in a subtle yet unsettling fashion, and that both Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman empower its frightening existence through their stellar performances. Especially Davis is astounding, and I caught myself thinking stuff like: ""Get some sleep, you poor woman"") several times. ""The Babadook"" perhaps isn't the masterpiece that certain reviews claim it to be, but it's a truly impressive film and a must-see for genre fanatics. Jennifer Kent is familiar with the genuine masterpieces of horror, by the way, because her film contains footage of Mario Bava's ""Black Sabbath/I Tre Volti Della Paura"".",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Anyone who's suffered loss knows this horror.,"""You can't get rid of the Babadook."" Samuel (Noah Wiseman)The monsters they do live inside us, except, of course, when they also inhabit our humble homes, which is the stuff of horror films for over a hundred years. In that well-prescribed genre rests Jennifer Kent's disturbing The Babadook, one of the best psycho-horror films in recent years.Almost jumping off a children's terrorizing pop-up book, Mister Babadook, the titular monster and typical kids' bogeyman, is first of all an obvious metaphor for the demon that dogs a mom, Amelia ( the fine Essie Davis), after losing her husband in a car accident as she is going to give birth to her 6 year-old son, Samuel. As they try to deal with the loss and its resentments, mom and son can't shake the terror of losing dad and husband, nor can the guilt-ridden Samuel let go of the feeling that Babadook is in their lives for the long haul: ""You can bring me the boy,"" says Babadook, in a statement redolent of revenge and resentment.Actually seeing the monster as it invades their house is rare, as it should be, given the suspenseful emphasis on the son's growing obsession with the ghoul's presence and Mom's increasing mania. In other words, this film works as a psychological study almost better than a horror story.In some ways it reminds me of The Innocents, and in other ways it is notably a successful rendition of the modern female fighting elements that used to be reserved for the flawed male (think of The Shining as a shining example of the male-dominated horror flick).First-time Australian director Kent's relaxed depiction of the possession until the effective climax and denouement goes a long way to let the audience consider the psychological ramifications of profound loss. Rarely does she gives us the standard clichés like false alarms and banging doors; rather she lets the horror emanate from the seemingly possessed Samuel and mom's emerging dementia.""Don't let it in."" Samuel",,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Annabelle.,"Finally a good horror film with no annoying jump scares.When a disturbing storybook called 'The Babadook' turns up at their house, Samuel is convinced that the Babadook is the creature he's been dreaming about. His hallucinations spiral out of control, he becomes more unpredictable and violent. Amelia, genuinely frightened by her son's behavior, is forced to medicate him.They are so many bad horror films out there right now that I'm pretty tired and sick of seeing, but The Babadook is not like those films. This horror movie did something that Annabelle or Ouija couldn't do, and that is try to be original and scary.Babadook is a movie that got under my skin if I got to be honest. The chilling and uneasy atmosphere and it's sense of fear that this movie truly nails it for me and not like most horror films today that lost that sense fear and just allow on lazy Jump scars. The acting in this movie was so real and so top notch that I got to say that Essie Davis did excellent in this movie, even the little kid did good.The other thing that this movie get's right is the fact it says ""F'ck jump scares"", and tries to scary the viewing auditions and not be throwing loud sounds to make some people jump a little bit, no it goes for the good old fashioned method of a good horror film and that is showing frighting images that will stick in your mind until the movie is over.My only problems with this movie is it's slow at the beginning and the ending to the movie was a bit ridiculous if I got to say.But overall The Babadook is more than you're cliché monster movie, it focus on doubt's and depression which made the movie even scary, because if you got doubt's and depression running throw your head and meanwhile there might be something out there after you and your kid then it can mess with your mind and cause terror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Beautifully novel work, truly refreshing","Horror is a film genre so bogged down with sub-mediocre works it's almost easy to dismiss in its modern form. But every five years or so a film comes along that breathes new life into the medium (and then, sadly, spawns untold lacklustre copycats for the next decade). Past examples include The Blair Witch Project, The Ring, and The Cabin in the Woods. The Babadook is more than worthy addition to that pantheon.Excellent acting, tastefully done special effects, a lack of cheap jump scares, and a greater emphasis on human emotional darkness than supernatural spookiness are among the film's best qualities.

The Babadook,"Amelia is a young widow; her husband, the father of her son, was killed in a car crash seven years ago, and if the boy is not mad he is slowly driving her nuts with his obsessing over the Babadook, a mysterious entity which is really only a character from a rather weird children's book. Or is it real? Certainly he seems to think so, and his obsession is so out of hand that he is as good as thrown out of school, and is causing his mother's friends to ostracise her. Well, if you are invited to a birthday party where you throw a young girl out of a tree house, what else can you expect?As far as psychological thrillers go, this is not a bad offering; we've seen it all before of course, as with ""The Exorcist"", but this film - which is really more of a play with two leads and a side cast - has no real resolution, though it must surely have been a baptism of fire for 7 year old Noah Wiseman.

We Create Our Own Monsters,"The film develops slowly, while quietly pursuing a rising action. Kent delivers a film that resists the run-of-the-mill horror pace by moving her plot to a staggering rhythm. Despite this, it holds the audience on its grip. It builds on its characters instead of banking on cheap horror thrills and CGI-crap. Its monster, on the other hand, doesn't need a justifiable cause to defend its terrifying presence. It doesn't come with a backstory. The central characters' history is already enough to juice the plot. Unlike Sadako and Kobayashi (or Lotus Feet for that matter), whose backstories stretch to almost epic proportions, the Babadook is just how it is: it's just there, and the characters will just have live with it or fight it. And although it doesn't show itself much, its horror still lingers like an ellipsis.THE BABADOOK presents a nightmare both real and unreal. Its creature doesn't just jumps on beds and opens doors, it also symbolizes the dark alleys of consciousness. It has a character who is doomed with a remembrance of a tragic memory, and letting go of such past could also be a terrifying process in itself. In one way or another, we create our own monsters. Through careful direction, it is a movie that delicately shows a truth about who we are and how we embrace our pains. And that despite the victories, there still would be lingering, disturbing denouements.More on http://jellicleblog.com",,Anonymous,Horror

A Chiller That Gets Under Your Skin,"The Babadook is not like Godzilla, Dracula, or some other movie monster a child fears is hiding in their closet. Those beasts, by comparison, were real, in their outlandish zones anyway. In contrast, The Babadook is a manifestation of grief, tormenting the lives of Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman). His presence is there — strikingly evil and intellectually sadistic — but his existence is never as certain as we might like it to be, similar to how the ghosts in The Innocents could have easily been a twisted hallucination stemming from Deborah Kerr's psyche.Lately, the best of horror seems to be found in independent cinema (You're Next, It Follows), The Babadook acting as its arguable peak. It is not a self-aware slasher nor is it a crafty supernatural farce; it is, instead, a highly original work of psychological terror. The directorial debut for Jennifer Kent, the film is, by turns, visually stunning (nearly everything is shaded with the metallic artistry of a IKEA designed prison cell) and genuinely chilling, though not in the ways you might expect. The real monster here is not The Babadook himself but the feelings of mourning, sadness, and agony, pressing on and on until they reach an explosive breaking point.These emotions have been lingering over Amelia and Samuel for nearly a decade. Seven years earlier, Amelia's husband was killed in a car accident, an accident that took place only moments before Samuel was born. Ever since, Amelia sees her son as a burden, a reminder of the horrific doom she faced that fateful night. She loves him as much as any mother in her situation could, but it's no easy task, considering how precocious Samuel has become over the years.Precocious, however, is too kind a word to describe his temperament. He seems only able to speak within the constraint of an ear-curdling shriek; he can hardly sleep through the night, believing he is tormented by monsters (building harmful weapons to try to avoid them); and, to Amelia's increasing horror, he is turning into an extremely violent child, eventually getting kicked out of school. She wishes he were normal, or, better yet, well-behaved.Things take a turn for the ghastly when a mysterious storybook pops up in Samuel's room one night. Titled Mister Babadook, it is filled with disturbing images and a storyline certainly not meant for young children; the book promises that, once Mister Babadook makes his way into your home, he will never leave, will never stop terrorizing you. Amelia finds it troubling, but not as much as Samuel. If he wasn't already the child from hell, one might send him straight to a local asylum. His behavior becomes more bizarre than ever. He is convinced that The Babadook is residing in the house, talking to blank spaces in his spare time; he starts having hysterical outbursts, at one point breaking his cousin's nose at her birthday party. Gradually, though, his actions are eclipsed by his mother, who is showing signs of monstrosity similar to the apparently fictional creature.The Babadook is not an easy horror movie. Gone are the jump-scares, the ghostly clangs that come from nowhere. Its most stunning aspect is its ability to hold a spectral atmosphere throughout its running time; even before the titular villain appears, despair looms like laughter in a '90s sitcom. If it weren't a horror movie, it would be a sinister study of trauma and its aftershocks.Not to suggest that the film isn't already a sinister study of trauma. The allusions to grief are hardly subtle; The Babadook itself reminded me of a childhood story in which a big, green monster suddenly appeared and grew bigger every time a little boy told a lie. As Amelia tries to move on with her life, The Babadook gets stronger and more oppressive, reminding her time and time again that the memory of her husband's tragic death will never really go away, and that's a scary thing for someone wants to live a normal, happy life. I questioned the true existence of The Babadook several times; only Amelia and Samuel seem to be able to see it, the rest of the world oblivious to its destruction. Maybe that's because Amelia and Samuel are the only people in the world that truly understand the loud bereavement that has hung over their life since the accident. The list could go on, but it's impressive how Kent, a first- timer, is able to link fantastical horror and real-life terror with such fluidity. Grief and the existence of The Babadook go hand in hand, but which is more frightening?Much should be said for Davis's fearless performance, which calls for as much silent torment as verbal outburst. So vivid is her characterization that we find ourselves intertwined with her pain, through her limits as a parent and a person afflicted by an invisible, metaphorical monster and a very real one. And Wiseman, as Samuel, gives one of the most disturbing performances I've seen come from a child. He isn't the usual creepy horror movie tyke that likes to spit out threatening lines with the calm of a angel; his screeching anguish truly makes us question his sanity, unlike any young actor ahead of him.Where most have found The Babadook to be the scariest film in, well, forever, I was not frightened by it; I was fascinated, hypnotized by Kent's presentation and the potent performances that come with it. I do have inhibitions about how successful the film is as both a family drama and a horror — they connect but are never fully realized as individual ideas — but that shouldn't stop you. This is the kind of horror audiences have been waiting for; like Poltergeist or The Blair Witch Project, the thrills are not transparent but affecting.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Iconic Character,"I watched the movie called Babadook and I must say I quite liked the movie because the type of horror distinguished himself from the others and left out the jumpscares advancing to the horror itself, had incredible performances from the two lead actors, Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman, a good story that led us to sympathize with the characters and to fear for them, and even a tone and a soundtrack that stand out. For me it's 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, only because there weren't so many horror scenes as I expected, perhaps due to low budget. However, it was a great movie that really worked thanks to Jennifer Kent's amazing storytelling, and let's hope they launch The Babadook Book because I really loved its iconic character.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Superbly well crafted horror *film*,"First off, the bad stuff. The story is fairly predictable, so much so that at the worst of it I found myself just waiting for what was going to happen next to be over with so that maybe the film could move in a new direction.

"If it's in a word, or it's in a look, if you're after great horror, you're in luck!","""The best horror movie in years"" tends to be the key phrase to use when describing a genuinely good horror film. However, I think modern horror tends to get a bad reputation due to the amount rubbish produced. We've had endless Paranormal Activity films which seem to make big money and the appalling Human Centipede movies seem to make big noise, but these films aren't especially 'good'. Unfortunately though, they tend to overshadow the fantastic horror films we have been getting recently such as: You're Next, The Sacrament and Cheap Thrills to name a few. The Babadook can now pop itself onto that list. In fact, I'd say that it's easily the best and scariest supernatural horror film since the underrated Sinister.The Babadook still seems to get quite a lot of criticism for some reason though. To be fair, the trailers do make it look like some sort of run-of-the-mill jumpy ghost story, so perhaps audiences were disappointed when they got a film full of rich characterisation, domestic drama and psychological depth. I wasn't. The Babadook certainly isn't your typical supernatural horror film though. We're not even given a glimpse of the Babadook himself until about 50 minutes into the film, but this doesn't matter because the central themes and characters are so strong.There seems to be some debate as to whether this is a supernatural or psychological horror film. Some think that it leaves it up for the viewer to decide, but I thought that director Jennifer Kent was making it quite obvious that this was a film about a woman going mad. It's very much in the same vein of The Shining and Repulsion as our hero slowly descends into a total schizophrenic onslaught of terror. As a result, we're given a much deeper and character-driven film about grief, motherhood and madness.The heart of the film is the relationship between a mother and son. Both actors are pretty extraordinary, especially the mother played by Elsie Davis who gives an incredibly strong and shattering performance. Many have described the boy as the most annoying child to ever appear in a film, which is a pretty bold statement and one which I wouldn't necessarily disagree with! The decision to make the boy as painfully annoying as chewing a wasp is an extremely conscious one though as we're put directly into the shoes of the mother. Amelia finds her son extremely hard to love as she subconsciously blames him for the death of her husband. By the end of the film we end up feeling as crazy as Amelia!The first hour is actually a very sad one as we see Amelia become slowly isolated from people as her life becomes increasingly more hectic. No one seems to understand her grief and no one wants to know her because of Samuel (the impossibly annoying son). Therefore her descent into madness is a wonderfully realistic one. It's also quite frightening. I'm not one to get scared in horror films, I can watch The Exorcist on my own and feel no fright what so ever, however there were some scenes in The Babadook which made my hair stand on end. The last half hour basically just tries its best to scare the trouser off you and it succeeds! Jennifer Kent is extremely masterful in creating tension and scares. I can't think of one jump scare in the entire film which is so unusual and commendable. Instead, we're left terrified from nightmarish imagery and sounds. I dare anyone note to get chilled to the core when the Babadook is hovering over the bed chanting 'baba-dook-dook-DOOOK!'The Babadook is so much more than just a 'scary' film though. It carries so much depth if you're willing to read into it more. It has a genuinely interesting and engaging character at the centre of it and is willing to throw the audience right into the middle of her mental breakdown. It's also really well-made, especially considering the teeny weeny budget. The production design is pretty outstanding and the infamous Mister Babadook book itself is beautifully made. This is a film which horror fans should welcome to their bosom. It's genuinely scary, masterfully directed and has a super screenplay to match. What more could you want? It's also a great advert for contraception if your partner is starting to get broody.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

And it's not just a movie. It happens in real life. It happened to me, growing up with a mentally ill and abusive mother.
This movie brought back memories. The writers must have lived it too, as no one else could describe this reality so accurately. The mentally ill would use any excuses in their mind to convince themselves they're innocent and that they're the victim. But that's just their reality. Not THE reality. This is not a scary movie. It's a sad movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrible.,"I have absolutely no idea why there are so many positive reviews of this movie, it's cliché, poorly acted, and just awful.The only reasonable explanation that I have as to why this movie rates so highly on IMDb is that one of the producers, or someone involved in marketing this movie has paid a bunch click farmers to click 10/10 and write fake reviews for this movie.This movie is an intellectual carcinogen, please don't waste your time. The pace is painfully slow, the characters are completely unlikable, the story makes no sense, and the ending is almost like the writers got bored and just decided to end the movie once they'd sucked up enough money from the Australian government in the form of artistic grants designed to prop up the rotting corpse that is the Australian film industry.Movies like this are the reason why I vote for the Australian Liberal party.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incoherent and anti-climactic,What is the point of this movie? What is the intended audience? Waste of 1.5 hours for me. It built up some suspense and interest but gets your hopes up for nothing. It is a little bit like Poltergeist at some moments but in a worse way. It was kind of a psychedelic journey near the beginning but I was very disappointed at the end.,,Anonymous,Horror
Took too long to get going,Just forward to the 40 minute mark and start watching from there. Most of the movie you just wish the incestuous kid would disappear he is such a pain of a character. Doubling the speed of the movie is really the only way to watch it and even then it barely moves along fast enough.So the mother of the kid has some sleeping problems and she's giving he kid tranq's. When she does dream its of the babadook but its all too little. At the 1 hour mark she is well into la la land as the sleep deprivation really starts to kick in and all you can think is she's dreaming it all again and you just don't really care where its going.It definitely seems to have a little bit of inspiration from the shining but due to the complete lack of clarification on what on earth is happening you just sit there waiting for the end. It just takes too long to get anywhere and it has a terrible ending.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
No more than a pass,"(2014) The Babadook
HORRORWritten and directed by Jennifer Kent, centers on a single mother, Amelia (Essie Davis) who has just lost her husband and the relationship with her only son, six year old, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) asking her to read the scary pull up children's book called ""The Babadook"" who may or may not exist in real life and living in the family home.The problem is that because the premise is expected may have made the film not as scary at all, that is reminiscent to have it's story from a ""Goosebumps"" novel, for the pass rating is for it's originality and that is basically it. Some of the holes or one of the question I had while watching it is, how did the mother obtained the Babadook book in the first place!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Babadook""-  A new classic in the world of horror.","It's not too often that I am as amazed and enthralled with a film as I was with 2014's phenomena of horror ""The Babadook."" It's a film that from its very first moment has you captive in its dark tale of grief and suffering, unable to turn away from the screen because you are so completely absorbed into the exquisitely crafted narrative. Clever and deliciously frightening, it's easily a new classic in the world of horror.In the six years that have passed since the tragic loss of her husband in a car accident, Amelia Vanek (Essie Davis) has lead a troubled and depressing existence as the single mother of her deeply troubled son Samuel. (Noah Wiseman) One night, as she goes to read Samuel a bedtime story, he suggests a mysterious book that Amelia was previously unaware of: ""Mr. Babadook"", the story of a frightening creature that stalks and tortures those who become aware of its existence. Samuel is disturbed by the twisted story and the images contained therein, and soon, becomes obsessed with the idea that Mr. Babadook is all too real. At the same time, mysterious phenomena begin to plague the largely sleepless Amelia, and it appears that with her quickly-slipping sanity, she too will begin to see the demented figure that has started to torment her son's fragile psyche.Written and directed by Jennifer Kent, ""The Babadook"" is a powerhouse of emotional terror, dealing with complex themes of grief, depression, mental illness and even hatred. It's very clever in its use of ambiguous and evocative storytelling, allowing the audience to reach their own conclusions and to theorize on the goings-on in many key sequences. Like many greats of the genre, it's a film that from the start encourages critical analysis and personal interpretation, which helps each and every person take from it what they will. It's filled to burst with metaphorical imagery and hauntingly atmospheric visual motifs, leading to an all-encompassing sense of dread that very few films in the past have managed to capture. I was left in literal awe with just how exquisitely crafted a tale it was, and Kent deserves nothing but the utmost praise and respect for what she accomplishes here.This is also very much an actor's film, relying heavily on the presentation of a single mother and her child on the brink of collapse. Not only does the script perfectly establish and continue to flesh out our two leads throughout the running time, but both Davis and Wiseman are revelations for the film. Davis gives a performance that in every way deserves all the recognition she could receive. It's the role of a lifetime, and she consistently knocks it out of the part as a mother pushed to and over the edge by the circumstances of her life- both those in and out of her control. She is simply incredible and makes for one of the most compelling leads in a horror film I've seen in some time. Wiseman is a very talented and lovable child actor, and he does great with the part of the deeply troubled Samuel. Samuel is a disturbed young boy who is obsessed with his mother, and is obviously dealing with the repercussions of growing up without a father. Wiseman does exceptionally well for a boy as young as he is, and injects a lot of complexity beneath the surface. Bravo, young sir. Bravo.Beyond that, every facet of the production is absolutely spot-on and contributes towards creating a masterpiece of modern cinema. Radek Ladczuk's stunning cinematography perfectly compliments the complex and tragic nature of the storyline, delivering us beautifully crafted images that work wonders for the tale being told. Composer Jed Kurzel does a fine job with crafting a subtle and appropriate score that accentuates every scene with class and elegance without distracting from what we are seeing. Production and costume design is top-notch stuff, creating a world that feels true to life while also having just a slight enough hint of exaggeration to build towards the moody sense of tone established. And the editing by Simon Njoo is just spot-on, with a grand sense of pacing that helps each and every scene build in tension like a wire ready to snap at any instant.There is only one simple and elegant way to say it- ""The Babadook"" is a flawless classic in the genre. Despite only being two years old at the time I write this review, it has already shown itself to be one of the greatest horror films ever crafted, and it will without doubt continue to be admired for years, decades and generations to come. And thus, it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10 from me. Worth seeing for everyone who loves cinema, horror or otherwise.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting, but nothing new","You don't need violence and gore to make a horror movie. And Babadook is a fine example.Even though the idea itself is nothing new, I found this movie interesting. Mostly because of the actors who did a really amazing job and greatly contributed to the overall impression of a dark and bleak atmosphere, with their frustration and agony very well depicted. It is a psychological horror story, but only mildly frightening.A few objections are due to the very slow pace of the movie, and due to the fact that some quite important story-related things are left unexplained.Thus, if you exclusively like shocking, bloody, violent jump horrors, then know that this movie isn't for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beautifully Executed,"I am not going to post any spoilers, because the delight of this film is watching the plot unfold and drawing conclusions on your own. I will say that the performances are stellar. Essie Davis excels at creating tension and inciting sympathy, even if you don't know what to think of her character. Noah Wisemen is amazing. The first time I watched it, I thought his performance was over the top, but upon a second watching I realize he was pitch perfect. The film is atmospheric and creepy and truly, truly terrifying - if you interpret it the way I did.I love that Jennifer Kent had her feature film debut this way, and that some of the budget was crowd-funded. I would love to see her make another full-length film.If you didn't like it the first time, give it another watch and open yourself to it emotionally. That's the film's power.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mostly very scary,"This is a fairly standard horror flick. A lone mother struggles to look after her challenging son when a ghost comes along to really mix things up.This film has a few things going for it. The mother gives a great performance but is over shadowed by Noah Wiseman, who after only a few minutes on screen I wanted to slap his face (that is a complement) Also this film is as creepy as hell. A number of highly effective tension building devices (books, cellars, rhymes) will make you quake on your sofa.The direction is great. The characters world is very small, they are trapped inside the walls of their dreary house but at the same time their existence is empty and lonely.Then like in a million horror films before, in the last quarter of the film, as the tension reaches its zenith the director gets carried away and blows the whole show with a truly stupid finale.Very eerie, no blood, violence or nudity.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You can't get rid of the babadook,"2014's psychological horror film ""The Babadook"" was one of the best films of the decade by far, as Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent wrote and directed a ghost story addressing the issues of grief and mental health in a brilliant way. The story focuses on Amelia, a single mom who is still dealing with the loss of her husband in a car crash 7 years ago and is now raising her son Samuel who has a love for magic, but also a belief in monsters. One night while reading him a bedtime story, she ends up with the book titled ""Mister Babadook"" and this begins a haunting series of events as Amelia's home is attacked by this entity with her doing everything possible to make it go away. It's films like this and ""The Nightingale"" as to why Kent needs to be making more films because she's a remarkable talent.Essie Davis gives one of the best performances in a horror film maybe ever as Amelia, with her portraying a deeply wounded woman who is barely able to properly take care of her son and struggling with her mental health. The relationship with her son Samuel is the heart and soul of the film, with the two having a very strained dynamic due to Amelia not having control of her life and Samuel being a very hyper and sometimes difficult kid. What makes it work is that the kid isn't made out to just be this annoying little brat who won't shut up, but instead a little boy who just wants his father and it really pulls at the heart strings. Davis as Amelia goes from a deeply sympathetic woman with no true support, as her trashy fried Claire is always at her throat, to a truly terrifying person by the time the third act rolls around and I wish she received some Oscar recognition because she is out of this world.The elements that really make this film effective are the outstanding camera work, a well written script, and some insanely brilliant sound design. The way the film is shot sees the camera act as the actual Babadook itself, with the POV shots seeing the camera tilt and even crawl in a swift manner to represent the creature's presence. The sound design here is large and loud, as the actual voice of the creature gets under your skin as you hear it rapidly moving around the room and sometimes the sound is removed completely to only show the creature appearing in a Nosferatu-like manner. The script here is magnificent in how it tells a horror story that goes against most of the usual tropes in a psychological horror film, as it focuses on the actual characters and deeper meaning while using the creature as a representation of something bigger.Within ""The Babadook"" is a story centered around grief, loss, and mental illness as we watch Amelia have a hard time getting a grip on her life 7 years after the tragic loss of her husband. Her relationship with her son suffers not only because of his difficulties as a kid, but also because of her inability to truly move on and be there for him in a much more active sense. It's through this story that we see a woman go through the ringer in order to learn that not only must she move on, but she must learn to accept the tragedy of her past and that that scar is a part of her because it will never go away. When the ending rolls around, it's a really touching moment because we see her have a new grip on her life and I wish we had more horror films that were this emotionally investing in modern Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Psychological horror,"I really enjoyed Babadook. Its clearly not for everyone: the slow structure and the fact that the horror is most psychological can make some people bored or desinterest whit this movie. But for my opinion, i found it very scary. Its a story of a mother who raise her children and with some difficulties. The babadook story was well made and the story have some psychological point with the dead husband. I really appreciate also the role of the actor of the mother who did a very good job when she lose her sanity. It make it very believable. Nice movie an original one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth the Hype,"The Babadook, like Sinister, is one of those horror movies that has far more of an impact if you happen to be a parent, I think. Personally, I found it to be a substantially more spooky movie than a lot of the things I've seen...relying less on jump scares than a sense of tension the narrative builds up in the viewer(s) combined with a genuinely creepy premise. This is one of those movies like Session 9, where you spend a good portion of the time unsure as to whether there is actually some supernatural agent imposing its malevolent will upon the character or if these apparent supernatural elements are manifestations of a psychological breaking point being reached. There is a very real transition that takes place within both of the protagonists through the course of the movie, especially where the son is concerned, going from a child that would legitimately drive any parent insane to the more stable and coherent voice in the household by the climax. There have been a number of good films to have come out of Australia over the years, but this one is going to be within my top five for some time to come, I suspect.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Do Not Look In This Book...,"THE BABADOOK opens with a terrible accident. Seven years later, Amelia (Essie Davis) is raising her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone, while working at an elder care facility. Both remain devastated by the loss of their husband / father in the aforementioned tragedy.While Amelia has fallen into a deep depression, Samuel has become obsessed with protecting her, fearing that she could die at any moment. Samuel also exhibits some peculiar behaviors, resulting in his being pulled from school. Amelia is beside herself, unsure of what to do or where to turn.In the middle of all this, a strange book seems to simply appear in Samuel's bedroom. It looks like a child's pop-up book, so Amelia reads it to Samuel one night, and odd things start happening. What begins as a few weird but explainable occurrences, becomes increasingly menacing and dangerous. Are Amelia and her son being stalked by a supernatural entity, or is she just losing her grip on reality?Channeling elements and atmosphere from several, past genre classics, this film manages to incorporate them without being derivative. Ms. Davis is astonishing, shifting from terrified victim to terrifying threat with ease. The story can be viewed as a supernatural horror tale, a psychological thriller, or both.Part of what sets it apart is its emotional depth. It seems to have the greatest impact on viewers who have themselves suffered tragic loss. It is, at its core, about catastrophic loss, crippling sorrow, and eventual acceptance.A triumphant horror movie...",,Anonymous,Horror
it's about friggin' time!!! why do we have to shuffle through so much junk to find these?,"Moves in alongside Audition, Devil's Backbone, Drag Me To Hell, Behind the Mask, Let the Right One In, Scream, Sinister, Pontypool, and The Decent as one of my top ten favorite horror flicks of the last two decades(just ahead of Drag Me To Hell #10 and Sinister at #9). There's been some others of late come close like I Saw the Devil, Maniac, Citadel, and a few others, but this is the kind of horror film that comes around once every couple of years if you're lucky.When looking at the best over the last 5-10 years - the Aussies rule! I'm starting to watch more and more Aussie horror flicks lately because the ratio of good horror flicks versus bad one's from the Aussie's is strides better than what you'll find coming out of Hollywood ""Babadook"" has everything you want from a horror film. It's genuinely frightening, visually dazzling, and thought-provoking. The lead, Essie Davis, is absolutely fantastic. She definitely drives this film with a truly amazing performance, and the young Noah Wiseman is also great.THe film doesn't rush, but it also doesn't drag. It builds to a Poltergeist like crescendo, and pins the viewer against their seat, clutching the armrest, and grinding their teeth.Highly recommend this one! 84/100... will likely hold onto a top 10-15 spot come years end(which will likely be out of about 100 films, or at least that's about what I average per year), and that's high, recently rare praise for ANY horror flick.

Fantastic acting but overall slightly disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of the psychological horror genre. The way a well made movie can put you on edge without anything scary actually happening.

After watching The Babadook trailer I was excited to watch it on it's Halloween release date here in Australia. I did feel that it was a well made movie and the acting is very impressive, it just didn't deliver for me on the horror side.

"THE BABADOOK (Jennifer Kent, 2014) ***","Although I was vaguely aware of the film under review being ""the new phenomenon"" in horror movies, it had slipped my mind to try and score a copy for my month-long Halloween marathon which I have just gone through. In fact, it was the recommendation of a local film-buff friend of mine which jogged my memory and made me spring for it sooner rather than later. As usual, in hindsight, the end result fell just short of all the hype that had preceded it – but, having said that, it is still the best horror film I have watched since James Wan's surprise box-office smash, THE CONJURING (2013). Being a contemporary low-budget Australian production, it is small wonder than none of its cast and crew ring a bell but, as it turns out, as had previously been the case with legendary genre stalwarts like George Lucas and John Carpenter, writer/director Kent's breakout film turns out to be an expansion of a previous work, in this case the award-winning short MONSTER (2005; which, incidentally, is generously available to view in its entirety on ""You Tube"")!The simple storyline revolves around a widowed care-worker and her disturbed young son being menaced by the eponymous villain of a children's book. The film is anchored by two exceptional lead performances from Essie Davis (as the beleaguered mother) and Noah Wiseman (as her volatile kid), sensitive and subtle handling and a creepily effective sound design. Surprisingly enough, the titular villain (played by Tim Purcell mostly in silhouette) barely features in it – which makes its belated and sparse apparitions all the more electrifying. Unfortunately, the director still felt the need to cater (ever so slightly) for the ""torture porn"" crowd and gore-hounds in the audience by, at one point, showing the possessed mother plucking out a tooth from her own mouth (for no apparent reason!) – thus virtually stifling the effect of the preceding scene (one of the best in the film) where she breaks the neck of her fluffy dog during a late-night TV screening of the original Italian-language version of Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (1963)! – as well as exorcising herself of the offending spirit (which, inexplicably, she later keeps chained in the basement!) following a bout of bloody vomiting!!Like most horror films of recent vintage (particularly the good ones), as it was unfolding in front of me, I was reminded of several earlier genre efforts to which the film-makers could well be paying tribute or referencing, the most prominent of which here being Roman Polanski's REPULSION (1965; in its harrowing depiction of the psychological unraveling of its sex-starved female protagonist), William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (1973; in the medical examination and possession sequences), Mario Bava's own swan-song SHOCK (1977; in the fractured mother-son relationship played out in a house haunted by the malevolent presence of their late husband-father) and the Tobe Hooper/Steven Spielberg blockbuster POLTERGEIST (1982; in the climactic aerial abduction attempt by the spirit on the boy – who had been constantly coming up with elaborate weapons to combat it). The trump card of this particular film, it seems to me, is the fact that all the supernatural horror on display emanates from an obscure literary figure that finds itself in the house out of nowhere, puts itself back together after the mother tears the inventively illustrated book up and even rewrites itself anew in a more personalized and intimidating manner as a consequence of this very defiance!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Do Some Mothers Hate Their Children?,"Touted as the scariest movie of the year and loved by critics, audiences and filmmakers alike (which pretty much never happens) this little independent feature is admittedly the best horror to come out of Australia that I can remember. That said, it's only competition is that God-awful ""Wolf Creek"", so...Synopsis: The anniversary of the death of her husband is always a hard time of year for Amelia (Essie Davis, who is actually pretty great in this). But compounded with the fact that her bratty child has not only gotten himself kicked out of grade school due to his unusual hobby of constructing homemade projectiles, but also recently made her read a book, which may have summoned a demon called the Babadook (a taker of children) into the house, which just so happens to coincide with her going a little crazy herself.Though writer/director Jennifer Kent's first attempt at a feature is more miss than hit, all in all, ""The Babadook"" is filmed quite well. And though there are absolutely no scares (IN THIS HORROR FILM) the moments when Amelia is descending into madness definitely displays Kent's distinctive voice in the horror genre.Final Thought: Yes, the 3rd Act is a mess of clunky visuals, wasted potential and a final few sequences that are pretty damn confusing, plain and simple. And ""The Babadook"" is a horror film that isn't scary at all, unless you count a child who constantly throws tantrums as terrifying; which for some is quite terrifying. The fact that the underlying theme at the heart of the conflict between the mother and her child and the Babadook, may come down to the fact that a mother can hate her own child, is not only fairly untapped territory and quite morbid, but also pretty interesting. But again, whatever interest I had mounted up to that point, was totally scared off by this shockingly disappointing ending; even by Video on Demand standards.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Highly Disappointed,"Hype is a dangerous thing, especially in this day and age where your access to hype is as far reaching as you choose to make it. It also doesn't help when you get blind adoration from critiques seeking artistic integrity by lauding anything art-house or indie.I don't mean to completely dismiss ""Babadook."" Rare is the contemporary horror movie that seeks to do more than make a few things go bump in the night, and this film is rife with symbolism and metaphor. Amelia is a struggling single mother coping with a difficult 6-year-old (Sam) and the postpartum depression that has plagued her ever since her husband died while driving her to the hospital to birth their son. Her struggle is tragic and heartrending. And during the first act, the movie does well with getting us to feel the immense stress that comes with her every day life.But a good idea does not a good film make. The editing is incredibly poor, cutting out unnecessary bits of conversations and jumping clumsily through scenes that require a different pacing all together to be effective. The director is a huge fan of having a dramatic scene cut abruptly (music and all) right when it's becoming emotionally involving for the audience, and shifting tone completely. ""It's just mimicking her fragile broken state"" you may cry, to which I would answer yes, maybe, but you can only use that effect so many times before it's just shoddy film-making.And finally, ""Babadook"" is completely devoid of scares. Any scene that might be on the verge of making your hairs stand on end is painfully corrupted by the monster's laughable noises or cheesy special effects. In fact, on more than one occasion, the film even fell victim to one of horror's most terrifying enemies: the unintentional laugh.Don't get me wrong. I love horror. Even bad, campy horror. But the pedestal this movie was put on really set me up for a dour disappointment.

A Masterful depiction of true emotional horror,"Never before have I ever felt such a powerful urge to review a movie.The Babadook puts you in the shoes of Amelia, a single mother raising a seemingly troubled child. They are then haunted by this sinister presence known as the Babadook, which early in the story manifests itself as a children's horror story. But oh, it is so much more.This film was cursed with a marketing team who pushed it to be a monster movie, which is unfortunately unsurprising in today's day of lazy, Hollywood jump-scare horror. Let me first begin by stating that I have never once considered myself to be a fan of the horror genre, probably thanks to the crap we are typically served and pay big bucks to see every year.I thought this film was phenomenal. The pacing is perfect, with a slow but cumulating eeriness that makes you impressively uncomfortable. The characters are also so well fleshed-out and believable that even though I desperately wanted to stop watching by the final third of the run time, I was so invested that I just HAD to know if Amelia and her son would end up OK. The sound effects are very well timed, not overused, and will chill you to the bone. Trust me when I say that if you endure through this unnerving experience, you will be rewarded.This film is a dark, disturbing, & masterful portrayal of deep depression and grief. It got under my skin in all the right ways, climaxing in what is probably the most emotional any film has ever made me. If you or anyone you love has ever dealt with depression, you most certainly will cry. And you will like it.10/10. A wonderful debut film by Jennifer Kent.

ba...ba.....DOOOOOOOK.,"Here is a film that has received a lot of positive buzz this past year. Receiving especially high acclaim from The Exorcist directed himself William Friedkin. So, being the horror nut that I am, I knew I had to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.A depressed and troubled widow, Amelia, has raised her six-year-old son Samuel alone. It's extremely difficult for her because the kid is beyond troublesome. Constantly yelling, threats of violence and an obsession with weapons has driven her to her boiling point. One day a children's book appears on his bookshelf. She reads it to him...big mistake. The grotesque pop-up book details murder and mayhem for the young child at the hands of The Babadook. Throwing the book away doesn't help, because he has already been unleashed.The first thing I noticed, besides how annoying this kid was, was the art direction of the house. How incredibly blue and grey everything was. It was striking how drab the interior was and how it matched her depression. Kent, the director, has cited Polanski and Lynch as influences. This film feels like an odd mix between Eraserhead and Rosemary's Baby. So those inspirations shine through here and it makes for a well done horror film.Very few horror film rely on real genuine scares, they instead opt for the cheap jump scares that heavily rely on sound rather than sight. The Babadook doesn't really go that route. Thank heavens. It slowly builds the tension and releases the horror at the right moments. We see glimpses of 'him', like Bruce in Jaws, which amps up the fear.I can understand people being put off of the film due to the kid. He does ruin the picture at times. I get that he is suppose to annoy, irritate and make the viewer want to inflict pain onto the poor lad, much like the mother feels, but there is a breaking point. He does a good enough job, but I totally understand where people are coming from in their dislike for the film because of his performance. The mother does a good job here as well. We feel tired like here throughout the beginning of the picture. Kent manages to switch the fear here. We fear for the mother, then we fear for the kid. It was an interesting move between characters.With real scares, The Babadook is this years The Conjuring. Enjoy yourself....ba...ba.....DOOOOOOOK.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good movie,I liked this movie quite a bit. Had a real creepy feel to it. The mom and son were great actors. It's rare to find a decent horror movie that you actually enjoy but this one was pretty good from beginning to end. Almost more of a suspense movie. Highly recommend it of your a horror movie fan.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worst film EVER!!!,"SERIOUSLY???? What are people watching??? I have never written a review before but felt i had to as I am so shocked at the reviews for such a terrible film. It was such a dark depressing film that was slow going off.There was nothing to it until about 20 minutes towards the end and even then it wasn't anything to write home about (even though I am). I am a big horror film buff and this was just a joke, seemed like it was made in the 70's, you know, when they weren't scary!!! Even the babadook was a jokey looking character. The boy was a good actor (all be it a bit strange) but please, don't waste an hour and a half of you time. Save yourself, i wont be getting that back!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
An enjoyable flick,"For some inane reason it took years for me to finally watch this well made low budget Australian Horror. The basic premise is a widowed mother has problems looking after her incredibly annoying son, then things turn for the worse when she reads him a bedtime story called 'The Babadook'. I will admit that the first 15 minutes of the move were hard going simply because of the world's most annoying child, though I urge you to carry on watching as it might start to make sense. For modern Horror lovers, this might not hit the spot, there is no gore and nothing really shocking, just the sanity of either the Mother or the child or both slowly going. It's a good tale, and the acting from both the leads is very good. A horror movie outside the box, well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbing mix between The Shining and Home Alone,"This movie is one of the most disturbing and sad I have watched for a long time. It actually was difficult to watch because of the fact that no one was helping this poor lady and troubled boy. And like most thrillers it was slow. Add slow with disturbing and sad and it is really difficult to watch.I like the concept of the Babadook but the execution of the monster didn't really work for me. Like ""The Pact"", when the danger came from a source of reality I found it a lot more scary. But this movie isn't even close to ""The Pact"" (IMO).Without spoiling, I do like the fact that she was a children's book writer and she was not coping with the loss of her husband and the theme the entire movie was implying. I like the entire story underneath a story but I think it went to far for that alternative story to ring true...movies where they are more subtle in regards to this are more enjoyable (Again IMO).The six year old kid made some pretty impressive home made weapons and traps which reminded me of ""Home Alone"" (I know, strange comparison). He also understood the situation to a remarkable level. I can't see a six year old having the capability to be so resourceful and insightful but hey, we are possibly watching a movie about a children's book horror character coming to life so reality is out the window.Also the ending didn't work for me either (Again IMO). To explain would spoil.In summary, I found this movie more disturbing than scary...it was uneasy to watch and I wouldn't watch it again. However I admire the talent of the Director and the product outcome on such a low budget and the performances of the Mother and Child. The child was amazing, it would have been an incredibly difficult role to play for such a young child.Everyone else seems to be raving about it. It may have cult hit written all over it. maybe I missed something...",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A run of the mill psychological thriller,"May I start by saying this is not a bad movie, it's dark but at the same time more absorbing than your average kitchen towel!Many have been aghast at the use of colours, but to be honest would this movie have conveyed the feeling of depression and oppression had principal cast members gone around in a super fun happy Technicolor world, I think not....Watching this movie the feeling of hopelessness and loss are paramount, directors message achieved I believe.It is clever, very clever as you the viewer do not see at great lengths he who lurks in the shadows, a must in a good psychological thriller.My only real criticism with the movie is that I found it to be much like any other horror film, the same undertones and basic storyline, creepy child, hopeless mother, possession and a finale with a wits end desperation fight seen.In summary the babbadook is a strange if not quirky film that is gripping in places, a headache in other places, confusing but OK if you enjoy a good run of the mill psychologically suggestive film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Babadook haunts you long after watching this,"We all have monsters, maybe they're not physical, but they can be memories, dreams or just packed up feelings. And while they haven't got real bodies, they can be more scary than anything we know.The Babadook is a story about mother and her troubled child. The father passed away in a car accident on the same day when their son was born and after that the mother, Amelia, tries to raise Robbie as well as she can. It isn't easy, especially when Robbie is convinced that monsters can be real. On one evening, while searching for a bedtime story from the shelf, Robbie finds a peculiar red book called ""The Babadook"". When Amelia opens that book, she doesn't know that she just opened a door for something else.The Babadook was refreshingly interesting and well made. It has some good scares, but luckily the movie doesn't sink to basic Hollywood tricks - which are nowadays almost a cliché. Instead the movie gathers focus to the mother, her son and their attempts to survive, even when the enemy is not always clear. There will be lots of doubt, lots of ""aha"" moments and the watcher is slowly sucked in with the story.Beware - this movie will not only haunt you. After watching this you will realize that Babadook is always with you.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
High-end horror,"Classic horror movies have always gained their power from externalising on screen those deep, dark fears we'd rather forget. Whether it be the 1930s Universal Movie Monsters which were updates of long-told folk tales or the Slasher boom of the 1970s and 1980s with their commentary on the fallibility of our own parents, a good horror movie has always been one which knows how to push our buttons and is not afraid to, well, scare us. Unfortunately, many horror movies over the last couple of decades have taken the superficial route of quiet-loud dynamics and/or excessive gore to get byand oh how boring it is. However, Writer/Director Jennifer Kent has delivered something which, although not a ""classic"", nevertheless takes the horror back to the disturbing territory where it thrives.Amelia (Essie Davis) is a single mother struggling to cope. She is still finding it difficult to deal with the violent death of her husband several years before and her young son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is terrified by a monster which he believes is haunting him. At first Amelia dismisses his claims as a particularly disruptive form of childish imagination but when a creepy book is delivered which tells the story of Mr. Babadook, she begins to suspect that a sinister presence is indeed nearby.The film then shows Amelia as she slowly unravels and succumbs to the monsters malevolence, in the process becoming a threat to both herself and Samuel. Upto this point the movie has crafted a bleak and empty atmosphere illustrative of the emotional landscape of a woman at the end of her tether. However, from this point on the movie shifts into brutal and horrifying territory. Now, don't get me wrongeven at its most terrifying moments, the film never once resorts to the cheap scare-tactics so overemployed by contemporary horrors. Instead, the scares build on the actions of the characters which have been meticulously built on the carefully constructed atmosphere.By the end I felt exhausted from the ordeal of watching someone purge (literally) the corrosive effects of grief to rediscover the fundamental values of their existence. Heavy stuff, and certainly an emotional weight not something usually ascribed to the horror genre. Which is the real tragedyas this kind of emotional raw-nerve is precisely the ground horror was built to explore.In some ways it reminded me of Andrzej Zulawski's 'Possession' (1981) in that, while still a horror, it is more art-house than grind-house. For this reason the film may confuse or alienate some. However, if you have a real regard for the potential of the genre then it is well worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scared me a lot,"I watched so many horror films ... I should be in hell. This movies scares me because of the Reaktion to the innocent child and the demon hiding in the dark corners of his room. It is so schizophrenic and still believable. The babadook is better than any mike Myers, because he acts only in the details, which makes you think he it is only the illusion of the mother. Even when I think about the tv scene I get goosebumps. Why not 9 or8 for this movie? Because the ending is somehow confusing and the son seem to be healed from his weird behaviour just without any reason. It is not scary as get out or not so schizophrenic like the shining.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genuine new horror film,"I thought this was a great film, although like the 'The Witch' you need to approach this film with a new look at horror style movies. It's a fairly low budget film so don't expect Hollywood dressings.However this film struck me in that it cleverly intertwines several quite complex ideas around a very creepy character...the Babadook.At the end you will not be disappointed with what this film has to offer! I think it deserves an 8 and it's a very fresh understanding of how horror can manifest itself in our lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Functional little horror,"'Babadook' has come in for some 'high praise' from a lot of the people who have seen it. I'm not sure that I'd go as far as to praise it highly here, but it's not that bad. I think that the reason it's been so well received is because it is slightly better than the average horror movie. Let's face it... just because there are load of horror films around right now, that doesn't mean that most of them are totally forgettable.The 'Babadook' is vaguely better than the average modern horror film. It's dark and moody, yet at the same never really reveals the 'time period' it's supposed to be set in – people dress and speak like they're from the nineteen forties then use a mobile phone (couldn't spot an iphone though).It's about a single mother and her son. The youngster clearly suffers from various 'behavioural problems' – many of which stem from his father's untimely demise on the day of his birth. He's expelled from school and his mother does her best to raise him. Only there's a bad book (or anagram of 'Babadook' if you noticed?) in their house that seems to bring on an equally bad presence in the house.And the 'bad presence' is pretty eerie and nicely done. That's another plus point. Then you also have the child actor. Now, ninety per cent of kids in films deserve to be eaten by monsters and, despite this young boy spending much of the early part of the film screaming, he just about does enough to stop you from completely hating him.There's nothing new here. It could almost be 'The Ring' under another name. If you don't watch much horror, you may enjoy it more as you probably won't have seen as much like it before. However, if – like me – you've seen a hundred and one different spooks tormenting a hundred and one different families, then there's a certain amount of de ja vu going on here. It's not bad. I didn't resent sitting through it. I just can't promise not to forget it totally in a few months time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you like horror films that aren't scary and boring, this is for you.","First of all I can only assume that the good reviews that this film has received are from infants or people that have never watched a decent horror film.

I have never left a review on a film before and I have seen so many. I only watch horror films and I believe I know the difference between a good one and a bad one. If you put this film in the 'Adam's family' or 'Beetlejuice' category, then you might be slightly (emphasis on slightly) scared. All in all this filmed sucked worse than a drunk toothless hooker.

"Overall, a fairly terrifying horror movie","I really liked the movie. I really did. It scared me and had me looking away from the screen a lot, which is great. I love it when horror movies can do that to me. Essie Davis gives an awesome performance that really made me feel for her character. The relationship between her and her son at the end was actually really touching. Every scene with either the book or The Babadook were really sweet and I really liked the ending (except for one part, which was kind of stupid). Yet, I didn't love this movie. To me, it felt like the movie had all these amazing things in it, but they weren't really put together in the best possible way. Not to say it failed miserably at it, I just felt like it could have been a bit better in that regard. You might not even notice this, as I have a sneaking suspicion that this is a problem only I have, but who knows. As I mentioned previously, I like the ending, except for one thing in it. *Spoiler warning* At the end, Essie Davis defeats The Babadook, I guess you could say, and it runs off to the basement and stays there. Fine, whatever. But then we get a scene of Essie Davis going to the basement with a bowl of worms to feed it, which was really weird to me. I mean I get it. She wants to keep it contained, but it makes me laugh to think that this evil creature that freaked me out so much can be subdued with a bowl of worms. I don't know, it's that that big of an issue. It was just kind of silly. In the end, the movie scared me, which is the main thing I need from a horror movie.Combine that with all the other good things, and you've got something worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

And that lunatic hyper-active screaming kid didn't seem to add anything to my inability to find the monster. Yeah, the mother was nuts. Yeah, the kid was nuts. But where did the ""horror"" come in to play? And why did it mysteriously end? Because the mother decided she was crazy? Really... seriously... this was horrendous.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ghosts of Life,"There are times during the viewing of ""The Babadook"" that I feel too overwhelmed with the tragedy of a widowed mother and her little son. One feels the realism and gets suffocated. My sympathy runs back and forth between the mother and the son. Before I know it, I feel for the two characters very deeply. After the film's director Jennifer Kent has that feeling registered and established in my mind, I am ready to follow her to any length. The Babadook thus seems real, scary, and very, very disturbing. Anytime it acts up, we feel. This is a great accomplishment of this first-time feature film director. She makes a drama-horror film to work so well. I am not so sure if her being a woman has a lot to do with this deep sentiment of a mother-son relationship, especially the one with a deceased husband as well as a woman's sexual needs. My guess is that it does. Another contribution is the respect Jennifer Kent has for the audience at large. She does not try to over-explain anything. She really wants you in there with her, as opposed to pushing us into a spook house and laughing her heart out at our reactions. Drawing from ""The Babadook"", I conclude that a horror film that works must make us deeply care for the characters, so the subsequent fate of theirs will always be construed as our business. This fact may be true to an art piece in any form, but for a film such as this type, mandatory.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Obscure Australian horror film impresses,"The Babadook is an amazing little horror film. I recently purchased the special edition DVD, and was not disappointed. While I had never heard of this film, just reading the synopsis on the back cover sold me on it.This is one little thrill ride of a horror film!!!! Phenomenal performances by Essie Davis as a widowed mother, and Noah Wiseman, as her idiosyncratic son, are what makes this film tick. Radek Ladczak's eerily beautiful cinematography, and heart pounding sound effects add to the creepiness of this little gem.When a strange children's book shows up mysteriously on a bedroom bookshelf, the horror begins! In someways, the Mr. Babadook pop-up book , is scarier than the film itself. With each reading, the book becomes more and more disturbing to the boy's mother.This film will both sadden and shock you to the core!!! I highly recommend it to all movie lovers, for while it is a taut little horror film, it is also an astounding study of human grief. Don't miss it!!!!!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Might be one of the best horror films of recent years, except they felt the need to tell you up front exactly what was going to happen and what the central metaphor is","A solid horror movie which was, for me, a little disappointing. I kept hearing it was the best horror flick in a long while, and I just can't agree. The set-up feels a little cliché, first off. The biggest flaw is that the central metaphor (and pretty much the whole plot) is laid out in such a hamfisted way, I was just watching it play out exactly the way they said it was going to. The monster, the Babadook, is a shadowy entity that's haunting a single mother and her poorly behaved six year-old son. Early in the film, the child finds a strange storybook and has his mother read it as a bedtime story - it's this book that tells us the whole story up front (more its second appearance a little while later than right away). As unsurprising as it, it's still fairly successful. There are plenty of nice chills to be had. Essie Davis, who plays the mother, is absolutely fantastic, actually giving one of the best performances of the year. The son, Noah Wiseman, well, let's just say you're going to want to strangle him from the outset. That's exactly the reaction Jennifer Kent wanted, and thus his casting is beyond perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Efficient But The Short Film Was Much Better,"I saw Jennifer Kent's short film MONSTER a couple of hours ago and if there one thing more shocking than the scare tactics in that film it's how easy it is to find online the feature length film MONSTER inspired . If nothing else it means that a film that would have remained unknown and obscure as been given a much wider audience . The question is if it's worth seeing ?The answer is probably yes but with rather strict reservations . If you're looking for an expanded version of MONSTER unfortunately you might be left a little disappointed . Where as in that short the monster was the focus of the story here it's little more than a plot device and its great strength was scare tactics which it carried off brilliantly . Here however it's the mother / young son dynamic that is important and the horrors are of a more psychological nature . Despite being written and directed by Jennifer Kent THE BABADOOK doesn't share a lot with MONSTERThe flaw with THE BABADOOK is that there's not a lot of narrative drive . We get hints that something is not right in Amelia's household but nothing really happens until well in to the second half of the movie . Before then the story revolves around the mother Amelia and her son Samuel . Essie Davis as Amelia is good in her role but the character is rather unlikable and unsympathetic , and you get the feeling the producers are trying a bit too hard to get a few mainstream award nods for Davis . Unfortunately Noah Wiseman as Samuel is simply dreadful and one of those irritating kids you hope something nasty happens toIn summary THE BABADOOK is efficient as a psychological horror film . It relies on suspense and mystery rather than violence and gore but if you've seen MONSTER then all the things you loved about that short are conspicuous by their absence so this version isn't really a version of the short but still manages to get a generous 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A great piece of psychological, supernatural, and creature horror.","This was a phenomenal piece of horror. This movie recaptures what made horror movies great in the past. This film took everything that the horror industry has ignored and runs with it. Likable characters, great acting, and hardly any jump scares. Its all in the subtleties. The atmosphere is astonishingly uncomfortable and eerie. The uncanny nature of all the actors is palatable. The movie isn't perfect however. The kids performance was less than stellar even for kid performances. The lower budget is obvious when sound effects abruptly cut off indicating that they were put in later. The sound the Babadook makes in the trailer is cut off because if you heard the sound in the movie, the sound clip cuts off before the end of the 'k' sound. A few times the sound of banging doesn't echo and just plays and ends. The camera work was odd. Several times the mom lays under her covers and then the sun rises. Not bad, just weird. The ending really disappointed me. I won't spoil it here, but its not fitting. Other than that, its quite excellent. Its on Netflix, so give it a look!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Babadook (8/10),"Rarely, do horror movies that are all hype before release, or seen by the masses, actually deserve the acclamation, but The Babadook absolutely does. This Australian horror thriller bases its fright from a mysterious children's book called Mister Babadook. Once the mother, played by Essie Davis, reads the babadook book to her horribly behaved son, Noah Wiseman, all sorts of chaos ensues. At first it's hard to tell if Mister Babadook is real, or it's the characters imagination, but as the movie continues the pieces to the puzzle start getting put into place. It's unfortunate that the ending left out a few pieces leaving an empty taste after watching it. Anyway, the scares and tension is definitely there in this movie and is quite unsettling at parts. The direction is stellar, it's an original script and solid performance. As a longtime horror viewer it's hard to say movies scare me anymore but Babadook sure did make hairs stand on end and create some tensed up muscle moments.

Atmospheric and creepy,"Another really good horror entry this year. Not particularly original, like at all, but some effective atmosphere, some great suspense, and some strong acting make this certainly worthwhile. Sadly, I wasn't a big fan of the last 20 minutes or so. It just got silly and deflated a lot of the suspense, although it wasn't like a train wreck though. Still, very much recommended, and I got a new scary (or funny, depending on how you look at it) catchphrase. I'm sure many will be discouraged by the fact that this really isn't anything new (Sinister and The Conjuring come to mind, more so the former) but still, supremely effective at times, worth it.",,Anonymous,Horror
It goes under your skin!,"For me, there're three sorts of horrors. 1. The gruesome ones: Movies like the exorcist, Rosemarry's baby, the exorcism of Emily Rose etc. 2. The awesome ones: the evil dead (2013), planet terror, final destination... we all know a couple! 3. The ones that creep under your skin: it, the shining, el orfanato, the blair witch project...This movie is a number three. It's not as good as any of the movies mentioned above... but it does bring something new to the genre. The movie doesn't hang on creepy sounds, shock moments and gore. Actually the movie is quiet theatrical. It builds up suspense in this dreamy feel. Mostly created by the editing and cinematography, which are both brilliant.The cast is pretty good. Many people mentioned they hated the boy (his character, not the actor), as I did to. But it's absolutely necessary for the story, so bare with it.

Female driven Horror with deeper meaning.,"Every now and again we stumble across a new and innovative looking film trailer that pricks up our senses, giving us hope that there are still original ideas left in the over troped world of cinema. Trailers, which bring us that feeling which my lucky generation had during the Indie era of filmmaking. Where a story didn't fit a mold that was set years before by the cookie cutter flicks which became the standard. New concepts tackling bigger issues than man saves damsel in distress or god forbid another B.S. horror villain that will spews out the next big franchise. Many moons ago I came across one such trailer (as many on the internet did) called The Babadook (2014). ""What the hell is a Babdook?"" was an utterance heard anytime I recommended it to family or friends. ""Just watch,"" was always my reply. And with that, let's hop in the Wayback machine and check out a trailer posted many months ago: All caught up. Wonderful. Let's get into it then.The Babadook, directed by first time feature writer/director Jennifer Kent, tells the story of a single mother named Amelia (played disconcertingly perfect by Essie Davis) who is coming to grips with both the death of her husband as well as the trying needs of her only son Samuel (Noah Wiseman in an unnervingly strong performance), who, after finding a strange pop-up book, believes an evil entity named The Babadook has become more than just a character from the macabre bedtime tale. After strange occurrences around her home coupled with Samuel's increasingly erratic behavior continue, Amelia begins to break. Disturbed by her Samuel's obsession with protecting her from the (possibly) imaginary being, Amelia lapses into a mental state which questions whether there is something wrong with her weapon building son or have her own limit of stress driven her over the edge of sanity.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Drama-Horror hybrid at its finest, for what it's worth. Or: How acting and mood make a good film great.","The first word that came to mind when I tried to think how I would eventually review and rate this film was ""different"". The Babadook is absolutely different. I wouldn't say unique, or one of a kind, but it definitely has its own uniqueness which makes it unlike other films, and a lot better than most. Now, let me try and verbally describe the sensations brought upon by watching this.First of all, the the plot is successful in being intriguing and fascinating regardless to having a pretty ordinary story. A mother and her small neurotic child face a supernatural being. We've seen it in the Hollywood adaptation of The Ring, ans in many other films whose names I am simply unable to recall at the moment. And, the inter-character dynamics and the slow downward spiral into insanity and despair make the suspense strong enough to overcome the overall mood and ambiance.Second, as I've just mentioned, the mood and ambiance. The characters, the acting, the cinematography and the story create an almost unbearable sensation of discomfort, awkwardness and uneasiness. One could almost taste the stress, strain and frustration gone through by the mother, as well the fear and despair of the child. In a way, watching The Babadook is like going through a mental breakdown. More Drama than Horror, yet excellently executed and serves the overall sensation very well.The acting is in all ways superb. The lead roles by Essie Davis (Amelia) and Noah Wiseman (her son Samuel) are absolutely marvelous, and the supporting cast isn't any less amazing. One could understand the main plot and the relationships and dynamics between the characters simply by watching the actors and actresses do their job. As a viewer who is always impressed by young characters, Wiseman's acting was in my opinion the best, but altogether the acting is way more realistic, authentic and disbelief suspending than the usual Hollywood acting in Horror films.As for the supernatural part, we don't really see the Babadook, but we definitely feel its presence and its relentless grip on the main characters. The effects are just right, not too flamboyant yet not lacking, And of course, the book... Dear Lord, that book is probably responsible to 50% of the Horror motive of this film, if not more. The film also uses some jump scares emphasized by the eerie aggressive soundtrack, but these only serve to support the overall sensation of haunting and fear, not to solely create them.There were some parts of the film I didn't like, of course. As a six year old boy, Wiseman's character is way too capable if you ask me, not to mention way to courageous... That is not how I would expect a 6 year old to deal with a supernatural evil terrorizing him and his mother, and how he'd been able to create his ""toy"" weapons is beyond me... Also, the ending wasn't only anticlimactic but a flat disappointment. I'm not only referring to the lack of plot twists, but to the complete lack of logic and accordance with the plot. That film deserved a better ending.All in all, I can't say this film was ""fun"" to watch. The uneasy awkward feeling it gives throughout most of it is not enjoyable. Then again, it isn't meant to be. While most Horror films dealing with supernatural evils and the haunting of characters aim mainly for fear, the Babadook uses the plot tools usually utilized by different sub-genres like the ones dealing with torture, hunts, murderers and such others. It is still, in my opinion, a great film achieving precisely the goals set out by it. I don't think I'll be watching it again, but I would definitely recommend it to Horror fans looking for something new, innovative and refreshing in a genre that usually fails in breaking the boundaries of old.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A drama about depression and bereavement with horror elements,"I attended the UK premiere last night. It was a double feature and the Babadook was screened after The Evil Dead 2 which may have influenced the audience's reaction to the film.The main theme of the story is coping with depression and bereavement.This film felt more like a drama with minor horror elements than a full horror film.There is a slow build over the first 30-40 minutes before The Babadook actually appears on screen. During this time quite a few members of the audience broke out into conversations. It struggled to hold the audiences attention. When The Babadook does appear, the horror scenes are a disappointment. The Babadook looks almost identical to the Hitcher from The Mighty Boosh comedy series. I didn't find it frightening in the least.The film attempts 1 or 2 ""jump scares"" that didn't really land with the audience at my screening. It followed a very formulaic beat. It certainly is not Sinister or Insidious in that regard.I thought all the characters in the film were unlikeable. Every single Character is shown at some point to say spiteful things to other characters. The young boy in the film is portrayed as the character you should root for but the child actor is so annoying it makes it difficult to care for him. He's a child so annoying that his mother and auntie can't even stand him. He screams and shouts almost all of his dialogue and his voice will annoy you by the mid way point of the film. By the end of the film I really didn't care who died and who lived.The positives: The film does try to be intelligent and carries a message. The metaphor for depression and bereavement are great ideas but are so unsubtle I felt like I was being hit over the head with it by the director shouting ""do you get it?? the monster is depression!!"" The cinematography and lighting is fantastic. There are some beautiful shots in the film and the way the house transforms at night is really enjoyable to see.I would not recommend this film to cinema goers looking for a fun popcorn horror movie. There is no comic relief at all in this film. I left feeling as tired and depressed as the characters on screen. The depressing themes and slow build make this film a chore to get through. The first act does build tension and the set up with the childs storybook is a great idea. Unfortunately, the film fails to deliver upon that set up in act 2 and 3.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Alien vs predator directors cut was better and it was not as good as avatar special edition i support the film industry is-nit so I always buy my movies off the Chinese man down the road. I have to write ten bloody lines is-nit it's terrible so I've got to keep writing is-nit bloody hell mate I can't believe it the review doesn't need to be ten lines long for gods sake I haven't had to type this much in years is-nit mate. The directors cut was also a brilliant movie I have to say is-nit oh my my god save the queen is-nit mate bloody hell. You see alien vs predator is good isn't it because you've got alien and predators in the movie isn't it and avatar is good but avatar special edition was the best movie I have ever seen I have to say in all fairness,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Go into it with the right mindset,"I was trying to decide whether to watch this movie or Jessabelle, so I got on here and read a few reviews of each film. What really helped me with The Babadook was a review in which someone stated that it was not your typical ""make you jump"" horror movie. It definitely is not. It was definitely creepy. They did not need to resort to making you flinch to get your attention. This is the type of movie that will get into your head just a tad. It is a bit like The Shining. I like the fact that the actors are not your typical model-esque characters. They are everyday looking people. Australia and the UK are good about that though. It held my attention the entire time. It is very psychological as well as supernatural. All you need to do is go into this film with the right mindset. That can make all the difference.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Babawhat?,"This decent if somewhat over praised modern psychological horror film stars Essie Davis as Amelia. Amelia is a single mother raising six year old Samuel (Noah Wiseman) by herself because the husband / father died while trying to transport Amelia to the hospital in the first place. Now Samuel is acting very strangely, insisting that he's interacting with the terrifying spectral beast of the title. His troubling (to say the least) behaviour leads her to start really losing her mind, which has already been in a fragile state ever since hubby's death.This viewer found it a little too hard to care that much about these main characters, and the basic story is rather average. Yes, writer / director Jennifer Kent does deserve some credit, for choosing to go a mostly traditional route in terms of horror. She creates a mood, and an atmosphere, and some genre fans will be pleased to note that, for the most part, she eschews the use of excessive gore. She's also smart to keep her villain shadowy and vague and barely seen; while this approach might not appeal to some horror devotees, this viewer thinks that, often, the less he knows about the antagonist, the better. Lastly, Kent never allows special effects to overtake any drama, keeping them to a minimum.The performance from leading lady Davis certainly reveals a deep sense of commitment. Granted, her histrionics come off as a little much, but she absolutely does not phone this performance in. She gives it her all. Little Wiseman is pretty impressive, and appealing through it all.Overall, a good watch, not a great one.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simply put the best horror film i've seen in years,"Reviewing a horror film without spoiling it is next to impossible. So please just go and watch this film as blind as possible so you ca enjoy everything it has to offer. So very LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD.Seriously i have nothing bad to say about this film so here we go with the good. The performances are incredible. Not only from the mother(seriously this is Oscar nomination worthy) but also from her son who couldn't be more than 10 years old. No jump scares is also a godsend in this day in age.But really the 2 best things about this film are it's unrelenting tension and incredible horror gimmick. Like most of my favourite horror gimmicks(how death works in Final Destination, the 8mm films in Sinister or the VHS in The Ring) this will captivate you and terrify you in equal measure. All i will say is that it's a book.But really it's all about the tension. The second the book is introduced the movie grabs your balls and doesn't let go. You will fear every sound and everything you see or don't see and really it's a feeling that can only be experienced and not explained.It also is a thinking man's horror film. It probably won't stop you from sleeping but it will definitely make you think and wonder about what just happened in the past 1h30. It's very clear but also open to interpretation which is a very hard thing to do especially in horror films.So if you like to allow your body to contort in your couch in fear then turn off the lights, pump up the sound and enjoy a truly well crafted piece of horror.This has been a green review",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
haunted by a children's book,"I'm sure a lot went into this and the boy and mother were together throughout the whole film. But I found that the boy was rather annoying and irritating although he had lost his father very young. To be haunted by a children's book is rather odd and the mother is more than a bit odd but she has to have a difficult time, and us as well. I thought The Babadook was well done and there are some screams but probably too many. Essie Davis as the mother and Noah Wiseman as the boy must have put a lot into it but it is rather slow and then there had to be lots of cheap thrills all the time to stop us from falling asleep. Towards the end the Exorcist bits were way over the top and I'm afraid that it made me smile. A good effort but too much about the book and unfortunately we are asked to move into the area of depression and madness.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Movie About the Greatest Horror of All,"If you can get over your initial disappointment that ""The Babadook"" is not the scarefest it was built up to be, you might just find yourself enjoying a well-made and even groundbreaking -- in its own modest way -- psychological thriller.And don't get me wrong: ""The Babadook"" is scary, it's just not scary in the visceral horror movie kind of way. It's scary because it's about mental illness, and anyone who's dealt with illnesses of the mind in real life knows that they are far more horrifying than any monsters or serial killers horror movies can conjure. It's impossible to watch ""The Babadook"" and not experience it as a kind of gender-reversed version of ""The Shining."" But it has enough originality to stand on its own apart from Kubrick's classic. And it's that gender reversal that makes ""The Babadook"" so horrifying and so unlike any other horror movie I can think of. How often are mothers the monsters, and how much scarier does it get from a child's point of view than to find your chief enemy being the one person who you take for granted will protect you at all costs.Indeed, ""The Babadook"" is almost too effective at times. I'm particularly bothered by films about children in peril, and especially films that dwell on the fear of a child. ""The Babadook"" is tough to watch at times for this reason, and it came close to crossing the border that separates for me a film that's disturbing in an enjoyable way and one that's not.I loved the ending of this film, and the suggestion that an emotion like grief is not something to be eradicated but rather something that needs to be attended to and nurtured for the rest of a person's life. You can keep it at bay and not let it dominate you, but the only way to do that is to acknowledge that it's there every once in a while.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm perplexed at the high rating.,"I've been an avid horror movie fan for 25 years, and in my opinion, there are several elements that make a good horror movie, such as creepy music to build anticipation, spooky camera and lighting techniques, and good acting to believe the characters are really scared. The Babadook had almost none of these. I'mp not sure how this movie got such a high rating of 6.8, which is considered really good for a horror movie.Also, one of the sounds that the monster makes is a stock sound effect used by movies and videos games in the past. I went to google, and was definitely not the only person that noticed this.The parts that weren't supposed to be scary were also fairly boring. I know horror movies must have some non scary material to build a story, and so you can get to know the characters, but I was not entertained by the non horror elements. I now realize why I have not heard of this movie until 10 years after it's release.There is also the possibility that since the movie is Australian, an Australian audience may appreciate this more than I did, but overall I found the film to be bland, not scary, and completely forgettable.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not as smart as it thinks it is but I'll take it over a lot of other supposedly superior ""horror"".","The first scene was laughable but from the second I got the immediate impression I was watching a superior horror movie.The conflict between a bereaved mother and her problem child is enough to make dark, unsettling viewing even without the horror elements.But I take issue with these horror movie antagonists who feels the need to just mess with their hosts for 60 minutes before just killing or possessing them or whatever it is they want.A lot of people have stated ""metaphor for depression"" and I really don't want to give it that much credit. I liked the beautiful art within art in the form of that excellent book that just keeps coming back.But although rather chilling and engaging with two horrifically convincing performances as mother and son not seeing eye to eye there is so much wrong with this. Despite the relative freshness of the story (I know it's an incorporeal terror in a house that terrorized people apparently for fun but trust me it's fresher than a lot of other movies with the same premise) there are so many wrong notes.In one seen the phone rings and all we hear on the other end is a strained voice saying ""Babadooooook...Babadoooooook"". This immediately makes the thing something corporeal and kills the mood almost irreparably. Various other shooting tricks that should have been left in the '20s also make the picture more funny than scary. And what is up with them showing movies within the movie?This is a movie with some good talent behind it sadly collapsed under its own smugness and complacency. But you could do so much worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I read about 25 reviews and I feel better that after watching this BABADOOK (A BAD BOOK) twice, I do not know what the heck is going on. No conviction in any of the ideas offered. So then, after reading a few synopsi, a bunch of reviews, watching it 1.8 times, replaying seemingly crucial scenes so as to be sure I'm not missing a key moment, and thinking out loud with my 22 year old boy, I challenge any and all who scored above 740 on their English SAT score to give it a try and report back here,,,,,. please.

Suspenseful psychological thriller,The majority of the negative reveiws that come from this movie stains from the fact that how it was advertised. it was advertising if you were going to get a monster movie when that is not at all or even what the Babadook stands for. It is about a mother and son coming to grips with the death of the father and a husband and how the mother slowly start to develop a huge sign of depression and stress in the form of insomnia. The son Sam Despise being a kid unfortunately is one of the cons of the movie he just screams and yells constantly throughout the film to the point they start to become excruciating to the audience as well as to the mother. The Babadook well not actually a monster in The traditional sense is the obstacle to overcome and this film and what it actually represents makes sense as you progress through the film.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I can say that this is not a regular kind of horror , I can compare it to indie rock music vs classic rock music . It has its benefits but in general it looks kinda strange and i believe many of the viewers wouldn't understand it and as a result wouldn't like it so much.

An Emotionally Thrilling Ride,"The Babadook was a deeply thought-provoking and creepy film. The film focuses on Amelia (Essie Davis) and her problematic and disturbed son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Both Amelia and Samuel are still dealing with deep emotional wounds, as Amelia's husband passed away years ago. Despite her efforts to ignore and move on from her husband, the wounds are still present, and Amelia finds her relationship with her son grow very testy. On top of the emotional baggage both individuals carry, we see that Samuel is clearly a troubled child. He is constantly having trouble socializing and getting along with others and even becomes dangerous and violent in certain moments.The performances from both Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman were phenomenal. I felt the stress and hopelessness that Amerila felt while trying her best to raise a child who needs special treatment all with no help. I understood how deeply confused and troubled Samuel must feel when it seems that nobody likes him, even his own mother. Both these actors gave it their all and it really showed. On top of the acting performance, the makeup was on point. We clearly saw a decline in the health of Amelia as the movie progressed. The lack of sleep and emotional trauma was taking a toll not only mentally, but physically as well, and this was masterfully shown in her appearance throughout the film.Arguably the greatest part of the movie is the monster itself. The babadook was introduced through a book, and even the reading scene of the book had me on edge, let alone when we saw or heard the monster. The babadook gave off a very eerie feeling and it was definitely creepy. What adds an extra layer to this fear was what the babadook actually represented, which is emotional trauma. Everybody goes through life and suffers some emotional wounds, and it is important to deal with them in a healthy manner. The Bababdook shows why ignoring your problems or past won't make it go away. Hopefully everyone who watches heeds the warning.Overall rating 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A movie about grief.,"This movie is not only a very well crafted thriller, but I think it was a very poignant metaphor about the nature of grief.A single mother, Amelia, is struggling to deal with her emotionally disturbed seven-year-old son, Samuel. As it transpires, Amelia's husband died in a car crash on the way to the hospital on the same day that Samuel was born.Amelia is clearly not coping. She is exhausted and run ragged, all of her relationships are suffering, she flies into a rage whenever someone mentions her husband, and she pulls her son out of school after he starts screaming at an invisible person he calls 'The Babadook'.The 'Babadook' is a creepy little children's book that hits Amelia a little too close to home. Samuel insists that the Babadook is real, warns that it kill them both, and tells his mother to ""not let it in."" Then the horror begins, expertly building-up via a psychological slow burn to a very satisfying conclusion.I believe that the Babadook itself is a metaphor for the nature of grief, and in particular, pathological grief. Amelia's grief over her husband has absolutely crippled her, had a catastrophic effect on her ability to function, and prevented her from bonding with her son. In the end, it threatens to consume them both, until she finds more appropriate ways of coping.The production design of this movie (and in particular the design of the book itself) was tremendous.This was a fantastic little psychological thriller. I wish more horror movies were this clever.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Refreshing perspective on the horror genre,"Major kudos to Aussie director Jennifer Kent, who managed to distill down all the pain and loneliness of being a working-class single mother, into one of the most frightening ghost stories I've seen.

Here's to female directors willing to explore issues all too often ignored in film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hype unjustified,"I am writing this review solely to objectively state that it does not deserve a 10 on any scale. I have seen outstanding reviews and while not a bad film entirely this is unjust. My rating is almost confined to the genre of horror because otherwise it really does not compare to other films id label a 6 so in comparison with similar films it hits a 6.To keep it short I've seen many horror films involving paranormal activity/poltergeists etc. such as paranormal activity (1,2,3...) the conjuring, dark skies, it follows just naming first that come to mind. As the others do also, there are very few ideas that are original and not taken from older films such as the Poltergeist. The film is very very basic when it comes to the actual effects of the babadook; bed shaking, closet noises, doors opening, random faces etc. for that it is hard to take the film seriously more towards the end and the late quarter of the film spoils it.However positively, this films does build a character better than a lot of others in this genre and the acting from the main lady and boy is better than most and enjoyable. The mental decline of the mum and the boy's disobedience is played well. OK film for its genre, people are getting very carried away when there are many, many like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"no jump scares, but definitely liked","First, I would like to say that those giving this movie a low rating, like a one, have a didn't appreciation for horror movies than I do. This movie doesn't have scares, in my opinion, and it's completely okay without it. Sometimes, horror movies are about the tale itself. If you were to read a story about the bogey man as Ann adult, would you be scared? No. You'll have doubts of his existence. However, that doesn't mean the story isn't horrifying! That's how this movie is. It's actually interesting, because the characters aren't all over the place. The mother reacts like most people would while in denial. The kid made me want to hit him in the beginning, and I felt bad for the mother. I won't go into the details about it, because you should see it for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Plenty to suggest that this is a director to keep an eye on,"Ever watched Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace (1999) and found yourself wanting to slap little Jake Lloyd, rather than the much-despised Jar Jar Binks? Can't stand Jonathan Lipnicki's sentiment-cloying turn in Jerry Maguire (1996)? Ever wished Jonathan Ke Quan's Short Round had met his doom in the eponymous Temple of Doom (1984)? Well, prepare yourself for Noah Wiseman in The Babadook, the most eye-gougingly annoying little s**t ever to step in front of a camera. Only, he's meant to be, and Wiseman is astonishingly good as young Samuel, every parent's worst nightmare who sees a monster no- one else does.His mother Amelia (Essie Davis), an orderly living with the memory of her lover's death on the day of Samuel's birth, is at her wit's end. Samuel's teachers have given up on him, her sister doesn't want her child anywhere near him, he fashions weapons meant for serious harm, and his behaviour is only getting more unpredictable. She pulls him out of school and takes some time off work to help deal with the problem. One day, Samuel gives his mother a pop-up he finds on his shelf - a terrifying, black and white tale of a monster named The Babadook, who enters your home and eventually your body, manipulating you and driving you mad.Soon enough, strange things start to happen around the house, as the outside world becomes increasingly distant in Amelia's troubled mind. She finds glass in her food, doors open and close on their own, and social services are coming round looking suspicious. Samuel promises to protect his mother with his various traps and devices, but his erratic behaviour subsides, and Amelia starts to see the monster for herself. The Babadook is a manipulative, jet-black creature, crawling along walls and ceilings. But is the monster real or is it a result of Amelia's deteriorating mental state and increasing frustration with her child?For a debut full feature, The Babadook is very impressive. Director Jennifer Kent directs with a natural flair and a definite knowledge of horror tropes. The film often resembles Roman Polanski's Repulsion (1965), with the house becoming a metaphor for Amelia's psychological prison, and there are plenty of scares that don't rely on a loud noise to make the audience jump out of their seat (or skin). However, it does outstay it's welcome, taking a steady course from psychological study to full-blown horror, even though the whole thing is much more interesting in the build-up. The CGI monster is also an ill-fitting distraction from the realism of the drama. But, Davis is very good and Wiseman is probably better, and there is still plenty here to suggest that this is a director to keep an eye on.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrifically bad,"I have never written a review on IMDb and I probably never will again, but I felt a strong desire to bring the rating of this movie down closer to where it should be (1 star).I cannot understand why anyone would think this movie was ""nothing shy of the most terrifying film ever made"". REALLY? REALLY????? I LOVE horror - particularly post-1990s, but there was nothing scary about this movie. There was nothing interesting about it.It was incredibly slow moving. Boring. And explained very little as to what the babadook was or wanted. The ending made absolutely no sense at all, and the kid was weird and annoying.I actually hated it. It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen - and that is after seeing movies such as Israeli film ""The Slut"" (it was on Foxtel and my friend and I had nothing else to do!) and half of ""Sharknado"" (I turned it off halfway through because it was so bad).It is such a shame that it was an Australian movie, because I know we can do so much better - The Loved Ones (fantastic!).I hope you see the light and don't waste an hour and a half of your life on this rubbish.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is not a horror film...,"In the true sense. This is a story about grief, about a very difficult child and how that grief affects a womans ability to deal with that child. There are no real ghost or monsters in this, just the damaged mind of a widow with a child who is as damaged by grief as she is. We need To Talk About Kevin is far nearer the mark than Poltergeist or the like. The performances are tremendous; Essie Davis is phenomenal and Noah Wiseman does exactly what is needed.

Flipping brilliant,"This movie is brilliant.It's unnerving - it gets under your skin in the best way. It's not about jump scares, or stupid little cheap loud bangs. I sat there thinking ""I'm OK, this is fine, I'm not scared"" only to realize at the next scary scene that my soul was trembling. It's the kind of scary that the shining, the blair witch project, and (I think) games like 'Amnesia' achieve.If you only watch horror movies for the jump scares - then you won't enjoy this. Go watch random loud noises or something.

And I don't know what they did to the woman but she looks like she's dying since the start. Pretty good makeups I'd say. Well written, just a little confusing sometimes. I'm satisfied with the ending because it's not something I expected. I was sure they all would die and that woman would go hella crazy and kill herself too.

The people who didn't like it were too stupid to get it...,"People are generally pretty dumb. When the average person watches a movie, they want to laugh, see explosions, be scared or feel closer to their loved ones. This is a movie for the High Tension, Se7en, A Clockwork Orange, Anti-Christ, Taxi Driver, Requiem for a Dream, Blue Velvet and The Silence of the Lambs crowd. One of its biggest problems is that people think it's a horror movie, it's not. It's a psychological thriller. People see the boogie man and think that's all that it is...it isn't. Although, I do dig the Man in the Beaver Hat.The synopsis is pretty basic, a single (widowed) woman has a bratty kid that she can't deal with. One night, she reads him a bedtime story that begins to haunt them. They have to deal with it. The End.Anybody who gave a negative review of this movie, saw that film which I just described but this is not Saw or Friday the 13th. This movie is way more thought out than that. Most people simply don't want to think that hard...but I do, which is why I am writing this review.If you were hoping for a scary movie with jump scares and gore, there are literally thousands of them. Although this movie has a little of that, this isn't one of them. For the record, I love a lot of those movies too but I also like movies that are smart. This movie is smart. If you don't get it, you're either too dumb or you lacked the attention span to care. I have talked to several people who didn't like this movie and they all thought (as did many reviewers) that it was some ""boogie man"" flick and they all seemed to tune out at the halfway point. That's when you really need to pay attention to this movie. If you watched the whole thing and paid attention to it and you still didn't get it, well, I am sorry but you're an idiot. I mean, they kind of spell it out for you, you were just too dead set on the Michael Meyers in the shadows to realize it.I believe in being honest with people and I stand by my statement, regardless of the backlashes or negativity my comments might create. I grow tired of catering to morons. If you haven't felt offended yet, then, this movie may just be for you. Honestly, it was harder to watch the second time around for me because I knew what the outcome was going to be.I don't want to spoil the movie but if you watch it, remember to think for yourself and pay attention when the book shows up on the doorstep. Just remember...""Whether in a word or in a look, you can't get rid of The Babadook...""",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Emotional drama with a weird horror concept. 6/10,"Review: This is another one of those horror films were the people should have just left the house! It's about a woman who lives with her troubled son who are finding it hard to deal with the loss of her husband, who died in a car accident while they were on the way to the hospital to have there son. The little boy has problems at school because of his weird behaviour and his mum works in an old people's home which doesn't give her much satisfaction. Every night she tries her utmost to get her son to sleep by reading him books and they come across a book called the Babadook which scares the little boy because he thinks that the creatures is real and that he is coming to kill them. After a while, the boys strange behaviour becomes violent and unpredictable so his mum starts to look into the mysterious book which has caused so many problems. She soon finds out that her sons behaviour is connected to the book and that all is not what it seems.The storyline wasn't that amazing but I did find the movie quite entertaining because I really didn't know were the plot was going. I found the little boy incredibly brave and at the age of 7, his weapon making was top notch. The airy feel to the movie, really worked with the storyline and the relationship between the little boy and his mum was sweet and loving, before she became possessed. I really felt for the mum who was suffering with depression and sleep deprivation and when you've got a monster in the house, it really doesn't help. Anyway, the mixture of horror and drama really worked but I didn't get the ending. Watchable!Round-Up: It's always good when an independent movie comes together well at such a low budget. This film is based around a mother and sons relationship which is touching in parts and quite disturbing in others. Its the first major movie from writer/director Jennifer Kent who has only done a few shorts in her career. Essie Davis, who played the lead, has starred in movies like Australia, Matrix Revolutions and the Girl With a Pearl Earring but I really can't remember her in those films. She played her part extremely well in this film and she made this far fetched storyline seem real. The little boy, played by Noah Wiseman, was excellent and his annoying behaviour would have got on any parents nerves. Anyway, it's worth a watch, from many different angles and it could have easily done without the horror aspect because of the touching concept between the mother and son.Budget: $2million Worldwide Gross: $5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/thriller/horrors about a mother and young son who are under attack from a evil force in there house.....The Babadook. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dreadful in almost every way.,"One of those films that make you think you must have watched an entirely different movie to the rest of the world.I keep hearing people say that it was real horror and not cheap scares...and all I saw was the cheapest and most clichéd of scares all badly mishandled.The spooky voice on the phone, the banging at night, the enemy put on fast-forward, the creature in the closet. All present and, unfortunately, incorrect.It had only two redeeming features...the sound design was OK and the Art direction on the book was good. It was poor in every other way.Story was terrible, the dialogue amateur, the set design awful and clearly a sound stage, acting was overwrought and unrealistic, the directing unimaginative and it features what must be the least scary villain in all horror history. Most of all it was just deeply, deeply boring.I felt like there should have been a warning at the cinema that this wasn't a real film...I felt badly ripped off paying standard rate to watch this youtube movie.Avoid, unless you have some severe phobia of marigold gloves.Utter tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Makes Me Want To Die In The Best Way Possible,"This movie isn't what you expect.For months , my brother had been telling me to watch this movie but I don't watch horror movies all that much so I sort of avoided it for the longest time. Then one night, my cousin and I were having a horror movie marathon and he suggested we watch The Babadook. I said ""Why not?""I was in no way prepared for what this movie would bring. It's not your typical jump-scare film. In fact, I think it has MAYBE one jump-scare throughout the whole movie and the movie's an hour and thirty three minutes long. Instead, it uses a psychological aspect that absolutely freak you out. It gets in your head and makes you think one thing, but instead something totally different happens. The Babadook only speaks twice but you spend the whole movie in anticipation expecting it to speak again, knowing if you heard it's voice again, you're whole body would feel terror.The acting in this is FANTASTIC. Essie Davis truly was the perfect pick for the leading lady. I've never seen her in any other movies but after this I will definitely look her up and watch more of her. Noah Wiseman started out a bit awkwardly but as the film went on, he got better and better.This film is simply fantastic and if you enjoy psychological horror films, this is definitely the movie for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I wanted a little more, but overall I like","'The Babadook' is a well done horror film, one that is most definitely creepy.I would've liked more from the monster and how it works, though the film does give you enough and certainly does a fine job at building up the atmosphere of uneasiness that the thing produces. One great part I noticed is the sound editing, which is astutely crafted throughout.Essie Davis does terrific in the role of Amelia, she shows every emotion that her character is feeling nicely - I felt her pain initially with the kid, too. Noah Wiseman plays her son, Samuel. He is actually quite impressive given his age, there are a few scenes where he adds a fair deal to them.It's hearty, suspenseful and attempts proper horror as opposed to forcing things like jump scares, which I will always praise a production in this genre for. I wanted a little more, but overall I like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great concept ruined by unbearable character(s),"Wow...It takes a lot for me to turn off ANY horror film, no matter how bad it seems to be... But this one... WOW.After readings the reviews I was excited to give this film a try as I have been a die hard fan of horror all my life. From what I was reading I was in for a good story line with a great blend of suspense and superb acting.This was not the case.It took all of my power to not turn this off within the first several minutes. Never have I seen such an unbearable character in the young boy Samuel.It gets better... Or worseHoping that the leading lady would turn this film around, the more the film progresses the more you begin to hate her as well.With this intense dislike of the two main characters so early in the film all good that could have come from the ""Babadook"" part of the story is completely lost and overlooked.Highly disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good horror, excellent actress.","Good psychological horror with an excellent performance from Essie Davis. In the last third it lapses into cliché, and becomes over-reliant on supernatural elements. Also, as a study in parental anxiety and breakdown 'The Babadook' is somewhat overstated.

"Really, really good.","If you're like me and aren't really a b-movie ""shock and gore"" fan and just enjoy a well crafted film then you will enjoy this.

I had the advantage of seeing it with absolutely zero expectations, I literally had no idea what it was about or even what genre it was, my wife just told me ""you have to check this out!"" and that was it. I'm assuming it must have been mass marketed as a ""Horror! Scary!"" movie, which, while it is extremely unnerving is not at all what this movie is.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Brief Look at The Babadook,"The lights flicker, bugs begin to crawl, shadows envelop the scene, the Babadook has arrived. Jennifer Kent's The Babadook (2014) is not your quotidian psychological thriller. Beneath the superficial paranormal threat, Kent artfully implements multiple double entendres to be unearthed by the viewer. While doing so, Kent tenaciously utilizes extreme but simple cinematographic elements to induce fear in her audience. Analogous to Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), this film frequently employs earsplitting sounds, disquieting dissonance and a woman's bloodcurdling screams to keep the viewer on edge.
Before being exposed to the Babadook, Kent constructs the platform for her narrative by using precise cinematography to delineate the hardships and emotions of the protagonist, Amelia (Essie Davis). From this structure, the audience is informed of the contemporary grief, stress and frustrations constantly surrounding her. Through such relatable downbeat emotions, Kent presents a character worthy of our sympathy. Moving forward, The Babadook departs from traditional transcendent psychological thrillers by translating Amelia's sentiments into the supernatural-being known as the Babadook. In other words, Amelia's underlying emotions are organized into one paranormal being, thus granting greater significance than the trite demonic antagonist capriciously haunting the principal characters of a film as seen in Oren Peli's Paranormal Activity (2007). Moreover, the initial presentation of Mister Babadook is arguably one of the greatest conventions the film has to offer. As Amelia sits down to read the seemingly innocent children's book, Kent employs an amalgam of close-up pans and cuts along with a shrill insect-like buzzing to hyperbolize the disturbing contents of the wicked red book, ""Mister Babadook"". Thus, leaving the viewer rid with anticipation and fear of the imminent occult threat.
Jennifer Kent's ability to sophistically develop the film to the latter electrifying zenith is subjectively unparalleled. The slow introduction to the tall, rigid figure dressed in a jet-black trench coat and top hat is both enticing and suspenseful, continuously leaving the audience hungry for more. By creating an indirect relationship between Amelia and the demonic aggressor, the viewer is immersed in a complex allegorical narrative rather than a rudimentary hedonistic thriller. Furthermore, the negative emotions that construct the relationship are emotions that many individuals have grappled with in life, resulting in an elaborate alignment between the viewer and the subliminal essence of the film. In retrospect, Jennifer Kent's The Babadook does not disappoint as it proves to be a captivating psychological thriller rich with concealed narratives awaiting subsequent analysis.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Good!,"I finally got to see The Babadook and watched it on Netflix. I was very impressed with how well done the movie was with direction, casting, and overall story and environment. The story involves a mother who comes under attack along with her son after reading a horrifying book. What's interesting is the routes the movie goes and how invested the audience gets in what's going on in the film. I was very horrified and scared not knowing what was truly attacking the son and the mom, and the payoff is very well done. The ending I also found to be both fitting and a nice end to the horrors the mother and son face in the film. I definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in horror movies or wanting to see a film that's a little odd in terms of visuals. 10/10!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I am perplexed to know that people were scared watching this. I have seen more horrifying episodes of Goosebumps.I can't quite comprehend why people loved it.

"You can't get rid of ""The Babadook"".","With a name like ""The Babadook"", this film is expected to be a story about an urban legend becoming reality. However, what Jennifer Kent presents is far more than an ordinary, creepy tale. What ""The Babadook"" depicts is the projection of the distressed human mind, of inner fears and despair. These feelings are manifested through a struggling single mother, Amelia, and her six-year-old child, Samuel, who just so happens to be obsessed with learning of his deceased father. His inquisitions become an ongoing burden for the mother, who has never overcome the death of her husband. What we witness is a very realistic scenario of a mother trying to cope with a troublesome child and a young boy trying to grow up with the absence of a father. Both characters find solace in their nightly bedtime stories, until one particular book obstructs their ritual.Kent's tale of a monster that preys on your biggest vulnerabilities goes beyond anything we witness in nightmares. If you've ever experienced sleep paralysis, you will surely identify with Amelia. The monster that haunts her son also torments her, leaving her unable to sleep because closing her eyes means entering a world of constant agony, causing her to be paralyzed by fear. Kent manages to place you in the home of these two characters, making you battle with reality, fantasy, and the subconscious.Through the use of color and lighting you will be transported into the land of the Babadook- a place where only dull colors exist and happiness is unheard of. Kent's continuous use of blue and green hues add to the film's feeling of melancholy and the characters' trance-like state of living. Kent also makes sure to incorporate shadows in the most disturbing of places, playing with your panic of unveiling the Babadook.""The Babadook"" is labeled as a psychological horror because it truly plays with your perceptions, confronting you with the question of whether the Babadook is real or simply the fragment of an agitated woman's imagination. If you're looking for a horror film that features the typical killing- machine monster, then ""The Babadook"" is not it. However, if you understand the monsters that are capable of forming inside the human mind, you will surely accept Jennifer Kent's directorial debut as a smart, intriguing, yet horrifying film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A clever horror movie that makes you think,"While it's not the screamfest that some people may have been expecting, The Babadook takes a lot of great horror elements and brews a story that is terrifying even when you remove the monster completely. While I did have a hard time maintaining interest in the movie the entire time on the first watch through, I found myself much more into the story the second go around when I could really look at things from another point of view. If the first viewing had been as entertaining I think the movie would be rated higher for me, but the enjoyment is there nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Creepy and atmospheric, emotionally driven yet lacking","I have been meaning to watch this for years as I know it is hailed as a modern classic Horror movie. Its got its good points which make it slightly above average as a rating: casting and performances are good but it just lacks that extended sense of dread or payoff that would make it a longer lasting memory for me as a movie. There's some good elements in here for sure, and I like the way it is shot. I think there could have been more here and linking it to themes of grief and loss should really help the story more than it does, yet it doesn't have the overall power of some of the films it draws from in the genre that are, frankly, stronger. I am not sure I'll remember this much after viewing and that says a lot.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Babadook use elements of Horror movies to explain the Psychological of Human Perfectly""","The Babadook is a Horror movie that really interested me from what i heard critics really love this movie and also it is a Australia movie so i really looking forward to see this movie.This movie is pretty amazing actually i think it's almost like Black Swan + Conjuring in someway it's a Horror movie that uses it's Horror elements to explain the Psychological of characters and that's make this movie really interesting all the time , it's not just a dumb horror movie that fills with stupid jump scare or some ghost that the movies doesn't even explain why.The Director and screen writer Jennifer Kent doing a amazing job her directing is really good and unique despite this is her first really huge movie , her screen writer skills and script is really interesting it's mirror the problem in the social really well , i think the fact that she is a female makes her directing and screen writing more unique because the way her telling the story and the story itself is really really fells like a feminist movie in a lot of ways.The 2 main actor/actress are also pretty good , Essie Davis she is pretty amazing playing a role that i think it's pretty hard but playing so well that it's just really work or Noah Wiseman who play as a son in the movie i think he's good but sometimes his acting is kind of annoying i know his characters has to be that way but sometimes it's just too much.Overall The Babadook is by far the number 1 Horror movie of this year and i think it's really hard to find another Horror movies to dethrone The Babadook because it's use it's Horror Elements really really well like no others Horror movies can do.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Im not that hungry actually mum, after all...","The colourless decor of the house and it's sparse furnishings match nicely the weak and characterless personality of the mother. 
Even her clothing just screams 'drab'.When I first thought that, not long after one of her patients changed her mind about milk in tea, I felt perhaps I was judging too harshly, too soon.By the time her odious offspring snarls,""Do you wanna die?!"" (in a manner akin to Tom Araya from Slayer)
... she's become the biggest drip since the BFG had sinusitis. Calling her weak was nowhere near unfair.Her big plan to defeat the evil Babadook that has been freaking out her freaky son? 
Tearing up the book. Yep. That'll do it love.Although she does grow some balls at Ruby's birthday party when the rich WAGs are moaning about not having time to go to the gym.Although I loathe Samuel, even I wouldn't hold pushing Ruby out of the tree house against him. Children can be so cruel. ""Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me"" goes the old saying, but I don't think a fall onto your face from 9 feet up is preferable to being taunted for not having a dad.Ordinarily I celebrate the weird people. I hate the idea of just being the same as 'the norm' so naturally rally round the unpopular one or whipping boy of a group (such as the emo chick in The Breakfast Club or Trash in Return of the Living Dead).
However in this kid, we have someone I just can't sympathise with.

Definitely one of the BEST films of this year and probably the finest psychological horror film ever made // instagram: moviesmaniax,"Not many films that I went in with high expectation and came out with the same feeling as I was expecting. From its skillful directing to brilliant script along with creepy sound effects and gleefully insane performance, this film succeeds greatly and effectively on these elements. Instead of cheap SCARES and GORES, this film smartly uses its atmosphere, story, and performance from both the mother and son lead in boosting into an effective scare that really haunts you in its truthful message. However, this is a great FUN for those who enjoy more of a psychological type of horror film over those who prefer gores and cheap scares but overall, this is such a masterfully crafted and suspenseful horror film that you have to see it for yourself to believe in how perfect everything comes together as a whole movie.

Modern Homage to Classic Horror,"The BabadookThis is what nightmares are made of. Not to mention that the movie plays on the fears of being a single mother. I can't relate but I totally see where this is coming from. Everyone is completely believable. No one feels out of place and no one under performs. If anything the acting is too on point that I felt bad for this fictional person.Amelia, played by Essie Davis, isn't dolled up, she's just your average single mom who hasn't gotten over her husbands death. Because she and her son haven't grieved properly their relationship is a mess.Samuel, played by Noah Wiseman, was excellent as a kid. Almost as if the director said be as annoying and loud as possible. I loved to hate how annoyingly real he was. The kid has a great arc which just goes to show you how well written the characters were.Jennifer Kent shines as her writing impresses, but her direction and choices were nothing special. The acting and writing is what stands out. You can't expect anyone's first major film to be as polished in direction. Some of the effects are goofy almost silly, and then some of them are horrifying.The ending was familiar, expected, and odd. Lots of homages to other horror movies which was either awesome if intentional or cheap if otherwise. There was this odd horror noise that sounds an awful lot like a dinosaur from Turok. The ending was all over the place. Point of View of the Babadook was weird.Verdict: Watch if you can handle scary movies, otherwise you (if you have kids) might have trouble sleeping.

"Nice, but could have been better","Greetings from Lithuania.""The Babadook"" (2014) is well made psychological horror flick.

But unfortunately, somehow this movie didn't made impact on me so I could call it great. I was kinda disappointed on the level psychological / horror level, because you can't clearly be sure, was it all just imagination, or was it real, and although scenes at the end hints and shows the true meaning, I wasn't sure, so it left me unsatisfied. I know, some will find this ending and events interesting and absorbing, but I like more when horror pictures doesn't play with you and goes straight – otherwise I can't fully accept the chills and whole scary mood.Overall, this a very nicely made picture, with some genuine scars, bus sadly it didn't kick as much as it could have.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Its One of Those Films That Makes You Want To Sleep With One Eye Open,"Right off the bat this film is wonderful. From the bleek color palet to the wonderful shots, it's definitely eye candy. I would say this is more of something that is creepy rather then a horror that is filled with jump scares. Most of the ""Spine Tingling"" moments are when the antagonist is out of the shot but all you hear are then noises and things going on in the background. Another thing this film excelled in is the character development. I left feeling great sympathy for our protagonists through out the whole film. The boy played the best acting in my opinion although everyone did an amazing job. This is one of those films where its best to watch in the dark and alone.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Don't expect the scariest, but it has great moments","The Babadook is essentially one of those ""artsy"" horror films, to the point where you'd almost call it a Dramatic Thriller. This movie does not use obnoxious music or jump scares to get you, it's more methodical and about 70% of it is Drama. The rest is pretty scary.Plot- It's about a grieving widow taking care of her dysfunctional son, who begins to talk about this imaginary friend called The Babadook. The boy later tell his mom that he found him in a book of the same name, which the mother doesn't recall ever owning. About halfway through, the tension built really starts to settle in, and there are very memorable scary moments. The ending was intense, but the resolution will leave you asking ""How is that even realistic?"" or ""Why did that solve the problem?""Writing- This movie is written very well in a sense that you feel the way the main character does. There aren't too many calm scenes that you'll walk away with, but all of it is realistic aside maybe some people constantly bringing up the dead husband to the widow.Acting/Characters- The acting was great, the movie is in an anxious kind of realm so it can be hard to really make every actor stand out. The Babadook itself was scary as hell although you just barely see it's silhouette.Quality- The film is shot perfectly I'd say, one of the cinematography jobs in a recent Horror film. The way they maintain the same consistency of shot length is so smart in terms of actually scaring you, since you never know when something is building up to that moment. The mood is well executed through visuals, some scattered music, and convincing actors.Overall I downgraded this from 10 because the ending is a big ""shrug"" moment, and it's almost too boring- almost. But the scary parts, as well as the build up to those parts make the film worth watching. A good movie to watch if you want a tame Horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A terrifying experience - Jennifer Kent hits the nail on the head,"Looking through some of my reviews for more recent horror films, I seem to react with genuine surprise whenever I come across one that I've actually enjoyed. And I think that's mainly due to the fact that almost all modern horror films are the same. They don't pay much thought to character development, story or drama, and are just concerned with forcing bigger screams from its audience and making them throw their popcorn higher and higher into the air. If people leave a cinema laughing about a horror film they just saw, it has failed to deliver. If they are quiet and exhausted, then it really has frightened its audience.The Babadook, first and foremost, is a terrifying experience. Not entirely because of its supernatural elements and the villainous entity, but because of the drama and tension surrounding the unstable family unit that Amelia and Samuel inhabit. Though a single parent raising an unmanageable child may be a well trodden premise, particularly in a horror story, it is compounded by an expertly written and heartfelt script, authentic performances - Essie Davis is outstanding - and a horrifying exploration of a parent's descent into madness, the kind not executed this well in horror films since The Shining.When the supernatural elements do emerge, the third act begins to falter slightly, and the melodrama of the dialogue threatens to encroach soap opera territory. But what chilled me to the bone was watching the mother - influenced by this evil being - chasing her son around their dilapidated house, hurting him and threatening him, and realising that this is how some children live their lives, without influence of the Babadook. I'm sure this was director/writer Jennifer Kent's intention, and she's absolutely hit the nail on the head.I never did like sleep much anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the Elites of Modern Horror Film,"The Babadook, masterfully directed by Jennifer Kent is one of the best horror movies of recent years--possibly of recent decades. In her stunning directorial debut, the Australian Kent shows not merely promise as a filmmaker, but the kind of rare talent that seldom shows through this strongly so soon. Creepy, tension filled, and mostly free of tired horror clichés, it is something special.The film stars Essie Davis in a terrific emotional turn as Amelia, a widowed mother still years later in a funk of despair over the loss of her husband, in addition to having difficult young child Samuel, played by Noah Wiseman. Samuel talks of dark subjects, makes weapons, and is prone to violent outbursts; he gets suspended from school and causes his devoted-if-emotionally-distant mother barriers with among others her sister and a potential love interest, and society generally. As they become more isolated from society, things get stranger and more distressing in their home, especially when what appears to be a kid's pop-up book, that Amelia can't recall seeing before, called The Babadook—those pages are a terrific artistic creation in themselves—is discovered, and when read is found to be nothing innocent at all. It builds on a spine-chilling atmosphere with events and details, one and then another, very effectively, and hits the viewer with along the way moments of startling fright that add to but never overshadow the main situation. Motivations for certain acts aren't always clear, but that only adds, not detracts, from the overall effect.This is in the running for my favorite horror film since the turn of the century: a genuinely scary film with a great pacing, two strong lead performances, and enough originality to keep it interesting throughout. Beyond all it is Kent, who wrote the film as well as directed it, who deserves large credit for the success.About the same time as this film came out another horror film was released, also by a woman directing her first feature film, and that I think also ranks among the best modern examples of the genre: Ana Lily Amirpour's A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. What Kent and Amirpour prove I think is that if more female talent was given a chance to make the films they are capable of, or the kinds they desire, that many more would shine, and studios are doing a disservice by not considering filmmakers of that gender more often. I can probably count on one hand the number of horror movies since 2000 made by men that I could put alongside either of these two.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Bold, original, and terrifying. What more could you want?","Amelia (Essie Davis) has struggled to raise her six year old son, Samuel, since her husband died whilst driving her to the hospital to give birth. After withdrawing Samuel from school due to his behavioral issues, Amelia finds a book in their house entitled ""Mister Babadook"". One night, she reads Sam the book, despite its dark, frightening nature. Since that night, Amelia and Samuel begin to experience strange happenings wherever they go, despite Amelia's insistence that the Babadook isn't real. However, after throwing the book away, it soon returns to her doorstep with a new warning; the more you deny the existence of the Babadook, the stronger its presence will be felt.As stated in my recent review for the annoyingly average Annabelle, 2014 has been a mixed year for horror. But, when it gets it right, it really gets it right, as shown with Oculus. Which is why it's such a relief to be able to say that The Babadook exceeds every horror film released this year. In fact, it probably surpasses every horror film from the last decade. This is real horror. No over reliance on blood or gore, no abundance of cheap jump scares; The Babadook crafts genuine tension from beginning to end, surrounded by sympathetic characters with an emotionally heavy story to guide the film through to its sublimely terrifying final act. Old fashioned, stylistic and loaded with sheer, genuine terror, The Babadook is all you could really ask for when it comes to horror.It helps that the lead role of Amelia is played by Essie Davis, an actress previously unbeknownst to me, but certainly one to watch for the future. Amelia's character goes through a horrific change throughout this film; from caring and compassionate, to desperate and demonic. Davis tackles every scene with commitment, and she fuels her character with just the right emotional level in order to make us care about her, and go on that emotional roller coaster with her. Very much a female fronted film, The Babadook is directed, written, produced and led by women; a refreshing alteration from the predominantly male driven film industry. Jennifer Kent, with her first time in the directing chair, goes about this film with precision and intention, and the result is a knockout.My favourite element of The Babadook is unquestionably the way it looks visually. For the vast majority of the film, Kent employs a heavy detraction of colour; some of the external scenes may as well be shot in black and white. By withdrawing heavy colours from the film, we are immediately drawn into the dark atmosphere; The Babadook is dark both emotionally and aesthetically. Kent also uses unusual framing for many scenes, and this adds to both the tension and the visual complexity of the film. We open with a breathtaking shot; a medium close up of Amelia's face while she endures the car crash that preceded both the birth of her child and the death of her husband. This is a contrast used repeatedly throughout the film, especially the final act. The scene in which the Babadook appears in the form of Amelia's deceased husband asking for their son to join him is a moment that is both visually stunning and emotionally harrowing, but commands our attention to appreciate the weight of what is actually happening to Amelia. And it deserves it.But thanks to Kent's innovative visual style and old fashioned approach, The Babadook is truly horrifying. Kent uses the first half of the film to build us into the mythology of the Babadook and to allow us to buy into the characters. By only having two main protagonists, this is much easier than the standard father-mother- two-children cast most typical horrors offer. But once we reach that mid point, the film explodes into a frenzy of jumps, frights and horrors, and each come so quickly after the last that you've barely had time to recover. The Babadook itself is fantastically designed, as creepy as it is memorable. The same can also be said for Jed Kurzel's score, which accompanies the film's tone to perfection and allows even the most frightening moments to be pushed even that little bit further. But most of the fear comes through the emotional bond between Amelia and Samuel; between mother and son. Their relationship is the real underlying narrative that guides the film from act to act, and it works seamlessly.I really hope The Babadook is successful commercially. It would be awful for an underwhelming and generally disliked film like Annabelle to make a monumental profit if a masterclass in horror like this doesn't fare as well. The Babadook is truly original, something that has been lacking in horror for quite a few years now. This takes you back to the days of The Exorcist or the original Halloween, in which sound and emotion can be used as both a narrative tool and a means for fear. In years time, when people look back at the great films of the horror genre, I can only hope that The Babadook is recognised as one of the best. In the endless swarm of found footage, jump-scare ridden, unoriginal ""horrors"" that we're subjected to these days, The Babadook stands high and proud as one of the greatest ever produced in its genre.To Summarise: Boldly directed, emotionally powerful, and loaded with enough pure horror to last a lifetime, The Babadook is a brilliantly refreshing take on a decaying genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Childhood Fears,"Children can have the creepiest things in their minds and are sometimes the cruelest beings on this planet. Perhaps, because they are still linked to some primal fear memory. The Babadook is a child's fear manifested in our adult world. An aspect of fear that we try to control and overcome. But this also makes us question that how far exactly are we from it? The world with its material attractions dull our senses, desensitize us to these things. But, that's exactly what we would like to believe in the waking world. Because, when we go to sleep and darkness lays its heavy hands on our eyelids, we return to a primordial soup of memories that we both like to remember and forget at the same time. This tension, I believe, is the stuff of nightmares and childhood fears, that we try all the time to keep at bay.How this fear is manifested and given shape by a mother's guilt forms the second layer of the story. Guilt, despair, and hopelessness give rise to strange manifestations in our fragile minds, especially when we don't have a support system. People start breaking up. This is exemplified by the mother, who loses her husband in a car crash, when he was driving her to the hospital to have her baby. The child is born, and is seen by the mother as the cause for her unhappiness. This externalization of the loss and the cause for blame is, of course, at a subconscious level. But her veneer of strength slowly crumbles as the days pass and she becomes less of a mother and something else altogether. After bearing this unhappiness for seven long years, she slowly teeters off the edge of her sanity. The onset of loneliness, depression, and ultimately insanity form the major themes in this film. The lack of sleep, imaginary noises, and the strain of consoling a constantly scared child creates havoc on the mother's nerves and is manifested in the looming and ever-growing shadow of The Babadook.The name, ""Babadook"" is nonsensical, and I feel, it's a name that actually is a forced word, manufactured to rhyme with the children's poem – ""If it's in a word, or if it's in a book/ You can't get rid of the Babadook."" Maybe, it's something to do with Baba Yaga? Who knows? We do that sometimes; manufacture stuff, in our own minds to fit stuff into place. But, in this case, it goes horribly wrong.Themes of motherhood, single parenting and a child's imagination are extant throughout the film. We can, at least identify with one or more themes in the film. As children, we have always imagined our toys to life, given monstrous shapes in the dark to clothes bunched up in the corner of a roomand so on.Stylistically, this film creates a feel of claustrophobia and suffocation, more so, by the use of minimal color. The blue seems grey, the grey seems greyer, the whites are never really white, and the blacks just get darker still.This film, I think, is comparable in many ways to The Shining, Jacob's Ladder, Angel Heart, The Sixth Sense, The Machinist and books such as The Believers (Robert Arthur) and The Haunting of Hill House (Shirley Jackson). For people with an appetite for old school terror and scares, this film is definitely recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Indie-horror of the best sort,"British Reviewer.I love Australian cinema, they have a courage to go to places on screen that America and Britain have lost the nerve for.The Babadook is an intense, psychological analogy for grief and lone-parenting and isolation. Or that's my takeaway from it. The ending is a bit abstract and more open to interpretation than the actual haunting, I believe it's about making peace with the shadows that lurk in all our cellars (unconscious, subconscious) and feed them worms...The two leads are excellent. Both utterly believable as a strung-out, barely-coping widow and an autistic, troubled brat! If that young lad is actually 'normal' by societies standards then his is probably the most incredible performance by a child actor I have seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Traumatised,Well for one the mother needs to be reported to social services. She thoroughly neglected her child from start to finish. The house resembled that of a war family in 1944 not 2014! The mother is the most annoying bland uninteresting clearly sexually frustrated and have no respect to be able to do what she does when her child is clearly mental declining. Also couldn't tell if they were British or Australian at first. This film is literally harrowing just by watching how tormented the child is. It's sad. It's literally like watching the social services records. It's just cruel from start to finish but apart from that brilliant acting and directing.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Misunderstood Masterpiece of Psychological Terror,"Forget the silly name, The Babadook is an amazing little piece of film. It's not that people are disliking it, as I believe they are misunderstanding just how deep it is. I would bet money that most people missed the whole point of it because the director gives just tiny hints along the way.On the surface it comes across as the story of a mythical creature called Mister Babadook... A monster that somehow finds its way into the lives of the two characters. However, it's the ""somehow"" that tips you off to the real story here. Don't just limit this movie to a haunted book, that's doing a disservice. Think of what the Babadook symbolizes during the film, there are a couple of very specific flashbacks and ""visions"" that point to what exactly the monster might really be. I won't spoil it, but I guarantee it adds a whole new dimension to the story... And makes this slice of celluloid and tight little thriller that side steps the conventions and goes for the psychological scares. It reminded me of The Orphanage and Dark Water, with some Shining on top.The way she slowly becomes affected by the monster, and how it plays out in the end, all work perfectly due to some top notch acting by the two leads and a brilliant scriptwriter. This movie kicks but, and scared mine right off!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The horrors of single parenthood meet the horrors of the supernatural,"Amelia (Essie Davis) is a single mother trying to raise her six-year-old son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone after her husband was killed in an accident. The only problem is that Samuel is a nervous, skittish and impressionable little boy who's constantly testing the patience of Amelie and all his caretakers. And things continue to go downhill when a mysterious book appears in Samuel's room, telling about a creepy Mr. Babadook, who will come a-knocking, after which he will naturally devour your soul, feast upon your blood, all that good stuff.Pretty much textbook as far monster horror movies go, but what gives The Babadook its strength is its way of telling its story and the things it chooses to focus upon. Because quite frankly Mr. Babadook is the least interesting thing in the film. The actual horror comes from the fraying relationship between the mother and the son, from the fact that they're both becoming so very scared of one another, and how you'll start to see their nerves building and building. It's a very poignant film about raising a child alone and being under so much pressure, stress and unreasonable expectations.And that leads to the downside of the film. It is a monster horror film and when Mr. Babadook enters the picture, the film just isn't as interesting anymore. I enjoyed the first half, when it looked like Samuel had simple gone insane and was lashing out against his mother, far more than I enjoyed the second half, which was by no means bad as far as horror films go, but which just wasn't as innovative and unique as the first half.Still, when the film works, it works amazingly well. Especially keeping in mind that this is director Jennifer Kent's debut film. Definitely worth a watch for all fans of psychological horror.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting psychological monster movie,"This movie is the kind of one that is best when you don't know too much about it beforehand. So I'm not going to explain or interpret the plot too much. But my impression is that it's borderline psychological horror and a monster movie. That works because it creates an unsettling feeling of paranoia where you don't exactly know what's going on.If you only expect a monster movie it can be a little bit letdown, but if you're interested in psychology I recommend the movie because I felt like there might be different ways to interpret the story. Watch it for yourself and think what it might mean.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Lots of interesting elements, but too silly to do justice to its central theme","The Babadook is a family drama featuring a memorable bogeyman, whose true nature is revealed by the end of the film.Things I liked about the film: the concept of the creepy book; the visual references to German expressionism; the reference to Bava's 'Black Sabbath' when the mother floats across the room; the resolution of the film (without wanting to spoil the film, the way the characters deal with the Babadook makes good sense, thematically, as was an unexpected ending).Things I didn't like: whilst the Babadook had a clear metaphorical meaning that made sense, it still had a literal presence in the film as a monster, and this aspect was poorly handled. No parameters were in place around what it was, its powers etc. and so for a significant amount of the movie we just went through the motions of ""supernatural monster stalks family"" as it caused (predictable) havoc. Cheap chills! The other thing I struggled with was the little boy. The actor did such a good job of being so completely unbearably obnoxious and annoying that it made me want to stop watching. It also made me really glad when his possessed mother finally toughed up and put her foot down with him (which was not the intention, I'm sure!)Ultimately the emotional core and metaphor of the movie is dragged down by the general silliness going on around it. The ""horror "" aspects are fairly cliched and inept. I found this film a bit of a chore to get through, to be honest. Lots of good ideas and lots of potential, but it just doesn't come together in a satisfying or entertaining way.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Interesting,"Australian director Jennifer Kent toys with atmosphere similar to the one in ""The Others"" while adding her own twist to it. Its ""us"" against the world, familiar things that turn into demonic and crippling fear coming from our own living spaces. Very simple in cast that counts only handful of characters, the movie focuses only on single mother and her little son who are slowly sliding down into danger that lurks somewhere from inside this house. Avoiding the simplicity that would result from simply pointing at one focus of demonic possession, Kent plays around with it, suggesting all kinds of explanations and ideas, cleverly keeping our attention all the way trough. What personally I found most interesting is the relationship between parent and the child used in Horror context, which was rarely if ever been so well used like here. Actors are absolutely brilliant, though in retrospective I am not so happy in using little Noah Wiseman for this kind of movie, because I wouldn't like my own child to be exposed to such disturbing things in such tender age. Call me over-sensitive but I am very protective towards what we are putting in kid's heads while they are still growing up and soaking everything in.

You can't get rid of the Babadook,"The Babadook is quite an interesting film. This film takes not only our childhood fears, but our parenting fears and makes them a reality. Mister babadook is the best, or in this case worst, of both worlds when it comes to these fears. He is able to scare children in a simpler way in that he has a terrifying appearance. Additionally, he is able to invoke fear into parents by bringing out the worst in them as well as their thoughts and actions. Because the film is able to reach into the worst fears of not only children, but also parents, it becomes that much more terrifying, as almost no audience member is left out of the intended audience. Even myself, as a college student who is not a parent, nor afraid of monsters under my bed or in the closet, I know what it's like to have that fear because I have experienced it before. This quality of the babadook shows how he never escapes someone, no matter what stage of life they are in. Moving on from there, I didn't really enjoy how the characters needed to act for the film to work. I understand that Samuel had to be an annoying little kid to help heighten the fear of this film, but there were points where it was too much. However, this made his shift in character later in the film to be that much more impressive. This is also heavily contrasted with Amelia's shift in character where she is first seen to be a loving mother under extremely difficult circumstances that she can't get away from. But as the film progresses, she proceeds to be a worse and worse mother as her child becomes more and more supportive and caring for her. While there is the terrifying presence of the looming babadook over them, they still find a way to support one another throughout the film, which is quite encouraging for such a terrifying film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sigh of terror among several disappointments,"In a century where few horror movies stand out, we have ""Babadook,"" the film that tells the story of Amelia (Essie Davis), a single mother who creates a troublesome son by herself, causing depression, anguish, and anger. With sections reminiscent of Repulsa (64) and the Enlightened One (80), ""Babadook"" is a script show, all the characters are absurdly well built, and it looks like the movie only has an hour and a half. For many moments we forget the supernatural, because what terrifies us is the life of Amelia, and the film becomes so human that when the supernatural comes, we really get scared, a story where the human aspect of the characters are very well built in the Making me forget the supernatural and mystery, we can say that it is a script that Stephen King would approve, I confess that I went to watch the film for a recommendation of a friend, and with a certain prejudice, but the photograph of the film won me completely in the first 5 minutes, This extremely dark photograph with a palette of colors turned to gray, from the first minute something in the film bothers you, with a precise soundtrack and brilliant performances, Essie Davis is frighteningly perfect, and Noah Wiseman makes you believe in his madness only with You look at it. The big mistake of the movie is his third act, all of it is a sin, in trying to fight against the bad he relieves himself and puts himself at the level of all other mediums for bad horror films. Of course the film has a message, it's all an allegory, the monster is much deeper than just a monster, it's all an analogy behind involving depression and madness, but the movie that has its first two great acts, And a third dumb and simple that normalizes and disappoints, but it is worth very much, although the film is no longer genius due to sheer lack of imagination, the script is given to the common in the last minutes. But lastly, ""Babadook"" is worth it, because it is mostly different, and for lovers of terror, it is a delight.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointing and utterly banal effort,"Troubled by her sons' bizarre behavior, a single mother tired by his constant mentions of a strange monster coming after him turns out to be true when she soon encounters the vicious figure coming after him in the house and tries to save him before the creature can get to him.This one ended up being an incredibly problematic effort. A lot of the films' issues come from the fact that there's nothing about the son worth celebrating about the son here. This is one of the most irritating, utterly insufferable brat that ever lived the way he's portrayed here with his screaming for attention, the need for household protection measures that are far more destructive than helpful and a general air of total disobedience that borders on psychological intervention the way he goes on throughout this one. His screaming and hysterical antics are plain grating, and the out- of-control nature of how he behaves around her and others such as the neighbors or the friends' birthday party just make it nearly impossible to feel anything less than utter disdain for him. However, since this behavior is supposed to demonstrate how terrifying the creature is that he's forced the child into that state instead all it does is hammer home how despicable the kid is and that really drains the film of any chance to generate scares or thrills of any kind for most of the overall running time. This manages to really delay any kind of horror scenes here as this just turns the film into a dull, exhaustive drama for most of the running time. The other big issue here is the complete and utter lack of information here about what the titular creature actually is as there's nothing given about the creature's' history, what it's actual purpose is or where the rules about it come from as the entire affair is kept completely in the dark and is a total mystery. This also offers up no connection as to where the book came from or how he became so obsessed with it considering the reaction he has to it the first time she reads it for him which shows he is clearly afraid of the book like it's the first time he's read it which makes no sense if he's heard the story before. These issues are what hold this one down considerably and don't really allow the positives much room to work with. Those positives consist solely of the action found in the final half where the creature is finally let loose and engages in some wild chases around the house which lets this one get quite dark and chilling with the way it all plays out. This gets the film moving along nicely and places a lot of emphasis on the breakneck encounters which makes for quite a rousing finish. Coupled with a creepy look to the main creature, these, though, are all that work for this one.Rated R: Language, Violence and intense themes of children-in- jeopardy.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

What a let down! - SPOILER ALERT,"I've scored this movie 6 only because it is well made, well shot, it's intelligent and attempts to handle difficult subject matter in a mature way.This review has SPOILERS in so please stop reading now.I liked everything about the Babadook up until 2/3s in when we are still unsure whether the Babadook is ""real"" and that I was watching a supernatural movie, or if the Babadook is merely imaginary and/or a metaphor.The movie is paced really well. It builds up the tension and fear gradually and holds back until further on and keeps us guessing if the Babadook is real or imagined.I'm afraid the movie lost me when I realised that the Babadook wasn't going to be ""real"". I felt misled by the makers. They extracted all the jumps, scares, and fear that a ""supernatural"" movie would be entitled to then cops out massively by making it all a metaphor for the mother getting over her grief, and anger towards her son.OK, you might say that the fear and horror we went through before the reveal was justified because it made us feel as the mother might have felt but that didn't work with me personally. Just because it bravely deals with admittedly heavy issues does not excuse misleading us about the Babadook.I don't discount the films usage of the Babadook. It could have hinted at or openly defined the Babadook as a metaphor or mental phantom, and scared us as much as it wanted. But keeping us guessing till the end was a disingenuous choice in my opinion and left me feeling cheated, let down, and disappointed when I really didn't want to.I would have voted the movie 4 because of the massive let down.

A story of Grief,"The Babadook is a smart dark modern horror film filled with grief, children, and monsters. This film by Jennifer Kent puts us with a grieving mother and her hyperactive son after their father and husband was killed in a car accident. This film is not your typical monster horror film. Kent presents the Babadook in a way that has you questioning whether it's a real monster or a figment of her imagination. It's a very smart film because of how Kent leaves up to question whether this monster is real or just a manifestation of her grief. The way the Babadook is associated with the mother throughout the book, looming over her, and the mother's slow decent into following what the book prophesized. I believe the Babadook as an allegory to the mother's grief of losing her husband as well as the build up from her hyperactive son getting underneath her skin is a great way to keep the audience guessing all the way up until the end. The camera work along with the music and lighting gives us this sense of perpetual anxiety that this mother goes through every day and that built up can manifest into something as scary as the Babadook or as scary as how she treats her song when she's under its influence. The suppression of the Babadook to the basement can be mapped to her suppressing her grief and keeping it under control in the basement while still feeding it from time to time, sort of how grief works in the real world. Overall the film was a fantastic portrayal emotional trouble along with a strong residual sense of fear after the film is over.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Drama Thumbs Up, Horror Thumbs Down","The Babadook I thought was just an okay film that felt a bit flat regarding horror elements. The biggest positive I can give this film is the acting, especially from Essie Davis. It's one of the best horror movie performances I have seen. She plays this mentally unstable mother to absolute perfection, and she's the perfect complement to Samuel with his behavioral issues. I really liked the moments of drama in the film in the first act because it sets the foundation for what's to come. You don't really get good characterization in a horror film, so the change of pace was nice. The scenes where Samuel was annoying and yelling was the most tension I thought this film had, and I was unsettled with it. Now for some flaws. I just can't get around the concept of a scary monster scaring people coming out of a children's book, especially when this movie tackles a very serious subject matter about mental health. The movie got worse and worse over the course of the runtime because it focused more on cartoonish horror near the end. The 3rd act just did not work for me, and the tone of the film was shifted significantly. I also think we could've used more visuals of the Babadook instead of the monster just lurking. I don't really understand why critics loved this film. I guess maybe because the film is more innovative than most, not using as many horror tropes. My main fix for the movie is just make this film a drama, because the Babadook monster was just a tack on, and when it was a drama, I really was enjoying myself. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Amelia ignores Samuel's warnings and, not to play Bada Spoiler, you pretty much can assume the rest. Kent did not really construct any spooky elements to the picture; and it was somewhat predictable. Now I must exorcist, I mean exercise my right as a ghost corny film critic, to mention that Aussie Essie was auuuuustanding as Amelia.

Just bad.,"This movie has an atmosphere of ""something wicked this way comes"" but falls short in soooooo many ways. It has a parent that doesn't believe her son when it comes to the boogieman. And that is it. The entire movie is a loop of who is right and who is having a nervous breakdown. In the end it seems arbitrary who is having a nervous breakdown and what is real as the end payout is not worth it. After reading the shill reviews and bumps of this title it is a shame that it was this bad. Always the shills are wrong (surprise)and this movie is crap. Should you avoid it?

Representation of Emotions,"The Babadook, is a psychological horror film by director, Jennifer Kent, that premiered in 2014. The film has Amelia (Essie Davis) and Samuel (Noah Wiseman) as mother and son navigating through grief from losing a family member. Specifically, Amelia is going through the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. She is having a difficult time separating Samuel from her husband due to the association of his birth to her husband's death. As for Samuel, he is becoming a problem child and a nuisance to his mother. This film differs from others by how there is minimal use of computer-animated imagery. It relies heavily on shadows to produce fear from the audience. Throughout the film, it is noticeable that Kent has drawn inspiration from German expressionism in how it portrays upfront the emotions that the characters are feeling in a twisted reality. It is interesting how Jennifer Kent has changed what the viewers should expect a villain or monster to look like. The monster in this film does not possess supernatural or evil tendencies that one would initially look for. Therefore, the monster is one's self. In this case, the monster is the physical embodiment of Amelia's grief, depression, and anxiety. It is considered to be a smart film by other critics due to it being able to leave room for interpretation and concentrates on an emotion that everyone goes through sooner or later in life. For those willing to dive further into the subgenre of psychological horror , this is the film for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It was late at night and I had to cover my eyes the whole time because I'm a little sissy. 10/10 would recommend to scare the shoot out of someone. The dog was so cute (rip), Sam was my nightmare if I have kids, and I felt so bad for the mom. If you need get through this, make Babadook jokes about him being ""daddy"".

Midnight Rambling!,"The Babadook is a terrific debut feature for writer/director Jennifer Kent. On a limited budget, she has produced a work of genuine originality, whilst operating ostensibly in the horror genre. Crucial to the success of the film is lead actress Essie Davis, who gives a fantastic performance as, lonely, grieving widow Amelia, whose own depressed state, is only exacerbated by the obnoxious and anti-social behaviour of her extremely needy 6 year - old son, Samuel.Much of the film is shot in Amelia's and Samuel's house, but the movie never feels in the least bit stagey. It was interesting reading Kent's comments that she originally envisaged deliberately fostering a 1950's set look, even considering filming in black and white to highlight the anachronistic feel. I'm personally glad she changed her mind over that concept and I think the skilful work of Polish cinematographer Radek Ladczuk, put the final seal on adopting any retro-look. The camera swings, tracks and zooms in and out of the Babadook's adopted residence, snake-like in it's character-revealing intent. The sound editing too is first-class. It always enhances the bleak, moody atmosphere and suspense quota, without inserting overpowering effects aiming for cheap jump shocks.The Babadook is not flawless by any means. For whatever reason, Samuel is just established from the outset, as a complete brat. Thereafter, it becomes rather difficult for even the most compassionate of viewers to feel much sympathy for him. There's very much a repetition factor happening as well. We already are witness to the fact that he drives his mother towards exhaustion and exasperation by getting her up every night and eventually climbing into her bed. So there's not much happens that's different after the supposedly terror - inducing Mister Babadook book is discovered and read.On a less significant level, Australian homes virtually never have the North American - like basement that is seen in the movie, crucial though it is to the plot. And I tend to agree with quite a few other reviewers that the conclusion appears to have escaped Kent somewhat. In the context of the rest of the film, there just seemed to be a sudden injection of unneeded special effects and Samuel's role in the way things panned out, seemed to me, to be rather ludicrous, considering his age and earlier behaviour.But too reiterate, The Babadook is a very good initial outing for Jennifer Kent and I look forward to seeing her second production The Nightingale, about which, I've also heard really good things. Meanwhile appreciate The Babadook for what it really is. A clever, multi-layered story about how incredibly difficult being a parent to a troubled child can be. And it's all dressed up as a ""horror movie"". Who would have thought?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great little Australian horror drama,"I had some pretty high expectations going into this actually, the score was decent for a horror (imdb wise) and the reviews seemed really positive. And I can see why, it's a good horror.What stands out to me directly in this movie is the pacing, it flows nicely and never dragged for me. It's not a long movie, and it doesn't need to be. And the way it balances it's creepiness is well done.The directing is nice. There are a couple of nice shots and ideas here and there but overall it wasn't too interesting, it was simply good.The editing has some mishaps though, I felt 3 or 4 times that a cut was made or scene ended a bit awkwardly or abruptly. Especially noticeable when Robbie came over to Amelia's house to give her flowers. We never get to see him leave or get the strong notion he's leaving, it just cuts and he's gone. So that took me out a little bit.The horror here is mainly psychological, which I like. Though the way the monster works is a bit iffy. Though if I'm right the monster is a manifestation of her trauma/grief. That was done well but you could interpret it as a haunting or whatever as well.The acting from the lead was fantastic. The acting from the kid was alright, I couldn't really believe some of the more emotive scenes, they weren't as convincing as the lead.The music is good, so is the sound design, recommended to watch with good headphones/speakers.Set design, most of the movie takes place in one location, and it's almost a bit too depressing the way it's decorated but it does set the right mood.The gore, blood etc is done well, though there isn't much. Also there is some CGI, most of it is good, but a bit iffy in 1 or 2 unimportant scenes.Overall a enjoyable film, recommend!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What happens when Al Bundy tries to direct Alfred Hitchcock style,"Once again we have a typical 21st century bad horror movie. It is a shame that horror movies have stopped being horror stricken and just went to horrible. Ever since Freddy started hacking and slashing through dreams, horror movies have become nothing more than blood-f-e-s-t. This movie is no different it is supposed to be highly suspenseful --that is why you never see the monster-- but the woman actress portrays her character as just another nagging, dominant, arrogant, female. She blunders her way through the entire movie demanding her point of view be the one that dominates her life and everyone around her. This is typical to females and is in no way scary to the divorced male. if the viewer were to take the monster out of the plot, it would not be hard to convert this movie over to an insane mother flick. It is with great hope that in the next 50 to 150 years Hollywood will stop trying to emulate Chinese style directing and story-line and plot; and will actually go back to the wonderful habits they used to stand for as when Hitchcock actually was doing some of the best suspense movies in film history.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

This isn't a typical GORE movie, so don't expect that. This is more like for example: jumps, creepy ghost things, but also some twists. I really hope there comes a second part, because I (In Belgium) loved it very much. Finally something descent for your money.

"""The Babadook: The Ghost of Grief and Terror.""","""The Babadook"" is a psychological horror film that gets to the heart of realizing human grief, trauma and the challenges of motherhood. Director Jennifer Kent's movie is a horror story that is different from typical horror tropes, and after watching it, there are unanswered questions that remain.At its core, ""The Babadook"" is a story about Amelia (Essie Davis), a widowed mother trying to raise her troubled son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) after the tragic death of her husband. As the film progresses, the relationship between mother and son becomes more and more strained, and they already have a lot of problems with socialization and communication with outsiders. And then an ominous presence begins to enter their lives. The titular character, Babadook, appears from a mysterious children's book and manifests as a malevolent force that preys on Amelia and Samuel's vulnerabilities.For me, the great thing about ""The Babadook"" movie is not having screamers and lots of blood and gore. The movie is packed with suspense and with the use of unexpected and loud noises that in normal life would not have caused me any fear. But because of the director's skill, even the unexpected banging of keys made me tense up and start looking at the small details. Kent skillfully uses the Babadook as a metaphor for Amelia's repressed grief and Samuel's trauma, blurring the lines between reality and hallucination in a disorienting descent into madness.In conclusion, I'd like to say that The Babadook is a good, modern horror movie that offers an in-depth exploration of grief and trauma wrapped in a compelling horror story. With convincing acting, atmospheric direction and psychological depth, the movie is a good example of a quality horror film that not only scares its viewers but also educates them about moral trauma.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

When Depression Becomes Your Inner Demon,"The Babadook takes a unique approach to horror which is why most people do not find the movie good or scary. This film is smart because instead of taking the approach of jump scares or a scary monster, Kent decides to go after pure, terrifying emotions such as grief and depression which make the viewers have a sense of discomfort. The mother in this film is going through an incredibly hard time with not only being reminded of her dead husband around every corner, but also her son struggling in school and being disobedient. Not only was she struggling but her son is also struggling and we see both characters dealing with these emotions which are conveyed through lighting and mise-en- scene. Kent uses a relatively gray color scheme and places multiple objects in the frame to correlate the Babadook to her husband. This connection is important to realize because it is what makes the movie so beautiful and gives it a much deeper meaning. The Babadook is an allegory for the level of her depression and grief, which is expressed non-stop throughout the film throughout the monster's actions. Kent does an incredible job at capturing these emotions and conveying an uncomfortable feeling to the audience. Overall, I think that The Babadook is a revisionist film that is able to make the audience relate to the emotions the mother and son are going through while still encompassing some of the horror elements found in films such as It Follows to an extent.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

FINALLY... a modern horror film that understands what makes a great horror film...,"I thought this movie was BRILLIANT... one of the better horror films that I've seen in many a year... tense, gripping with outstanding visuals and an excellent, original, layered story which can be enjoyed on multiple levels (literally and symbolically)... What's more, the performances of the two leads were amazing... this, IMO, gets back to what truly makes an excellent horror film and makes it truly creepy, scary and intense... our reaction is driven by the setting, the atmosphere, the images, the music, the subtle sounds and, most of all, the performances... Essie Davis is incredible and she handles an extremely complex role very well and you feel her frustration and terror... Finally, the film never resorts to what I believe is the bane of horror in the last 20 years: never does it use cheap jump scares (and, in the hand of a lesser director, there would have been 30+ opportunities to do so)... As a result, the scary moments aren't just a quick punch to the stomach which you shrug off in a few seconds but, instead, they linger in your brain and under your skin for well after the film is over... again, absolutely loved it and I hope we can see more films that are like this because they are few and far between these days...

Well done but really not scary.,"It's been awhile since I've posted a review so I hope this helps. I did not come away from this film feeling haunted. A strong, mind that I did not say great, film leaves me with a feeling of dread even after the film. It really has to make me feel uneasy while watching and keeps my eyes glued to the screen. Lucky McGee's The Woman did that. The Babadook did not. It was well done in the sense that it sets the mood for bad things to happen but it did not push through all the way toward terror and dread. Jennifer Kent did a great job in her first film both in writing and direction. I would say Andres Muschietti's Mama had a stronger feel for horror. I'm not a fan of the stereotypical woman who is generally weak in the face of major horrific issues whether they be internal or external. And this may be My problem. One, a soft female protagonist and Two, the origin of the evil force. I went on the statement put out by William Friedkin that this was a great horror film. Friedkin's endorsement was the impetus since I rank The Exorcist as the greatest horror film of all time. Alien is next. Both have smart, strong female characters that face an evil that is external to their understanding of reality. So The Babadook scores low for me there. My criticism is probably more a result of my preference than what the film really delivers to a general audience. I cannot see why anyone would give it one or two stars. I think you have to have a bad looking film for that. But, I thought the mood that Kent sets was great it just didn't send me over into that dreaded feeling. And I surely didn't think about it once the film was over.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

This trending movie had a lot more to offer than just a gay icon,"PROS: To start off, I have literally never seen a better kid actor. The two main characters were able to deliver a perfect film with no faults in their delivery whatsoever. The actors gave everything you want and then some to their performance, it was quite remarkable. It was so good that it helped the rest of the film tremendously. The characters were able to move along with the build up of tension at the same rate which made the movie progress smoothly. The build up was very terrorizing as well. It was so good that it gave me chills to watch. Something that I look for in movies is how smoothly the transition is from, climax to falling action, and this movie was able to let the viewer simmer on what they just had watched which was nice. The director was careful enough to let the development of the falling action carry the last few scenes of the film, this made the resolution of the film more impactful. To continue, the resolution was very well composed. I enjoyed the movie greatly because of the way the ending wrapped up everything nicely.CONS: The one thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the crazy amounts of plot holes and unanswered questions. To start off, the way the characters changed throughout the film was so bizarre. One minute the mother was sane, then crazy, then sane again; then the son was crazy, then sane, then crazy, then sane, and these transitions happened so abruptly and it caused too much disorganization for my liking. Another part that was frustrating was the Babadook himself. I know this might spoil some things in the movie, but the Babadook was quite agonizing to conceptualize. He did real life things like move things, recreate things, make phone calls, inhabit bodies, and all this time the whole point of the Babadook was to be a metaphor for grief which it didn't deliver. I was torn by the Babadook because it wasn't developed well enough in the film. I know their was a lot of cons, but PLEASE watch this movie! It is so good.www.chorror.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I don't need jump scares or any gore. That's not horror to me, anyway. There doesn't need to be a monster, either, just the shadows and promise of one will do. Suspense would be nice, though. There is no suspense, unless trying to find the plot or interest is the suspense. For suspense to happen you have to be invested in the characters, or the story. This is just...

A Monster under the Bed ?,I read a few newspaper and online reviews of The Babadook saying it was one of the scariest films ever made. I was planning on going to see it but while scrolling through the films available on the On Demand menu from my cable company I seen that it was available to view so I purchased it. It was a scary film but nowhere as scary as the reviews indicated. That might have been different I guess if viewed at a Theater in wide screen and Dolby Digital. The film more than focusing on the evil Babadook focused on the mental breakdown of the mother in the film and her young son who was just as batty. All children seen monsters under the bed and in the closet in this case those monsters are really there or are they. I wish there were more of a background of The Babadook it seems like it is exist in just from one children's book . The son/ child in the film Samuel played by Noah Wiseman when not saying lines that he is pretty good at just screams and screams at his mother Amelia (Essie Davis) who looses it more and more at each scream. It's not a great film but I can see some younger people and those scared easily having nightmares from it.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It also has this strange beauty to each shot, even though 90% of the film happens in the same set.The only bad part about the movie was the sound editing.

Disturbing and character driven horror,"The early 2010s provided a refreshing change of direction in horror, as gory franchises such as Saw and Hostel had tested the limits of what audiences could stomach. Instead of gruesome torture porn, a slew of films took a back to basics approach, finding fear and horror in the supernatural and placing a greater focus on relationships, acting, and a creepy old house at the centre of the action.Sitting right in the middle of this trend, the Babadook sees a widowed mother Amelia struggle to handle the relationship with her young son Samuel, whose behavioural issues are causing her problems at work and embarrassment among the people around her. She still grieves the loss of her husband, whom years later she still cannot talk about, and she lashes out at anyone who tries to broach the topic.Much of Amelia frustration with Samuel stems from his insistence on the existence of the Babadook, a monster depicted in a children's book that Samuel owns.The illustrations in this book are truly creepy, and as new pages are inexplicably added to the book later in the film, they become outright disturbing, depicting Amelia killing firstly the family dog, then then Samuel, then herself.Of course, as the film goes on, the Babadook begins to appear in Amelia's real life in the form of a disembodied coat and hat set hanging on the wall, croaky phone calls, and eventually as a dark presence in the house where the monster attacks her.The depictions of the Babadook himself are somewhat underwhelming and we never see him in full as represented in the children's book. Perhaps this is intentional as the real horror comes from Annie's transformation under the influence of the Babadook. Where the film starts with her as an exasperated mother with whom we sympathise, as the Babadook exerts his influence, we see her behaviour devolve and her treatment of Samuel becomes sickeningly abusive. Her behaviour to begin with could be plausibly interpreted as a disturbing yet human response to a challenging situation, and we as the audience are unsure where Amelia starts and the Babadook begins.The possession eventually becomes demonically cruel and we are left with no doubt that we are no longer watching Amelia. It is up to Samuel to try and expell the evil monster and bring back his mother.Although the film makes it clear that the monster really exists, it can be easily read as an allegory for grief. We are told that the more you deny the Babadook's existence, the stronger he becomes. The most shocking scenes are not those involving him directly but where Amelia is breaking down and becoming a kind of mother that nobody would ever want to be. Without context, an audience might think they were watching a tragic family drama rather than a supernatural horror film. This keeps the film grounded and engaging, and appeals to real human struggles to which many audiences will be able to relate. There are also enough jump scares and creepy creatures to adhere to more typical horror conventions.In terms of weak points, I would have liked the Babadook himself to have been explored a bit more fully. What are his origins, his motivations, and what does he want from his victims? The film either could have leaned into the grief allegory and fleshed this out further, or made a departure from this theme and created a new mythology behind the titular creature. Those details aside, the the film is intriguing, well-acted, and engaging.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another horror-film disappointment.,"The Babadook is the story of a strange supernatural creature that arrives after being read about in a book, which itself just ""appears"" on a child's shelf. It then begins to torment a troubled woman, haunted by the death of her husband, and her likewise- troubled son with a history of behavioral problems. Pretty standard.The first hour of the movie is spent wanting to slap the spoiled children before things take a dark turn, as the woman begins a rapid decent into insanity spurned on by her son's insistence that the Babadook is real-- and it wants to hurt them.Well-acted and atmospheric, yet too boring to be considered a good film-- the creepiest parts of the movie were the horrific illustrations in the pop-up book that seemed to serve as the vessel for the Babadook's arrival.While not terribly bad, I was still left wondering if anyone is still frightened by films of this ilk, and why I still feel compelled to watch them.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
If you think monsters are scary...,"This may not be the movie for you if you watch it expecting to be scared by the ""monster"". What scared me the most about this movie is how great it was in showing that the scariest monsters are within, and very much a real thing people deal with in their lives.I sat watching a good portion of this movie with wide eyes and mouth open in shock. Not once did the movie make me jump, but I have to admit it's been a long time since a movie made me feel so unnerved. I really appreciated the lack of jump scares too. Most of what passes as horror in movies lately is a series of short suspenseful moments followed by a ""gotcha"" jump scare. Kind of like walking through a good haunted house on Halloween. This movie on the other hand, is like that feeling you might get when the power goes out and you're alone. You start hearing noises that would normally be familiar but put you on edge given the situation. Subtle fear starts to build as your imagination runs wild with possibilities as to what might be going on around you.Do yourself a favor and set aside reservations about watching this movie for scares. Try to see past the action happening in the movie and imagine what is going on from the perspective of the main characters. If you really let it in, you will be scared.

The Haunting Shadows of Parental Fear: A Chilling Tale Unveiled,"'The Babadook' creeps into the darkest corners of the human psyche, leaving viewers with a lingering sense of dread that seeps far beyond its runtime. Directed by Jennifer Kent in her feature debut, this Australian gem is a masterclass in building tension and exploring the terrifying depths of parental anxiety.The film introduces us to Amelia (Essie Davis), a single mother struggling to raise her young son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) while still grappling with the tragic death of her husband. Their world, already tinged with grief and loneliness, takes a sinister turn when a mysterious pop-up book, ""Mister Babadook,"" appears on their bookshelf, unleashing a malevolent presence that mirrors the family's inner turmoil.What sets this horror flick apart is its meticulous exploration of the psychological, rather than relying solely on jump scares. The Babadook, a top-hat-wearing, shadow-like creature, becomes a metaphor for the all-consuming nature of grief, depression, and the primal fears that come with parenthood. As the entity's influence grows, so does the tension within the family, blurring the lines between the supernatural and the psychological. The once-loving mother, exhausted and overwhelmed, transforms into a volatile figure, her maternal instincts distorted by the darkness that has invaded their lives.Kent's direction is both subtle and striking, using shadows and sound design to create an atmosphere that is as haunting as it is intimate. The scenes where Amelia is tormented by the Babadook's presence, her sleep-deprived state, and the escalating tension between her and Samuel, are masterfully crafted, showcasing Kent's ability to elicit fear from the simplest of elements.Young Wiseman's performance as Samuel is a standout, capturing the complexity of a child grappling with the supernatural and his mother's deteriorating mental state. His portrayal adds a layer of vulnerability and innocence, making the audience question the nature of the threat they face.While the film's pacing may test the patience of those seeking fast-paced horror, the slow build-up pays off in intensely chilling moments. The climax, set within the confines of their home, is a testament to the power of practical effects and clever cinematography, leaving viewers with a sense of unease that lingers long after the credits roll.'The Babadook' is not your typical monster-under-the-bed horror story. It's a nuanced exploration of the monsters within, the ones that lurk in the shadows of our minds, waiting to be unleashed. This film is a must-watch for horror enthusiasts seeking a thought-provoking blend of psychological terror and emotional depth.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Grief, isolation, reality, adaptation, protection of loved ones, going forward among others are themes covered in a beautiful way in this film.This is the perfect psychological horror film. Profoundly scary, very well acted and filmed and definitely very entertaining.This is a beautiful jewel of horror movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid acting but weak script,"Essie Davis and Noah Wieseman are apparently good actors but the script was very weak. The first time the Babadook materializes it looks like a cartoon character, I actually started laughing.The ending is not believable,the adopt a Babadook theme is more comedy than horror. Also this movie was just kind of patched together and didn't come off cohesively. I can honestly say that I was initially drawn into it, but that interest turned into boredom about sixty minutes into the film. Character development was below average and the movie reaches a crescendo about half way into it and goes down hill from there. I would give this film a 7/10 for it's acting and overall a 5/10 once you consider the script. Davis deserves better material than this, what a shame.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Total waste of time,"This movie actually starts pretty good, and I thought it was going to keep that pace. But after just a few scenes, I realized this movie sucks. I've watched the whole movie, hoping something would happen that would change my opinion, but this movie continued to sink in its awfulness. I have wasted 1.5 hours of my life on this, I beg you to learn from my mistake and don't watch it. I gotta have 10 lines of text, so I am going to continue writing about how awful this movie is. The worst I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies, trust me. I've read some reviews that actually made some sense into this movie, but it still sucks.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Very unnerving, VERY amazing movie","I am a huge fan of horrors and psych thrillers, but I have to say, this movie REALLY unsettled me. I saw someone say it's like a mix of The Shining and We Need To Talk About Kevin, and that is absolutely right.With NO JUMPSCARES, The Babadook somehow manages to unsettle the viewer more than any other movie I can think of. I expected it to be one of those horror movies like Insidious, but it is far from. (It's more of a psych thriller.) The acting is phenomenal, for maybe the first time, I really, really cared about the characters. It is such an unnerving movie, and I felt genuinely scared. I would highly recommend watching this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"So much potential, so little resolution","Babadook is an expansion of a ten minute short done by the director in earlier years. She should have kept it as a short and skipped the 'long' version. The pacing is.. well methodical I guess. The two actors do a good job, the photography is fine, the sound is a little over the top but what the film really lacks is a horror movie plot. Monster movies usually have a monster in them and Babadook plays games with the core element so much that by the time the movie ended I was confused, unsatisfied and scratching my head at the absence of a climax. Gave it a '3' because the lead actress was excellent, the kid did his role well and all the secondary characters were fine.Any monster movie done reasonably well can have scary moments but there's gotta be more to it than loud noises and quick editing. Asking the audience to fill in the gaps doesn't cut it.And no, its no 'Exorcist' or 'Haunting of Hill House', thats for sure.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of worst films I've seen,","I was really excited to watch since IMDb has an slightly average rating. But this was one of worst movies I ever seen. The only thing here positive and remarkable was the acting of an very young kid. Mother does also a good melodramatic acting but on other scenes she is way predictable. But probably were the 2 good things of the film. The story behind is completely non sense, rubbish, forced, etc. Im not rating badly because is not an horror movie as it is classified (which in fact is not) but for me that isn't even the point. The point is that is a so weak movie in every aspect. Its so bad its hard to find a category to fit this movie really. I have seen during 45 min and I felt stopped in the time and in the same scenes,no excitement , no surprises, nothing. Obviously i couldn't see it till the end and I've just forward straight to the end.a big disappointment and it shows that many users of IMDb don't have an idea of what should be made a good movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Scary,entertaining,and thought-provoking horror.","The Babadook is one of the best horror movies I've seen since Sinister. It is scary, engaging , and it makes you think about it a while after viewing it. The terror here does not come from cheap jump- scares , but from tension built from atmosphere and psychological horror.The story is great because it deals with universal themes like grief, loneliness, and resentment. The music here is also quite effective and creepy and not overly used . The visuals are very unique and creepy . There is not an excessive amount of cgi used here , thankfully.The acting is pretty good , although some may find the young boy a little annoying at first. The pacing is a little slow at first but the final third of the movie is pretty intense without being super gory . The ending may be a little ambiguous but I felt satisfied by it.I would recommend The Babadook to anyone who enjoys scary , atmospheric horror like Sinister or Insidious . If you're looking for something besides lame remakes or cheesy found footage horror, give The Babadook a try.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A twisted and cerebral horror masterpiece.,"(Halloween Horror Reviews #14)Rarely are horror films this effective. The Babadook sets out to do a few things, and nails every single one of them. It curls toenails, dries mouths, opens eyes. It is legitimately one of the genres best entries in over a decade.The first reason for this masterpieces effect is the phenomenal performance by Essie Davies. She dominates the screen throughout and presents fragility, doubt, menace and realism in everything she does. We relate with everything she does and thinks (we delve deeply into her psyche through use of dream sequences) and are driven to to shivering fright as the horrors unfold around her. In conjunction with this career making performance is Noah Wiseman, portraying a young boy haunted by his separation from others and his mother's guilt and fear. He is believably and highly likable in a part that so easily could have failed or become overbearing. Instead of this however, he brings a sense of dread and danger to the scenario by his vulnerability and sympathetic mannerisms.The director has control over her atmosphere to a level that would impress Kubrick or Romero, it is a truly staggering achievement in modern horror. The beautifully washed-out set design, the prevalent shadows and the careful lighting. I particularly praise the shots of barren trees against the stark white sky, it was a poignant source of chills for me and was essential in forming the film's harsh and uninviting world. The film oozes with passion and care, and the atmosphere was clearly the focus of much of these passions.The Babadook has a refined emotional range rarely seen in lesser horror fare. It brings catharsis, wonder and immense sympathy before the horror begins and creates a fully formed connection with both of the main characters before the true chills begin. The final 20 minute stretch can best be described as a glorious crescendo of various emotions, all with freakish implications and subtexts. You feel like you've entered a fresh layer of Hell, and are overwhelmed with unease and persistent cloying dread.In conclusion The Babadook stole my heart, before promptly forcing it though the emotional wringer. It should stand as one of THE all time classics and will affect its audience in varied and totally unexpected ways. It is one of the most joyfully surprising film experiences that I have ever had. I hope that every member of this creative team goes on to have sparkling careers of their own.I would also like to personally thank the Kickstarter contributors for this film's art budget. Thank you for allowing me to experience this cinematic powerhouse in it's full glory.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I just don't know where to begin,"This is my first ever review. Main reason being is that I felt it necessary as I always check IMDb for reviews on movies. Saw some very high scores. So being an Aussie Made movie, I thought I would support Australian products, and give it a shot. This movie has probably stopped me from ever making that decision again. First off...... it's not a horror movie. It wasn't even scary. It was a lame Drama more than anything else. I understand this movie was made on a tight budget. But there have been plenty of horror movies made on a small budget that are actually scary..... and good. If you are reading this.... don't go off the higher scores on this movie. It is more than likely friends and family members writing those reviews. Listen to me... and do not waste your precious time if you want to see a good scary movie. If you have no life and no taste in movies, and are just waiting to die.... and you've watched every other movie every released..... then give this a crack. Otherwise.... STAY CLEAR!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Carves a pit into your stomach that won't feel whole for long after the film has ended. Utterly masterful.,"I don't want to give the film a number, because numbers are too limiting and don't really encapsulate the essence of a film. A 10 suggests a film to be completely perfect, and although I believe The Babadook is, it still seems almost hyperbolic. A number is just a digestible verdict of a compendium of thoughts, so rather than this continued waffling I'll actually try to articulate my opinion of the film.I'm no connoisseur of Horror cinema, and really couldn't confidently point out all the influences and tropes that make up each film, but as a general self-confessed film buff I'd like to, with some measure of certainty, declare this a masterpiece. Again, hyperbolic. But I don't bestow that phrase lightly. It is one of the most overwhelming, emotionally exhausting films I've had the pleasure of seeing. It is a complete drainage of the psyche; not an unwelcome one like Lucy (2014) that in its stupidity and banality seems like an intellectual thief trying to rob you of your enjoyment, but a welcome fatigue, one that in tiring you invites you to enjoy every frame available to the eye. (Which is limited in this event, as your shirt will be desperately pulled up to your forehead, as you try to wish away the terror of this spectacle)The atmosphere is so perfectly realised from the get-go. The subdued and repressed blues and greys of the house in which the film largely takes place, and the drab and tediously homely colours of our protagonist Amelia's clothes set the tone immediately, and also forewarn us as to what we've gotten ourselves in to. The set-design is immaculate; the house empty and sparsely decorated enough to put us at unease and yet accurately reflect the psychology and financial struggle of the mother Amelia. On this note, I should say the film is true to life. The premise, which sees a soon-to-be mother (Essie Davies) lose her Husband in childbirth and mid-journey to hospital, and never recover from this loss, is not glossed over, the material implications of this never ignored. In American cinema, particularly horror and comedy, we always see the world through this filter of artifice. The people are so perfect and privileged, and their world is so infuriatingly unperturbed before whatever horror or mishap it is that sets the plot rolling.Our mother, and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) do not have a happy life when we first see them, and their modest-at-best-household conveys this perfectly. Amelia diligently works to support herself and her son, yet Samuel is a troubled and exasperated young boy, plagued by the child's irrationality, and a young boy's longing for a father he never had, and so she is constantly fighting for some peace of mind. She herself is still reeling from her husband's death. The opening sequence sets this premise, yet in the world of the intangible nightmare; the sound is muted and drowned, and Amelia crashes back to bed. (The sound design reminded me briefly of the Exorcist, with its surreal use of silence) She is a vulnerable woman, instantly sympathetic in her plight, and is a true triumph of character that American counter-parts don't give us. She has a mental precariousness and financial instability that is wholly relatable.As she increasingly grows exhausted and frail, we feel as if we are too. Her and the son, whom the film allows to share such a sincere and tender, yet unstable relationship, steal our sympathy, and we are emotionally involved without realising it. The dynamic of mother-son relationship is so unfiltered in its unflinching domesticity, that as we progress and the horrors unfold we are almost screaming of them to be allowed some relief. Some shred of respite. Essie Davies is most comparable to Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby, and her performance is inarguably equal. Without theatrics or over-the-top hysterics, she marvellously plays the psychologically unravelling mother. Noah Wiseman offers one of the best child performances I've seen.I watched The Conjuring last night, and it is plagued by all the flaws I described. The people in it are ultimately just hollow tools, puppets to orchestrate some mild scares for the audience, but the Babadook is so far removed from that, that it's undoubtedly triumphant. They are real people. And we care for them, completely. Jennifer Kent's direction and script-work, and the two leading performances, the only significant (in size) performances, are utterly magnificent. The other character, The Babadook itself, is a masterpiece in tease, in taunting the imagination but never revealing itself to the eye. It largely inhabits a book in which the characters read, and these illustrations are malevolent, so sinister in their creation that they are enough to haunt our dreams for weeks. When the creature does manifest itself in some vague physical form, obscured in shadow, it is almost more than enough.The Babadook doesn't do jump-scares. Nothing throw-away or cheap. What it does do is slowly encroaching terror, like a shadow gradually invading your periphery. As the characters fall into terror, so do we. The gnawing anxiety in my stomach was such that I considered leaving the screening to calm myself.The cinematography, the presentation of the film is subtle, and always lets the anxiety unfurl. An early example, a transition, in which sinister shadows travel across a duvet in a time-lapse like fashion is ambiguous in its nature, and offers us no comfort. Are they the shadows of some malevolent presence, or can we seek a rational explanation, such as the shadows of the sun progressing with the day? The film maintains this careful ambiguity, to the point that the film can work on two levels. But ultimately, it is one of these levels which best fits, and encapsulates the idea of the film: There is nothing more destructive than the human consciousness.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A one-of-a-kind masterpiece!,"Seeing the title, i was hesitant with the movie. I mean, it's a little ridiculous and it got me thinking it's some kind of throwaway comedy/horror. But, NO! This movie blew my expectations out of the water. I was trying to close my ears and eyes when the scares started yet i can't miss a scene of this gem.It is a story about a grieving mother with a single child after the death of the father seven years later. Coping from her grief, one day her son found a storybook named 'Mister Babadook'. And then... I just can't tell you 'cause it would only ruin the surprise!I gotta tell you i was not expecting much. But, everything seems to be running smoothly. From its' cinematography to its' acting. The actors did an excellent job portraying the bleak family, bringing tension to the highest level possible. And the Babadook...I just can't believe this is just a low budget movie. It's flawless!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beware of the Babadook,"I was privileged to see coincidentally see the trailer of the Babadook during a TV show. Not convinced, yet hoping there is something new for the eyes. Then saw so many applauds were given to this movie, including in this site. Could not wait to have it this Friday night and here I am.The Good One thing good about this movie is so many positive reviews are given, that I expect at least it is as good as the Conjuring. Also, the acting of the mother is pretty good. The plot was moving pretty well. But it is for the acting of the mother, I gave it a five stars.The Bad Now, half way into this movie, I am not sure if this is a mother-son melodrama or a mother-son horror movie. I cannot even remember a horrifying scene from this movie. OK, there are some horror scenes, the cockroach and the caterpillar. Personally hate those. Story is not engaging and even many TV movies are much better. I am not even sure if part of the story makes sense, how the aunt hates the kid that much. I can't tell too much without a spoiler which I don't like to spill out. Everyone has their birth right to enjoy or dislike her own time in a movie.Conclusion If you are a fan of horror movie, like I am, beware of the Babadook. Babadook. It may turn out not as it looks.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Meh,"So I did not absolutely hate it, that's something. There was actually quite a lot to appreciate here. I can't fault the acting of the main characters, for one. Some interesting visual effects. (And a bunch of terrible ones.) Fairly interesting story, if not especially original. A fair amount of courage from the filmmakers to depict themes that are guaranteed to be unpopular.But most scary horror of all time? Riiiight... Not one scary moment. If anything, there were disturbing, annoying, pityful, sad, abhorrent scenes, but scary? Not even close.What the film worked most effective as was birth control. Every single child in the movie, espeially the main character was painfully unbearable, like nails on a blackboard. Not like Mommy of the Year was not annoying/despicable at least most of the time, but that kid... It was actually hard to get to the part where ""stuff"" started happening without switching the movie off to get rid of the whining little thing. Again, you can count it as a positive since the boy playing him did a great job to create that effect.One thing's for sure, I'm not re-watching this ever again.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Future classic.,"If ever there's a film that's destined to be thoroughly misunderstood, it's The Babadook. All the trailers have it pegged to be an outright horror movie, filled with jumpscares and gore. Thankfully nothing could be further from the truth. Though it is a horror, this debut feature from Jennifer Kent relies on undercurrents of sadness and looming violence, an eerie atmosphere, and in my opinion, the scariest movie villain since little Regan chilled our blood in The Exorcist.Back to it being misunderstood, though. It's already being criticized for all the things that make it great, simply because the trailers have misled people. This is also a thoughtful film that borders on being a flat-out drama examining a borderline-abusive mother-son relationship in the wake of extreme grief; albeit with a seemingly haunted kids book in tow. Brilliant as it is, the typical weekend horror movie audience aren't going to appreciate that, and so it has already received tons of backlash. So I warn you now; if you want jumpscares, gore, people being dragged across rooms etc. go see Annabelle or rent out Hostel, because this film will probably not be to your taste.To those of you who aren't after those kinds of films (those of you with attention spans), this is an amazing, haunting film. As one reviewer pointed it, it plays out a bit like an extremely dark Tim Burton film, with it's slightly Gothic style and grim colour palate. As a horror, it's actually very effective. As I mentioned above, the titular character is extremely sinister and creepy, and is sure to join the ranks of legendary horror villains. He's used sparingly though, and the film manages to create many scary moments without him too; the kids book causing all the trouble is chilling to the bone, and Essie Davis is bone-rattling as a dangerously unhinged character (for that matter... I smell Oscar buzz for her role here).As a drama, it's emotional and raw without ever running into camp (which could have happened very, very easily with this material). I won't ruin any of it (and I urge you to avoid reviews that do), but it makes for fascinating viewing that calls to mind both Pan's Labyrinth and The Exorcist, with a dash of the less fantastical We Need to Talk About Kevin, which this film actually beats, in my book.This is definitely one of the best films of 2014, and a film that's destined for classic status, misunderstood or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Amazing horror that burns slow but keeps you constantly gripped,"Great and genuinely terrifying horror movie. It is very much so a slow burner but all throughout the film I guarantee you will be on the edge of your seat.A lot of the negative reviews are obviously from people who are used to constant stimulation and aren't happy sitting and paying attention to a great storyline slowly unfold. If you class a great horror as ""hostel"" or ""saw"" then you may struggle to keep yourself entertained without seeing blood flying left right and center every two minutes.However, if you really want to watch a smart and deeply metaphorical horror film this is truly one of the best in many years.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genius,"This movie is insane. This film managed to stick with me like few others have been able to do. Never since Sinister has my heart been beating so quickly, my mind racing and my senses heightened to even the slightest bump in the night. Needless to say, I enjoyed The Babadook very much.For one thing, the film is heavy on atmosphere and immersing the viewer in the experience without even being completely aware of it doing so. This film is very blue, the walls of the house, the curtains, most of the furniture is all in a sort of melancholy indigo that has a habit of creating an atmosphere of sorrow and general negativity. Meanwhile other scenes appear grainy and often have a dull sort of hue that really emphasizes the overall presence of a dilemma for our main characters to face.Another great quality of this film is it's acting, predominantly the two main characters Amelia and her son Samuel. These two both give great performances. Amelia is someone that I find more and more real as I watch her. Sure her actions in the film are at times not something normal human beings would typically do. But with the things that she goes through it can be said that there is a reasonable motivation behind her behavior. Huge props to Essie Davis for her role as Amelia. Noah Wiseman also does a great job as Samuel who is a psychopathic kid who is prone to violence and sporadic behavior . But along with his mother, Samuel's reactions are strange but certainly not unreal.But most importantly as a horror film should be, this film is horrifyingly scary. There were several occasion where I had to cover my eyes. The movie even had one scare during the climax involving Samuel that gave me chills and my jaw actually dropped as the scene unfolded, it was that scary folks.In conclusion, go see this movie! I can honestly without a doubt say this is one of the greatest horror movies I've ever scene. Even if horror isn't your thing, I'd still highly recommend giving The Babadook a shot. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Babadook Review.,"The Babadook(2014) is an Australian film by first time writer/director Jennifer Kent. The film Is about a recently widowed single mother Amelia(Essie Davis), who is struggling with controlling her out of control six year old son Sam(Noah Wiseman), who is convinced monsters exist. His behaviour becomes more and more erratic to the point she's forced to take him out of school and look after him by herself.One night Amelia reads him a story of The Babadook, that mysteriously appears on Sams bookshelf. As she begins to read the disturbing book of Mr.Babadook, who torments victims when they become aware of it's existence. Amelia rips up and throws out the book, but the book re- assembles, and is left on her front door. Then strange and more violent acts start happening, as she starts having visions of her deceased husband.Jennifer Kent, directs the film with a very claustrophobic feel, so that the main characters are always feeling trapped and unable to escape from their environment. The Babadook is filled with intelligent symbolism, and metaphors for the viewer think about during the film, and long after it's ended. The film deals with Issues about how fear attracts fear, and how not dealing with our problems, can bring the deepest parts of our subconscious to life.The film is boosted by two strong performances from the lead actors. Davis portrays a grieving mother who is at the end of her rope, with her son, as she begins to lose sight of reality. Wiseman gives a star making performance in his first film. He does a fantastic job of showing both strength and vulnerability, whilst dealing with paranormal monsters, and his increasingly dangerous and destructive home life.The Babadook Is a film that focuses on style, subtext and atmosphere, whilst rarely using jump scares to terrify it's audience. This film has all the right ingredients that makes it one of the best Horror films in recent years.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
For all the right reasons,"If you want a good and true horror movie than I would be doing an injustice if I did not recommend this movie. There are a lot of different horror movies out there: blood and gore, with cheesy or lame set ups like any movie with Jason, Freddy, or Chucky; gritty classics and homages like evil dead or cabin in the woods; or the too joking to be scary or nothing but jump scares like John dies at the end or, well everything else Hollywood sends out and calls horror basically falls into the jump scare category. Even found footage movies seem to be nothing but jump scare after jump scare if they are trying to make it a horror movie. Now don't get me wrong, I like Jason and Freddy. I like cabin in the woods and John dies at the end. I like the old and even the new evil dead. For me though, there is just something special about this movie.If you are expecting a lot of jump scares than go watch sinister. This movie has few if any that I can recall. This movie reminds me a lot of Oculus, which has some good moments and if you haven't seen I would also recommend. Babadook goes farther though. Babadook to me is if you took Oculus, stripped all the exposition and back story, changed the antagonist thing, removed the father, and then asked Stanley Kubrick to direct the movie as a horror. There really isn't any filler to give us a why. No kids lost in the woods eating cherries or secret realm of demons. The horror plot explanation is ""because plot"" and that's all we need. Look at silent hill 2 compared to silent hill when they started trying to explain things.The Babadook is creepy. It is not jump scare scary. You might never jump once. The Babadook is the kind of horror that gets inside you and makes you feel uncomfortable. Whether it is the mother and her plight, the kid and, well the kid is messed, or anything else. It isn't the type of horror to give you a quick thrill. It is the type of horror to get inside you and make you feel uncomfortable, and then haunt you the babadook plot line without ratcheting back anything else. By the end of the movie you should the horror feeling of ""did I turn the tap water off"" or ""did I leave my account logged in and computer still on"" kind of discomfort should be present and just hope nobody visits later that night, and knocks, three, times.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most thrilling and appreciative horror film I've seen in a long time.,"Even though this may not be the scariest horror film, I can honestly say it's the best, and the most appreciative one to boot, going for well thought out and promising scares rather than your typical BOO! jump scares like the typical horror film you see made today.Amelia is a widowed orderly who stresses day in and day out in taking care of her distraught and outcast son, getting rarely any sleep every night over the death of her husband.Right away the film jumps into the plot. We immediately learn of the tragedy in the family without any forced exposition, and we passively learn of the son's disillusioned state. At first you feel for the mother and what she goes through for the son, but the film quickly changes moods in the blink of an eye, but keeps a steady pace on the tone.It has a chilling atmosphere the whole time, making you feel like it's another David Fincher film.Essie Davis as Amelia is amazing, especially for a horror film. The film makes you feel different feelings for her throughout, though her performance makes her likable and unlikable in all the right parts. The son impressed me to no end. He's the right amount of creepiness, but in the end he also has the most amount of humanity to him.What I really love is how self aware the characters are. When they suspect something they play it safe and smart. No clichés whatsoever. No going into an abandoned cabin in the middle of nowhere or investigating a strange noise outside BS, this film is completely original and smart from beginning to end.The Babadook himself appears when Amelia reads her son a bedtime story based on him. She finds the book disturbing and gets rid of it, until it starts to stalk her from the book, which where the psychological thrill ride falls into place.I highly recommend this film if you're looking for something fresh in the horror genre. It's a film with actual scares which is enough for me. I'm hoping this film inspires other movies to be made to actually try to not treat people like 6 year old girls and focus on the psychological part of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I can see what you did there,"I totally can see the director was trying to achieve. It seems to me this is a story about mental break down after a tragic loss, and eventual recovery (of sorts). But .... and it's a big BUT. From the beginning the characters are totally unlikable. The mother seems rather trashy and neurotic from film minute 1, the son is horribly obnoxious and generally a pain in the behind - also from film minute 1. The home is chaotic, adding to the general impression of a mental breakdown in process. There's also a dog there, even he isn't very likable, as far as dog likability goes. And of course it is killed (the only reason for it's inclusion?). They simply are unlikable - to me I couldn't care less if Babadook ate the whole street.Also one moment, possibly not important in the general flow of things, is the visit of the mother colleague from work. Upon hearing the brat isn't sick, he just vanishes from the story - but it adds to the general doom, gloom and surreal feeling of the movie.Then finally getting over the characters and their dog aren't likable - the movie ends. Good riddance. I've seen worse, I've definitely seen much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Take  one  look  and you  can never get rid of the Babadook,"The reviews here are clearly divided into those who loved and those who hated it, mainly because this is not classic horror. The Babadook is actually more a psychological drama that uses it's monster as a metaphor for how we deal with our fears, our grief, our pain. For Amelia, a widowed mother with a young, difficult child, her suppressed trauma begins to manifest itself as a horrendous creature, first in her dreams, later in real life. As her mental state spirals downwards, her life and that of her son come in mortal danger. What makes the film so scary and touching is that we all can (at least partially) relate to those dark feelings that conjured up the apparition. A tour de force for Essie Davis who gives us a stellar performance as the troubled Amelia. The whole film is highly stylized, in some parts maybe a touch too much, when in becomes almost Tim-Burton-esque, but the atmosphere it creates does work perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Amazingly Crafted Emotional Terror,"I'm a newcomer to horror movies. I don't know all there is to know nor can I compare this film to many other like it, but when I did succumb to my inner longing to see this movie I was not at all disappointed. I may or may not be like many of you horror fans, when your in your room or at the cinema and you are watching a truly good horror movie, it's like nothing else. It's exhilarating, your heart beating like a drum, your adrenalin pumping and a light sweat beginning to appear on your brow. If you love all of those things than you must give this film a go. I bought the DVD and upon pressing play I spent nearly the remaining 90 minutes whimpering in the corner of my couch, blanket tucked tightly around myself and every now and then when things were quiet I would quickly turn behind me just to check that 'The Babadook' was not haunting my late night horror sessions. Not only is this movie scary it told a meaningful story, the themes that were explored are easily relatable and it forms these characters into living breathing human beings, they are brought to life so vividly. When you watch a film and your so invested in what is happening that you forget it's a movie, is truly a special thing. You forget about everything and you think solely about the story, about the characters and about how much you are not sleeping tonight. This you know your watching a well made film. This movie legitimately unsettled me, Jennifer Kent's superb way of crafting an atmosphere that oozed tension, this film's way of expanding upon themes such as loneliness and grief is masterful and bring with it an emotional punch. Along with an astounding performance by both Essie Davis (Amelia) and Noah Wiseman (Samuel) this shapes up as a fantastic horror movie that I recommend anyone to see, I don't care if you love horror movies or you hate them because a lot of this movie isn't about the horror there is a lot more to it and for this reason I have given 'The Babadook' a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The film dies at the hour mark and gets sillier and sillier,"The Babadook is a well crafted film that manages to ratchet up some decent suspense, mystery and even some scares, until the thin narrative runs out of steam. The last half hour devolves into a cheap horror show that produces unintentional laughs, as the story disintegrates on screen. The Babadook just doesn't sustain as a feature length film. Essie Davis is excellent as the lead and she commits herself to this material and her fantastic performance keeps the film watchable. Child actor Noah Wiseman isn't as successful, as the boy can be competent in some scenes and so grating in others, you'll need the mute button handy. His performance could have been shaped slightly better and certainly less irritating through editing, but as cruel as it sounds, it's an annoying kid performance. Even with all of its shortcomings, The Babadook is a nice showcase of talent for a first time director and I look forward to her next project.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Movie that presents horror in a correct way,The movie portrays horror and fear as more psychological than a supernatural phenomena happening to a person which indeed makes more sense. If you think horror movie should contain some supernatural elements and gore then you wouldn't like this movie. The movie was built showing how life is affected by trauma and how important it is to overcome one's fear however big and scary the fears might be to be able to see the true colors of life. The movie made more and more sense when I started to think about the various things happened through out the story line on watching it for one more time. I wonder why anyone didn't try to portray horror as this movie does previously or I wasn't aware of such movies. Its definitely worth spending time to watch this movie.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hollywood should be ashamed. With less than 1/100th budget yet 50 times better than any American horror film,"The Babadook is an Australian horror movie both written and directed by first time director Jennifer Kent. It is a horror movie the likes of which you have never seen before. It delves deep into psychological trauma and the grief that can be led on by the death of a loved one.Let me start off by saying this movie was, fantastic. It isn't often you see a horror movie that isn't just relatable to certain people, but to the human race as a collective. At one point or another everyone has a feeling of guilt, repression or grief etc. It is also one of the very few horror movies that isn't rife with ridiculous clichés. Maybe one or two but you can't avoid them all.What makes this movie scary? Most, or pretty much ALL horror movies these day rely on jump scares or gore to frighten the viewers. This movie has none of that. They rely on special effects and CGI to make the monster look scary, because they focus too much on that, they lose whats really important. At first sight this is a monster movie, but when you get further into the story you realize that it isn't hat you first though. The Babadook isn't just some monster. Monster movies don't scare, because the people watching them know they're not real. But the Babadook IS real. It's about a persons shadow self taking over your conscience mind. The shadow self is a persons negative feelings, all their fears and regrets that is put into your unconscious and out of mind. The Babadook isn't just some random monster. It is real. and it exists in all of us.Even William Friedkin director of the Exorcist, which I would consider the scariest movie of all time, said ""Iv'e never seen a more terrifying film than 'The Babadook'"" coming from a man who knows what makes a good horror film. He knows that what is scary about this movie isn't just whats on the surface. It's what lies within. Grab a pen and notepad Hollywood, because THIS, is how you make a horror film.8.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A bit of everything (horror, thriller, drama) and it's all good!!","I try to watch every horror movie possible, desperately seeking for a scare, often appalled by how bad or cheesy they are. To give you a taste: I liked Jeepers Creepers, Descent, VHS, Insidious and Cabin in the Woods.After so many clones of 6th Sense, remakes and sequels, I didn't know what to expect. But unlike many other movies, the atmosphere in Babadook grabs you within the first minutes and won't let you go. Within those same minutes, you'll grow to either love or hate the main characters (mother and child), only to realize that it is because of their flawless acting.The characters are worked out perfectly, in a genuine creepy and almost claustrophobic setting. The horror is lurking from the shadow but doesn't ruin the movie with predictable scares. Obviously the scare work is not done by clichés or effects, but by atmosphere, acting and not knowing what to expect. The movies also uses symbols and metaphors which I can't explain without giving stuff away, but they don't overuse it in the way they did with ""Only God Forgives"".This is a movie you need to watch one times for the delightful scares, and than one more time to make you think. Now that makes this movie special.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
That damn kid.,I couldn't get through the movie. That damn kid was so weird and annoying it made it impossible to watch. I also got the vibe that he has this incestuous feeling towards his mother that grossed me out too. I can handle a lot of things but that isn't one. Like when he went to hug his mother early on in the movie and she told him to stop it/ don't do that it just felt weird.I have no clue how it has the high ratings it does. From the majority I got through it's not groundbreaking. It's not that interesting of a plot and the kid seriously ruins it. All I keep thinking about was that poor mother having to deal with him day in and day out.,3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Does it need to be spelt out?,"After just seeing this movie, and then reading the reviews, I have to say I agree with the majority here. It's by far the best horror flick I have seen for quite some time. I have been disappointed so many times recently by the latest horror films, I had begin to think the genre had become saturated with high-budget, over-hyped movies that fail to deliver any real scares. It seems horror movies nowadays are made to try and cater for too much of a wide audience. Babadook says 'screw you' to the Transformers fans who need everything spelt out to them, and instead takes a whole new approach. I couldn't help but notice the lack of music in the scare scenes, the lack of the obligatory house trashing scenes and the dog that actually gets killed and not comes running back to its owner for a happy ending. Bravo to everyone involved in this movie. I look forward to the next film from you guys!To sum up....this is a horror...with a difference.

"""If it's in a word or it's in a look; You can't get rid of the Babadook.""","FILM: 8.5/10.The Babadook remains one of my favourite Australian films from the last decade, and my recent rewatch only solidified its position in my personal horror hall of fame.What sets The Babadook apart is its refusal to lean on cheap jump scares. Instead, it crafts a chilling narrative that delves deep into the realms of mental health, grief, and behaviour disorders. It's not just a horror film; it's a psychological exploration that keeps you captivated from start to finish.The brilliance lies in its focus on the psychological aspects of the situation rather than relying on traditional scares. This unique approach makes the film a compelling and thought-provoking watch. It's not about startling the audience with sudden jolts; it's about unraveling the complexities of the characters' minds.Critics who dismiss the film because ""the kid was annoying"" miss the point entirely. Young Samuel's behavior is a deliberate and crucial element of the narrative. Through his character, the film offers a poignant glimpse into the challenges of dealing with grief and behaviour disorders, a perspective that adds layers of depth to the storytelling.Walking in Amelia's shoes, portrayed brilliantly by Essie Davis, makes the film even more impactful. The struggles she faces while coping with her own grief and mental health, all while attempting to understand and support her troubled son, create a profound and relatable emotional experience.And then there's the Babadook itself-an impeccable embodiment of horror. The simplistic design and eerie movements contribute to an atmosphere that's more terrifying than any over-the-top creature. Less, indeed, proves to be more in this case, as the Babadook haunts the screen with an unforgettable presence.In the end, The Babadook transcends the conventions of horror, offering an immersive and psychologically rich experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It's not just a horror film; it's an exploration of the human psyche, and that's what makes it a standout in the genre.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9/10.Upscaled 4K presentation, Detail level: Good, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The psychological horror of sadness.,"Babadook is a special film that takes seriousness with great complexity and stylism, presenting a spooky story through psychological terror (the ability to frighten us with our imagination rather than with the presentation of the monster, villain or enemy) and it does not fail in the unparalleled narrative quality and the sad, decaying and lost atmosphere it holds. I understand the critical reception of the film, after all it is a different shot in an oversaturated genre.The Babadook is a psychological horror movie, full of unexplained mystery and scenes designed to keep us tense and stressed by the possibility of something. The suspense is real and remains constant throughout the film, being the main premise of this the ability we have to imagine things that are not there, in turn, it presents a story based on the pain of the loss of a loved one, combining the difficulties of fear of the unknown with the horror of eternal goodbye.With excellent performances and an atmosphere built to give us a feeling of maximum discomfort, The Babadook manages to penetrate strongly between our nerves, especially if we investigate its surface and go deep into its depth. A good horror movie that plays with our minds and depicts us a story through a different and well narrated structure.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Truly phenomenal psychological horror,"The Babadook is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. Granted, it won't be everyone's flavor of horror and though it presents it's fair share of jump scares, The Babadook does them differently and does not rely on them to carry the film. IMO, The Babadook was marketed so poorly. The trailer prevented me from seeing it for a very long time. Monster thingy from a children's book? Meh.BUT...once I saw it, it blew me away.The Babadook is actually a very complex story with a multitude of layers. It is not your average supernatural monster movie. It builds tension, frustration, and dread expertly and then hits you where you least expect it to.The acting is top notch, the cinematography is brilliant, and the mood is bleak and gritty and pulls you into the story that is unfolding.It's a film that builds slowly while making you feel uncomfortable and impatient, but it's done on purpose. If you can sit back, let it happen and appreciate this fact, chances are The Babadook will be a worthwhile ride for you.The Babadook does not spoon feed its audience and much is left to the viewer's interpretation but it manages to do it in a way that doesn't feel so distant or removed. It doesn't try to be scary, it simply is.Sometimes the scariest things are our own minds.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Glad I saw it for free.,"Just watched after hearing some positive reviews and was disappointed. I've seen loads of films like this that are considered average fodder and this should be one of them. Two annoying main characters, a book, lots of darkness, a ghoul that can't be seen. You get the picture. Had this film been released 30 years ago it would have gone under the radar but the quality of film is so bad in the 21st century that The Babadook is considered a good film. I think people are looking into this film too much in regards to loss and depression which it does indeed have but as for having genuine horror there is none. It's not a scary film by any means and for me I couldn't wait for it to end and needless to say the ending was ambiguous.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this film, because I had heard so much about it that I had saved it for a real horror treat. In reality it was slow, muddled (quick shots, suddenly changing into something completely different, and one did not know what was real, what was a dream or a hallucination or what), weird, unpleasant and totally pointless.To begin with there were no good scares at all. I think it was even wrong to put this film in the ""horror"" category. Possibly it could have some interest, as a portrayal of life as a single mum to an only child with behavioral problems. Many people today can relate to THAT part. But in that case the supernatural element (or whatever it was) should not have been there at all. In my experience, it almost never works out well to try to combine something supernatural with something more actual, current or serious, such as social realism.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'Babadook' is a fine Aussie name for a phantom (probably a second cousin to the Bunyip) in this harrowing antipodean cross between 'The Innocents' and 'Repulsion' with a powerhouse performance by Essie Davis of which it's a compliment to say the ending comes as a relief.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
You can't get rid of . . . The Babadook,"Other than the title of the movie making me interested in this, but I have heard stuff about this movie with it being divisive in a way where there are people who like it and people who do not like it, mostly because of how the movie is marketed in the trailer making you think it is a monster movie when it is not. I thought The Babadook (2014) was an incredibly good creepy and unsettling horror movie that focuses on grief from losing a loved one that made the movie dark and creepy on what the mom and son are going through, until this book on this weird entity that affects them in bad and mysterious ways that get weird. This movie might not be for everyone, especially if you are misled by the marketing and trailer, but going in knowing what you are getting into will make your experience better.The mom played by Essie Davis was fantastic in the movie; throughout the film you understand how tough it is for to deal with her son who is weird, and dealing with the loss of this loved one who meant a lot to her life. The son named Samuel played by Noah Wiseman was also great in the movie; the son starts out as this annoying and difficult person that you start not liking, but as the movie plays out, he gets better, and you can feel for both him and his mother who are both dealing with a big loss that has affected them. After certain things with the Babadook, the mother starts having issues and starts seeing things while going crazy, along with the son fearing his mom or the entity in the house, and the performances from them here was amazing.The cover of the book named Mister Babadook was simple looking, but the pop-up images and illustrations were cool on how this book was made but also very creepy and disturbing; when you do get an appearance from The Babadook, he is hidden in the shadows with him having a creepy looking design when you can see him sometimes in the darkness. The movie uses the focus on grief very well, and the stuff with The Babadook was integrated very well with how the grief is affecting the characters along with the movie being unsettling as the movie plays out; the ending of the movie was interesting on how certain things rap up, but by the end of the movie because of how the Babadook hides in the shadows, it will have you looking in the closet and in the shadows which will creep you out and it is what makes the movie effective.The Babadook (2014) was a very good unsettling and creepy horror film that takes the concept of grief from losing a loved one and using in a dark way that will creep you out; I am glad we do not see The Babadook in full view, and I liked how they built him up instead of showing him constantly where you get tired of seeing him. There will be people who wanted a monster movie so they will not like this movie, but if you know what you are getting into then you will like this horror movie; I liked this horror movie and though it was creepy, though this not a horror movie that you will be able to watch all the time, it was still a very good horror movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
slow and drawn out,"I was genuinely disappointed. It's not often you see a horror film receive so much praise and I guess that put my expectations a bit high. I found the movie to move along quite slow. There were, in my opinion, very few scares. It was all build up and no delivery. I really disliked the characters to the point that they were becoming difficult to watch. First the child was unbearably annoying and then the mother. I understand that the family was meant to be portrayed in a troubled light but it was done in such a way that really made you hate them. All in all I think this film is extremely over rated.

Just average,"I read the reviews and the rating before I decided to give this film a chance. Maybe I should have watched the trailer, but it seems the latter was good, so it might have been misled as well. The movie isn't so bad but it definitely ins't worth its current 7.0 rating. The acting performance is pretty good (especially the Mom) but the storyline is at best déjà vu or cliché, not the least bit chilling anyway. Tis is definitely not a horror film. I rather consider it to be dark fantasy, which won't appeal to everybody for sure. Yet I really don't understand the big hype around The Babadook. I don't think it should be bashed either, but the current ratings & high number of positive comments certainly don't reflect the reality. I had the same feeling about The Cabin In The Woods, which also had 7+ ratings by 15k users at some point, but whose plot was so messy it didn't make any sense. I wonder what's up with IMDb ratings these days. When I see this film get praised mostly as a physchological thriller, I still wonder how come it gets better ratings than a film such as Derailed (also a psychological thriller) which is much better in comparison.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Babadook Review,"After losing her husband in a car accident on the same day of her son's birth, troubled widow Amelia (Essie Davis) must now deal with her grief from losing her husband while struggling to raise her troubled son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). When Samuel begins to believe that a monster has entered their home through the pages of a children's book, Amelia soon discovers that her son is telling the truth.I've spoken about this before but I am a big fan of horror films. I don't mind either type of horror film, the more violent ones where the more graphic it is the better as long as its not gratuitous or the psychological horror films that like to play around with your mind. I prefer the latter so I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that this film was more like the second. Despite being the film being called The Babadook and featuring a monster that also called The Babadook, it does take a backseat here. The film chooses to focus on the relationship between the mother and the son. Without giving too much of the story away, the film is about how the family, more specifically the mother, is coping with the grief of losing her husband and having to take care of her unstable son and dealing with the stress coming from that. With Amelia having lost her husband and Samuel having lost his father, they only have each other and this fact strengthens their relationship. The fact also becomes very evident to the viewer while watching and because of this, it is their film. You don't mind this because of the performances of Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman. Davis embodies the character of Amelia beautifully as she portrays Amelia's fear and fragile mental state with ease making her feel real and genuine. Wiseman's Samuel may seem annoying and obnoxious at first but he is simply a kid acting the way one would if they were in that kind of a situation. There are no jump scares in this film as its horror stems from how the monsters seems to affect the family emotionally and their relationship. I like this better as it isn't simply stupid characters running from one scare to the next as is often seen in lesser horror films. It chooses to scare in a more subtle way. Some may be turned off by its pace as it does take a while to get going but I did not mind this as I was becoming invested in the characters and this helped me to better appreciate what happened later on. It's not too flashy, for lack of a better word, either but that is probably because of the film's budget but based on the story, it was not necessary. I think I can easily say that after watching this film that it is now in my top 5 favorite horror films and definitely in the top 5 films of 2014. Just give it some time and I swear you will not be disappointed.Score: 9/10 keithlovesmovies.com",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A great premise for a decent film ruined by dreadful cast, plastic performances and poor direction.

"Great director and actors, but just not the right story for me.","It should be clarified that Jennifer Kent is a very good director. Unlike many of her colleagues she appears to have a clear vision and the skills to see it realized on film.
The subject she chose for her feature length debut isn't an easy sell for everyone, though. It deals with depression, mental (in)stability, social pressure, hardships of parenting and the loss of loved ones. The visual style tries its hardest to emphasize all of those aspects, ensuring that the audience can partake in the protagonists' misery. The movie is very efficient in creating a bad mood and that's cause for many overly critical reviews. All of the 1-star ratings are fairly ridiculous and a showcase that people are often entirely incapable of casting fair judgement.My review isn't shedding the best of light on The Babadook either. The actors are great and I can see all of the ways in which Jennifer Kent succeeded in realizing her vision, but when I wasn't annoyed by all of the (intentionally) exaggerated characters, I found myself bored and/or negatively affected by the depressive tone. I guess I was especially disappointed that the movie wasn't as scary as people claimed it would be. There was one moment that started out with much promise but then immediately moved on with fully showing the Babadook and thus annihilated all chances of evoking fear. It never picked up from there.
What hurt the movie the most, was that I never cared for the fates of the two protagonists. They do have character arcs, but those were too subtle for me, especially considering how the movie ends.Hardly any of my criticism counts objectively. It's mostly a subjective disliking.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Here it includes the fears many single mothers have that they can't raise their child alone and effectively keep him ""safe,"" combined with the survivor's guilt and intense grief at the loss of a loved one.

This is a truly terrifying thought, that we as humans are able to plague our own lives causing our own destruction. Thus this movie is far beyond the simple minded fear of death, it is about the fear of living and I think this is a way for the filmmaker to tackle a very real problem today and that is of depression.I found myself thinking about this movie for several days after watching it the first time until I finally sat down and watched it again, and despite some underexposed shots I still think that this film deserves an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'd actually been aware of it for several months before finally getting the chance to see it, occasionally visiting its IMDb page and seeing glowing reviews come in from everyone who I follow. Now having watched it twice, I think I understand what's going on, and without a doubt it is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. More than just having a creepy atmosphere and some jump scares, it explores deep emotional themes in a highly metaphorical and truly unsettling way.Without giving too much away, the basic story is about a single mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), and her child (Noah Wiseman), Samuel. Samuel is a rather difficult child, and Amelia is doing her best to raise him. One night, after waking up from a nightmare, Samuel picks a book for his mother to read to him: The Babadook. After this, strange things start to happen and they begin to sense a sinister presence with them in the house.Now, earlier I said that it explores emotional themes. One in particular is that of grief and the loss of a loved one. Again, doing my best not to get into spoiler territory, this is key to understanding what happens in the film. I thought Essie Davis did a remarkable job as a mother who is plagued by grief and her emotional range in this film was amazing. Noah Wiseman also does a great job, especially for a child actor, as her son. At first, he's very bratty and unlikeable, but he gradually changes over the course of the film and you begin to understand him more as a character and a person. The supporting characters aren't as developed, but they merely provide a basis for how to view the events that transpire and as a conduit for the audience.As far as horror films go, you could come away wondering what the big deal was, but then you'd have missed the point entirely. There are some typical horror movie scares and tropes, but all of that is window-dressing for the psychological horror that lies at the core. There is a creature, but it's only used and shown as much as needed. Also, in contrast to most horror movies these days, every effect was achieved practically or in-camera, quite the necessity for a low-budget film like this. I can't really think of anything bad to say. The only thing I'll caution is to go into this with an open mind, and to expect something a little more subtle than you might be used to. Other than that, I can't recommend this highly enough. Not just one of the best horror movies this year, but one of the best, period.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beat your kids!!!,"This movie is both boring and annoying. It revolves around a grieving mother who never disciplines her son so he grows into an obnoxious little twat. He screams, he always gets his way, and he brings weapons to school. Yes legit weapons. He is only six yet he is violent to the point he breaks his cousins nose in two places. And the mother sees nothing wrong with this??? This is disgusting. People say this movie has tons of symbolism but the only symbolism I see is that if you don't discipline your kids they grow up into serial killers or mass shooters. An hour and a half of cheap scares and effects mixed with a whining, psychopath six year old who you wish got put down faster than a one legged horse. The only real scare here is that there are parents like this who let their kids grow up into real murdering monsters.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gripping psychological thriller,"I saw this film in less than optimal circumstances, flying QANTAS with edits for the flight and a 6 inch screen... never the less it caught me massively by surprise. A couple of scenes sent shivers up my spine even in this environment, and I absolutely fell in love with the main actors and felt for them throughout. A strange Australian movie, I enjoyed it thoroughly and when I saw it was released on video felt I had to leave a comment. Cannot recommend it enough, although if all you are after is blood and gore don't bother... this will pull you in with the characters and their plight, the special effects are not a draw card though they are good enough to do the job.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wow, great movie!","This is a whopper of a horror film. The performances by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman as the mother and son were so authentic I was pulled way into the plot within the first 10-15 minutes. Watching Davis' gradual descent into madness (or was it?) was very reminiscent of Polanski's ""Repulsion,"" however I felt this film was much more effective. ""The Babadook"" goes into some taboo territories that I've never seen explored in a movie before, and at times it almost becomes unbearable to watch. There is an atmosphere of uneasiness throughout most of its running time. I really hope this gets a formal U.S. release, it's one of the most original as well as one of the creepiest films I've ever seen. Reading Jennifer Kent's filmography, it looks as though she hasn't done a lot of directing; hopefully after the success of this we'll see more of her work.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Only the 2 points for the nice picture quality,"What a disappointing movie is this. It's the first time since years that I feel sad for the wasted time that me and my girlfriend spend on this 'movie'. It have so many useless plot changes and makes no sense at all. I really don't understand why people give it such a high score...??? Please do yourself a favor and watch something else is our advice. I feel the director was inspired by the legendary The exorcist, but it not even get close. Without telling too much; it's a slow starter and gets the 'scary' moments around halfway in the movie, but it's never really scared. Our opinion is that you see a lot of things happening suddenly out of nowhere without a reason, which made the movie unstructured and to be frankly useless, especially at the end",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Horror Movie For Adults,"I love horror movies. By that I mean I liked the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Hostel, Cannibal Holocaust, George Romero's ""Martin"", the original ""Nosferatu"", and a few more. I despise films like ""Insidious"", ""Annabelle"", and anything that relies on CGI to make your scream - they're like watching Saturday Morning cartoons and about as scary, unless we're talking about ""H.R. Puff n Stuff"" which was really scary! :) ""The Babadook"" is a real film about a real horror and seems to appeal to more mature audiences who can appreciate what going on and what the Babadook is.Without mentioning what the ending is, a few have reviewed it poorly, or as not understanding it. The ending makes perfect sense as does every scene and plot advance in this movie.If you haven't seen it Kent's original short version - ""Monster"" is floating around online. I might suggest seeing it AFTER seeing ""The Babadook"" as the story and production isn't as polished, but nonetheless still present.Unlike Oculus, where the original short movie is more than enough, the release of ""The Babadook"" will, hopefully, set a new bar for horror movies to come.Gore, slasher, and CGI horror still has it's appeal - like the Jetson's had for me when I was 10 - but as I get older it's only the things that are truly ""real"" that ( oh, yes - the BabaDook IS real ) have a place in true horror....ps: I'm changing my ringtone to ""ba-ba dook... dook... doooowakkkk!""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Actress gone wild!,"I shouldn't review horror films anymore. I've seen so many over a lot of decades that it is indeed the rare film today that can actually scare me, something that I so regret. This didn't strike me as anything special or all that original, but what it does have going for it is a whale of a performance from the lead here. Her name is Essie Davis and I've only seen one other film she has ever been in and that was the excellent Burning Man. The other most prominent actor is a child, Noah Wiseman, who does okay in this story of a mother becoming more and more unwrapped after the death of her husband in a terrible car accident combined with a seriously difficult child convinced there is some sort of monster, evil spirit or something after him. Turns out he might be right and this does not help mom at all with her mental deterioration. A lot of people here seem to like this a lot. Maybe you should listen to them as I didn't see anything really special about this other than it is not stupid and Davis.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grief won't go away. Learn to live with it,"The Babadook is nothing short of absolute brilliance. It is hard to fathom how good the result is considering the seemingly low budget and mere 94 mins runtime.This is not your typical Hollywood horror movie-of-the-week - and thank God for that. The Babadook is carefully thought out and not only does it play on tension rather than actual scares; the character build-up is so strong that the actual ""monster"" (the Babadook) takes a back seat and becomes a mere supporting character to the mother-son relationship - something that is seldom achieved in the horror genre.Naturally this notion makes the movie play more like a drama with horror undertones for the unsettling atmosphere and tension - strongly emphasized by the cinematography and sound design as well as Essie Davis' outstanding performance.The way Davis portrays a woman fighting to meet her responsibilities and keep her head above water while slowly being dragged down by grief is both chilling and beautiful. I dare you to try and watch this and not feel sorry for her.To me; the Babadook is a clever tale of grief in several (if not all) of it's stages. We're shocked by it, we deny it, we succumb to it until finally we accept it and learn to live with it.If you're looking for jumpscares, blood or gore this is not the place for you, but I absolutely recommend The Babadook if you're into story-driven horror - Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent,This is an excellent story of a mother going through a mental breakdown with horror elements put in. Some very creepy moments in this film but the ending was a bit disappointing.

Gave Up After 20 Minutes,"I'd heard lots of good things about this film but, like his Aunt, I *really* couldn't cope with the kid in this. He was beyond irritating and I just couldn't take any more.
Not necessarily a ""horror"" film, but certainly horrible.(NB I've rated it a 5, as I don't think it's fair to give an extreme rating without seeing the whole thing... but I'm certainly not going to do that!)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Good and Very Scary Film,"I initially felt pretty discouraged from watching this movie. I remember attempting to start it a year or two ago and not getting past the first 5-10 minutes because I thought it moved too slow. I also heard it wasn't scary in the traditional horror movie sense (WRONG). Even though it was very well rated, I was too thirsty for exhilarating, chest-pumping horror to watch some slow moving indie movie that probably wouldn't even scare me.Boy was I wrong. This film is S C A R Y: in more ways than one. Just the idea of parenting that out of control kid is terrifying, and seeing how helpless the mom was made me feel a deeper, more profound terror than anything that can be aroused by a slasher villain. Yet, this is not even close to the only thing scary about this movie. There are creepy supernatural elements, disturbing imagery, and moments of spontaneous and enduring horror.I have a real soft spot for movies that play the ""No one believes me, they'll think I'm crazy, but I'm not!"" card, and The Babadook plays it HARD. This really puts a sour twist to the film, and it's hard not to feel really sorry for the mom. The main actress played the part really well, and one can definitely experience sincere feelings of desperation and dread through her.It's not a perfect film because the ending kinda turned me off. Still, it's at least a high 8 from me, and I gave it 9 stars here because it's definitely one of the best modern horror movies out there. I wish I watched it sooner, but it seemed to be sold as some slow-moving, ""deep"", pseudo-horror film instead of the genuine horror movie that it actually is. I'd say it's more similar to The Exorcist than a film like The Others, which is a horror movie I'd describe as slow moving and not very scary. Definitely watch if you love horror.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Should be a great movie,"My opinion about this movie!I do understand why some ppl said, this was 1 of the best horror film of all time. Because it's not a cliche horror film with alot of jumpscare. 2/3 part of this film was great,u can feel the horror element around you without a jumpscare.But, at 1/3 part of this film was really boring + the actor was terrible, the boy too overacting. It is like ""The Shining"", good movie but terrible actors.I don't really mind watching a cliche horror film as long as the movie have good actors and good execution rather than watching a movie with terrible actors",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great elevated horror,"The Babadook excels at being creepy. It's a prime example of a great metaphorror as it can deliver plenty of scary chills whilst being a moving exploration of motherhood, grief and the struggles of being a single parent. There's a lot of dark content here but it's all the better for having light at the end of the tunnel and going for a genuinely satisfying ending opposed to taking the easy way out.Essie Davis gives an excellent lead performance that neatly splits into two halves. For the first part she's stressed out and overworked in a very empathetic manner and then in the second half she gets to bring some horror herself as her deepest and darkest thoughts are let out by something beyond her control. Noah Wiseman is really impressive as a troubled yet naive child who has good intentions and a darker side.Jennifer Kent's direction is excellent, crafting smart scares that prey on primal fear to create nightmare fuel. The special effects used to create the titular Babadook are old fashioned in a way that enhances how unsettling it is, especially when they're combined with some suitably uncomfortable sounds. The majority of the proceedings take place in a bleak location that still manages to be really striking.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Jarring and poorly executed throughout.,"The parallels to be drawn between the Babadook and a person's ability to cope with grief are not lost on me. But any depth in this concept is sacrificed due to the painful execution.A noble idea in concept, just very very poorly put together. The acting is bad at times, not helped by the script, and the lack of any proper visual effects (practical or otherwise) means that the film is lacking in certain key moments/revels where it could have somewhat redeemed itself.The transitions, either between scenes, shots or lighting setups are jarring and feel amateurish. Lastly, someone buy the cast a hairbrush!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deserves a higher rating.,"It is depressing to see some people trashing this movie because it doesn't have jump scares. These are the same people who make Annabelle and Ouija blockbusters.The Babadook is nothing like these cash grabs. It has a terrific screen play, written by debutante director Jennifer Kent herself. She is in my opinion one of the best horror filmmakers. She understands the genre and does not resort to cheap tricks to sell her movie to today's attention-lacking-and-hungry-for-jump-scares audience.The lead performances by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman are also amazing. This is a movie which will inspire debates about it's themes and layers among cinephiles. I just hope this doesn't become that underrated horror movie that everyone talks about but no one seesBut I am pretty sure some people will hate this movie if they watch it expecting a monster flick. The marketing campaign for this movie was really misleading.THIS IS NOT A MONSTER FLICK. IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR FILM AND IT'S AMAZING.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This should have been limited to a Creepypasta.,"Mathew Buck from That Guy With The Glasses mentioned this movie and said it was good.I really wanted to like it. And it has a few moments. And as far as some horror movies go it does have some suspense, but it's really painfully stupid and the payoff is just not worth the watch. The story just tries so hard to keep you guessing. But there is no guessing game when the answer is in the TITLE.The acting and directing are pretty good. And I understand that this is a low budget movie... but writing a good story is free. It seems they took a creepypasta and turned it into a movie.I really really wish that I would have liked this movie better.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of time,"I had heard good things about this movie, so I was disappointed when it was painfully boring.

By the end of the movie I realized that Daylight Savings Time was ending that very night, and I'd be getting back an hour right then! So I only wasted 30 minutes that I was never getting back. Phew!Actually, it got worse at the end. It was boring and disappointing for the first 75 minutes, but stupid and pointless by the time it ended.Seriously, watch something else.

Excellent,"Do not watch this movie if:
1) you hate children
2) you don't understand trauma and mental illness
3) you prefer gory, jump-scare type of horror
4) you don't like psychological thrillers
This movie is a psychological thriller--a story which focuses on the psychological states of the characters. Some people who have reviewed this movie apparently aren't aware what a psychological thriller is. This movie isn't fast-paced or full of action, it builds atmosphere. It's one of the few movies that I actually find scary--because it plays on a parent-child dynamic we have all experienced.My only complaint is the ending, which is satisfying, but a bit confusing. Overall, this movie deserves a much higher score.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Formulaic & Cliché,"The Babadook isn't a bad film, but it isn't the great film that I expected to see. In fact it is very formulaic and cliché, with obvious foreshadowing that takes away any thrills, excitement and surprise from the future of the film.As I watched the film I was easily able to predict the next scene throughout the film, all the way to the end. Which couldn't come soon enough; the story drags through the first 45 minutes of the film at such a slow pace that you become annoyed just by sitting though it.The Last 45 minutes were barely a saving grace as the flow of the story picked up, but the entire film lacked a climatic scene that was interesting.The Babadook is visually nice and doesn't use a lot of the Hollywood bloated techniques which I can certainly give it high praise, and the story telling which was done fantastically receives high praise.But in this case, no matter how good it looked, how awesome the director was, the story itself just lacked enough interesting material for it to be a feature length film.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well Done,"I must admit I very seldom write reviews or watch this genre of film. I had heard about it a couple months ago on one of the youtube channels that I subscribe to. This was one of those top scary films. And I must admit, it was well done. I went in thinking I would turn it off but I sat through the whole thing. Both of the actors Mother and Son were amazing, especially the little boy. I don't want to give much away, but I may even go watch this again, which I rarely do. Awesome ending for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm Not At All Sure What Actually Happened - But I Liked It!,"The first thing that comes to mind looking back on this movie after watching it is that every time Bugsy appeared on the screen I winced. Bugsy was the family pet. A cute dog. And this is a horror movie. And you know what happens to cute dogs in horror movies. Anyway ...What a well crafted story this was. A young mother and her young son (Amelia and Samuel, played by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman) are dealing with his upcoming birthday, I say ""dealing with"" because it's not a happy day for them. Samuel's father died on the very day Samuel was born, in a car crash getting his mother to the hospital. What becomes clear in the movie is that the father's death continues to torment both of them. As the movie starts, Samuel is a troubled child - unreasonably afraid of monsters (under the bed, in the closet and everywhere else) and with massive behavioural problems that make him unwelcome at school, unwelcome even by his aunt, friendless. He throws tantrums at the drop of a hat. And Amelia can't control him. One night he asks Amelia to read him a bed time story, and he picks a book called ""The Babadook."" Amelia doesn't know where it came from. It's bloody violent and graphic. And it unleashes something.That much I understood, but from that point on I became confused about what exactly was happening. But even if confused, I was admiring this movie. It's one of the better horror movies I've seen in recent years. It leaves a great deal to the imagination. It ends on a somewhat ambiguous note, letting the viewer interpret this in pretty much whatever way the viewer chooses. Was the Babadook real? Was it a figment of Amelia's imagination? I really don't know. What I do know is that this is a creepy and scary movie. What I also know is that Davis and Wiseman handled their roles very well, indeed. I especially appreciated the way they seemed to ""flip"" about halfway through - with Samuel increasingly controlled and Amelia increasingly out of control. And in the midst of the horror"" - you feel sympathy for both Amelia and Samuel, because of the husband/father's death, and how that affects how they feel about themselves and how they feel about each other and how others look at them and treat them. Regardless of whether the Babadook is real or not, they both obviously have their monsters to deal with, buried deep within them and coming out every year I would think as the ""birthday"" approaches.I give credit to the writers and to director Jennifer Kent. Kent set a great tone and atmosphere throughout the movie, and the writers avoided making this any sort of graphic, slasher-type horror movie and instead focused on Amelia and Samuel and how they dealt with this terrifying situation. This is truly a fine addition to the horror genre. (9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Baba-snore,"Disappointment is the only way I can describe how I felt about this movie. I had read multiple positive reviews, and heard lots of buzz, and even watched the delightfully creepy short file ""Monster"" (which was called ""Baby Babadook"" by the director) (You should find the short and watch it! It was really good)But when you take the short film and stretch it into 90 minutes, Its like drinking watered down cola.There were a couple of creepy moments, but they passed far too quickly. And there were so many things that could have made it a better show. Why not give the mom an alcohol or drug addiction? Give the guy from work who was flirting with her a bigger role. Maybe just kill an innocent by-stander.Don't get it on pay-per-view, like I did. I wasted $4.99 on this thing.Wait for it to come out on one of the subscription channels.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intelligent and critically acclaimed psychological terror,"Truly good horror movies do more than just dole out the jump scares and other cliches. Expertly written horror teases the idea that what is happening on screen actually has a plausible explanation - once we understand what is causing the characters to experience hallucinations and mental illness. The Babadook successfully manages this feat.Amelia is a single parent grieving the loss of her husband while simultaneously raising her only son, who is showing signs of autism. While her son has an overactive imagination - seeing monsters and the like - the tension and isolation he causes to his mother's life leads her to a mental breakdown. Enter the Babadook, asking to be let in.What makes the Babadook particularly special is that despite it's horror, it shows genuine compassion to people suffering from the real, invisible, and ever present monsters. Whether that be nurses looking after the elderly with dementia, a mother managing a son with autism, or the feelings of powerlessness experienced by community doctors and support workers. The strain of looking after others with mental problems often causes the carers to fall down into the same hole.The Babadook is all the more grounded and terrifying because once the patient, intelligent, and observant viewer completes the necessary detective work from the clues in the film - the Babadook is unmasked for what it is.
What makes it truly terrifying, is that we could start seeing the Babadook all around us in our own society,",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Are you serious people??,"I am a HUGE movie buff and usually check out the IMDb user reviews before investing time in a movie.

Great film,"I really enjoyed watching the babadook. It's so dark and creepy. It's so dark and gloomy. You don't really see films that are dark and gloomy that often. It's definitely one of the best horrors that I've watched. It was also a nice change from slashers. I think that supernatural horrors are fantastic, especially when there is mystery to it. I loved the bit when she went to the police station and it showed the coat, hat and gloves. The hands are definitely the most creepy part of the babadooks appearance. I have rated this 8/10. The only two things I didn't like about it was that it started off a little slow and also it didn't really show the actual babadook that much. But at the same time, it makes the babadook more myterious. If you like horror films, I would definatly recommend this.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The babadook,"A film that could be interpreted in many ways.This is something much more than a horror movie, this is a masterpiece filled with layers of deep symbolism and metaphors. It's a film that embraces the human psyche, it plays with it, entangles itself with it, reveals it in all of its glory, yet also its vulnerability. Mister Babadook himself isn't meant to be a depiction of horror, he's meant to symbolise grief, loss, deep depression and aggression. Mister babadook is a pain to get rid of, especially when your attached to your past, attached to loss and overwhelmed with grief. Mister Babadook makes you do immoral things that you deep down want to do. Mister babadook is the worst version of yourself, a version in which you lose control, lose humane characteristics, once you engulf mister babadook all your built up anger, sadness, anxiety, and negativity is let out into the world. Mister babadook is your own creation, he feeds on your negative thoughts as that's the only way he gets the energy to consume your soul, and control your actions. While your busy in the world of your mind, reality seems irrelevant, so you inevitably block it out. You transition into forgetfulness once disconnected from reality, you might no remember things you did. You might remember ripping mister babadook apart only to see it on your front porch the next day, this symbolises trying to detach from the past but then relapsing back into it. Mister Babadook symbolises how essential moving away from the past is, to reminisce the past can fill you with warm memories but staying there too long can drag you down in life. Babadook is about acceptance of the present and the past and the balance needed between the two to live a harmonious life. Overall a superb film, in terms of acting, storytelling, pacing and originality.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Horror... Thriller... Psychological drama... Perfection.,"Read as little about this film as possible. Don't watch trailers. Don't discuss it with anyone. Stop reading reviews. Just go and watch it. It may take a little time to suck you in but the film you watch will be unique to yourself, especially the conclusion.No one escapes the Babadook.If you are still reading, I assume you've already seen the movie and are just curious about others' thoughts. I will say that I have no idea what a non-parent might think of this film but as a mother of a 4 year old, this one strikes me so deeply, every time I watch it. I am a victim of childhood abuse and was terrified of the prospect of continuing that cycle with any child I might have- it's just one reason I avoided having children for a long time. I've also seen mental disease up close and watched it devour people I loved... this film is definitely not a stereotypical boogeyman for me but instead hit all my personal terrors.One does not *enjoy* a film like this but it definitely fulfills the primal urge that horror addicts seek- the addressing of real fears and terrors in a controlled manner by observing them in a fictional setting.

As Kent highlights the gloomy, dark colors throughout the movie, Amelia goes through her life living in the past and not realizing what a promising future her and her son could have. Both Amelia and her son are stuck with a children's book, ""The Babadook,"" which ends up haunting their lives. The monster portrays the never-ending grief Amelia has in her life. It is not easy to get rid of the monster just like it is difficult to come to terms with her past. Her son has an unbreakable bond with his mother when he swears to protect her no matter what. He believes the Babadook wants to kill him and his mother and after he is medicated, his thoughts become out of control. When Amelia realizes her son's hallucinations might be real, she realizes that her son has been warning her.The allegory in The Babadook, I believe, is the grief someone can have once tragedy hits that person's life. That bottled up grief and no reason to move forward eats a person from the inside out. The monster in this movie portrays this by always coming back. In the end, grief will always be there, but there is ways to cope with it to not ruin the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
leave it on the shelf,"Babadook is never a 1-star movie so ignore anyone suggesting it is, but it certainly isn't anything like as accomplished or disturbing as I thought it would be from the amount of hype it's generated. Stylishly directed in places yes, but it has an overall feel of taking place inside some kind of atmosphere-less vacuum that never quite engages. Add to that a very uninspired script, overly melodramatic acting (especially from the mother), a kid who does well for a child actor but never really convinces, and a main plot device which is so clumsily handled it seems unintentionally funny in places, and you have a movie that comes across more like a stillborn show-piece than any kind of gripping, scary cinema. The trailer suggested a potential classic, but the result while not exactly a full blown disaster is nowhere near.If you want a vastly more creepy movie carried by a young child in the lead role check out Bob Balaban's brilliantly eerie, surreal portrait of suburbia gone wrong 'Parents'.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Babadook understands what makes horror movies so appealing to watch.,"I like horror movies. I also like smart movies. Unfortunately, I find that 'horror' and 'smart' don't often go hand-in-hand when it comes to movies. Well, Babadook managed to close the gap and delivered a truly chilling, thought-provoking experience.If you, like me, are a horror fan, at one point you've probably found yourself desensitized to all the jumpscares, gore and ugly faces, immune to the over-the-top but ultimately futile attempts to create a credibly creepy atmosphere and yawning at the predictable twists of ""bland-horror-movie number 94841432"". Babadook ain't it. Babadook is different. It understands that throwing monsters at the screen or killing characters that we all know are expendable isn't what makes a horror movie scary. It is whatever is lurking deep within the human psyche. Not only the primal instinct of survival, but also the things we value the most. Abstract things like love, compassion, trust, happiness, acceptance. What makes this movie terryfing is the ever-looming threat to those things that we hold sacred. The Babadook is merely a conduit in the grand scheme of things.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Horror down to earth,"Babadook's beautiful combination of suspense and grief descends each of its audience members into a dark hole where a glimmer of hope is the only way out. The film is presented in such a way where character development and a story driven plot is displayed subtlety but also is very impactful on the viewer. The audience is truly able to sympathize with the main character's grief because there is no control of her surroundings. The sound produced throughout the film are harsh noises to make you cringe, from the grinding of teeth to the constant squeaking of breaks while the list goes on. These examples are few of many constant situations, noises, and images making the audience never able to become comfortable or safe. Babadook is its own work of art where this isn't a play-on from horror films in the past or using familiar horror movie tropes one may consistently see. Rather this psychological horror uses the suppression of this poor woman's grief to create this evil character the Babadook. Ultimately digging down to the fears of an everyday (slightly older) audience to create empathy and disruption of the everyday world. Jennifer Kent does a beautiful job of displaying a truly horrific roller coaster ride which doesn't need anything flashy to instill fear rather a dark realistic idea put into motion with the Babadook's character being an intricate part with all the right pieces falling into place.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Excellent,"I thought this film was a supernatural horror about a monster that only children could see. This film is very different. No spoilers but your expectation may change if you keep reading. This is a film about a single parent family struggling to get over the death of the father. This manifests in different ways for the son and mother. The psychology of this becomes quite harrowing and deeply sad. I like the non-stereotypical cinematography and great sound design. Acting is excellent throughout, as is the direction. The story is very engaging and the pacing solid. I didn't like the production design all the time as sometimes the house didn't look like anyone lived there, I found that aspect a little unbelievable.

"Shallow, disappointing junk","Although interesting to look at, The Babadook is an appalling mess of a horror film, with irritating characters, a lack of genuine suspense, and a style that's more likely to evoke mild bemusement than sincere dread and terror.The premise is a familiar one. Young Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is seemingly haunted by a spirit that no one else can see, and of course no one else believes said spirit exists, least of all his mother Amelia (Essie Davis), who's struggling with the sudden, violent death of her husband and sees Samuel's ""ghost"" as Samuel's way of dealing with his own grief.Things kick into a higher gear when Samuel finds a book called The Babadook on his bookshelf. No kids' book this, The Babadook is about an out-to-get-you entity, complete with terrifying artwork and menacing words. It's so scary that Amelia can't stomach reading it all to Samuel. This ain't no ordinary book. The Babadook will come a-calling, first to the child in disguise and then to the kid's mother; then it'll just do it's haunting thing. The better to drive you insane, my dear.Samuel begins to act out. I got the impression that he'd been having behavioral issues (likely stemming from his dad's death), but once the book arrives, those issues increase infinitely in intensity. He misbehaves in school, at the park, and at his cousin's party; at the latter, he pushes his obnoxious, teasing cousin out of a treehouse, which enrages his aunt. So much for family and understanding, right? Eventually, Amelia is able to secure some medication for Samuel to keep him calm, but soon the spectre of the Babadook is in her head, too.A few points. First, even in recent memory there have been plenty of nobody-believes-I'm-being-haunted plots. Even with the children's book as a hook, this story is well worn indeed. But what really counts against it is that the kid is so over-the-top horrible from the beginning of the movie that it's nigh impossible to feel any real sympathy for him - until and unless the plot says it must be so. Samuel is, to put it bluntly, a real jerk. He's mean to everyone and disobeys his mom constantly.Sure, we can explain this away by pointing to the dad's death (he died in an accident on the way to the hospital when Samuel was born) - but since he never knew his dad, it feels like the logic is twisting to suit a screenwriter's desperate needs. Samuel is so obnoxious that he spends about the first twenty minutes screaming ""MOM"" at the top of his lungs. I'm sure you parents out there can relate to how wonderfully appealing this sound is. It's so nice to be wanted.When Amelia herself inevitably becomes haunted by the Babadook as well, things get progressively worse. She's angry! She's normal! She's loving! She's cruel! She's seeing things! She's experiencing reality! It's a whirlwind of lazy, lazy writing. And, true to the trope, no one believes Amelia's claims that Something is happening - not the school, which clearly doesn't care about Samuel's well being; not her sister, who doesn't stop to consider that Amelia may truly need her help; not the Child Services people, who drop in unannounced and have no idea why this person is cleaning the kitchen because of a hole in the wall that doesn't exist. No one cares. Maybe that's because everyone involved saw the first part of the film, in which neither mother nor son comes off as particularly sympathetic.I got the impression that this movie merely needed a better director (than Jennifer Kent), writer (Kent), and actors (Davis and especially Wiseman). That's not asking too much, right? In the right hands, The Babadook would have been a stylish, Gothic psychological drama, but instead it's a run-of-the-mill plot sunk by aimless direction and a real lack of panache. There are just too many ludicrous scenes in this film to stomach. William Friedkin, of all people, claims that he's never seen a more terrifying film than this one; we can thus infer that Mr. Friedkin has never seen his own horror classic, The Exorcist.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Babadook,"The Babadook is an Australian film directed by Jennifer Kent being her first feature length film. The film is about a widowed mother named Amelia Vannick (Essie Davis), her son Samuel Vannick (Noah Wiseman), and Samuel's obsession with being afraid of the monster within their home. Amelia at first takes this fear of monsters to be something that is normal for an adolescent boy, but soon finds out there is something lurking within the home when a book named Mr. Babadook finds its way into the home. The film gives us a look as to why Amelia is a widow, and how she is coping with it after all these years. On the anniversary of her husband's death the Babadook tends to grow in strength. The Babadook could be seen as an allegory to Amelia's crippling depression and sadness that she has dealt with for quite some time. The building of her emotions finally come out as a monster known as the Babadook. If you as a viewer are looking for jump scares within this film, you will not find any here. Rather, you will find a psychologically intense film that shows what true depression and sadness can do to a human being and what it can drive us to do. Jennifer Kent looks away from conventional horror films and the blood and gore that we may all be used to, instead she uses the human psyche as a plot point in this critically acclaimed film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Weak story derails spooky effort,"I don't know how people grade a movie like this with 8 or 9 stars...or even 7. It's a fairly interesting and well acted film, but the screenplay is an utter mess. Never once do we understand what the Babadook is, what it wants and the storyline essentially morphs into each setup with little originality. Using elements of everything from Exorcist to Signs, The Babadook just never finds a story it can tell with any hint of coherence. Instead, it floats along on scene after scene of admittedly unsettling moments, but never seems to know for a moments what it's all about. Ultimately The Babadook cannot come close to delivering on what is promised in the book read by the mother and this unrealized groundwork makes for a grade C effort. Whether it's Ghost, Ghostbusters or the Evil dead, a good story needs to have a direction that is both clear and dynamic. The Babadook has neither.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredible piece of film making,"Initially I was fairly surprised to see this film only sitting at only a 7/10 on IMDb, but then, having thought about it and the demographic that probably reviews films and maybe their expectations about what this film was on the way into the cinema - its probably not that surprising.Its difficult to write a review about this film without giving a huge spoiler, and I really don't want to do that because to do so robs the film of some of its power... but let me just say that this film isn't really a horror film at all in many ways. If you go in expecting a horror and some mindless entertainment - then this isn't what you are going to get or at least this isn't the core of the film - this is just its clothing. I've watched a lot of horror films and this trumps every single one of them by a country mile but not as a horror film - in that sense its fairly ordinary and at no point did it scare me at any rate.I re-watched this shortly after my first viewing, and knowing the premise of the film at the start - made the second watch a different experience - I was fully able to understand what the film was really trying to say.Its an incredible piece of work from start to finish, on many many levels.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A metaphor for ones inner demons,"DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH MY INTERPRETATION COULD BE SAID TO CONTAIN SPOILERS.Without giving too much away the main theme of this movie is not an imaginary monster come to life. The true theme of this film is traumatic loss, how we cope or fail to cope with it and how, if possible, we somehow reconcile our inner demons.Its clear from the outset that the main character has, in fact, tragically and irrecoverably failed to deal with her personal demons. If you pay close attention I do not think this can in any way be denied.The final scene really spells out what has happened. Like the young boys magic tricks its hardly real. Its the conjuring of a fevered mind wanting to wash away the awful reality of what it has done and replace it with a beautiful, if illogical, fantasy.There is a secondary theme here too about the manner in which family, employers and authorities treat those who are under extreme pressure as a result of loss. Its damning assessment too, one that speaks stridently and honestly of indifference and selfishness.There are no happy endings in the Babadook. Its a hard, sad watch but also very compelling and emotional. There is a positive message too for those willing to listen. Don't ignore others suffering, don't turn your back, expect better from yourself personally, from those around you and your government. A timely message in an age where people seem to care less and less about one another.What more can I say.

reminded me that i really REALLY do not like kids in movies,"*sigh* What can i say... I am not a fan of the movie.What ruins movies the most for me is when the protagonists actually annoy me. That is not the same as the protagonists being bad/evil or twisted or anything. I mean ... actually annoying.The mother is an incompetent and emotional wreck, the son is annoying - bordering on mental illness (he does come across as mentally challenged but the issue is not addressed as it would be in ""real life""). Now i do not quite accuse the actors for it - but the story itself.However - i do accuse the kid for bad acting - and shouting nearly every line he has with three exclamation marks. - Which becomes really really tiring. Meanwhile the mother gives a perfect example of ""how not to do parenting"".. . She is a textbook case of incompetence.In a horror movie where one is meant to kind of hope for the protagonists to overcome and survive - well... the horror. - It is a really bad thing when the viewer hopes they die a horrible, painful and slow death.Well - i am being too hard on them, i admit. I do generally dislike kids in movies - and they do have to work extra hard for me not to dislike them. This child is not a good actor - and/or did not get good enough directions. The mother and the supporting cast are alright - but quite one dimensional.The main factor about this movie though ... : Is it scary?Well - i think it might have been... but for me the annoyance with the protagonists well overweighed any sense of dread or suspense.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Truly terrifying for all the right reasons.,"This film is in every way a true ""horror"". It scares you in places you never knew you had. Whats most horrific is the sinister tone throughout the entire film, not just the monster itself. The appearance of the monster is revealed right away, which is strange for most horror movies. But here it is done well, meaning that when the beast is finally revealed, you might just soil yourself. You are scared by the sick images and the possessive thoughts of the stressed and somewhat insane widowed mother, instead of the usual pop-up jump-scare. Also, you cannot help but notice the outstanding acting (especially of child actor Noah Wiseman who plays the role of a young kid with behavioral problems). Not to mention the incredible and unique sound design.

"a terrifying movie about being a parent, or a child, or both","William Friedkin, in his glowing adulation of the film, said that ""there's Psycho, Dialbolique, and now The Babadook"" (may not be an exact quote, but close enough). I would've thrown in as most directly The Shining. While the house isn't a big part of what makes the creature the Babadook come out - not that the gray walls and drab appearance don't help to add to the atmosphere - the way that the parent-child relationship breaks down into murderous madness does. Perhaps it's like if one takes seriously the whole ""Book-As-Demon-Maker"" from the Evil Dead movies as well: you open it up, read it, and things start to materialize in the most horrifying ways possible. But this isn't some people in a cabin in the woods - this is a widowed, single mother and her child, with the kid already a little eccentric (he's cute at being a magician, not so much wielding a small cross-bow, which me makes himself), and this book just amplifies everything wrong in their lives. Will their bond and promise to protect each other hold?The book arrives seemingly by some stranger, right on the doorstep for Amelia (Elise Davis) and her son Sam (Noah Wiseman). She reads to her son, as all good mothers do, but when she reads this book it terrifies him before she can finish it, with graphic images of mayhem and violence and the macabre. She tears it up, but it comes back to her all taped together and with *new* pages, detailing in practically prophetic terms what she will do to her dog, her son and herself. She burns it, and seems like the smart thing (except what to show the skeptical police force?) so she tries to cope and get on with her days. But things get frayed with her sister and her friends, and Amelia starts to... see things. Or have very vivid nightmares. It first starts with her son - the usual trope we see of the kid seeing things are the parent not believing him - and then it goes to her. Oh man, does it ever!The Babadook's triumph is in creating images and scenes and set-pieces where Amelia's frame of mind goes downhill, maybe not too fast but certainly fast enough with a six year old boy in the house. The boy is a fascinating character in how perception of him changes as the movie goes on; at first, he's almost kind of annoying, though not any more than your average 6-year old full of energy and vigor and whatnot, but he's also one of those distant and alone kids (no father, seemingly no friends, a disconnect with his cousin, and, as it's pointed out in almost darkly comic terms, a very quick response to adults with no filter). What's great is to see how he not so much changes but fulfills certain alluded-to set ups early in the movie that one thinks is just little things for the character to do. It's all the more disturbing because of his age; any older, and it would almost take on the qualities of a coming-of-age film for what he has to put up with with his mother.And Amelia... this character is really the main one, though it's arguable the mother and son are on equal footing as leads. The director Jennifer Kent really gets the audience into her frame of mind: vulnerable, broken in some way, healed up over time but the wounds could be ripped open, and it stems back to the loss of her husband (Sam's father of course), and in the way it leaves her by herself all the more when her son is off at her sister's or at school. There's a scene were we just watch her going about her day, walking around some stores, sitting in a car and happening to see another couple making out. Even a moment where she is sexually 'alone' emphasizes her state of mind, to a degree. All through this early part Davis makes Amelia real and strong and forceful along with those other qualities in the writing. So that by the time this book really rears its ugly head, she's in a position to try and fight it, but how can anyone fight the BABA-DOOK-DOOK-DOOK?The imagery Kent creates is staggering. She starts with TV - why are there old silent movies on the TV, would they be on, hey, why carp - and then unfolds it into seeing things in a neighbor's house, then on the walls, the ceilings, in her nightmares with her dead husband. Though it would seem the Babadook is a real demon/entity in this world, it's a constant question, especially in the second and third acts, if this woman is really losing her mind and what she sees is just magnified, wretched manifestations of everything turned upside down and blackened. For myself, after seeing horror films for so many years it takes a lot to get me scared. This one has the goods: it gets you invested in the characters, their relationship, and then gets to work making the mind throw up on itself with a bogeyman that is most terrifying for what it can unleash in the psychological sense.The Babadook may not quite be the new Psycho as Friedkin puts it - the ending is a little too ambiguous, perhaps, though not in any way bad, one just has to sit on it for a long time - but is it really good and worth watching and stop what you're doing and look it up on Netflix? Yes.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

This Movie Is A Zillion Times Better Than The Ones James Wan Is Making Nowadays.,"A very scary Australian horror film about a mysterious figure named Mister Babadook. The film is the directorial debut of Australian writer and actress Jennifer Kent. I always appreciate the fact that the director is a woman, since there are so few female directors in the movie industry.There are some very good films by other female directors, namely Pet Cemetery(Mary Lambert) and Ravenous(Antonia Bird), American Psycho(Mary Harron), The Piano(Jane Campion), Boys Don't Cry(Kimberly Peirce), Big(My favorite Penny Marshall film starring Tom Hanks), Blue Steel (Kathryn Bigelow), Look Who's Talking(Amy Heckerling), Children of a Lesser God (Rhanda Haines). I am feel extremely privileged to have seen some of these films in my teenage years.Back to the film: it is about a young mother who has been recently widowed. She has a hyperactive son who does not sleep at all during the night and so she has not slept well for a long time. One night, Sam asks his mother to read from a mysterious pop-up storybook he found on his shelf. The story, titled ""Mister Babadook"", is about a supernatural creature that, once someone is made aware of its existence, torments that person indefinitely. Amelia is disturbed by the book's contents, while a traumatized Sam becomes convinced that the Babadook is stalking them in their home.Soon Amelia also starts to feel the presence of something malevolent lurking in the house, trying to make itself known.The film shows Amelia(Essie Davis) as a woman who is starved from sexual relations due to the death of her husband in an accident. There is a scene in the film which shows her relieving herself with a vibrating dildo under blanket. Added to this is the frustrating job of earning a living and taking care of her son all by herself.The main thing that makes this film work is pop-up book about Mister Babadook which is one of the most gruesome I have ever seen. The terrifying rhymes in the book, pertaining what Mister Babadook will do, adds to the horror. The sound effects and special effects are spot on and extremely satisfying.There is just one problem to this film, and it can be excused since it is Jennifer Kent's first film - the ending to the film is very poorly executed. Make no mistake - this film is going to be a cult film in the days to come and maybe sequels to this film be made.I have watched a similar film like this one: Boogeyman a 2005 horror film which has 2 sequels.Jennifer Kent, I wish you all the best for your future projects. And may you continue making horror films for fans like me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is not a horror movie,"Will people please quit calling this a great horror movie much less calling it a horror movie. There is nothing scary about this movie. I don't mind not seeing the monster but what I do mind is a slow, boring, and pointless horror movie. This movie is such a load of crap. I keep seeing people say how great this movie is and how great the story telling is and all this other stuff. I've even seen people say only an idiot can't see the real plot of the movie or understand this movie. Sorry but there is nothing good about it. Yes it has good camera work but that doesn't make a good horror movie. The acting is crap, the plot is impossible to get or follow, the writing is confusing at best, and the directing is weak at best.This is my opinion of this overrated piece of crap. Now if people will quit putting on the top 10 list of great horror movies because it is not in the league of Exorcist or Texas Chainsaw or Halloween.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Conjuring meets the Shining,"In the Babadook, Essie Davis plays Amelia, a woman who is widowed in a horrible car accident the night she was to have her first child. She was in the car with her husband in route to the hospital. Cut to seven years later and she is living alone with her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) in a large, old, and unsettlingly scary house. Samuel, to put it mildly is a less than well behaved child. So much so that she is decides to pull him from school to find an alternative one that will be able to accommodate his wild temperament. One night when Amelia asks Samuel to pick out a bedtime story. He brings back a book she does not recognize entitled ""Mister Babadook"". The book is a terrifying pop-up book that tells of a monster, the Babadook that terrorized people. After reading both Samuel and Amelia begin to notice that they are not alone in the house. This is the first full length film for director Jennifer Kent. And may I say, what an amazing freshman effort. This film reminded me a lot of the feel of the Conjuring (2013) and the Shining (1980). I cannot remember a film in recent years that kept me on edge for as long as the Babadook. It is a hair raising, terror thrill ride from 5 minutes in to 5 minutes before it ends. Essie Davis's performance is spectacular. Essie's is a transformative performance that feels a lot like Jack Nicholson in the Shining. Your bear witness to her decent into dark madness. This film not only gives you the jolting scares you come to expect from a horror film, it gives you an amazingly haunting performances that linger. Noah Wiseman as Samuel is phenomenal. He transforms from a bratty unruly child you want to hate, into innocent and sympathetic. He feels like a cross between Danny from the Shining and Robbie from Poltergeist (1982). The overall subtext to this film is indictment of the modern family society. Specifically the struggle of the single mother and male centric society that has her raising one. It offers an answer I'd rather not go into for fear of spoiling the ending. The ending is probably the weakest part of this otherwise very strong film. This is the best horror film of 2014. It is a must for horror fans, especially if you like a little depth and psychology over gore. ""Ba, Ba, Dook, Dook, Dook"" will be etched into the darkest part of your nightmares for nights to come.If you enjoyed this review, pleas check out my blog at yourturntopick.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Innovative and smart which would entail you to watch it again but you would hesitate as it's dauntingly creepy,"The Babadook is 2014's best horror film without any doubt. In recent years we got really good films like The Conjuring and Oculus in the worn-out genre of horror. The Babadook sits on top of both. But take a note that this not your typical horror movie filled with jump-scares alongside sudden loud noises to scare you. You need to watch the movie closely and try to understand what is the idea underlying the creepy monster called 'The Babadook'.The film opens with a dream sequence of a woman Amelia (Essie Davis). We learn that the dream was of the car accident in which her husband died 7 years ago. She was in labor and her husband was taking her to the hospital when the whole incident happened. Ever since, Amelia has raised her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone. Amelia who is still plagued with the depression and hassles of daily life rarely sleeps. Adding to it, Samuel stars displaying erratic behavior of being scared of an imaginary monster making Amelia comfort him every night by reading storybooks. Things get worse when one night they go through a strange book named 'The Babadook' which describes a weirdly-scary monster with same name. It scares the hell out of Samuel and seems to have a bad effect on Amelia too. Samuel starts talking to others about The Babadook making people think weird of him. Amelia and son start getting more isolated from the society and feel scary things at night. We may have seen the mom and child against the ghost many times but the story here is intelligent and very well scripted. The ending was a bewildering, making you rethink whether you caught hold of the things perfectly.The story builds up slowly whether you like it or not, but it is the essence of a good suspenseful horror. It nicely imprints characters of Amelia and Samuel in our minds and their mother-son relationship. Since her husband died on the same day Samuel was born, deep within her she feels her son was responsible for all the troubles they are going through even if on the top she lovingly takes care of him. At the same time the son loves her a lot more and has the usually ""dont worry mom, I am there to protect you"" feeling. But he also soon starts to understand what lies buried deep within his mom's feelings. Even if The Babadook is portrayed as a horror element, it has a metaphorical view point of grief and despair in our life which soon starts to take our bright hopeful side. Actually, I feel the movie was made to metaphorically relate to our daily lives. Still, it doesn't degenerate the horror aspect of the film. The gradual yet perilous consumption of the lives of Amelia and Samuel by the relentless scares of The Babadook will remain with you even after a long time of viewing. The atmosphere generated and setting of the house, with fine cinematography is sad and chilling which was very much necessary. Plus, the soundtrack had the same required tone and blended in smoothly with the scary scenes with crisp editing. Acting wise both Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman do a splendid job, it is rare to see such good acting in horror films.The Babadook will stay in your minds many hours after you finish watching the film, may it be in form of the monster from the creepy book or a monster hiding under plain sight in our daily lives. I really liked the way it is quoted ""You can't get rid of The Babadook"" signifying that bad things will always be there in our lives but it is in our hands to conceal it. Many aspects in the film can have more than a single interpretation, leading to good amount of discussion about it with others who liked it. There is a lot of ambiguity in many places where I feel a bit more plausible expansion would have been better. In the end, I was really impressed by the film and also believe there are still many small things that I didn't catch which would have added more to the story on first viewing. I will watch it again soon, but right now am too creeped by the weird tone of the film. If you liked mind-bending movies like Enemy, Oculus of 2013 or have taste in psychological horrors like Black Swan or even if you are a horror fan wanting to see something interesting I recommend not to miss this one.RATING: [4/5]",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A solid watch.,"I argued with my friend recently about the quality of this film the other day. We both agreed that it was marketed poorly as a horror film and we both disagreed on the ""creep factor"". He told me he couldn't get into it, that it was drawn out and boring. I asked him to go back and watch it again in the middle of the night, alone and with no distractions. He came back and told me it was intense.Turns out the problem for him was the yammering groups of teenagers chuckling and being general annoyances, sitting on their smartphones and asking their friends every three minutes ""what happened?"" when he watched it at the cinemas. I'm gonna go ahead and assume many of these one-star reviews are from ""torture porn"" aficionados hoping for lots of blood, gore and awful death scenes, or from kids who were on their Facebook pages for much of the film, because if you involve yourself in the movie, it's actually really damned good. If you catch the allegory, which I doubt the slasher/TP viewers could even fathom, then you would see the ending is quite well constructed.All in all, for a modestly budgeted film, the presentation is great. It's bleak and depressing and cruel and not particularly enjoyable in any sense of the word, but then that's what it sets out to be; A true ""horror movie"" in every sense of the term. It's hard-hitting and close to home, the acting is fantastic, the production values are great, the sound editing is skin-crawling in a good way. I've got nothing but praise for this effort. Ignore the one-stars. Just watch it and judge for yourself, but make sure you watch it alone in an empty house in the middle of the night and not surrounded by teenagers on smartphones that are just going to ruin the atmosphere.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Babadook makes a convincing argument for classy, psychological horror cinema even as it fails to meet its own lofty standard.","The Babadook is a horror fable that's light on terror and heavy on whiny children, making for an uneven watch that squanders potential around far too many corners.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

If one expects buckets of blood or a high body count from your horror, again this is not your film. But for those who enjoy a little substance with their scare, you could do far worse than The Babadook. The fear in this film is pervading and intimately tied to the human experience in all its unpredictable subjectivity, and despite the backdrop of children's fantasy, much more real than the scares usually meted our in the horror genre. Unfortunately, the reveal is held out a little too long, and the audience gets to the punch before the film throws it, so long as you're not waiting for a literal axe to fall.

Movie Review: The Babadook (2014),"In this day and age of torture porn and senseless sex, blood and violence, many of the newer generation are so numbed out and not used to the intensity of true psychological horror. The thing that makes psychological horror films so great is the slow burn. Slow burns consist of a few things, atmosphere, a great story, and always a epic twist at the end. Those three things alone will trump over any blood and guts film.The mind itself is far more terrifying than in your face visceral carnage.Last year it was OCULUS (which can be read here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388715/reviews-285).This year...The Babadook is THAT film.The Babadook is the directorial debut of actress turned director, Jen Kent. The film itself is based on a short film entitled: ""Monster"" which won rave reviews in the short film festival circuit. This film has lots of mixed reviews which I believe stems from the lack of knowledge of older films and imagination to boot. The Babadook is a anagram of a bad book, and interesting enough a Serbian word babaroga which means boogeyman.The film starts out with Amelia (played by Aussie actress Essie Davis) involved in a car crash which took the life of her husband. The film then cuts to 7 years later where we are introduced to her son 7 year old Samuel (played with perfection by Noah Wiseman). Samuel has a bit of behavioral problems. These problems are both in school as well as in his social and family life. His mother's health and mental stability hasn't been the same since the accident, which causes a huge gap between him and his mum.The 30 minute mark is when we finally are introduced to MISTER BABADOOK. The 45 minute is when things start to get uncomfortable. The hour mark is when it gets intense, scary, and really exercises your intellect.The ending itself, is quite open to interpretation.The actual entity known as Mister Babadook, takes play from the silent black & white films. The film was originally intended to be filmed in B&W, but the crew found perfect colour palettes which accommodated their needs for the setting and mood of the film.The first half of the film allows you to relate and feel for both Amelia and Samuel. In a way, the film is about love. It doesn't shy away from that vibe, even when things start to take a turn for the worst. The film itself has a lot of in your face situations that mothers and people who have suffered a devastating loss can relate to.The film has a slow burn style. It also has Polanski as well as German expressionism overtones throughout. The film seems to be set in a reality styled setting but with just enough darkness and mood to make it surreal almost.The young actor who plays Samuel really makes the show. This 6 year old is utterly amazing!! The pop up book itself is another actor in the film that truly makes your skin crawl. The book really sets the mood for what's to come. Aussie actress Essie Davis' performance rivals Shelley Duvall's in The Shining.This is a film that demands multiple viewings....do yourself a favor and let MISTER BABADOOK DOOK DOOK in your lives.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Don't believe all the hyped up good reviews, this one missed the mark by a mile!","I can't believe all the positive reviews this movie received! It is not good. Following the same old gimmick of child and parent trying to survive a haunted house, I found myself bored immediately. The only thing still worth waiting for, was the revealing of the Babadook! Too bad he's just a shadow that growls. This movie was terrible. Don't believe the hype. For a while I still held out hope that perhaps there was no monster at all, and maybe the screen writers had a card up their sleeve. A twist perhaps? Maybe the mother is crazy and is imagining the whole thing? Maybe SHE wrote the book about the Babadook? But no... unfortunately I was far too optimistic about this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Babadook's at Home,"""The Babadook"" grows on you. I saw it one night, and thought it was just OK. But next morning, reconsidering the tedium I experienced in a few spots which I thought were mere horror film clichés, I realized they really were psycho-plot points, and my appreciation for the movie changed considerably. When we remember those moments as well as a couple of scenes that seem incongruous or unresolved (as when the mother finds a photograph in which the face of her husband has been scratched and, after facing and shouting to her little son, their relation goes from tender to wild and back) , you know that the movie is not only telling you a horror tale (because the Babadook is certainly an entity freely moving in the shadows of the house where the protagonists live, and in their neighbor's home) but also paints a frenetic psychotic portrait, since the beginning when the little boy warns his mother of the intentions of the evil presence. Produced in Australia and directed by Jennifer Kent, many persons find a connection between the movie and Polanski, Tarkovsky and even ""Home Alone, but as other reviewers elsewhere do, Andrzej Zulawski's ""Possession"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" were the two movies I thought of. In both films and ""The Babadook"" there is a strong connection between horror and the psychological disintegration of the leading characters, which in the end denies all Aristotelian progression and undermine whatever happy ending you may imagine. Essie Davis as the mother and Noah Wiseman as the son (I hope he does not turn into another case of child actor going bananas) are very good, and illustrator Alex Juhasz' concepts of the Babadook and its book are really outstanding. A fine cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Generic,"Yeah, there are already 481 reviews for this movie at the present time, so why bother writing one? I don't know, really. Maybe because my expectations got staked so high by the hype surrounding it. What is certain, is that the movie has gathered a solid fan base which, alas, doesn't prove its quality. It's the story of a single mother and her exuberant boy who get stalked by a demon from a children's book. How the demon is connected to the boy's deceased dad remains unclear, or at least I couldn't make odds or ends of it but the mysterious connection is kept alive like some loose end of an unfinished plot idea and in the end, it's left to the viewer to decide what to make of it. Apart from those loose ends, the movie in itself isn't really bad. It's actually quite well presented. It's biggest crime is just that it's a bland mixture of a hundred and one other horror flicks of that type. I found myself watching the movie until the end, only hoping for some great turnaround to happen, where it would reveal to me that it had just pretended to be generic. But unfortunately, this didn't happen and the movie kept unfolding its boring clichés one after one. That's real horror of this movie. I understand that many people who like to eat the same old dish over and over again may like this movie. So will many others who haven't seen that many horror movies yet but to me that was just a saddening experience. If you're okay with this unimaginative mess, please don't judge me. I hated it.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Seriously creepy if you like atmosphere rather than flat out scares,"Let me start off by saying that the viewer must not start watching this expecting a full-on horror film. If that's what you're after, you'll probably be disappointed. It's a slow burning story with a lot of character development, very few jumpy moments, and a really bizarre ending.The lead actress is spectacular. I started off feeling so awful for her to have to cope with so much, and she portrayed all her emotions so well. The lad is also very good, he was so annoying, and there were times when I wished he'd just shut up and let the poor mother sleep.When the Babadook started to make itself known, I found the sounds that came with it so disturbing and creepy, I was cringing. The best horrors don't need fancy CG or an epic soundtrack, all it needs is atmosphere, and this film has plenty of that. It's dark, sinister, and downright depressing.I must admit, I was quite confused by the ending, but after I read a few explanations, it all fit into place. I'll definitely watch this again, its a great toe-curler.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly disturbing,"This is my first review on IMDB and had the urge to take a shot at giving my opinion.I've been binge watching horror movies currently and this one really stuck out. It is incredibly well acted by the two main actors.The scene setting and imagery I really enjoyed, makes me want to decorate my house in dark greys and blacks.There is a fine line between ""what is real?"" In movies like this and The Babadook does a fantastic job of gently tip-toeing that pathway.If you like Twin Peaks screams and mystery, a strong underlying reference to grief, mental health and insomnia - then you'll love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
They took it too far just to be shocking.,This movie is eerily creepy and suspenseful. It progressively gets better as you get through the movie but the beginning was extremely slow and boring.I have also found it hard to move past the following things. 1. The heavy Australian accent was too bogan for my liking. 2. The characters were annoying as hell. I don't know how the mother put up with a kid like him for as long as she did and she's just an all-round bad parent herself. 3. Never bring a dog into it. So not cool.Putting aside the above issues it did manage to create a certain level of terror. It was slightly erratic in parts and became quite sadistic and violent.I can see how some people may enjoy it but it's not my cup of tea.,4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hhhaaaa-Hhaaaa-Holy Crap! Scary!,"THE BABADOOK (2014) A REVIEW BY JP MAY 29, 2015""Whether it's in a word or in a look, you can't get rid of the Babadook."" -I can think of no better way to sell a dark fairy tale bit of horror than a rhyming tagline.MAAA-MAAAA-MOVIE CONDITIONING: A PREFACE The only thing that intrigued me more than the chilling trailer to Writer/Director Jennifer Kent's career-jump-starting psychological horror, or ""PSYCHORROR""-(TM by JP)-titled ""The Babadook"", it was the odd split of love & hate in the comment thread (where I'd exuberantly-posted the trailer), word-of-mouth, and even online.Examples: ""I thought it was the best horror film I've seen in years!""-stated a fellow horror aficionado. ""I hated it,"" simply added by a distant comedic/horror-loving equal & also by a co-worker. Rotten Tomatoes gave it 96% while IMDb squeaked it just above mediocre with a 6.1.It is rare to find such a defined variance in cinema. Whether we like it or not, humans are more alike than most care to admit. When it comes to entertainment, there is commonly a majority on the ""yay"" or ""nay"" that spells make-or-break for a film's acclaim & possible cult status. With this film, I can only venture to guess why there were those who did not care for-or even hated-what I consider the most intense, thought-provoking, manipulative, spooky, freaky, nightmare-conjuring instant classic in the horror canon arguably in more than 4 decades.Perhaps some did not agree with certain parenting behavior, but not being a Dad myself (although I'm bordering on ""Daddy"" status), for Samuel's (Noah Wiseman) Mother Amelia (Essie Davis): a scarring combination of PTSD, a rambunctious child (Ritalin anyone?), and an often-thankless job—I hope were taken into consideration for all the Judge Judys out there. For those who downright hated it, I wonder if that is due to the constant anxiety throughout; comparable to saying what all Potter fans will unite upon: HATE Umbridge! But how many would agree Imelda Staunton's giggle-cringing/rage-inducing performance played a strong hand in bringing Rowling's despicable fear- capitalizing witch-bitch to fiery fruition? Okay maybe not in those many words, but you get the gist. Whatever the case may be, we are all entitled to our opinion (especially film), and I LOVED THIS INSANE GASP-FEST OF HORRORS!HAAA-HAAA-HOLY SH*T!!! I THINK I JUST PIDDLED A BIT The extended AAAs in my usual section titles are one of the best examples of simple-but-effective fright tactics. I'll admit the trailer's turtle-heading hook left this viewer with: the scratchy, demonic rattle of guttural din implied to be the voice of the Babadook (Tim Purcell is credited as the title character & there is no person credited as ""Voice of Babadook"")—never truly left my head since it first slithered upstairs. Unlike most films nowadays whose previews exhaust every frame worthy of seeing, this unique unsettling-indie's surface had merely been scratched rather than a full-on possession (which may/may not apply to this film for those who have yet to experience it). Uneven flow as seemingly-erratic as the lead's uncertain psychological status added nicely to the dread. Stressful pitch blackness was accentuated by the painstakingly- tackled lighting cinematographer Radek Ladczuk carved into the creepy house's shadows (which were unwelcome characters in themselves) inhabiting the MANY smudge (cleansing)-needed corners. Sign of a great score parallels great editing: they flow without being noticed and do not distract from the story; both strong qualities here. The claustrophobic setting and unknown cause of the many attributable disturbances spin macabre theories up to (and even following) the climax, adding mystery to the mental mayhem already present. The Babadook creature's clever, shoestring-budget-turned- epic-scary ""pop-up"" design and all its movements, sounds, and goosebump-forcing shrieks stood proudly as an effective bit of squirm-infecting.BAA-BAAA-BAD CHOICE FOR 1 JP DO-NOT-GO-THERE ELEMENT There are 2 types of fully-executed violence I am against in film. Though there IS an ATTEMPTED-rape in my book ""Downhome"", it DID further the satisfaction of the attacker's downfall. Otherwise, I would rather not tread that unpleasant path if at all possible. The other is harm to animals. The only exception would be ""Cujo"", but that's only to put the poor dog out of his misery. Sadly, Kent's script did apparently deem one of these ""JP-DON'Ts"" necessary to intensify threat levels to a ""SH*T JUST GOT REAL!""-status. Foreshadowing early-on does prepare viewers, but this one hoped it would not come to pass. I was sadly mistaken and although tastefully-implied just out-of-frame, the action caused a major strike against it. However, aside from little Noah Wiseman's migraine- worthy screams and occasional poor takes, there was really nothing else to mention dropping ""Babadook"" below a ""Better Than Average"" rating. However, prior to the 1-2 seconds of unfortunate cruelty, I had given it an ""Exceptional"".Above all aforementioned ""Babadook"" benefits, even those who ""hated"" this film would most likely be lying simply to be contradictory NOT TO AGREE that Essie Davis's brilliantly-vicious performance proved just as-to equal to-all the way to surpassing the title monster's most-frightening-aspect-pedestal. She really embraced Amelia's disparaging spiral downwards to moments of discomfort few actors could convey with such effortlessness. If Davis's career does not pick up from here, the film industry is more doomed than I realized. The same can also be said for the lady in charge: Jennifer Kent. I only wish I had come up with this great addition to the horror elite where few reside e.g. the horror ""Criterion"".JP'S VERDICT: 4 OUT OF 5 PAWS—BETTER THAN YOUR AVERAGE BEAR",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sometimes the unseen is better left unseen.,"My husband and I had high hopes for ""The Babadook."" It seemed like a good horror movie without the Hollywood bloat. It didn't have the typical all good-looking, young cast. This made the movie much more relatable and enjoyable. In order to not give away any spoilers, let's just say we were not impressed with the sudden CGI that came out of nowhere and ruined our image of the Babadook. Sometimes the unseen is better left unseen. Definitely in this case. The sounds were scary enough! Also, we're not fans of movies that leave their endings open for interpretation. We want to see their story; not make up one. Or maybe I just didn't get it!On a better note, the main character was a great actress. And although we felt nothing but annoyance for the boy throughout the beginning-- which I assume was the director's intention--he grew on us.This would have been a great horror movie--almost up there with ""Sinister""--if they hadn't ruined it with unnecessary computer imagery. Then it just became laughable. I could even maybe accept the ending this time around if I wasn't already so turned off by the CGI.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Impressive, low budget Aussie offering that restores your faith in horror","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Morning *** Friday Night ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAmelia (Essie Davis) was widowed when her husband was driving her to hospital to give birth to their son Samuel (Noah Wiseman.) Since then, she has been struggling to raise Samuel alone, while he has been displaying some wild behaviour. Things take a sinister turn, however, when they discover a creepy looking book entitled The Babadook, and Samuel begins seeing an imaginary monster that drives him completely out of control. As Amelia is confronted with spooky happenings of her own, she finds herself pushed over the edge, on the verge of losing her own sanity.Being Halloween week, it's been the perfect opportunity for me to get round to watching this well received, off the wayside horror offering that seems to have hailed from Australia. Marking Jennifer Kent's feature length directing debut, after a string of TV work and short films, this takes the familiar horror device of placing a child in the centre of the story and adds in more distinctive themes of unresolved grief and emotional dependency, and works them wonderfully, with only a fraction of the budget of your modern day, sanitised American horror film.It lays its cards on the table very early on, taking a slow, lingering opening that generates its terror from a haunting use of atmosphere and silence. The set up created from the mother-and-son relationship generates an interesting dynamic all of its own, working in a way where you're never sure how it's going to work in relation to the unfolding story. Without any great special effects or CGI, Kent has crafted something that truly works and restores your faith in modern horror.By the end, it's lost its original angle a little, and it's hard not to notice shades of The Shining and Poltergeist that have crept in to the script, but none of that detracts from what has gone before, a splendid offering that generally works and restores your faith in horror. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The actors were amazing, Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman had a really good connection and were lovable characters, which is a very difficult thing to find in a movie nowadays.

A Refreshing Ray of Light in a Storm of Terrible Money-Makers,"Jennifer Kent's ""The Babadook,"" took me by surprise. Watching the trailer, I was expecting an average monster flick full of jump scares and forced scenes. Instead, I gripped the arms of my chair as I was taken for a ride on what I would say is the best horror movie since James Wan's ""The Conjuring,"" and the most original horror story since ""Insidious.""Actress Essie Davis- stepping out from behind the stage curtain and onto the big screen -gives a tremendous performance as a widowed mother who cannot outrun her past. In his early age acting debut, Noah Wiseman's performance as a very troubled young boy is exceptional, especially for an actor his age. While many movie-goers will be disappointed in the lack of on-screen presence for the antagonist, Kent makes sure to keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration of the film. This is not your granny's haunted house movie; this is a pure psychological-thriller and a True Horror film that does not need frightening images or sudden loud noises to make you shake in your chair or sleep with the lights on. True Horror fans will love ""The Babadook,"" and look forward to future Jennifer Kent films; however, movie-goers seeking cheap scares, gore, expensive CGI creatures, and teen romance will be extremely disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A film that should serve as a template for other Paranormal films.,"A film that in my belief; was one of the greatest paranormal films of this generation. A film that understands the psychology behind the genre. Understands the fear of the unseen.The film plays on that. You never really see the Babadook, but you feel his presence, and when you do see him you never see his face.The film also plays with tension, plays with this through sound. Sound is a another thing. 50% of a horror movie should be based around sounds, because all the great horror movies of the past would not have been, without the sounds. Example being John Carpenters Halloween. Without the sounds, or the music; the film would not be the masterpiece it is.These two factors should always be in a horror film. Its a formula that if done correctly; makes for a great horror flick. Something that this movie does. If you are a fan of horror films, or Paranormal films you will enjoy this one. It has always been hard for me to be afraid of horror films, and most of the ones that have been coming out; example being the paranormal franchise. But this film had me crying with fear, it gave me nightmares, something I haven't had in a long while.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just terrible,"I don't want to spoil anything, but I can say that you will not find in The Babadook what you expect. It's just a trivial, mundane story.
The main character arc is totally forced and unwarranted. It's awfully bad writing. The ending was terrible.
I regret watching it.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Impressive,Watched this film with my two kids Friday night. Well to say the film had a lasting effect on the kids is an under statement. They couldn't take their little eyes off the film yet were scared out of their skin. I'm not sure either of them have slept since and today is Monday. All they've done since is ask is the babadook real. I tell them he not real but kids seem to believe everything you tell them bar the truth. I loved the film too. Its quite an original film and abit trippy too as someone else said. No gore or bad language but very effective in getting a few scares and making the babadook believable. I had a look under my own bed later that night :-) The acting in the film was Oscar standard. The mother looked like she hadn't slept in 6 months(my kids soon) and the son(noah) was absolutely brilliant. I really enjoyed the film and I know my kids will remember it for a long long time to come..... Huge congratulations to all involved with the film.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Horror Film In Years,"I didn't know what to expect going into this small Australian horror movie but I came out horrified about how frightening this movie is, Normally I don't like horror films these days because of the cheap and lazy jump scares, But The Babadook doesn't rely on such things the film uses lightening and great sound design for it's scares.There are two things that make this movie stand above all other generic horror films from the last 5 years which is Essie Davis performance in the main role of a parent of the child who is being seeing this monster , her descent into madness is better than any other over the top generic performances from other horror films from what I have seen this year so far she is a shoe in for a best actress Oscar nomination.The second is the monster itself not only the design of it but how it is portrayed on screen, the look alone is terrifying (Think Papa Lazarou and then some) it's presents itself on screen with really seeing his face and thing that I found really creepy is his hands which you see quite often coming out of the shadow. Not much is heard from the Babadook except for the weird screams and quietly says Babadook.This movie is one I will be watching for years to come, for fans of Eraserhead this watch is essential.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very surprised at how bad this was,"One of the worst movies my wife and I have seen in a while... the only positive I'd give this film was the acting. I had a bad feeling the movie was going to be trash simply based on the plot, but after seeing high reviews and hearing a lot of positive feedback we thought we'd give it a try......... I'd say I'm surprised by the amount of super high ratings people give this movie, but a ton of people liked Blair witch as well, so I learned a log time ago ratings are often worthless. This movie isn't worth the watch, for anyone looking to watch a late night horror, don't bother..... this was lame as all hell. It was incredibly boring.... make sure you have a cup of coffee, or two... maybe 3..... some candy..... I mean for real.... whoever is rating this movie more than a 3, the hell is wrong with you? I'm being nice here..... I mean the reality is a good horror movie hasn't come out in a very long time, the vast majority of them are garbage.... but this crap simply shouldn't have been released..... the fact that the people who made this movie are allowed to make films again just about convinces me to go into the movie business tomorrow.... I could film my toilet and it would be more interesting and slightly more terrifying than this flick. My wife seems to be actually angry at me for wasting her night with this, and even though I had no idea, it was bad enough to where I kind of don't blame her. I actually got a kick that when you write these reviews you can click if your going to give away a spoiler.... what spoiler??? There's nothing to spoil..... although I'd probably buy a copy of the book that's in the movie, it's a whole hell of a lot cooler than the movie itself.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Monster Within,"A deliciously strange combination of the Exorcist, Repulsion, and Dr.Seuss, Jenifer Kent's debut feature The Babadook is simultaneously true to the roots of horror and daringly original. Anchored by a brilliant performance by Essie Davis as a single mother attempting to raise a problem child without becoming a monster herself, The Babadook is possibly the best horror film to come out since Guillermo Del Toro's Pans Labyrinth. And yet, to say this is the best modern horror film in years feels odd, primarily because The Babadook has very little in common with the recent trends of jump scare found footage films (Paranormal Activity) or torture porn films (Saw). No doubt, fans of these more recent horror movements will be disappointed. Jenifer Kent's film is a better fit in the cannon of 70's classics that capitalize on the primal fears of parenthood (Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now, The Brood). Much like these masterpieces of horror, The Babadook is a film with depth, atmosphere, and ambiguity but most importantly it's terrifying.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average missable movie,"I don't get the 8, 9 and 10 ratings given by people.Don't even know why this got recommended to me.

Excellent debut,"I really like Australian movies, especially their horror and exploitation movies, so when this was announced I was exited because I liked the basic idea and trailer was interesting... and it didn't disappoint.Made on tight budget, ""The Babadook"" looks lot more expensive then it actually is. It takes for about 30 minutes for a movie to finally start, and once things get going, the atmosphere and mood turns more and more tense. There are several scenes that are well made and quite effective, like ""book reading"" when book itself more or less explains to the audiences (or to it's main hero) what is going to happen. It's just a well made scene with really good sense of plotting.We as the audience know far more in advance what could happen to our two lead characters, which only adds to sense of dread and unease, because we know some of those things will eventually come on screen.Other note is that ""Badabook"" is quite simple in it's plot. There are no dozens of unnecessary twist that only end up ruining the movie. It is what it is and only ends up building upon it's basic premise. That doesn't mean that movie doesn't add some additional elements to it's story, but it keeps it simple in it's core.While well directed, movie was perfectly aware of it's budget limitations, so there are no glossy effects, which only work well for the movie. It should also be noted that movie, while lacking in effects, is backup by really strong acting by Essie Davis.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a brilliantly subtle/high impact thriller about grief, more so than a boogie-man.","The BABADOOK is one of those rare films that transcends from beyond the screen and truly interacts with the senses. It is an atmospheric and visceral journey that will clot your guts and coke you of air with its delivery and its, sometimes frightening, symbolic imagery.Some may make the remark that bias with my take on the film due to my Australian origin, however this couldn't be any further from the truth. I have found many Australian films prior to be quite caught up in their own little culture and very rarely acknowledge a greater way to craft a story due to their heavy fixation on the Australian psyche and an urge to alienate ""us"" from all other cultures, you could say that Australians are often pretentious in their crafting of a visual narrative.However, I found this pretentious sense to be quite absent from this film. As you can clearly visualize the directors goal, which isn't to demonstrate how wacky and zany Australians can be (with the exception of that infuriating brat Samuel). And it is due to this higher level of presentation that I find the BABADOOK to stand out from the speckled puddle of Australian movies.Now in all respects on the surface the film is quite dim, a bit, its just another monster movie. Although, that is only the surface... I was surprised when I looked at the many reviews of this film, and I was shocked to discover the few amount of people that acknowledged the deeper aspect of this film. This isn't just a film about a scary sound that goes bump in the night, but its the slow returning of grief from the stubborn mind. This film manages to capture what it is like when the flood gates of sadness are held at bay until their evident collapse. The ignoring of what is gone and can never come back, that is what the BABADOOK entails, its the dark struggle within that must one day be wretched from within. also the excellent delivery of the candy box assortment of scares is also one facet to be fond of, not just the scares but also the moments of bliss too. I occasionally think about the film and a moment that I had forgotten about comes back to mind and I think in utter delight ""oh, wasn't that brilliant,"" and not Manny films can manage that. However not every movie is without its flaws, and to me the ending of this film feels quite flat. In mentioning that fact, the ending only seems frail if looked upon from its outer layer, a deeper analysis does help sturdy the foundations of its accent to the final seconds.The BABADOOK is a film that is deep, nightmarishly frightening and with am excellent message to boot: that the containment of grief is dangerous, and the lounger you hide from harsh reality, the stronger it grows. And the face of this pain will ""make you wish You... Were... Dead",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Terrifying!,"This being what I would say is the most terrifying movie ever, The Babadook shows you that evil can lurk anywhere. The film is set in a Australian town and follows Amelia and her son Samuel. The film starts on a car accident that includes Amelia and her husband, it happened whilst on the way to the hospital to give birth to her son. Six years later, Samuel begins to have nightmares about a monster that he thinks will kill him in real life. Then, one night, Samuel wants his mother to read him a story, so he goes on his shelf and finds a book named 'Mister Babadook'. After this a mysterious presence starts to terrorise the family and sends the mother into a paranoid mess. This movie avoids the cliché jump scares and still makes the audience feel like they would rather be somewhere else. The terrifying film is director Jennifer Kent's first and will certainly not be her last",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Modern Horror at its finest!,"The Babadook is based on director Jennifer Kent's short from 2005 entitled ""Monster"", this is her debut into directing a feature which is hard to believe when watching the film. Jennifer delivers a truly disturbing Horror film, that from start to finish will have your brain going a mile a minute trying to work out what the heck is going on.The MAIN thing you have to understand going into this film, is not just about The Babadook as a monster, I don't really want to say too much about it without ruining the story. The Horror isn't fast paced and in your face like a lot of films in recent years, it is a slow burner that makes you feel invested in the characters and thrives on the tension the director builds in scenes. Director Kimberly Peirce who directed Carrie in 2013 should take a look at this film and see where she went wrong in the tension building department, while Carrie failed in drawing the viewer in, The Babadook thrives doing such.The acting of Essie Davis was incredible she really encapsulates the loving mother who is right at the point of snapping due to circumstances surrounding her life. She is extremely convincing in her portrayal of the character even down to the pale and exhausted look of a single mother living on no sleep and a young child who borders on a monster himself. As for said child Noah Wiseman was brilliant in his role of Samuel he really had that disturbing creepy vibe you reminding me of Miko Hughes as Gage Creed in Pet Sematary. As I read on another review ""There are times when the pair almost fuse into one traumatised entity."" I couldn't agree more, they really bounced off each other great, but at times they really did feel like the one character fighting the monster.Some long serving Horror fans may find this a bit different to what they are used to, The Babadook monster serves as a secondary factor in the film. The story itself is the main character, a truly terrifying story filled with scares, tension and twists second to none. While the film still has its ""traditional"" scares, it plays on the larger story of life and coming to terms with huge drastic and emotional changes we all succumb to in our daily lives and gives us lovers of the genre something new to enjoy instead of loud noises to make us jump.Well wasn't this the shock of the year when it comes to Horror, who would have thought a little known Australian film would have had cinephiles from all backgrounds watching. I personally know people who dislike Horror as a genre but genuinely enjoyed this film. Everything about this film was incredible considering the genre and the fact it is a feature debut, the film will stick with you for days thinking about how well written and directed it really was. I will admit at times it is hard to bare with Samuel's crying/moaning early on, to the point you're wanting the ""monster"" to get him ha, but when you sit back and think about it after the fact he acts exactly how ALL children would in such scenario. It is films like this that make me incredible happy to be a lover of the Horror art form, truly hope some more Horror comes from Jennifer Kent in the future if her debut is anything to go by, she can only get better.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Finally a great horror!,"I am not going to do any long review or give anything away but after many tears waiting i watched a horror that had some hype and was not left feeling cheated by the end! I love horror movies and have seen far too many. In recent years people have been left watching bad recycled horrors in which you can correctly predict what will happen, who will die, in what order and how the end will almost certainly be left on a cliffhanger--or better known as a director/producer who is thinking of lining their pockets more than constructing a proper end to a film and not thinking of another rubbish franchise. How people regarded the Conjuring as better than this ill never know. It had moments of course like all half backed horrors which know how to pull strings but that is rarely more than that. This was different. Perhaps the fact it didn't come out of the US is partly why it managed to stay clear of the usual flaws.Anyway, enough from me. Like i said i don't want to say too much but the score, the sound and visual effects, the acting, the lighting, the creativity and clear understanding of what makes something scary are all top notch",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

As for the Babadook itself, very very poor indeed. I was glad when it ended, and even a day later i am traumatised by the the rubbish that my wife and i sat through.

Blowing down the house,"There is very little more horrific than real life, and Jennifer Kent's first feature, The Babadook, proves it.Amelia (Essie Davis, in a tour-de-force performance) would have a hard time of it even without seven-year-old Samuel (Noah Wiseman) to constantly keep from trouble. And Sam's not exactly some mischievous little scamp --- he plays with dart guns at school, assaults other kids, and throws around firecrackers like confetti. He makes the titular terror from ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" look like a total pussy.And Amelia's not exactly mother-of-the-year. You can practically see the monster within her many times in the early part of the film, gnashing to escape the prison her deceased husband's confined her to, after he died in a car crash while taking Amelia to the hospital to deliver Sam. This is a risky, potent set-up that Kent could have only realized solo (with her Kickstarter and other funding, of course). Both mom and son are so pitifully unlikable (and realistic) that no big studio would come near this concept.Yet Kent makes it work constantly, due to the strength she imbues in every frame --- from the acting, to the at times beautiful chiaroscuro lighting, to the creepy sound mix, ominous visuals (which are just puppets, but damn good ones), and camera tricks that would make Hitchcock and Welles look twice. it really is a fantastically made film for any budget.But it's the emotional tension that Davis and Wiseman bring in truckloads that keeps you riveted, more than any cardboard bogeyman. The Babadook contains some really disturbing sequences, not the least of which is brought to life by superb graphics designer Alex Juhasz's ghoulish ""children's book"" that features mom strangling son to death just before slashing her own throat. Yes, it's that strong and that effective, at times recalling Friedkin's The Exorcist in it's shock value.As many other reviewers have noted, The Babadook is much more richly dimensioned than a cheapo monster movie. It's got enough allegory and symbolism to keep a Sociology class busy for a semester. It'll more than keep you hypnotized for ninety odd minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Flawless Masterpiece - Perfection in Motion,"The Babadook is probably the most impressive directorial debut I have seen (well if you only account the ones released where I actually was old enough to experience its release that is), and the best horror/thriller I have seen since The Shining - its direction, editing and acting was basically flawless. I really haven't been this impressed by a movie in years.I have seen some users complain that the movie didn't really feel much like an actual supernatural horror movie, which unfortunately is a really shallow perspective to judge a movie from - and no this isn't your typical ""there's an evil presence after us""-movie like Sinister or Insidious (to name some of the better examples) - this is something far better - this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.The camera-work, symbolism, colors, atmosphere, sound and artwork is beyond words. Essie Davis performance as Amelia is ALMOST on pair with Sigourney Weaver in Copycat and Ellen Burstyn in Requim for a Dream. While Noah Wisemans role as Samual without a doubt is the best child-performance ever - probably only matched by Sean Nelson in Fresh, though Nelson was a little bit older in that role/movie, so it's almost unfair to compare them. And these aren't just random facts I'm laying out, but deeply qualified and analyzed opinions, since I'm a genius. And a genius knows genius when he sees it.I don't really know anything about the director Jennifer Kent, but if she can keep this level of perfectionism in future movies, I'm almost tempted to say that she could become the new Kubrick - I know these are big words, but no director has left me this impressed for years, and when you take into consideration that this is her debut movie, I almost can't imagine where her talent potentially can go - and this is coming from a huge and proud male-chauvinist sexist..",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Likely the very best horror movie of the year.,"(74%) While most cinema goers wasted their Halloween horror movie night with what I hear is total dross ""Ouija"", this on the other hand with fewer than half the screenings by all rights should have been the number 1 movie of choice during the spookiest period of the year. The sad thing is that those who missed out on this, missed out on one of the best new horror movies I've seen in quite a long time. First of all Essie Davis provides one of the finest performances of the year, in any genre, she's flawless in this; while young Noah Wiseman as a troubled boy never fails to convince. The direction is top notch, and the production values in general for a low budget horror movie are never any other than seamless alongside the likes of last year's more forgettable ""the conjuring"". There's a touch of ""A nightmare on Elm street"", a bit of ""Poltergeist"", some family drama/comedy, but overall this is its own movie, and all horror fans should seek it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good movie, some great acting as well","*May contain minor spoilers if you are a picky brat who likes to complain about everything*I recently watched this and enjoyed it very much. For me, there were only a couple moments that I would actually call ""scary"", but the movie was very effective in what it was meant to do.They did a great job at building up the absolute frustration of the mother. If you have suffered from Insomnia, you can understand just how hard that is. Now, add on top of that a clingy child with behavioral issues, and that would just be too much.The mother did a great job acting, I was very impressed. So did the child.The Babadook was pretty creepy, and effective. They didn't rely on a bunch of jump scares or the face going back and forth super fast deal that too many movies have these days. There were some typical things about it, but they added some new elements to it that I enjoyed. The ""creature"" combined with the book was pretty cool...I have seen this compared to the movie: The Canal.I have seen both, but they are VERY different movies IMO. I enjoyed both movies, but got a totally different vibe from each.I could feel the Mother's frustration in this movie, but also her love for her child, how lonely she was, etc. That was done extremely well.So, I give this an 8/10. I was excited to see it when I saw the trailer, and I was not let down. I was glued to my screen the whole movie.

You can't get rid of The Babadook,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is nothing more frightening than the thoughts that occur within the recesses of our own mind. And therein lies the problem with so many ""horror"" movies. We may squirm and cover our eyes while watching the latest slasher film, but to stick with us as real horror, a film must tap into those internal, psychological fears that we each carry. This first feature film from writer/director Jennifer Kent does that so effectively that I am hesitant to write much more than  go see this one (but of course, I will).Ms. Kent has fully developed her award winning short film Monster from 2005. With a limited budget of around $2 million, she has figured out a way to utilize many horror staples: a misfit child, the family dog, an old house with creaky floors and doors, a musty basement, old reliables like under the bed and in the closet, open windows, and the always effective knocks on the door. Combine these touches with an incredibly creepy and dramatically graphically illustrated children's book, and terrific characters in the mom and her young son, and all the elements are in place for a suspenseful and terrifying film that is a throwback to the good old days.It's easy to spot the influences of such classics as William Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973), Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980), and Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), but Ms. Kent has her own style with the camera and expertly creates an atmosphere of widely disparate mood swings grounded in believable characters. Essie Davis (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) delivers an extraordinary performance as Amelia, whose husband died en route to the hospital as she gave birth to their son. Noah Wiseman plays Samuel, the now 7 year old boy who has behavioral issues, fears the monster under his bed, and recognizes the resentment his mom feels towards him as a constant reminder of the death that occurred on the day of his birth. Wiseman looks like a cross between Elijah Wood in Witness and Danny in The Shining  only he is much more energetic and animated than either of those characters.The suspense builds as Amelia's lack of sleep progressively wears her down, as her job and parenting responsibilities rob her of any down time or relaxation. She can't even get through a solo release in bed without her frightened son barging in for security. The dynamic between mother, son and dead husband/father elevate this to a level of psychological thrills that we don't often get on screen. There are so many superb moments to ""enjoy"". The amount of blood present is minimal, especially in comparison to modern day slashers. It's much more about how grief and stress can affect us in sinister ways. In addition to the influences already listed, there is also a tip of the cap to pioneer Georges Mêlées and his use of magic in the early days of film. Babadook may be an anagram for ""a bad book"", but it's also now synonymous with a really good horror movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The audience that is looking for a bloody meltdown might be disappointed.

Best ending in a long time,"Several reviewers said that the last 15 minutes were disappointing. But they're the greatest part of the movie! Sure, it's not some generic, idiotic horror, it's more complex than that, horror is a tool, there's so much layers in the movie, and it's actually a debut, first full length film by this female director, which is also important, considering feminist themes in the movie. The end is ambivalent, it's not one-sided pro or anti-feminist, it goes deeper. A debut with a 30.000$ budget, I mean, what else should anyone say when they hear a 30.000$ budget, and the film looks great. A director has to be given a chance to make more movies. Of course it's not a masterpiece, but for God's sake, if you watched Insidious, Conjuring or Annabelle than you've already wasted 5 hours of your life, and Babadook is definitely not a waste.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The negative point I didn't like is few of the voices the ""monster""Was doing,it was little weird an unfiting with the tone of the film...To sum up the film was creepy at it best and a very enjoyable horror that most of the horrors should be today.

Then, as in Insidious, about 2/3 of the way through it kind of lost its punch and when it came time for the ""boss battle,"" it had become downright silly.Slight spoiler ahead: I don't understand the claim that this was a particularly original film. The idea that a character in a book can be ""real"" (here, ""haunting"" you in real life) is as old as narrative itself. I will say that it was kind of neat how the ""haunting"" shifted from the boy onto the mother. But overall I found the collection of horror-suspense tropes to be rather cliché, borrowing from Insidious, Amityville Horror, even The Shining, and many other classics of the genre.I also found the resolution to be rather arbitrary and unexplained. What, she finally stood up to the Babadook and that was that?",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worths Watching,"I saw its trailer on IMDb. Then found an opportunity to watch it.Unlike many poor reviews I found the plot very interesting and unique.Actually the writer director Jennifer Kent managed to create a fantastic work out of scratch.Plot is around a young couple expecting a child running to the hospital. On the road a car accident costs father with his life. Movie starts seven years after that accident and we witness widow mother's and her son's last two weeks before her son's seventh birthday. Without any spoilers, I can tell you this much.Congratulations Ms. Kent. Apart from horror movies full of maniac serial killers, dumb and dumber zombies and shiny vampires; she managed to create something different. And all those 1 point reviews reflects that.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the creepiest movies I have ever seen,"So happy Netflix had this, I'v been seeing a lot of buzz for this movie and i decided to check it out and I was not disappointed . The movie does not rely on jump scares , but rather the atmosphere and the drama with the mother and child . But make no mistake, this movie is scary as hell and after viewing it the first time I had troubled sleeping that night.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
